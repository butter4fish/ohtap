Speaker 2: My name is [HistoryMaker] Glennette Tilley Turner, and Glennette is spelled G-L-E-N-N-E-T-T-E, and Tilley is T-I-L-L-E-Y and Turner is the usual, T-U-R-N-E-R.
Speaker 1: Now do you have a middle name?
Speaker 2: When I was a little girl, my middle name--well my name was Glennette Newman Tilley, but it seemed like too much baggage to add a fourth name and still use Newman.
Speaker 1: So Newman is your maiden name of your mother?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's maiden name.
Speaker 1: All right, now what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: November 23, 1933, Raleigh, North Carolina.  I was born in the same hospital that Jack Johnson died in.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: In St. Aug [St. Agnes Hospital, Raleigh, North Carolina], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a teacher, former teacher, writer, historian.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is August the 12th, 19--excuse me 2004 (laughter) excuse me, that's terrible.
Speaker 1: These historians always--
Speaker 2: I'm living in the past yeah.
Speaker 1: And--where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: At The HistoryMakers, 1900 South Michigan [Avenue], Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, and I just want to add, too, that you're an expert on the Underground Railroad--
Speaker 2: Oh.

Speaker 2: Yes, I--
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Before we go into depth there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions we always ask, and they only require a short, lightweight answer.  The first question is: what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is lamb chops.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Broiled lamb chops.
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Fall.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Oh, just anywhere there are interesting people, and of course Underground Railroad locations.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I can't think of one. I--no, none comes to mind--
Story_ID: 529154
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about your family history. I'm gonna start with your mother's side and then we'll ask about your father's [John Lee Tilley] side.  But--can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Her name was Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley.  Phyllis was spelled P-H-Y-L-L-I-S, Geraldine is G-E-R-A-L-D-I-N-E and then Jones, J-O-N-E-S and Tilley, T-I-L-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth was February 8, 1906 and she was born in Elgin, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what do you know about her side of the family, how far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Pretty far back, my great, great-grandmother, excuse me my great-grandmother and great-grandfather had taken a covered wagon and gone to Nebraska to homestead. It's only in recent years, I've learned that the Homestead Act [Homestead Act of 1862] didn't include black people, but I think my great-grandfather was of a complexion that if, no one asked, he didn't tell, so he homesteaded there.  And my great-grandmother's mother had--well the family had been enslaved near Roanoke, Virginia and there was a relative who married a man who had also been enslaved in Roanoke.  When we went to the Civil War and ended up in Belvidere [Illinois], so when that daughter came, then my great-great-grandmother came to keep her company, and so much of the family migrated to Belvidere.
Speaker 1: Now Belvidere, Illinois?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just outside Rockford [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so that the family before they, they went to Nebraska they were in Virginia? Or--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah they were in Virginia, yeah, and then I think the part of the family came to Belvidere had come there and then my great-grandparents set out.  Because my great-grandmother was eminently expecting a baby and she had hoped to get as far as Belvidere to have the baby.   And win her over with her sisters and she got as far as Marengo [Illinois] and had the baby--a black mid-wife in Marengo or black nurse served as mid-wife and then she went to thirteen miles further once she was able to travel, and went to Belvidere.  Then, when she was ready to rejoin her husband, she caught the [Chicago and] North Western [Railway] train the first year they went that far west.
Speaker 1: Okay to the--to Nebraska?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, to Holt County, Nebraska.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there was a town--their name is, was Newman and there is a town quite nearby called Newman Grove [Nebraska] and there are not distinctive records to indicate whether my great, great--my great-grandfather was the Mr. Newman that was named for or whether or not you know was named for him.
Speaker 1: But it's a possibility?
Speaker 2: Well, he planted trees, but I think everybody planted trees in Nebraska so he or some other Newman planted them.  It was quite near where they had settled, maybe ten miles so it's possible, but we don't know for sure.
Story_ID: 529155
Speaker 1: What else can you tell us about it, are there any stories that they passed down?
Speaker 2: Yeah, one story was that what--that my [maternal] great-grandmother was a midwife, it seems that the houses were all arranged, like if four families had squares of land that they built their houses right at the point of intersections so that they had a sense of community.  And my great-grandmother was a midwife, and of course she knitted and sewed and did all the things that pioneer families did.  But I think my favorite story is how the first year they lived there [Holt County, Nebraska], they lived in a sod house and two of the sisters were sleeping on a makeshift mattress and a beaver got into, no a badger got into, under the covers and each sister thought the other was pinching her.  And so they began to squabble and their father came to, you know, see what was causing all this commotion, or what they're fussing about.  And when they threw back the covers, you know, here this little animal you know, ran out and so it seem that one of the sisters had a bite mark on her, or that she kept all the rest of her life.  But I think that was probably my favorite story.  But I also just envisioned how beautiful it must've been in the spring because the sod house would bloom you know since it really was just the earth and, you know, just a side of a hill.  And so there would be wild flowers that would bloom on the sod house.  And so I, you know, think of that as a lovely image.
Story_ID: 529156
Speaker 1: How long were they able to stay there [Holt County, Nebraska]? I mean--
Speaker 2: I don't know in years how long they were able to stay there; there was a family story about how my [maternal] great-grandfather left.  It seemed that he used to go to town and get provisions--the things, for the things they couldn't grow, and the provisions included meat, and so as he was coming back, there, the wagon was always trailed by coyotes that could, you know, smell the meat.  And the way the story went one time the horse came home and here you know was all this meat but grandfather was not in the wagon, the horse just knew his way home.  And so it was assumed that he had been eaten by coyotes, but many years later (laughter) it turned out that he had taken that as an opportunity to return to Virginia and so it was kind of an embarrassing story.  But following her assumed widowhood, my great-grandmother brought the children back to Illinois to join the family in Belvidere [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Wow, that's quite a story.
Speaker 2: It is--he was a cad.
Speaker 1: So he just ditched the family.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He went back to Virginia.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's a story, that's a story you'll see on television.
Speaker 2: It's a painful story (laughter) embarrassing one.
Speaker 1: Did they ever get back together?
Speaker 2: I think in his old age, he wanted my great-grandmother to come and care for him, but she said thanks, but no thanks (laughter) after she'd struggled with raising the children.  And you know really managing in his absence; I think she told him it was a little too late to get back together--
Story_ID: 529157
Speaker 1: So there's no way--he [Turner's maternal great-grandfather] offered no explanation for any of that [deserting the family]--
Speaker 2: Not that I ever heard. It seemed that he really was quite a hard taskmaster that he--I had a great-aunt who lived here in Chicago [Illinois] for many years and she said that how--that he really was just very insistent that the kids would not only pull weeds, but line 'em--line the weeds up in a way that all the roots were fol--were turned one way--you know angled one way.  And at the end of the day he'd come and be as busy checking to see that the roots were laid out as they should be as the fact that the weeding was done in the garden.  And, or she felt he was probably the son of the slaveholder and had been in some advisory role or supervisory role in slavery and you know this continued this, in this manner with his own children.  Another story that she told was that he had a friend who had escaped from--or I guess, he didn't escape from slavery, it was after slavery that they went I think 1872.  But this friend had gone to Canada and sometime he'd drive his sleigh down to, to visit the family.  And this great aunt was a baby at the time and would be playing around and underfoot I imagined this man went out and cut a sleigh bell off of his--the harness of his horses and gave it to her for a toy.  And she kept it all her life and I now have that, so that is (unclear).  And then the great-great-grandmother who came to Belvidere [Illinois] had been married to a man named Armsburt Spurlark [ph.].  I'm not sure how Armsburt was spelled but he was a casket maker, and I had an experience--we have a family picture of him also.  Well this great aunt kept a wonderful scrapbook and she gave me permission to copy the photographs and that was at the time, I don't know if the technology is such now that to copy photographs like that you would have a camera placed very high and you know climb up there and look down at the images.  But one time I had, I--was teaching at the time and there was an audio visual department in the basement of our school, so on a Friday afternoon after everyone had gone, I was--I got permission you know to go down and use this camera to photograph these, this scrapbook.  And when I went to take a picture of this Armsburt Spurlark, I could look into his eyes, the depth of his eyes and oh, it's just so emotional, I just almost fell off the, you know the stool I was standing on.  You know 'cause you just look like you, you know almost as if he blinked his eyes (chuckling) you know, I--was focusing the camera there.  But that was, you know, another family story.  The family name was Spurlark, and they insisted on spelling it L-A-R-K and it seemed that Spurlock [ph.] was also very common name in that area.  And I'm inclined to think that some of the Spurlarks married the Spurlocks and that my great-grandmother was insistent on the L-A-R-K spelling to, you know, kind of indicate that her daughter was married.  It was, you know, instead of having kept her maiden name that this was a different name, and so that's another family story.
Story_ID: 529158
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley]--now she grew up in--
Speaker 2: In--well she was born in Elgin [Illinois], but her father [William Jones] died while she was probably a toddler or an infant, and her mother [Lydia Mary Jones Holmes] later remarried.  She married a man [Walter S. Holmes] who really, I think at the time they married, that he lived in Rockford [Illinois], but he worked in the adjutant general's office in Springfield [Illinois].  And I think in the summers they would have a camp, I think Camp Grant [Rockford, Illinois], it's in Rockford, and he would be in Rockford and he had had a home in Rockford.  But then in the rest of the year, they'd be back at the [Illinois] State Capitol [Springfield, Illinois] and then later, the family moved to Springfield.  And, so my mother really grew up in Springfield, for the most part.
Speaker 1: Okay now did she have any stories of growing up or that she told you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she has a younger sister who is eighteen years younger than she is and, or than she was, and so the sister is ten years older than I am.  So she was kind of like a shared sister and that, you know, she was mama's baby sister, but she has been like a big sister to me and she still lives and we keep in contact.  My mother really was quite a--student and she remembered so fondly that there was an organization in Springfield that black churches all had an ecumenical gathering each Sunday called the culture club.  And all the kids, the black kids came together, or families came together, but the children were encouraged to read papers, reports and, you know, school papers that they had done well on.  And so that was gave a sense of community and also, I think, validated scholarship or you know made the children feel that they were appreciated or that, you know, achievement was important.
Story_ID: 529159
Speaker 1: She [Turner's mother, Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley] also said that she, when she was in high school, would walk to high school as her father [sic. stepfather, Walter S. Holmes] was walking to the [Illinois] State Capitol [Springfield, Illinois].  And then after school, she would come back to the capitol and work in Illinois State Library [Springfield, Illinois] until it was time for him to get off from work, and walk home together.  But the person that she remembered so fondly was Colonel Otis B. Duncan, it seems that Colonel Duncan was not only head of the 8th Illinois [Infantry Regiment, Illinois National Guard] or, you know, ranking officer and that, but he was instrumental in forming this culture club.  I think he and a Dr. Ware [ph.] were the moving spirits behind this culture club but she also--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: So Otis Duncan is black?
Speaker 1: Yes Otis Duncan is black, uh-huh.  And he evidently was also stationed, or had an office or worked in the state capitol building and, you know, she would see him walking down the hall in this spiffy uniform.  And of course in the Springfield [Illinois] schools there were no black teachers and I think in their church they probably--they were Lutheran and I think all the ministers were white, and so this was kind the one black role model that she saw.  And just, she even to her dying day, you know, she would speak of Colonel Otis B. Duncan, you know, with such high regard.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's something--and he was stationed in Springfield?
Speaker 1: He was but, no he was the Doughboy statue [Victory Monument] there 35th and--King Drive--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he enlisted there; I can't recall if he just listed you know as a leader or if he facilitated getting that monument.  I would really just need to check the signage on that.
Speaker 2: And he's--that's the 8th Illinois (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah it was 8th Illinois.  Also later when I was writing the Bessie Coleman biography, I found that when she did her first exhibition flight, he went up with her.  It was in Maywood [Illinois] and the [Chicago] Defender had really publicized that and you know droves of people went out; it was really you know the, the big thing to do that day.  And she gave demonstration flights, and she, you know, of course was gonna do it in a figure eight and Colonel Otis B. Duncan flew, went up and flew with her, I guess really to instill confidence in this newfangled you know thing called aviation.  And so I was so happy to find that and be able to tell mama, "Guess what I've found (laughter) about Colonel Otis B. Duncan?"
Speaker 2: Well that's something, did he live in Chicago for the balance (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I don't know I, I haven't ever done any further research on his life and work, but I think there is an American Legion that is named for him in Springfield, if I'm not mistaken.
Story_ID: 529160
Speaker 1: Did she [Turner's mother, Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley] talk about going to school and that sort of thing in Springfield [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: She loved school, one of--a racial thing--she was someone that in their later years really just didn't talk a lot about her experiences.  But one thing she was saying is one time probably around third grade a little classmate, a white classmate had invited her to attend their birthday party.  And she remembered overhearing her parents discussing this and her father said, "We'll let her go now because in a few years that little girl won't be inviting her to parties."  And mama said she remembered thinking how can that be, Mary [ph.] and I are best friends and will be forever.  But she said in a few years, the invitations (laughter) you know, as they reached puberty the invitations did not continue so that was a memory that she had.
Story_ID: 529161
Speaker 1: So when did your mother [Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley] come to Chicago [Illinois]? I mean or this area, not Chicago but--
Speaker 2: Well she went from high school, after high school, she taught briefly in St. Louis [Missouri], the--it was before teachers were required to have a bachelor's [degree].  But there were some friends from--there was a lady that lived I guess in Rockford [Illinois], Julie, Miss Juliana Parker [ph.], she was married to a man named Jack Parker [ph.] who had gone to Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], and she encouraged a number of--black students to go to Hampton to college.  And mama was one of three young women who went, I guess what I left unsaid is that although much of our family was in Belvidere [Illinois], a number of family members had moved to Rockford which is just twelve miles away.  And so although our family, or my mother and her parents lived in Springfield [Illinois], my grandmother [Lydia Mary Jones Holmes] would come back each summer when her husband came to the encampment.  And she and her sisters would either gather in Rockford or in Belvidere to do canning and, you know, and just kind of have a reunion.  So their time was kind of spent between the Springfield and the Rockford area, so this is how they happened to have known this woman in Rockford who encouraged them--my mother to attend Hampton.  She got a Associate of Arts degree, I think that's what they called then--it was a two year--normal school, I guess that's what they called it.  And she took a job at Fayetteville [North Carolina], what's the college at--North Carolina--
Speaker 1: Is it North Carolina Central [University, Durham, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: North Carol- North Carolina Central is in Durham [North Carolina].  Anyway, Fayetteville State Teachers College [Fayetteville State University, Fayetteville, North Carolina] I guess it is, and she really was in early childhood education and was working in the nursery school there.  And, but one of the students on campus was a young woman who wanted mama to meet her brother because my dad [John Lee Tilley] was at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] at that time.  And so when she knew my mother was from Illinois, she just thought, you know, that they would, you know, really hit it off.  So one time when my dad was back in North Carolina he came I guess to pick his sister up probably by prearrangement (laughter), you know, for--before a holiday.  And so they met and then they married and remained in North Carolina for many years, he after he--well he finished his work for his doctorate [degree] and even had a fellowship to go to Heidelberg in Germany.  But it was during the [Great] Depression and Shaw [University, Raleigh, North Carolina] encouraged him to come back and serve as acting president.  I think his pay was in script (laughter) during that period--
Story_ID: 529162
Speaker 1: What is your father's full name? Can you give us his name and spell it?
Speaker 2: Yes. John Lee Tilley, J-O-H-N, L-E-E, T-I-L-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His place of birth was Wake County, North Carolina--Stem [North Carolina] is an area in Wake County where he was born.  He was born on a farm and his date of birth was August the 8th, 19--I mean, 1898.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and how far can you trace his side of the family, how far back can you go?
Speaker 2: Well I had--his, his sister was really the family historian and she felt they could trace it back to the African and--but the family evidently got their land, again through kind of a dubious story.  It seemed that there was a relative who was an--well a number of relatives were enslaved, but this particular one acted to save the silverware of the, the slaveholder you know when they heard the Union troops were coming through.  He did an ingenious thing; he put the silverware in a gunny sack, and put it in the creek.  And then a cattail or you know one of the plants in such a way that it would look like a--you know, just a normal bend of, of a piece of vegetation but he did it in such a way that served as a marker.  And so after the Union troops had gone, he drudged up (laughter) out the gunny sack and took it back to the slaveholder's family.  And was rewarded--well I've heard was either given some rocky land or was able to purchase it very inexpensively, but it was a really stony area for farming.  But nevertheless, it was--the family was able to, you know, form a little community, and it, they call it, they refer to the area as being in the mountains.  And so it probably was kind of a protected area or, you know, area where they felt relatively safe in that--during the Reconstruction period.
Story_ID: 529163
Speaker 1: One of the stories--well like so many black communities, they formed a church and one of the stories my father [John Lee Tilley] told was of an uncle who was a minster, Hugh [Granville] Tilley, who served in the North Carolina legislature [North Carolina General Assembly].  And some of the family stories say that he also was elected to come to Washington [D.C.], but it was really at that point that the--Reconstruction was ending.  And as I tried to do research on him, I wasn't able to find a record of him having been seated in Washington, but in a Washington City directory, I found him listed as a laborer.  So evidently he remained in Washington, I don't know if to save face you know if he just sort of stayed gone for the length of time he would've been serving (laughter) and then sort of went back home, or if he, you know, was hopeful that he would be eventually be seated.  And just wanted to you know be there in town and be available, but later he went back and was quite (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So, so he thought he was gonna serve in the legislature?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was, he came to Washington (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I mean in [U.S.] Congress.
Speaker 1: Yeah in congress, U.S. Congress and he brought his family (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: When he got there and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Evidently he was not seated.  I haven't been able to find documents you know with any like explanation of that.  But he left North Carolina thinking he was going to be seated, and yet, as I look in those records of black congressmen, he--his name doesn't appear, but it does appear in the city directory.  So I've just tried to connect the dots, but--but he went back and evidently enjoyed quite a, you know successful later career as, as a minister.  One of my father's sisters remembers how he would sometimes travel--well what was long distances then in, you know, a carriage and that where he would let go one day and then speak and come back you know the next day.  Which she would sometimes get to go with him and she talked about the foot heater, you know, that they had in the carriage, how they keep their feet warm.  And how, you know, they would stay with families and, you know, and just be treated, well not royally but, you know, people would bring out the best food.
Story_ID: 529164
Speaker 1: We're talking about Hugh [Granville] Tilley, you know, and speaking different places around his home. What was his hometown in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: He was from Stem [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Stem?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: S-T-E-M.
Speaker 1: Okay, just like the way it sounds. Yeah, Stem.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  It later was where Fort Butner or Camp Butner [National Guard Training Center, North Carolina] was built and that really just uprooted that community, and kind of abruptly, during the Second World War [World War II, WWII].  Everybody had to clear out and evidently didn't get a lot of notice, and when I went to a recent family reunion it seems they didn't receive compensation, or if they received compensation it was much less than equitable amount.
Speaker 1: This is like a black community basically in North Carolina.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  One of the stories about Hugh Tilley go back to him is when he was running--well evidently he was already in the North Carolina legislature [North Carolina General Assembly] and he was running for reelection.  But I just think this is the, the greatest of all the stories in that my father's [John Lee Tilley] younger sister, Alice [ph.] was saying how the, the people in, in their community knew that people, Caucasian people in a neighboring community would really do what they could to keep Hugh Tilley from winning election.  And it was known that the ballots would be taken from the ballot boxes or from the polling place to the county seat in Oxford [North Carolina], and by way of a fast horse who was called Black Jack.  And so our family's community suspected that the horse would be waylaid if he took the usual highway.  So they painted a decoy horse, painted him black and had a decoy rider with the saddle bags.  Because they--oh, the other thing was the votes had to be in Oxford by midnight so timing, you know, was important.  And so they painted this horse, had a decoy rider and he had saddled bags, you know, did everything to look as if this was Black Jack.  And he took the expected highway route and the real Black Jack took, the rider of the real Black Jack took a back road and got to Oxford on time.  Isn't that something, doesn't that just gives you goose bumps?
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Just to think how much the vote meant.
Speaker 1: And what, you know the lengths that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was the fake rider waylaid?
Speaker 2: I don't know, she, she never you know told that part of the story, but just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I don't think I'd wanna be the fake rider, either.
Speaker 2: Oh, what a risk, especially if he was found out, I mean if he was waylaid and somebody rubbed the horse and the polish came off, the paint came off.  He was in just grave danger, no ballots in the saddle bag, but just to take risk like that.
Speaker 1: So that's all like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: For democracy.
Speaker 1: This was during Reconstruction--?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah it was really during kind of that turning point the end of when Reconstruction was ending.
Speaker 1: Do you have idea how long they could actually vote there and you know?
Speaker 2: How long did he?
Speaker 1: How long that they were able to be in office in North Carolina?  I know there came a certain time when they were no more blacks in office (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I don't know, I went to the old capitol in Raleigh [North Carolina] and saw the benches the way they had been, but they didn't have names, you know, showing where the different legislatures sat.  And, but I went and sat on the chair, I just you know took arbitrarily thought--I think they said they were arranged it alphabetical order so I knew since his name was Tilley, you know, which side of the hall he would've been in.  And I, you know, went and sat in the chair and just sort reflected on what it was like.  One of the things he worked for is to try to get the Colored Orphanage [Asylum of North Carolina] in Oxford--everything was segregated at that point.  So therefore, the colored orphanage and also for railroads he was interested in; those were his two issues--
Story_ID: 529165
Speaker 1: You think he [Turner's paternal great uncle, Hugh Granville Tilley] served through the 1890s or did he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh no. No, I think it was maybe in the late 1870-something.
Speaker 1: Okay, around the time of the Hayes-Tilden Compromise [of 1877]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's something.
Speaker 2: And he was a big influence on my father [John Lee Tilley] you know he stressed legis- education and you know as a minister was a role model in that way.
Speaker 1: Now he would've been your father's--
Speaker 2: Uncle.
Speaker 1: Uncle.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  My father's father's name was Harvey N. Tilley; I didn't, I don't know what his middle initial stood for.  And he would never say what year he was born; he'd always say he was born the year that [Robert E.] Lee surrendered.  You know he would never say a year, and he was really excellent in mathematics, I can remember times during the Second World War [World War II, WWII], he and daddy would be sitting in--there was a room they used as kind of a dayroom or a parlor at my grandparents' house.  And they'd sit there--well, I guess they didn't--well they must've had electric light, but they didn't have the light on in the ceiling.  They just had this little dome-shaped radio with the yellow light, you know, those wooden radios that were popular at that time.  And if they, if they'd be a news story that would tell about, say the national budget and compared it to a previous year, daddy would get--because he'd been to school, get a pencil and paper and say, "I think I can figure out how much more it is a share."  And granddaddy would sit there and said, "Son, did you get one million five hundred seventy-three dollars and twenty-three cents on your piece of paper," or whatever the amount was.  You know he had figured it all in his head you know as my dad was doing the paper figuring and granddaddy was doing mental math.
Speaker 1: Well that's quite a gift that, for those days (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Especially so many black farmers were taken advantage of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Because they couldn't account, but they would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well he may have been taken advantage of--I mean it may have been you know like external circumstances where he may not have--even with his knowledge of mathematics he may, didn't have the, you know, the legal backup to say that I was cheated.  But my grandmother [Emma B. Glenn Tilley] was, was really the, the financial person in the family, and, you know, as far as keeping records.  And I don't know if she had more like writing, you know, ability to write numerals and, you know, and figure on paper than he or just how they divided that responsibility.
Story_ID: 529166
Speaker 1: Did your father [John Lee Tilley] tell stories about growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well he's the one that got me started, or he made me interested in family history and also in black history in a larger sense.  There was one uncle of his, now this was his grandmother's, I mean his mother's [Emma B. Glenn Tilley] brother, her maiden name was Glenn and this brother's name was Robert Glenn.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Is that where Glennette comes from?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, I was the oldest grandchild and of course they assumed the oldest grandchild would be a boy.  And when I was a girl, they were like what were we--they were gonna name me Glenn of course, and they were like, what will we do?  And my mother [Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley] leaned up on her elbow and said, "Well once I, I knew a classmate named Glennette, why don't we name her that," (laughter), and so that's where that name comes from.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you tell us about Glenn and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well Uncle Robert, according to my father, was going to be sold--his father evidently was in the position where--you know how you sometimes hear about enslaved people being able to work at Christmastime and keep, make a little money and keep a portion of it for them self.  Well seemed like a situation like that, and he had heard that his son was going to be sold and so he went to the slaveholder and asked if he raised the money, if he could purchase his son.  And he was told yes, but in reality, well he was betrayed and the son was sold and there was, the, he, this Robert Glenn, jumping forward, was interviewed as one of the people in the WPA [Works Progress Administration] [Federal Writers'] Project.  You know that one that Smithsonian [Institution, Washington, D.C.] recorded or some years ago (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right, right in the '30s [1930s] (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, but more recently the Smithsonian--Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] have--done a joint project where some of these WPA interviews were read aloud by present day actors like [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right, on public television--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: There was a public television special--
Speaker 2: Right and his was one of those stories, Robert Glenn.  But he was taken from his, his mother and really not able to say good-bye and well, he went into quite detail in this interview but then he was taken to the St. Louis [Missouri] area.  And then after he was freed after slavery, he worked his way back to North Carolina in the hopes of being reunited with his family--
Story_ID: 529167
Speaker 1: And they said--or the way the family story goes--that when he [Turner's paternal great uncle, Robert Glenn] arrived it was the day that my grandfather, great-grandfather was in town, or--well wasn't at home.  And so here this bearded man or man who, you know, matured since being taken away as a child, rode up on horseback and, you know, and asked to speak to Mr. Glenn.  And his wife said, well or my great-grandmother said, "Mr. Glenn is not at home," and just expected, you know, any proper man to turn on his horse and go on off.  But instead he stood there just staring at her and as she stared back at him, she recognized this is her long lost son.  And as the family story goes, she'd had my grandmother [Emma B. Glenn Tilley] in her arms and dropped my grandmother (laughter) and then reached up and hugged him.  But he remained in the Raleigh [North Carolina] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Poor baby that she (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah I know (laughter) but the--he remained in the Raleigh area and lived 'til ninety-seven and you know just was able to you know reconnect.  But now there's another, when I went to this family reunion, there was another story about Robert Glenn saying that he had used the name George [ph.] Glenn.  There are Georges in the Glenn family and one George Glenn had died quite young, and it's assumed that, or you know this, this is recent--story that I've heard.  That maybe to honor his brother or I don't know why but he went west and was one of the black cowboys and they said that, I think, either United [Airlines] or American Airlines had used a sketch of him in its publicity when they had done a poster or ad honoring the black cowboys.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh what's his name?
Speaker 1: Well his name was Robert Glenn but according this recently told story he changed his name to George Glenn when he went west.  And so I haven't had a chance to check and see if he's you know how the stories overlap or you know kind of sort out the details of that.  But it's intriguing.
Speaker 2: They're sure it's a picture of him.
Speaker 1: Well I don't know, I don't know if it was a photograph 'cause in the family reunion materials it just said that there was a picture of him.  So I, I don't know if it was a drawing like an artist imagined drawing or if there really was a photograph, was taken at his later in life.
Speaker 2: That's an interesting story, you know, that really is, that reunion theme, you know, I know that William Wells Brown's book that he--I think 'The Black Man: His Antecedents, [His Genius, and His Achievements'] or the one about the Civil War ['The Negro in the American Rebellion: His Heroism and His Fidelity,' William Wells Brown], I'm not sure which.  There's a couple stories like that of people being separated prior to the Civil War and coming back and being reunited with their family (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --being sold away making their way back.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: That's always real dramatic stuff, you know.
Speaker 1: I went to a family reunion once and, and we--went to church as a group, and the minister said we're all like salmon, we always want to return to our place of birth.  I just thought that was, you know, a powerful image--metaphor.
Story_ID: 529168
Speaker 1: So your father [John Lee Tilley] had a rich family background--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: A lot of history and people that, you know, were engaged in trying to change their conditions they were in.  Now--his--well how, did he talk about going to school and his development and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah he was the oldest son and would have to, well worked on the farm, so he finally graduated from high school when he was twenty-three years old.  He went to Thyne Institute in [Mecklenburg County] Virginia, evidently it was a Presbyterian school, and then he went to Shaw University [, Raleigh, North Carolina] for his undergraduate work.  And then his family mortgaged their farm you know just to think what property meant or the ownership of property meant how important that was.  They mortgaged the farm so he could attend the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] with the hope of getting his doctorate [degree], he got his master's [degree].  But as I said never completed his dissertation, or never published or defended his dissertation 'cause he did write it but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now his degree was in theology?
Speaker 2: Yeah, theology--philosophy and theology.
Speaker 1: So he had a master's in theology or master's in--what do they call it?
Speaker 2: I don't know what the exact title of the degree.
Speaker 1: Divinity maybe.
Speaker 2: Yeah, divinity [M.Div.] 'cause he used to talk about the divinity school, so I'm sure that was it.  His father [Harvey N. Tilley] had said to go back to the thing of property and the vote; he said that when a man is twenty-one years old he should do four things, and I'm not sure I can remember the fourth one--own property, own something with four legs, if it's a horse, or a dog a mule (laughter) or something; vote; or and I guess join the Masons was the fourth thing, be a Mason.
Speaker 1: Own property, own a four-legged?
Speaker 2: Something four-legged, even if it's just a dog, yeah, vote.
Speaker 1: Vote.
Speaker 2: And be a Mason.
Speaker 1: And be a Mason.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. So I, you know, I guess that background of, he saw education as a way to enable a person, to empower a person to do those things.
Story_ID: 529169
Speaker 1: Now that's something. The family mortgaged the farm for him [Turner's father, John Lee Tilley] to go to school.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. He worked at the university [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], you know, in the dining room and, you know, whatever student jobs.  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now he was there in the nineteen-teens, or around the time of the [World] War [I, WWI]?
Speaker 2: I don't know when he came, he wrote a poem at the fountain--at the base of the fountain at the time in 1927 and I have a copy of that.  Well it's just a typed copy that I, I have, but you know it's on reflection on life when day is done and you know all kinds of things.
Speaker 1: They just refurbished that sculpture.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Done by Lorado Taft.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The Fountain of Time, right.  So your father wrote that poem in 1927?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So he was in, was he in school when he wrote it?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was and he also worked with Mr. [Frederic H.] Hammurabi [Robb] and a group [The Washington Intercollegiate Club of Chicago] that published the ['1927 Intercollegian] Wonder Book,' ['The Negro in Chicago, 1779-1927'] and I'd like to know more about that group.  'Cause it wasn't--as I understand it, it was black students that one or two black students that were in the various Chicago [Illinois] area schools or the handful of black students that would get together and have lectures and music, and I'm sure a social life.  But then they published this, what looked like a yearbook but it was called the, 'The Wonder Book' that showed--well showed them, a pictures of them but had poems and a variety of things.
Speaker 1: It was like a college yearbook (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Except it focused on the black community in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And all the clubs and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Churches.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Hammurabi I guess would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Was Harold Robb [sic.] daddy said he knew him, he was a Northwestern [University School of Law; Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois] law student at the time that daddy knew him.  But I think daddy was assistant editor of that you now publication and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I heard his name is Frederic Robb, too, I don't know--
Speaker 2: Well Frederic Robb, I'm sorry I had the first name wrong.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it's--R-O-B-B was his last name.
Speaker 1: Yeah he had an art degree from Northwestern.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I didn't know if he ever taken his degree, but I knew he was you know in law school.
Speaker 1: Maybe I, maybe he didn't get the degree, he was in law school, no question.
Speaker 2: Un-hm, do you remember him?
Speaker 1: Yes, right.
Speaker 2: Around Chicago?
Speaker 1: He was, he died in '78 [1978].
Speaker 2: I didn't remember the year, but he used to put out that the annual, that huge calendar (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It kind of played it out, a lot of people didn't know he died.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: A lot of people didn't know him by the time he died.  But he died in '78 [1978] 'cause I just got to Chicago in '77 [1977], I--he came by Third World Press.
Speaker 2: Is that right, I can imagine he would.
Speaker 1: I met him in the early '70s [1970s], in '73 [1973], '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: At a conference of the Association of the Study of Negro African History [sic.] or African Heritage Study [sic. African Heritage Studies Association], I'm not sure which, but he was in the hotel asking five questions.  If you get 'em right, you got a calendar.
Speaker 2: Is that right?
Speaker 1: Calendars he had.
Speaker 2: I didn't know that about the questions, I knew (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, five questions and--
Speaker 2: --I have some of those calendars, but I didn't know that, you know, he would give you a test first, a quiz.
Story_ID: 529170
Speaker 1: Now he's [Frederic H. Hammurabi Robb] an important Chicago [Illinois] figure and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He is and he was a--
Speaker 1: --he had a [The] House of Knowledge [Chicago, Illinois] bookstore.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And was a filmmaker along with Oscar Micheaux.
Speaker 2: I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He was really a multi-faceted person and really was people say before his time he was just really a trailblazer as far as like even the images on the calendar.  Daddy [John Lee Tilley] during that same period of time, and I'm sure it was in conjunction maybe with the encouragement, of, of Mr. Hammurabi, wrote a booklet that or you know it's a thin volume called '[A Brief History of] the Negro in Chicago, 1779-1933' [John Lee Tilley].  And he talked about; well he started out with the history of Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, but he also even showed pictures or wrote about the people who had jobs that, the stores along 47th Street.  Like you know the stores who had black clerks or how many black--I'm not sure if they were actually black policemen at that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were some--
Speaker 2: --but just kind of a status, a status report of what black people were doing accomplishments of black people at that period.
Speaker 1: Yeah progress reports sort of, I think the ['1927 Intercollegian] Wonder Book' ['The Negro in Chicago, 1779-1927,' Frederic H. Hammurabi Robb] was a, was an attempt to do that because it was issued at the time of A Century of Progress Fair [sic. Century of Progress International Exposition], you know, 1933 [The Chicago] World's Fair [Chicago, Illinois], that's when it came out you know. I had an original copy of it once, that somebody brought by Third World Press and it disappeared.  You know I looked through an original copy of it a long time ago, and they--you know they keep one at the archives at the [Vivian G.] Harsh [Research] Collection [of Afro-American History and Literature, Chicago, Illinois] under lock and key and they have a Xerox copy for you to look at, they don't even let you see the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The original.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know maybe if you, maybe if you're you, not but not (unclear) (laughter) that's really a fantastic, I mean it's history of the city and snapshot of what black folks were doing in 1933 in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Right.  And, and there was a second volume ['The Negro in Chicago, 1779-1929'] did you realize that, there was a second volume.  I'm not sure if it was quite as ambitious as or thick as the first, but then there was a Mr. [Arthur S.] Logan who did the artwork on that.  And I, I--the last time I saw him, he was, had a funeral, or the repast after a funeral at the Griffin Funeral Home [Chicago, Illinois], and I don't know if he still lives or, or not.
Speaker 1: So he, he must be pretty, he would have to be--
Speaker 2: Up there in age, my father would have been 106; I guess his, his last birthday, this past August 8.
Speaker 1: I don't know how old Hammurabi was when he died; he had that, the bookstore, The House of Knowledge he called it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The House of Knowledge.
Speaker 2: Excuse me, August 7, my mother's [Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley] birthday is the eighth of February, my father's on the seventh of August.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 529171
Speaker 1: So your father [John Lee Tilley] was a--now you, were you born in--?
Speaker 2: In 1933, the year of The [Chicago] World's Fair [Century of Progress International Exposition, Chicago, Illinois], but you know I'm just having the aha moment of realizing that was the year that he was working on the yearbook ['1927 Intercollegian Wonder Book,' also known as 'The Negro in Chicago, 1779-1927,' Frederic H. Hammurabi Robb].  Evidently the work had been done before that, because he was back at that point at Shaw [University, Raleigh, North Carolina] and--'cause I was born there.  But he was also very involved in Olivet [Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois], my mother [Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley] used to say daddy had you know three loves in Chicago: his family, Olivet Baptist Church and the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Olivet Baptist is--now that's the home of, of Joseph [H.] Jackson, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah but that was preceded Joseph Jackson it was Williams, it could be L. K. Williams--I just would have to check, but it seemed that there was just, it was just a social, like a Mecca place you know.  Mrs. Ida Crest [ph.] was one of the people in that same group [The Washington Intercollegiate Club of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], what was it the? Oh, I almost I had the name of it--The InterVarsity Club or, it seems like the word InterVarsity was part of the name of the organization that [Frederic H.] Hammurabi [Robb] and the others had formed.  And Mrs. Crest was sent in it but seems her family was really very active at Olivet and so was Hortense Love who was later the music director at Monumental [Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] and you know used to do those wonderful 'Messiah' [George Frideric Handel] programs.
Speaker 1: So they had a regular group now that met and discussed history and culture?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's something, I know a lot of people think that's new and (laughter) but this happened in the '60s [1960s] or something you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But people were doing that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the whole idea of the, the cultural group in, in Rockford [Illinois], was it Rockford or, or Elgin [Illinois] or what, what was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Or the culture club (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The culture club.
Speaker 2: It was in Springfield [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Springfield.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah the family jumped around so much.  Something I started to say, it's eluded me now but it was--I didn't know if it had something to do with Olivet or, or that group, well maybe it will come back to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so your father helped put, put together one of the books prior to 1933 'cause I think the idea was to get it out before the Century of Progress, so.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, very (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: He finished with that work when you were born in 1933?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, but I'm just realizing you know the--how eventful 1933 was for him you know.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right, Century of Progress that's when the Field Museum [of Natural History, Chicago, Illinois] was built and all the--I think the Shedd Aquarium [Chicago, Illinois] and all that stuff around the Lake [Michigan] was, was for the Century of Progress.
Speaker 2: Is that right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I knew there's so much building that was done in the--for the earlier world's fair [World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, Illinois] and that only the Museum of Science and Industry [Chicago, Illinois] had remained from that.  But I didn't know the origin of the Shedd Aquarium and that.
Speaker 1: Yeah the Shedd (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the [Adler] Planetarium [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And the--
Speaker 2: Planetarium possibly?
Speaker 1: Yeah, planetarium are a result of the Century of Progress.
Speaker 2: Now called the Museum Campus [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right.
Story_ID: 529172
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about your first childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I guess the one of the things I remember is our house; we lived on campus at Shaw [University, Raleigh, North Carolina] on Blount Street.  A beautiful house that's since been torn down, but it, it backed on the football field for Shaw, and there were vines with white flowers that were on a trellis.  I guess it was you know kind of to act as of you know kind of a well you know what do you call that--well kind of between the--so you look right out on the football field.  But it-- I remember you know the flowers there, I also remember how I learned about that there wasn't a Santa Claus.  Because one Christmas my parents [Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley and John Lee Tilley] were reading a bedtime story to me and they--this delivery, there was a knock at the door, it was this delivery and--well because there was such a segregated South at that time.  I was very aware that Caucasians were in the community or certainly in the house, and you know here came these burly white men with piano with a big red bow on it.  But the bow was askew, you know, as they were carrying it, and I, this house had a second floor with a balcon--or kind of a lattice balcony and you could look down on the first floor.  And I saw these guys bringing the piano and I know for Christmas Santa Claus had brought me, or I was told that Santa had brought the piano and I thought I know (laughter) my parents bought that piano (laughter) so.
Speaker 1: So you didn't think those guys were elves or anything?
Speaker 2: No I didn't think they were elves, they were dressed in green I remember that, but so maybe I was supposed to think they were elves, but I thought that was very nice, so.
Story_ID: 529173
Speaker 1: Can you tell us, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up when you were in [North] Carolina, I guess?
Speaker 2: Pine needles of North Carolina and I always liked the idea of the name Tar Heel, as in the [University of] North Carolina [at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] image, or logo.  And I guess in a way I've kind of continued that, I realize I'm digressing, but years ago I'd spoken in Detroit [Michigan] since I've done the Underground Railroad research.  And I was leaving and a youngster had, with a further question, couldn't think of my name.  They came running behind me and said, "Miss Footsteps, Miss Footsteps," and I knew that's who he was talking to 'cause so much of what I've written has been you know either about people who are trailblazers or, or you know pathfinders or followers.  And--but I almost wonder if that didn't kind of in the back of my mind go back to, you know, having thought of my--that image of a Tar Heel.  And in since then sometimes I've just used footprints or footsteps as images, but it made really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What does Tar Heel refer to in North Carolina anyway, I don't think--
Speaker 2: I don't know 'cause it really wasn't--I don't think tar, I don't know if it was just the you know the black earth of North Carolina but it's a symbol--is the footprint that--and you know, so I just don't know if subconsciously I've kind of carried that thing through my life and work.
Story_ID: 529174
Speaker 1: I enjoyed or, you know, of course remember the houses--or the houses where we lived, 'cause we lived on campus [Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina] so that first house on Blount Street later was used for some other function.  Or was gonna be torn, or maybe it was at the time it was going to be torn down, but then they built a duplex for faculty members.  I think it was 816 North Wilmington Street, and our family lived there, and the backyard there, there were a lot, I can't remember if it was twelve or twenty-four magnee, magnolia trees, but it was, there were you know ancient trees that were just you know huge trunks.  And then of course the leaves were so lustrous and then the flowers were so beautiful that it (simultaneous) --
Speaker 2: We, Scott [Stearns] and I recently saw a magnolia trees in the South for the first time, really paid, paid attention to 'em (simultaneous) --
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: They are gorgeous trees.
Speaker 1: Oh, they are, they are.  And then I think they were sheltering and that's another thing, you know, I realized I've always loved kind of a canopy of trees, but I imagine that dates back to when I used to play in that backyard and, you know, these trees, you know, just almost really formed a roof.  Because they were such old established trees and someone had the wisdom to keep them, you know, even when they built this new house, you know, facing the street.  But one of the things that happened there in that backyard was they had, you know how ladders are child, children's play equipment like where three ladders are joined and they call it a jungle gym.  Well I had climbed up on that and fallen and knocked the wind out of myself and my grandmother [Lydia Mary Jones Holmes] was someone who--this is my mother's [Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley] mother who had come to live with us after she was widowed in Springfield [Illinois].  And--but she didn't have a lot of formal education, but she was a child psychologist or psychiatrist almost from the word go.  So she saw me fall and you know really get the wind knocked out of me, but instead of coming and you know and saying, "Oh, baby, baby are you all right," she said, "[HistoryMaker] Glennette [Tilley Turner], get up off that ground and come in this house."  And I thought whether I was dead or not, I better (laughter) try to respond and you know I could just you know.  And in retrospect I could you know just imagine how relieved she must've been to see that I was able to get up.  But that was just the right way to you know for her to have dealt with that situation.  And so those are sights, but then the, the taste that I remember is on Sundays, well because my father [John Lee Tilley] was a minister--well he had a church in Raleigh [North Carolina].  All the time he was dean of the school of religion there after he was acting president then you know then later he headed the department or the school of religion [Shaw University Divinity School, Raleigh, North Carolina].  And, but he always had a church and down Oberlin, on Oberlin Road, and so evenings on Sundays, mama and daddy would go to whatever the evening service was.  And my grandmother and I would stay home and make hot chocolate, but it was just at the time that I was learning to read.  And one Sunday she was busy doing something as it was time to make this hot chocolate, so I thought, well, you know, I can read the directions and I'll surprise her.  And, but you know how cocoa boxes used to be like made of cardboard with, with the label pasted onto, over cardboard, and this word, the vowel on the word dash had been scratched and, you know on the--off the box.  Or I guess you know in the packaging you know in handling of it, and the only word I knew that was D blank S-H was dish and so I put a dish of salt into this (laughter) hot chocolate and my poor grandmother sat there and we tried to you know tried to drink it.  You know she didn't want to discourage me you know she said, well, you know, "That's all right, honey;" you know, "it'll be all right."  But that was just the worst cocoa (laughter) in the world, but you know I it just showed me a lot about her character to, you know, to be encouraging (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well she tried to encourage you, but--
Speaker 1: She tried (laughter) yeah.
Speaker 2: A dish of salt. Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, huh?
Story_ID: 529175
Speaker 1: So you grew up on the campus at Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina] for the most part (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Then when I was ten--well we always had family in Illinois and this great-aunt that I mentioned you know when I was telling you about the roots of the plant or weeds.  It was in Chicago [Illinois] and she had quite a large house on--in 49th [Street] and Vincennes [Avenue] it's block of--and so it was kind of the place that family came any out of town family members would stay Aunt Mattie's [ph.] house.  And my mom [Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley] came to take additional courses at Pestalozzi[-Froebel Teachers College, Chicago, Illinois] which I guess later became National Louis University [Chicago, Illinois].  But--so that she could get her four-year bachelor's [degree] and my dad [John Lee Tilley] was taking these summer courses at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  So sometimes we, you know, would, would come to, to Aunt Mattie's.
Speaker 1: And spend the summer in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was you know always something we enjoyed and was very nice, we would drive up back when they had the winding roads before the super highways.  And I can remember being in the backseat looking at the mountain laurel as we went through Pennsylvania.  Still they were trying to make time 'cause they had probably had just gotten out of winter school on a Friday and were reporting for summer school on Monday.

Speaker 1: When you were growing up, what were you like, I mean, what kind of a little girl were you?
Speaker 2: Well inquisitive and, you know, always wanted to ask questions and--well and I just really was--it never occurred to me I wasn't supposed to try to get my lessons.  So I, you know, tried to be a good student.  In first grade I remember that we used to have to say a prayer at the start of the school day.  And we were supposed to of course close our eyes and I remember once opening my eyes and seeing somebody else who had their eyes open.  And I told on this kid and so it--my teacher whose name was Miss Lee [ph.], said, "Well [HistoryMaker] Glennette [Tilley Turner] you and Billy [ph.]," or whatever his name was, "close your eyes," (laughter), "and pray again."  So that was made me reveal I had no character (laughing).
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a bad thing (laughter).
Speaker 2: That was a bad (laughing) thing, I have, haven't been a tattletale since, I learned my lesson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well and then there was a very tall girl I don't know if she was older than the other kids in grade school or if she was someone who you know grew, you know who had a growth spurt before the other children in class.  But in the class pictures at our grade school, Crosby-Garfield [School, Raleigh, North Carolina], you know there'd be all the kids about the same height and then Pearlie Mae [ph.].  And it seemed that Pearlie Mae really would have to wear either hand-me-down or either her older sister's or mother's shoes and clothing that looked like they belonged to an adult and probably hadn't originated as her wardrobe.  But she was my dearest friend and I just you know is just--and I guess she had a wisdom.  She probably was older and maybe her, maybe her and her family had been migrant workers or something where she was still reading at the grade level that we were but maybe she really was older.  'Cause she seemed to have a wisdom about her that, you know, was beyond her years.
Story_ID: 529177
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Reading and history.
Speaker 1: And history, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you were--were you always interested in history for the most part?
Speaker 2: Well yeah, but then it probably developed later, what I started to say, say when I was talking about coming to Chicago [Illinois].  It was during the time when polio was so prevalent in the South or I guess throughout the nation.  But one summer our family had come to Chicago for the summer and planned to go back to North Carolina.  But in the meantime, daddy [John Lee Tilley] had gotten an invitation to come and be president of Florida Normal [and Industrial] College in St. Augustine [Florida; Florida Memorial University, Miami, Florida], and my parents were told that they couldn't bring my brother [John Lee Tilley, Jr.] and me, or children couldn't be brought back into the state and then leave again.  But if daddy came--daddy found that if, if he and mama [Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley] came to North Carolina and arranged the move and then saw to it that we went straight to Florida you know that would be okay.  So my parents went back and arranged the move and then mama and my brother and I took a train that took, I think thirty-six hours to get to Florida, and we went there.  Daddy was president by day but Florida Normal was such a poor college, it was a Baptist college, and, you know, didn't have an endowment.  So by day, he'd walk around and, you know, be presidential and wear a suit and do all the administrative things.  But the evening, he went to all these meetings, church meetings and association meetings.  And, you know, let tell why this school needed money for teachers, books and microscopes and stuff.  And would drive long distances, so mama realized he was tired when he left home, and she devised this plan to have this inquisitive little daughter go with him.  Thinking he'd be less likely to fall asleep at the wheel if, you know, there is some chattering child with him. But those were just the treasured moments, he would tell about family stories.  And I remember one night; we were in the middle of nowhere, but in a southern town with one red light.  You know, no other sight of people or cars in sight but he knew that if he'd gone through that red light, they'd probably, you know, patrol car would've zoomed out of the darkness.  So he used that as a teachable moment to tell me about Garrett Morgan as the inventor of the stoplight.  And that was also when he told me the story of this Uncle Robert [Glenn] who had come back after slavery, found his family.
Story_ID: 529178
Speaker 1: So did your father [John Lee Tilley] like stay in association with people like [Frederic H.] Hammurabi [Robb] and other black historians?
Speaker 2: I don't know if he did. I imagine summers when he'd be in Chicago [Illinois] he did.  Because I remember he, you know, would talk about Mr. Hammurabi and that's how I knew his, who he was and his importance.  When my parents were here in Chicago, Benny Mays [Dr. Benjamin E. Mays] was also at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and he performed their wedding services, ceremony at the little chapel at the University of Chicago.  And [Rev. Miles] Mark Fisher was also, I guess around Olivet [Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] at that time, and Mark Fisher--the reason I mention him now, is that when daddy was in North Carolina, Mark Fisher was at Whitehall Baptist Church [sic. White Rock Baptist Church] in Durham [North Carolina].  So I knew their associations or, you know, they stayed in touch and we used to even go over on Christmas day to all have dinner at the Fisher's house.
Speaker 1: Now I'm not familiar with Mark Fisher.
Speaker 2: Miles Mark Fisher, I think is his full name and he did a lot of work on--well music, black spirituals, but you know since he had the academic background, I think he you know did more than you know just appreciate the name but.
Speaker 1: Miles Mark Fisher.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did--Benjamin Mays was also a friend of your father's?
Speaker 2: Yeah he had performed; mama [Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley] said that when they used to go to that restaurant, I can't think of the name of it on [S Martin Luther] King [Jr Drive], on 47th Street that Dr., it was a little--evidently a very nice restaurant.   Had linen tablecloths and all, but Benny Mays had said that when you're in a place like this--or I guess on the 47th Street, you don't close your eyes when you pray (laughter) so I remember that as a, a quote (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's quotable; so many people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I can imagine.
Speaker 1: Yeah and Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: But to go back to my father and my interest in history, he would end each of his stories, family stories or stories about black history by saying, when you grow up, you should write this down.  And so you know I just thought I was supposed to do.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful so you were able to--it's something about long car trips and rides that you know with one's parents that bring the stories out.  You were fortunate enough to ride around with him (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Hear these stories.
Speaker 2: I've talked with a number of people--of black women who talked about the influence of their fathers you know kind of--as distinctive from you know just a general parenting.  But you know the type of encouragement, I don't know if it was because it was before the feminist movement that girls that were fortunate enough to have fathers that you know treated them as intellectual.  Or potentially people who were able to learn or to achieve or accomplish, or you know, do things.  If that just really acted as a challenge to, you know, really live up to your potential.
Speaker 1: So you consider yourself kind of fortunate to have that kind of a--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I do.
Story_ID: 529179
Speaker 1: Did your father [John Lee Tilley], was he a member of or do the--or were you aware of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History [(ASNLH); Association for the Study of African American Life & History, ASALH] in those days, Carter G. Woodson and all--
Speaker 2: I wasn't aware of it and I don't know if he was active in it or not, I just you know it was only after I became an adult that I--I know he spoke of Carter G. Woodson and we had a lot of, of black history books you know in our family library.  But I don't know if he was active in the organization, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] he certainly was.  And I--he especially worked with the NAACP.  After he left Florida, he went to Baltimore [Maryland] to take a church there--Metropolitan Baptist Church [Baltimore, Maryland] but he worked.  His greater work or you know I guess his heart was in his work with the NAACP and voter registration.  And he found that although Baltimore was quite southern in sentiment and you know in many of the laws it didn't have the some of the voting restrictions that some of the other states had on their books.  And with work in conjunction with NAACP and various churches, he was able to do what nobody else could've done.  He or nobody else could've done anyplace else, it was just the right combination of you know having that information and then having the corporation of the churches and the NAACP and the Afro American newspaper [Afro-American Newspapers] that really made voting you know really a priority for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now that's quite a story, and we were discussing off camera (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: A couple of days ago.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Your father's interaction with the Mitchells and Murphys in Baltimore and the, the Afro American newspaper and the famous Mitchell family (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Clarence [M. Mitchell] Jr. and his grandmother Lillie [Mae Carroll Jackson].
Speaker 2: Lillie Jackson.
Speaker 1: --Carroll Jackson.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah and her influence on Thurgood Marshall.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And all, all those churches together--Union Baptist [Church, Baltimore, Maryland] and the Methodist church, I can't think of the name the A.M.E. church, the A.M.E. church, they're all on the same street.
Speaker 2: And there used to be a restaurant (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: On Druid Hill [Avenue].
Speaker 2: Yeah Druid Hill, right. There used to be Sess's Restaurant [Baltimore, Maryland] that had wonderful crab cakes you know which was important meeting place, S-E-S-S, I think.
Speaker 1: Yeah [HistoryMaker Reverend] Vernon Dobson who is still alive at Union Baptist as a pastor you know tells his history so does [HistoryMaker] Michael Mitchell [Sr.] and [HistoryMaker] Clarence Mitchell, III, and they talk about those days of the NAACP being organized (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And Maryland being the most organized state (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Surely was.
Speaker 1: Then becoming the focus of a national drive to--for a Voting Rights Act eventually.
Speaker 2: Yes and the--Ebony did an article in I think 1959 called "Baltimore, That Vote Getting Capitol" [sic. "Baltimore: New Negro Vote Capital"] and so it really got national attention or you know really attracted national attention.  And then the Mitchells, or then there were people who were able then to run for office.  And, and then Clarence Mitchell who had been the lobbyist, you know, just really were just people.  Just all facets of, you know, if you think of it like a voting is a diamond, you know, there are just people who were able to fill all those slots very capably.
Story_ID: 529180
Speaker 1: Was your father [John Lee Tilley] an active member of the National Baptist Convention too?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah he would go each year to the National Baptist Convention.
Speaker 1: Did you ever go?
Speaker 2: Well I went and I didn't go, I did and I didn't--he, well to extend or to add another detail to this story of the voting.  [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] heard of daddy's voter's registration success 'cause they had people just lined up around the block.  The voting registration, the boards of election just couldn't close at normal hours 'cause there are just streams of people waiting to, to register.  Well Dr. King learned of daddy's work and asked him to come and be the first executive director of SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference].  And he went I--really it turned out, I found out years later, that because it was Ms. Ella [Josephine] Baker's brainchild that she felt that rightly, that she should have been asked to be the executive director or that she you know merited it.  Daddy not knowing this background took the, the job, and--went to SCLC, but I'm sorry, I got so busy telling that story.  Tell me what you'd said just before that.
Speaker 1: No I was asking you about the National Baptist Convention.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  When Dr. King wrote 'Stride Toward Freedom[: The Montgomery Story'], daddy was supposed to, daddy was you know at SCLC and Dr. King had asked him to have a booth selling 'Stride Toward Freedom.'  It was a pre-publication you know chance to--or kind of prior to the hit, hitting the bookstores.  You know it was like a preview, a pre-publication chance and--or sale.  And, but daddy wanted to go to the National Baptist Convention it was here in Chicago [Illinois] at the [Chicago] Coliseum that year.  And so what he did was he enlisted my husband [Albert W. Turner] and me to man the booth so he could go to the reunion, or to the convention.  And the Kings had a booth, the King family had a booth right next to ours, so that's how I got to meet Mama King [Alberta Williams King] and the--Mrs. [Christine King] Farris and, and Dr. King's brother [Alfred Daniel Williams King].  But daddy did go each year to the National Baptist Convention, but that one I particularly, I remember 'cause I didn't get into any of the sessions, you know, (laughter) daddy did, but we, my husband and I were selling 'Stride Toward Freedom.'
Story_ID: 529181
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet [HistoryMaker Reverend] Gardner Taylor?
Speaker 2: Daddy [John Lee Tilley] used to talk about Gardner Taylor. He was at [The] Riverside [Church, New York, New York] wasn't he?  I think he had left Riverside by the time I first (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: He was at [The] Concord Baptist [Church of Christ] in Brooklyn [New York, New York] yeah.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: That's right. Concord.
Speaker 2: Well daddy used to speak of him, there are a number of really trained black theologians that he had a lot of respect for.  He also had a lot respect for Paul Tillich, I remember, you know the similarity of the, the names, but he used to speak very highly of Gardner Taylor.  But I-- don't think I ever actually met him.  But Mary McLeod Bethune came and visited when you know when we were at Florida Normal [and Industrial College, St. Augustine, Florida; Florida Memorial University, Miami, Florida].  I guess there was a meeting of some of the Florida college presidents, the black colleges and she came.  And I understand I sat on her lap, I was told later (laughter) that I sat on her lap, but I don't remember an experience.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did, did you ever meet [W.E.B.] Du Bois or I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Or, or any of the other NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't daddy may well have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Because you were--he didn't, he came to Baltimore [Maryland] after you were already in school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He, he must've gone to Baltimore--I graduated from [West Aurora] High School [Aurora, Illinois] in 1951, so and I think he must've gone to Baltimore probably in the late--I was just trying to--he had gone to Baltimore before I finished high school, I, yeah, before I finished high school.  I was just trying to think, my grandmother, Lydia M. Newman Holmes [Lydia Mary Jones Holmes] had, as I said had lived with our family, she's the one I made hot chocolate with.  But in her latter days she lived with my parents in Florida and she really was the homemaker while my mother [Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley] worked.  You know during those days families you know black couples have had two working family members longer than the population at-large.  And nana died I think in 1949 and it was after that that my parents moved to Baltimore.  So I was just trying to sort out, you know, exactly (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) About 1950, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it must've been the early '50s [1950s] that daddy and mama came to Baltimore 'cause my grandmother died while they were in Florida.
Story_ID: 529182
Speaker 1: She [Turner's maternal grandmother, Lydia Mary Jones Holmes] had an invention that was patented a year or so after her death, you know, had finally--had gone through all the--
Speaker 2: This your grandmother?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: What did she invent?
Speaker 1: It was a children's toy, a pull toy a child could assemble, and so she's a woman inventor (chuckling).
Speaker 2: That's interesting you know.  Well did it ever, what was it ever manufactured?
Speaker 1: Not on any large scale, she had died by that point and you know my parents had moved and the--one of the criticisms of it, I, well you know could've seen as a strength or you know a drawback.  It was like an inlaid puzzle or you know like a piece of cardboard, or plywood that had the pieces inlaid in it.  And then a child could take the pieces and axel and a picture of a little dog and some wheels you know and assemble it and you know put a string on it and you know and pull it.  Well they said that any child that was old enough to, sophisticated enough to assemble it--one of the you know critics or criticisms of it would be too old to be interested in playing with a pull toy.  But my grandmother and my mother [Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley] pointed out well in cases of siblings you would have an older child who could assemble it and, you know, and might have care responsibilities for a younger child.  Then, you know, be only too glad to have the younger child entertained with a--themself with a pull toy.

Speaker 1: Where did you go to grade school at Shaw [University, Raleigh, North Carolina] did they have a school there on campus?
Speaker 2: No, I went to a public school. Crosby-Garfield [School, Raleigh, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Crosby-Garfield?
Speaker 2: Garfield, uh-huh.  I've seen that was hyphenated Crosby-Garfield.
Speaker 1: Okay, you talked about your favorite subject was a reading and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And history basically.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Are there any teachers there that, that stood out as (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Just Ms. Lee [ph.] who felt, who I tattled to (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, so did you finish grade school there?
Speaker 2: No, when we went to Florida, I went--they had a demonstration school on the campus [Florida Normal and Industrial College, St. Augustine, Florida; Florida Memorial University, Miami, Florida], and Ms. Alice Smith [ph.] had--was, it was one-room school.  She had come from Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], I think my mother [Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley], my mother was a graduate of Hampton you know the two-year graduate.  And either Ms. Smith was a contemporary of hers or she knew about her through you know the alumni journals.  And then I went to Excelsior High School [sic. Excelsior School] in downtown St. Augustine [Florida], it was a first through twelve school, but then I came--I must've gone there for seventh grade, then I came here [Chicago, Illinois] for high school.
Story_ID: 529184
Speaker 1: So you started off high school in St. Augustine [Florida]?
Speaker 2: Well I guess it really wasn't high school, I think I did seventh and eighth grade, so it would been like junior high, but it was a school that was, I guess a unit school that had classes from first through twelfth grade.  But I'd gone to I think sixth grade on the campus [Florida Normal and Industrial College St. Augustine, Florida; Florida Memorial University, Miami, Florida], and then went down, and I guess it's, that was the highest level that the campus lab school had.  And then I went down to the Excelsior High School [sic. Excelsior School, St. Augustine, Florida] for my seventh and eighth grade years, then came to West Aurora High School [Aurora, Illinois] for high school.
Speaker 1: Okay now you said that it was, well you came to--your family stayed, I mean your mother [Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley] and father [John Lee Tilley] stayed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah my parents stayed in Florida, my [great] aunt that I had mentioned as being my mother's youngest sister, had trained, done nursing training at Provident Hospital [Provident Hospital of Cook County] in Chicago [Illinois] and met and married a doctor whose home was Aurora, Illinois.  And I can remember overhearing the conversation where my Uncle Jim [ph.] said to my mom, "Sister, if you want [HistoryMaker] Glennette [Tilley Turner] to go to an accredited college, you should let her go to Aurora for high school, an accredited high school there."  And the plan had been for me to stay with Jim's, my Uncle Jim's sister, but her husband had tuberculosis and was in a sanitarium, she visited him each day.  So they arranged for me to stay with some church members--an elderly couple who belonged to the family church.
Story_ID: 529185
Speaker 1: Well how did you feel about that? I mean being separated from your family, coming to Aurora [Illinois] and all that?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know, but it was just kind of like what I was supposed to do, you know, and I was just supposed to make it work.  And so, you know, I kind of, I guess looking back now I could've felt like a pawn but I just you know just seemed like they put all their eggs in one basket to make it possible for me to come.  And so I just felt like I had to live up to you know--my responsibility to you know try to go to school and do, do well you know?
Speaker 1: Now you have a brother [John Lee Tilley, Jr.] too, right?
Speaker 2: I did he died in the early '90s [1990s], but there were the two of us as we grew up.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well how, how did you like Aurora, was it much different from--
Speaker 2: What--in the South?
Speaker 1: Yeah any one of the places, in the South.
Speaker 2: Yeah it was different and then the fact I wasn't with my parents [Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley and John Lee Tilley], these, this elderly couple felt so responsible for me and you know I was just so much younger than their--if they had children than their own children would've been.  And so my life was just sort of going to school [West Aurora High School, Aurora, Illinois] and going to church and going back to school (laughter) and going and studying.  But the woman in this couple had danced with 'Shuffle Along,' she'd been a show girl in her earlier days and she was such a bow-legged lady (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Mrs. Matilda Greer [ph.], and her husband's name was Solomon Greer [ph.], and they were very, very nice.  She was wonderful, wonderful cook and was just really--it was very nice; it worked out very, very well.  Mr. Greer was the first person I ever was around where it was very obvious that he didn't know how to read; he'd always ask me to look up numbers in the phone book. And just said, "I need to get these glasses changed," but in the four years I was there, he never had them changed, and it really was because you know soon realized it was because he couldn't read.  But they, when I was, when I took driver's training in high school, you know they wanted to, let me use the car to learn to drive.  However, the first time we went driving, there was a, a curb, I guess I was backing out of a driveway and the back wheel kind of--instead staying on the driveway, kind of glanced, the leaned around the curb.  And so it was this little jolt as you know as we backed, backed into the street.  And Mr. Greer was just as diplomatic, just you know not having time to take me driving (laughter) again about that as he was about having me look up numbers in the telephone book.  And he just sort of never conveniently could, you know, take me back out driving; I think he was worried about his little car there. Well, and understandably so.
Story_ID: 529186
Speaker 1: Were there other black students at [West] Aurora High School [Aurora, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were a few other black students. I had a very good friend who lived on--we, where I lived was 715 North View Street [Aurora, Illinois] where the Greers [ph.] lived.  And the next block there was a girl named Joanna Barbie [ph.] who was a wonderful artist and I would, you know, walk past her house and we'd walk to school together.  And there were other black students then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah Barbie is a name, there's some, I know there's some Barbies who are professors, there is a professor Barbie at Findlay College [University of Findlay, Findlay, Ohio] at one point.
Speaker 2: Is that right, is that right?  Wasn't there a Barbie who was also, no Barber [ph.], who had been bishop of A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church I was getting those names mixed up.  But Joanna later went to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] and she taught in Detroit [Michigan], I don't know if she ever really got to you know develop her art to the extent should would've liked.  But she did portrait of me you know as one of her subjects, or you know when she was taking art lessons in high school.  And I, her hus--when she died, her husband gave that to me, I just thought it was very nice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then we always thought we'd do a book together you know if she would illustrate, I'd write it.
Speaker 1: So were you writing in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I was always interested mainly writing on the school newspaper and you know and miscellaneous things like that.  And then in college [Lake Forest College, Lake Forest, Illinois] I continued writing on the newspaper and was later editor of the yearbook in college.
Story_ID: 529187
Speaker 1: In high school [West Aurora High School, Aurora, Illinois] now did you have much of a social life in high school?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, the Greers [ph.] saw to it, I didn't (laughter) have any social life.  There was a teenage center and I think maybe I went there once and probably it was to a Sunday tea you know.  They would have you know teen dances and stuff on weekends; I never got to go.  But I would sometimes come in to, it didn't and there wasn't any social life in Chicago [Illinois], but this Aunt Mattie [ph.] that I, I mentioned, at you know whose house, whose house we had stayed when we used to come to Chicago.  Would continue to like invite me for weekends and you know I'd spend Christmases and Thanksgivings 'cause I couldn't, couldn't afford to go home.  My parents [Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley and John Lee Tilley] had moved to Baltimore [Maryland] and that you know by that time, but I could never afford to you know go home for holidays.
Speaker 1: But did they come to Chicago often during those days?
Speaker 2: Once in a while they would come, the trip I remember best was when I graduated from high school [sic.].  Aunt Mattie had a daughter named Blanche Smith Elliott [ph.] and it was just really--she did a wonderful thing in that it was an acknowledgement of my, like having reached adulthood when I graduated from college [Lake Forest College, Lake Forest, Illinois].  And Blanche gave a lovely reception; it was years later before I you know appreciated how you know what a significant event this was.  But my parents came for that and you know it's just a nice time, by that time, I'd met my husband [Albert W. Turner], so they had a chance to you know.  My husband to-be at that point they had a chance to, to meet him.
Speaker 1: Where did you meet, you met him in high school?
Speaker 2: No, I was, I went to Lake Forest College--
Speaker 1: Oh, you're talking about after college?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: College graduation.
Speaker 2: Yeah I'm sorry, I--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry it was college, after college that this reception and the meeting with my husband all took place.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 529188
Speaker 1: --Was there anything significant about high school [West Aurora High School, Aurora, Illinois] graduation or?
Speaker 2: Well, my father [John Lee Tilley] said the prayer, I, you know, I guess I've always you know how Bobby Kennedy [Senator Robert F. Kennedy] said you know, I can, can only paraphrase it, you know ask what is and you know and think what ought to be and ask why not?  So I went and I, when we were gonna graduate and I said that my father was a minister and he'd be coming for graduation.  And I'd like it if he could you know say the prayer at the program, and so you know he did and I thought that was the standout you know the outstanding memory that I had of high school.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: For him to have been there, I didn't realize that that point in Aurora [Illinois] how, you know he'd probably was the first black person who had been on the stage as a presenter at a high school graduation.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that's in 1951?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 529189
Speaker 1: Is there anything else from high school [West Aurora High School, Aurora, Illinois], did you have any, was there a teacher or anybody in high school that was kind of a mentor (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a physiology teacher, Mrs. Una Hayes--Peese [ph.] who was oh, so excellent and Ms. [Marian] Winteringham was the dean of girls or dean of students and so those would be people who stood out--oh and then Mr. Friday [ph.].  When I came from the South I didn't have any math background or, or certainly not on the caliber I would've had if I'd gone to the Illinois schools.  And I signed up for freshman algebra and tried so hard I--but I just did not get it.  And I can remember Mr. Friday used to say, "[HistoryMaker] Miss [Glennette] Tilley [Turner], Miss Tilley; effort without result is nothing," (laughter) you know?  But it was a memory that stood out 'cause it was I guess having been a good student prior to that, it was very humbling.  It was good experience you know to just realize that that wasn't my long suit and there, you know, were things that would not come easy and so it was a good learning experience.
Story_ID: 529190
Speaker 1: Did you know where you were gonna go to school when you graduated [from West Aurora High School, Aurora, Illinois] or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I wanted to go to Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] because I had, you know, always thought I would go into writing and journalism was the only writing-type major that I knew of.  But our high school went downstate there in the sweet sixteen in basketball, and so I knew that what they you know I knew in advance which state they would be going downstate.  And so we'd have a day off from school, so I wrote Northwestern and asked to come up and, and visit Medill [School of Journalism, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois].  And there was a former basketball player who you know had probably been a senior when I was a freshman, but who was at, still at Northwestern and he was you know a great basketball player there, too.  So you know they had written and John Beaver [ph.], I think was his name was the person who was gonna escort me around the campus.  Well it was you know back in the days where many of the schools had some prejudice, and I went early.  I went up on the train and because of the train schedule, arrived like an hour before my scheduled appointment.  And I went to the building where I was to have met the director of admissions and it was in an old house like you'd know maybe the Chicago [Illinois] houses have like a living room a parlor and then you know rooms beyond that.  So they--in this house the parlor was where the receptionist sat and then the back part of the house had been converted to the office where the person I was to see was--had his offices.  And so the receptionist--I went and I just said I was [HistoryMaker] Glennette [Tilley] Turner, or Glennette Tilley at the time, and she said, "Won't you have a seat," that this Mr. Riley [ph.] was in conference with someone else.  Or you know he'd see me or you know he, he in other words I was to wait until the time of my scheduled appointment.  So I sat down and when he came out, the, he looked out and I was the only person in the office other than the receptionist and he said, "I see Miss Tilley isn't here."  Never dawned on him that just by chance maybe I could've been Miss Tilley.  So then he sputtered and told me that this basketball player that was to have seen me around the campus wasn't going to be available.  And I, I think he took me on a slight cursory tour of the campus, but I thought, you know, if he treats me this way now before I'm in their grips, you know this is where I'm not gonna go.  I--Medill is just an entirely different place now, I--have the highest respect for it, but that was really a turning point in my life.  So then soon after that, they had a college day at high school where different colleges came.  And I interviewed with Lake Forest College [Lake Forest, Illinois] and because I hadn't had any social life, I had great grades (laughter) and so was able to qualify for an academic scholarship to Lake Forest.
Speaker 1: It's interesting you know Willis [Nathaniel] Huggins went to Medill School of Journalism.
Speaker 2: Is that right?
Speaker 1: So did [Frederic H.] Hammurabi [Robb].
Speaker 2: Is that right?
Speaker 1: He went there.
Speaker 2: I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: I don't know if they graduated but Huggins did, yeah Huggins.
Speaker 2: Is that so?
Speaker 1: Huggins got something from Medill.
Speaker 2: Is that so, I hadn't known that.
Speaker 1: And he actually wrote copy about the Chicago riots to other papers of Chicago while, while he was at Northwestern.
Speaker 2: Is that so, my, I'm interested to learn that.
Speaker 1: It's funny now but you know so it's not like they didn't have any black students before.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.  I think it was just this one person, but he was the gatekeeper you know I don't think it was Medill at all.  I think it was this Mr. Riley you know and how some, how you really remember names of people at pivotal points in your life.  And I, you know, just really felt that it was his action rather than the school of journalism or Northwestern, so.
Story_ID: 529191
Speaker 1: So you wound up at Lake Forest College [Lake Forest, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Were there many black students at Lake Forest?
Speaker 2: No, but it was probably the best--again the best thing that could have happened because it was a small school.  And, you know, it was just a better setting or I was nurtured there having a chance to really know my instructors and you know and for them to be able to take interest in, in you know my work.  And oh, there were, I think only one or two black students who lived on campus but then a number who came, who commuted from Waukegan [Illinois] and North Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's not--nothing much to do but study, huh (laughter)?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  But then, and again well just I guess all the schools were reflective of the social mores or practices of the time.  The way I, I met my husband [Albert W. Turner] was that I had--our family had had some friends, the Crooks [ph.], my mother [Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley] had known Dr. and Mrs. Crooks from her Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] days.  And they really were from Jamaica and would sometimes when they'd come from Jamaica when we lived in Florida, they'd stop at our house and you know then visit other places in the United States.  So I knew their daughter who in the meantime had gone to Earlham College in [Richmond] Indiana and she was here for a work-study program, Interns in Industry [ph.], I think they called it.  And so when I was a junior, no I was a freshman at Lake Forest, they had an intervarsity dance or interfraternity dance at the college.  And the college whole structure-- social structure--was built around the fraternities and sororities and as a black person you know wasn't that, that sororities were not going to invite black people to join.  So all of the people of color were just arbitrarily called independent women (laughter) all the women of color and the fellows were independent men.  And even the wallflowers had in my dormitory had dates for this big innervarsity dance, and I would've been the only person left in the dormitory that night.  And as it happened, this girl from Earlham this family friend said that she; well she was living in--there's a house where a number of college students from different colleges had come for similar programs similar to hers.  And they had a housemother and a housefather, but you know this is where the students were housed.  And she invited me to a square dance, why I was no more interested in square dancing than the man in the moon.  But just to have an excuse to get out of the dormitory was you know exactly what I wanted.  So I went and by the time of the event, she had a date, so she was much more interested in her date than seeing to it that I you know had nice time.  But as I was sitting kind of like a wallflower there in the living room, this hand--tall handsome dark man, tall, dark and handsome man came in and he obviously was one of the students who was there.  And I, saw him walk up the steps and about an hour later, he came back all showered and you know a nice--nice sport shirt and introduced himself.  And we visited that evening and then found we had a lot of mutual interests and continued to see each other.
Speaker 1: Okay. And?
Speaker 2: Married eventually.
Speaker 1: All right, all right so you met him when you were a freshman?
Speaker 2: Yeah I was, March 3rd, 1952 is when I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: You know the date (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Well my, this Aunt Mattie's [ph.] birthday was March 4th, and I you know so I always associated you know the date of March with her birthday.
Speaker 1: This is what get men in trouble they can't remember the dates--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I know (laughter), but then he went back and to--he was from Tuskegee [Alabama] and he went back and, and finished and later worked in a program the Quakers [Religious Society of Friends] had American Friends Service Committee that was kind of like a forerunner to the Peace Corps.  And so it was you know a number of years later when we married, I'd finished college and worked a while.
Speaker 1: So he had already worked with American Friends?
Speaker 2: Un-huh, but we stayed in touch.  And then he conveniently found a job in North Chicago (laughter) and we resumed our acquaintance.
Story_ID: 529192
Speaker 1: So anything else about Lake Forest [College, Lake Forest, Illinois]--did you, were you introduced to anything at Lake Forest that later on would be useful?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had, there was an anthology or contest or competition for poetry, some organization was inviting the poet, poetry from college students around the country.  And then the poems would be, the best poems would be printed in this anthology.  And so I entered the contest and my poem was one that was selected for publication.  And I guess that was the first realization that I had that maybe I really had some talent as a writer.  Before that I'd thought you know there was teachers and parents you know that had just been encouraging.  And but I think that gave me a sense that some more objective critique, critics thought I, I might have some ability.
Speaker 1: What was your poem about?
Speaker 2: Oh it was called 'A Point of Snow.'  I don't remember the poem, I still have a copy of the anthology, but I don't think it was, you know, any great--I don't think it was great by literary standards, but it was some--you know, it had that function in my life.
Story_ID: 529193
Speaker 1: So what did you major--you majored in education [at Lake Forest College, Lake Forest, Illinois], I guess?
Speaker 2: No, in English.
Speaker 1: English, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah I didn't want to be a teacher because I'd seen my father [John Lee Tilley] bring home term papers and you know, and just have that be, it had--responsibility of you know marking all these blue books and not have time to go for a ride or you know do things with our family.  And my mother [Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley] when we were at Shaw [University, Raleigh, North Carolina] had taught--had headed the nursery school.  And whenever I would have a teddy bear or a doll or something that I put down for a few days or you know wasn't playing with on a regular basis, she would assumed that I'd outgrown it or tired of it and she would take it to the nursery school.  So there were things about the teaching profession that I was a little envious (laughter) of or you know resented.  And so being a teacher was what I wanted to avoid, but it was only when my own children [Albert Walter Turner, Jr. and Cyril John Turner] became interested in the beginning stages of learning that I came to realize that teaching was--very good profession.  Something I'd like to know more about--
Story_ID: 529194
Speaker 1: --Okay, so when you graduated [from Lake Forest College, Lake Forest, Illinois] you had this reception, you got married [to Albert W. Turner].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And just set up life and--were you living in North Chicago [Illinois], you said in North Chicago, (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No, I lived at Aunt Mattie's [ph.] house this you know great aunt for a year or so.  I wrote advertising copy for a department store here [in Chicago, Illinois] that was called Charles A. Stevens, it's since gone out of business.  But there, too, I learned things; one of the things we used to do is, well write display ads for clothing and the owner said that every headline should invite the reader to do something.  You know I wrote something about a dress that had a collar kind of like a sailor suit, a square collar.  And I remember writing "Sail through the summer in this nautical notion," you know or something corny like that.  But each headline was supposed to start with a verb that--I remember that you know each of our headline was supposed to start with a verb that invited the reader to do something.  You know that would engage the reader and so then later when I wrote biographies--collective biographies--I remembered that, and so one biography is called 'Take a Walk in Their Shoes' [Glennette Tilley Turner, Elton C. Fax] and another was 'Follow in Their Footsteps' [Glennette Tilley Turner].  And so it just made me realize that nothing you ever do is, is wasted, I would've like to have worked for a publishing company.  But there weren't any hiring at the time I graduated, but even advertising taught me things.  And also I got a chance to do some work with Vince Cullers when he started out, his advertising agency [Vince Cullers Advertising, Chicago, Illinois].  I, you know, I wrote some articles and would drop them off after work, and Al [Albert W. Turner] was working in the [Chicago] Loop, you know, he'd often meet me after work and, you know, and we'd swing by and, you know, drop off these articles for Vince.  And so it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Vince Cullers he--
Speaker 2: A nice experience.
Speaker 1: --a pioneer.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he certainly was.
Story_ID: 529195
Speaker 1: Were you interested in writing about history in those days? Did you--
Speaker 2: I was always interested in history; I don't think it had really occurred to me to write about it.  And it was juast, I enjoyed writing and was interested in history, but I hadn't you know put the two together yet.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is a, so this is in the early '50s [1950s] I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah it was 1955 and probably early '56 [1956], 'cause we [Turner and Albert W. Turner] married in '56 [1956] it was Easter Sunday, April Fool's Day, was also Easter Sunday that year.  So it seemed like a lovely day you know with the flowers and stuff to you know marry on Easter, but since then it seemed kind of silly to have an anniversary on April Fool's Day (laughter).
Speaker 1: It was April first?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so let's see so, so you continued to write and?
Speaker 2: Well I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: With--as a freelancer sort of?
Speaker 2: I, I guess stayed at [Charles A.] Stevens [Chicago, Illinois]--I got pregnant you know within a couple weeks of our marriage and so I worked at Stevens during my pregnancy.  'Cause I realized, I remember once--we lived in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] at 47th [Street] and Lake Park [Avenue].  And I used to take the IC [Illinois Central commuter train] and I just thought I was just so inconspicuously pregnant until one day I had a, a grocery bag that probably had a loaf of bread and a dozen eggs.  I mean not anything heavy and a youngster said, "Ma'am can I carry that bag for you," (laughter) you know and it's like you know realizing that you know like are you gonna carry this heavy bag or a bag that might be too heavy for me being pregnant.  And after our son was born, I, I left Stevens and then it was--well really four years or so, well after our, our second son was born, that I had gotten interested in the beginning stages of learning.  You know like teaching how to read, and well and to just be able to answer my sons' questions.  I just didn't feel as knowledgeable as I'd like to be and so I began taking courses in teacher education.  And I eventually added up to enough to you know pass the Chicago [teaching licensure] exam.
Speaker 1: Okay where did you go to school?
Speaker 2: Crane [Junior College; Malcolm X College, Chicago, Illinois], which I guess was Chicago branch of Chicago Teachers College [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I--you could teach before you had taken the exam, what was it FTB was, I think that's what the full-time basis substitute I think was my status.  And so I taught on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] and Crane was nearby and I you know take courses and you know take the "L" [elevated train] home.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what year did you start teaching?
Speaker 2: I guess 1961.
Story_ID: 529196
Speaker 1: So you started teaching around '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you taught in--
Speaker 2: I taught at--
Speaker 1: Chicago [Illinois] here?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I taught at the [Alice M.] Birney [Elementary] School [Chicago, Illinois] first, and then the [Robert Nathaniel] Dett [Elementary] School [Chicago, Illinois]. When Dett opened, I went to the Dett School.  But our family lived in Maywood [Illinois] at the time and one time my babysitter called to say my son had had a--well an accident and that he fallen into--she'd been taking him for a walk and he fell and you know had a, a gash that and it took me an hour to get home on the, the bus.  So it made me realize that I didn't want to be that far, or I didn't drive at the time.  And so then I inquired about working in Maywood and we, and worked there for three years, then we moved to Wheaton [Illinois] in 1968 soon after Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination and I taught in the Wheaton schools until I ostensibly retired (laughter).
Story_ID: 529197
Speaker 1: Now during this period of time did--when did you find out about the Underground Railroad and start exploring that history?  Was there some other area of history that you explored before you started exploring that?
Speaker 2: No, that was the first really focused study, I--when we moved to Wheaton [Illinois], a new neighbor that was making a kind of orientation, get acquainted talk, inadvertently or just made a chance remark saying that she understood Wheaton had been part of the Underground Railroad.  And I thought, this town must not have any history because everything I'd ever heard about the Underground Railroad had taken place on the East Coast or at least states east of here.  And I thought well she was making this up, but it made me curious and I went to the historical museum and the curator said, "Well there's no book on this subject.  But I think we have a couple books that make mention of anti-slavery or Underground Railroad activity," you know, "near in and around Wheaton."  And so she gave me these few books where I found like a one line reference here or footnote there.  But it made me realize there was some kernel of truth to my neighbor's claim.  And this made me want to know more and more and you know so it started me on a, a lifelong quest.  But then also the fact that there hadn't been anything written, not a full length work. I just thought instead of learning this from my own satisfaction, that I should publish it and that every school kid and citizen should know this chapter, this missing chapter of Illinois and Underground Railroad history.
Story_ID: 529198
Speaker 1: So in the beginning you just started like assembling information [about the Underground Railroad] yourself?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you have any kind of mentor in this process anybody else that knew anything about it that you could--
Speaker 2: Well not really, not at the beginning, I just had you know bits and pieces of information, but I started the research before the bicentennial [America's Bicentennial, 1976] year.  And increasingly there were articles in the paper--well there are articles about my research.  But there are also articles and findings you know that people working on bicentennial books, and their respective counties would come across and they'd mail me you know clippings and say, "We found this journal," or you know "this old newspaper reference."  And so the material began to you know accumulate and I did a little booklet called 'The Underground Railroad in DuPage County, [Illinois]' [Glennette Tilley Turner] since it was where I was doing my main research.  And then when I was going to try to get a master's degree, I, I wanted to take an external degree--well to be honest I wanted you know to increase my standing on the salary scale.  It was found that I could get a degree in history and juvenile literature by writing a book rather than a dissertation that would just sit on a shelf in a library.  And meanwhile I had met [Dr.] Juliet [E. K.] Walker and she served as my--the director of my program, I--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Now where did you go to school?
Speaker 2: Well I took the master's at Goddard College [Plainfield, Vermont] but it was an external degree, it was really a very stringent program.  Because there were things that we needed to--the students needed to accomplish.  And then they had frequent meetings at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] where they'd have a professor come and you know it really was a, a rigorous program.  But at least you could design your own and do an independent study.
Speaker 1: So it's similar to Union Graduate School [Union Institute & University, Cincinnati, Ohio] or something?
Speaker 2: Well I'm not familiar with Union (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And but it really, it was self-directed but it, it was not easy (laughter) and I mean you really earned everything but you're working toward a project or working on a project that had meaning of for you.  But then it was necessary to, you know, to do field testing and, well everything you would've needed to do for any other subject.  But it was, you know, really just focused and meaningful study.
Story_ID: 529199
Speaker 1: Your first book came out, was it in '76 [1976] that you--
Speaker 2: Well in 1971, I wrote a children's book. When we still lived in Chicago [Illinois], I had--when I was writing advertising copy, there was a woman whose name was Corrine Claybrooks who, whose family had lived in Raleigh [North Carolina] and whose parents had taught at Florida Normal [and Industrial College, St. Augustine, Florida; Florida Memorial University, Miami, Florida] when my father [John Lee Tilley] was there.  There just a number of ways our lives had intersected, and I found that when we moved to our first apartment at 47th [Street] and Lake Park [Avenue], she lived in that apartment building.  And she also wrote advertising copy she was at the Goldblatt's [Department] Store on State Street and I was at [Charles A.] Stevens.  And so often we would talk about our mutual interest in writing and by that time, I decided I would like to write a, a children's book.  And so she later moved to that apartment building that's out in the middle of 55th Street, you know that building right there in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: That you have to drive around it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah that you have to drive around, and the editor from Albert Whitman [& Company, Ridge, Illinois] lived there one night when they were both emptying their garbage in the garbage chute.  They were talking about children's literature or and or about writing and this editor said to Corrine, "We have one more--we need another book for our spring list, do you know anyone that would be able to write a children's book?"  And so Corrine said, "Well I know this young woman that," you know, "said that she'd like to write a children's book."  So long story short, I talked to that editor and ended up writing a book 197-, published in 1971, called 'Surprise for Mrs. Burns' [Glennette Tilley Turner].  So that was my first published work with Albert Whitman or and it was with Albert Whitman.
Story_ID: 529200
Speaker 1: But then, I really self-published 'The Underground Railroad in DuPage County, [Illinois]' [Glennette Tilley Turner].  And instead of making it obvious that I had self-published it, I called it Newman Educational Publishing Company.
Speaker 2: Newman.
Speaker 1: Yeah I keep Newman name alive.
Speaker 2: All right, now that was in what year?
Speaker 1: I think 1981.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it wasn't until '81 [1981] that you wrote 'Underground Railroad'--
Speaker 1: That I published it.
Speaker 2: Published it okay.
Speaker 1: There was a bank in Wheaton [Illinois] that had said they'd like to publish it for a bicentennial project, so I'd really done a lot of the work and I'd done a slide presentation and was you know speaking locally.  So my work was pretty well known, but this bank then decided that they'd prefer to use their money in opening a branch bank than publishing my work (laughter) so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You, you didn't have anything out earlier than that, because I--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Not between (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, I remember you selling something at one of the (unclear)--
Speaker 1: I may've, I don't really think so, unless it was 'Surprise for Mrs. Burns' [Glennette Tilley Turner].
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Maybe so, I don't think I had, I well I think I had a earlier version of the 'Underground Railroad' that, like you said, was hand-typed.  As a matter of fact, I was going to have a little surgery and was--my husband [Albert Walter Turner] was driving me to the hospital and I had a little portable typewriter and I was typing and made a, a typo.  I spelled railroad, R-A-O-D or, or you know or reverse letters.  And then later published this pamphlet but I, I think maybe that was 1976 that I or '77 [1977] that I published the pamphlet.  'Cause I had realized that this bank wasn't really going to publish it as a bicentennial book.  And then I maybe it was reissued that was 1981 and that's with a corrected spelling (laughter).
Speaker 2: I thought I remembered seeing it here in Chicago [Illinois] at ASALH [Association for the Study of African American Life & History] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Un-huh.  I probably did.
Speaker 2: It was at the Palmer House [Chicago, Illinois] I think.
Speaker 1: Yes it was.
Speaker 2: I remember you, I, if my memory is correct it might be fuzzier now, but I you know I thought you had a table and had some literature, and that's when I first met you, I believe.
Speaker 1: Isn't that something?  Well I probably had the 'Surprise from Mrs. Burns' and maybe this book that was really in pamphlet form and obviously self-published.  I didn't have to tell anybody that, they probably would've, if I'd said I self-published it, they probably would've said I noticed (laughter).
Story_ID: 529201
Speaker 1: --I think the surprising thing about 'Underground Railroad in DuPage County, [Illinois]' [Glennette Tilley Turner] to some black people who--if they know something about the Chicago [Illinois] area, they wonder, well, there're hardly any black people that live there [DuPage County, Illinois] now, how could there be Underground Railroad activity there?  Which, you know, shows you what a present time orientation period in history you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: You can't imagine you know escaped slaves coming through DuPage County 'cause we can't drive through (laughter) some of us have a hard time you know have a hard time driving through there today.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's not, it's not that bad (laughter) as it used to be.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you know what I mean?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, well but what did you discover in DuPage County, what was going on there back then?
Speaker 2: Oh well there were a number of locations--well I think in, in--well in a number of ways there were a number of black people who put down roots in DuPage, but I think most of the black community that had been there some years before we moved had come when the railroad was built.  When the Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad was built, and maybe dated to about 1906, but passenger, I think, was kind of the operative word to--well to some extent.  Wheaton College [Wheaton, Illinois] takes pride in being so involved in the Underground Railroad that they said it wasn't underground you know 'cause it was, you know, pretty open secret.  But the Graue Mill in Oak Brook [Illinois] was a, a station on the Underground Railroad and--well there a number of, of locations.  There's a home in Lombard [Illinois], Sheldon Peck, who was kind of the town founder postmaster you know and the whole nine yards.  His home was believed to be part of the Underground Railroad.  Sheldon Peck was an artist primitive art kind of like Grandma Moses [Anna Mary Robertson Moses] or kind of you know that kind of two-dimensional looking portraits, and similar to her in that way.  But he had a, a studio in St. Louis [Missouri] and would come along that probably Ogden what later became Ogden Avenue and would paint portraits of farmers and their wives.  And so probably also transported people who were escaping from St. Louis area and so.  And then there's so many natural landscapes, I think like along the DuPage River there were locations where trees and rocks and things you know was not only structures, architectural structures, but also natural landscapes were important.
Speaker 1: For markers and that sort of thing to mark the trail?
Speaker 2: Well yeah, but also as hiding places you know just sheltering places that a, a person--not everyone I, I learned who had escaped on the Underground Railroad was assisted at all or, or certainly not for the whole length of the trip.  Well one of the things I have loved about the story of Illinois is that Chicago [Illinois] was so, not only the terminus at most Illinois Underground Railroad roots, but there was wonderful interracial cooperation of, of Underground Railroad workers.  I think so often the story of the Underground Railroad represents black people as the passengers almost in a sense of pawns.  And the abolitionist as being only white, but in Chicago, there were black and white people of different denominations, different types of work, different income brackets who just really, you know, worked so cooperatively.  And also as far as the--in quotes "passengers," I prefer to say freedom seekers, they had to observe the best time to escape and you know and plan and strike for the unknown and successfully reach Illinois.  Where you know crossing the mighty Mississippi, since most had come from enslavement in Missouri, you know where they may or may not have been assisted by abolitionists or Underground Railroad workers.  So I think a lot of credit needs to, you know, go there also.
Story_ID: 529202
Speaker 1: Yeah Chicago [Illinois], from what I've read, was a lot more progressive in the 19th century than it became later on. You know, we think of Chicago these days as kind of a conservative Democratic city. I mean, its Democratic politics, but there's kind of a conservative and separate you know separation, there's a lot of separation in Chicago it's been called one of the most segregated cities in the United States and that sort of thing.  But in those 19th century before the population really grew, it was liberals or (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah oh it really just I think more than any other major city that I'm aware of.  Now Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] may have had comparable or you know be the next to Chicago I would think since I'd be bias and favor Chicago.  But you know just really the just the harmonious working together and there were a number of black barbers and tailors at some of the downtown hotels.  And they you know facilitate you know the connecting people who had--freedom seekers with Underground Railroad agents.  And people like John Jones and, and Mary Richards--his wife Mary Richardson Jones and people at Quinn Chapel [AME Church, Chicago, Illinois]--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Yeah black tailors here, he was a prosperous tailor--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Who lived in what's now--
Speaker 2: I'm so pleased the City of Chicago recently acknowledge his home as a, a site, although the, the physical building doesn't still stand, I understand there's a marker indicating where it was and you know what significant work he did.  But then it was not only limited to blacks right where the Wishbone Restaurant [Chicago, Illinois] stands or in that area on Morgan [Street] near, Morgan and Randolph [Street].  There was a white pharmacist, Philo Carpenter, who had, and Carpenter Street I imagine Chicago's name for him, but he was very involved.  And he started, he broke with the Presbyterian Church and started the First Baptist Congregational Church [Chicago, Illinois] which was, and evidently the balcony was used as a hiding place.  There was a doctor who was a medical doctor but he was also the president of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, Dr. C. V. Dyer [Charles V. Dyer], who was very involved in the Underground Railroad.  And then Zebina Eastman was the editor of the newspaper called the Western Citizen which was to this area what the, what Garrison's [William Lloyd Garrison] paper was in Boston [Massachusetts], what The Liberator was.  And--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: The Western Citizen?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And there's a black man who worked with Zebina Eastman who had been a newspaper or who had been a, a writer, Henry O. Wagoner.  I think he's G-G-O-N-E-R, I think it's--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: I've heard of him--
Speaker 2: Un-huh, but it--and then there was a white lumberyard owner who lived in Lake Forest [Illinois], Sylvester Lynn [ph.] and boats that were used to bring lumber from the north woods or to Chicago and ostensibly were to go back empty were tran- provided transport often for people who were escaping.  Either to the north woods where there wouldn't be such a concentration of slave catchers--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: In Upper Peninsula in Michigan?
Speaker 2: Yeah or then there was Washington Island [Wisconsin] a, a place they could transfer to the boat that would take them around the Upper Peninsula.  And then either go to the Canadian Shore or get close enough that if the cap, sea captain in quotes discovered them and, you know, and say get off this boat at once, you know, but of course it was like Br'er Rabbit. Oh please don't send me to the Canadian shore (laughter) and steady swimmin'.
Story_ID: 529203
Speaker 1: So was Chicago [Illinois] for most freedom seekers, was Chicago the end result, I mean the terminus or would they want to go on to Canada?
Speaker 2: Well it was the terminus until the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act; you know after that, it became so dangerous that the entire congregation of some black churches you know just migrated to Canada.  They just felt that the American law no longer protected them to the extent the Canadian law did.  But prior to that, there was a viable black community, the Quinn Chapel [AME Church, Chicago, Illinois] had an organization called the Liberty Association and men belonging to that stood as night watchmen on the corners while their residents slept.  So then if they saw any sign of slave catchers or you know what they thought might be trouble coming into town, they'd alert the sleeping residents.
Speaker 1: Now where we are right now 1900 South Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], we're a stone's throw from Quinn Chapel, it's just three blocks from here.  This area at one time, according to the oldest residents that we interviewed was known as the Black Belt [of Chicago] and black folks lived near a corridor in this--in the teens in Chicago from I guess from I don't know from maybe Roosevelt Road all the way--
Speaker 2: Quinn Chapel has been in a number of locations and where the Monadnock Building [Chicago, Illinois] stands now is where Quinn Chapel was during that period.
Speaker 1: So that's Jackson [Boulevard] and Dearborn [Street].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What's now Jackson and Dearborn where, where the mighty Monadnock Building stands--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah well actually--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Which is really a work of art.
Speaker 2: Oh, it is, it is.
Speaker 1: So Quinn Chapel was there?
Speaker 2: Right and then I--there were individual members of Quinn Chapel who--or I mean there were periods where Quinn met in homes and were you know it was a different locations, but that is believed to be where (unclear).  And there were four women called the Big Four, I've never been able to, I don't think anybody else know quite who all four of those women were.  And at one time I had suspected that possibly they were themselves fugitives and had not wanted their names known.  But since then, a number of scholars have you know feel that they figured out who some of the women were.  But that too was you know Quinn Chapel-related, but what happened is during the [Great] Chicago Fire, so much of that downtown area was burned.  And so I think that led to a lot of the, you know, the relocation and--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --displacement.
Story_ID: 529204
Speaker 1: When did Quinn Chapel [AME Church, Chicago, Illinois] move from Monadnock [Building, Chicago, Illinois], well was it after the [Chicago] Fire (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know the year.
Speaker 1: --from Jackson [Boulevard] and Dearborn [Street]?
Speaker 2: I think so, you just really have to check with the--
Speaker 1: So the [1870s] maybe when it moved--
Speaker 2: I really don't know, I know the present location is not the original location, but as far knowing the years, I, you know, really don't--
Speaker 1: Was that, was the present location which is I guess 23rd [Street] and Wabash [Avenue] or so--
Speaker 2: Wabash, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah--was that, was that the, an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church they built from the ground up or was there another church there?
Speaker 2: I think so some years ago, a, a professor at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] asked me to develop and conduct a Underground Railroad tour of the Chicago [Illinois] area for some African exchange students.  And we went to Quinn Chapel and the minister was saying that the architect for Quinn--they in recent years learned that the architect for Quinn Chapel was a black man, but that Chicago would not let him register his work in his own name.  So he had someone else [Henry F. Starbuck] register the work, but that they've since learned that it, it was a black architect who actually did the work.  But they feel that the way the arches or, are pointed or you know pointed up arches rather than rounded arches, is an example of how that moresian [ph.] influence was carried through. And you know I, I just thought that was some--which makes me feel that the church was expressly built for this, for Quinn.
Speaker 1: For the Quinn Church.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: I think Quinn Chapel named for Paul (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: [Bishop William] Paul Quinn, who went around--now there Ann Meecher [ph.] was just so, such a leader in Underground Railroad work the, the establishment of churches went hand and hand with literacy and you know and Underground Railroad work.
Speaker 1: I'm tryna think of who the four Horsemen of the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church are, I mean Paul Quinn's one, [Bishop] Richard [Allen] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And Absalom Jones [sic.] and (simultaneous --
Speaker 1: Is he--he stayed an Episcopalian, though.
Speaker 2: Well I was thinking that he was, I, I'm not A.M.E. so I, I don't know but I've been to Mother Bethel [A.M.E. Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he stayed Episcopalian, but. Yeah, Richard Allen would definitely have to be one (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And Paul Quinn's the other I don't know if [Bishop Henry McNeal] Turner, Bishop Turner was the third, I don't know but there four of them--figures.
Speaker 2: Well something that's interested me you know that's related to the A.M.E. Church and Quinn in particular, is that Abraham [Thompson] Hall [Jr.] was one of the early ministers of Quinn.  And was involved in the Underground Railroad and you know was either his grandson or his great-grandson who invented so many--had so many inventions like food preservation and, and was used extensively by the [U.S.] military.  And well by food producers--Lloyd Augustus Hall, I think is his name--in their family there are a number of names that are repeated.  And I think--but not only that, but when he, when Abraham Hall left Quinn, he went and established St. James AME Church in Elgin [Illinois].  When Richard DeBaptiste who had been the minister, a founding minister, of Olivet Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois], left Olivet, he went and established, or was one of the early ministers at least at Second Baptist [Church of Elgin] in Elgin.  He just, I just don't know what it was about Elgin that attracted both those men that had been involved in the Underground Railroad here.
Story_ID: 529205
Speaker 1: I think the last thing we mentioned was Richard DeBaptiste who is a--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, oh, okay 'cause--
Speaker 1: Is he related to George DeBaptiste?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're brothers.
Speaker 1: His brother, okay. He's the brother of George DeBaptiste and he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Richard DeBaptiste settled in Elgin [Illinois] you said.
Speaker 2: Well he was first at Olivet [Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay he was pastor at Olivet.
Speaker 2: And, and reportedly he you know (unclear)--he would loan his freedom papers to people who were escaping, going to Detroit and they would buy them off of George and they'd get recycled.  Now isn't that risk, I mean.
Speaker 1: Now his brother George DeBaptiste for those who are listening to this and don't know the Underground Railroad inner circle (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: George DeBaptiste is a--was a ferry boat captain or a boat captain, black who operated out of Detroit and Sandusky [Ohio].  He plowed from Sandusky to Detroit and then over to Chatham [Ontario, Canada] you know.
Speaker 2: Well now I didn't know about the Sandusky part I knew he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah he'd pick up Underground Railroad passengers in Sandusky take them to Detroit and over to Chatham.
Speaker 2: Isn't that something?  I knew he would go across to, he'd go across the Detroit River, 'cause he worked with William Lambert of Second Baptist [Church, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I hadn't realized that he had applied the waters between Sandusky and, and Detroit.  But he and Lambert had a, a wonderful operation going there; they said they even muffled the sounds of the horses--the hooves of the horses on the cobblestone street as they transported 'em from Second Baptist and Detroit to the bank--the waterfront.
Speaker 1: Right, so Richard DeBaptiste was George DeBaptiste's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Brother.
Speaker 1: Brother.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You know there's a--George DeBaptiste according to friends of mine in Detroit, who researched him say that he asserted several times that he was a distant, I mean he was a direct descendant of John Baptiste Point du Sable.
Speaker 2: I've heard that, I didn't know he claimed it but I've heard speculation that he was somehow related.
Speaker 1: And he was I guess he would've be considered part of black middle class in those days you know of course he operated a boat and he was a barber to [President] William Henry Harrison.
Speaker 2: Oh is that right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, George DeBaptiste was the barber for Harrison who--
Speaker 2: I didn't know that, but that's why it's so good to you know to learn the different details of different (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I didn't know about Richard DeBaptiste.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, about the you know the, just to where the connecting links between where one person's research ends you know this is thrilling to have these aha moments.  You know 'cause I admired George, well and Richard and their work but hadn't known you know these added dimensions of their work.
Speaker 1: So Richard went along, would get somebody's free papers they would use them to escape--
Speaker 2: Reportedly.
Speaker 1: He'd give them to George on the other hand, and George would mail them back to Richard.
Speaker 2: Or I guess--mail 'em or send them back some kind of way, yeah.
Speaker 1: That is something.
Speaker 2: Isn't that? I mean just courage, trust--
Story_ID: 529206
Speaker 1: Now when did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Dedication.
Speaker 1: Speaking of Detroit [Michigan] and Chicago [Illinois], now when did--was it after the Fugitive Slave Law that what is now the trail, which is now I-94 [Interstate 94] become like this Underground Railroad highway, sort of, with--
Speaker 2: Well it really that road begins and right, it's called Milan [Ohio], I'm not--it's, it's spelled M-I-L-A-N, but I think, I'm not sure there's a pronunciation Milan or someway, it's an old Indian [Native American] trail going to Detroit.  You know that was later paved over and became highway, so you know to give that historical perspective.  But it was a, a route--in one of the books I did, 'Running for Our Lives' [Glennette Tilley Turner], the characters in the book escape from slavery in Missouri with their parents, the kids in the book.  And they have all these experiences of you know getting across Missouri and hiding in a cave and crossing the river and all.  And then there was a white lumberyard owner named Van Duren [ph.] in Quincy [Illinois], in Quincy.  But I knew if it was gonna be a children's book, I had to get the parents out of the picture you know and let the focus shift to the kids.  So the abolitionists in Quincy put the parents on a train, a boxcar with the thought they'll be reunited in Detroit.  And then the kids make their way through Illinois, but by the time they, well they visit John Jones and he's--has a visit from Allan Pinkerton who was also a Chicago area abolitionist.  But they, then John Jones after the kids have wintered over to Allan Pinkerton's house in Dundee [Illinois], they take a train, well the Michigan Central [Railroad] really.  But by that time I have them have all these harrowing escapes as they came to Illinois so and by that time a little boy has learned to read.  So he looks at a crack in the boxcar and reads the names of all these towns in Michigan you know as they pass through so the reader you know knows that they've passed these towns along that same route leading to Detroit.  And then in Detroit they're met by, I think they're met by George DeBaptiste and then taken to Second Baptist [Church, Detroit, Michigan] where they meet William Lambert. And--it's been so long since I you know did the book (laughter) I had to stop and think on some of it.
Speaker 1: Well, that's a wonderful kind of story.  There's so much history in the Midwest.
Speaker 2: Um-hm and it's been overlooked.
Speaker 1: Heroic history, too, of you know there's a Crosswhite Affair in Marshall, Michigan that accumulated and rose up against slave catchers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right and they branded with an SS on it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the man who--with the branded hand, I mean all these, all these stories.  Cassopolis, Michigan, Bear Cave, I was talking about the other day, and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Story_ID: 529207
Speaker 1: You've written a book on the Underground Railroad in Illinois ['The Underground Railroad in Illinois,' Glennette Tilley Turner].
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Only places in Illinois.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. That is the compilation of all information.  But I just, you know, I did as a nonfiction work and really it's not limited to children.  I think of it like a PBS special where any aged reader that's interested in the subject can enjoy it or learn from it.  You know the more prior knowledge (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That's unlike most of your works have been centered on children.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, that's right, but this I thought you know would really have meaning; the more prior knowledge the reader has then you know the more he or she would get out of it.  But even a--well say a fourth grader could get an introduction to the Illinois Underground Railroad, you know, look at the maps and pictures, and learn from that--
Story_ID: 529208
Speaker 1: You know there are so many groundbreaking works about African American history that are self-published and the tradition goes way back to the 19th century when people like Hosea Easton or Martin Delany or even [Frederick] Douglass and William Wells Brown, they would publish--some of them would publish their own works, and sometimes they could find a publisher, but, but there's a self-publishing tradition that goes way back (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It sure is it's really nice to be a part of that continuum.
Speaker 1: Yeah 20th century of J. A. Rogers [Joel Augustus Rogers], who published so many works himself, I don't know how he did it.
Speaker 2: I don't either.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet Rogers?
Speaker 2: No, but I remember Dr. John G. Jackson who we both admire was talking about Rogers and you know and his memories of, or you know comments that Rogers made about times he was in Ethiopia.  That he just thought he'd found paradise and he also introduced Harry Dean's--sea Captain Harry [Foster] Dean to open court with the thought that they might have published his work.  They didn't but you know there were just a number of references to J. A. Rogers, so.
Speaker 1: Right Harry Dean wrote '[The] Pedro Gorino[: The Adventures of a Negro Sea-Captain in Africa and on the Seven Seas in His Attempts to Found an Ethiopian Empire'] I think it was co-authored with a man [Thomas Sterling North] from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Sterling, no (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Sterling, yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Sterling North wasn't it?
Speaker 1: Sterling North, exactly.
Speaker 2: Who later went on to do a lot of writing on his own.
Speaker 1: Right, he wrote a children's book that I read when I was a kid about a sled dog (laughter) but you know now Sterling North was at University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 2: And then both, you know J. A. Rogers and Dr. Jackson, you know just really, well did the impossible as far, I mean like Dr. Jackson to have his books used as textbooks and at the college level.  Where he probably wouldn't have been able to matriculate you know 'cause his, with his own academic background.  You know he didn't have the, the paperwork to indicate his level of expertise.
Speaker 1: I think he, he may have had a degree from City Colleges of New York [New York, New York], I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Eventually.
Speaker 1: Associate's degree, I think.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Jackson, yeah he eventually taught Huey [ph.]. He was an instructor at Northeastern [University, Boston, Massachusetts] here for about five, six years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he enjoyed that too. He was an interesting person.
Story_ID: 529209
Speaker 1: There're some other people that you've met along--you're a friend of [HistoryMaker] Charles Blockson's, too, right, who we've interviewed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he headed the Underground Railroad advisory committee when I served on the National Parks Service [NPS] advisory committee (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now how were you chosen to be on that, I mean how did, how does word get out that somebody knows about these things?
Speaker 2: Well Senator [Paul] Simon had written a legislation for the [U.S.] Senate bill at you know advising--mandating or I don't know the term, but you know directing the National Parks Service to study all the existing vestiges--remaining information on the Underground Railroad and you know and to focus on this important but overlooked period of American history.  Not overlooked completely, but he knew there was so much more to be learned than about Harriet Tubman's story.  And because Simon was an independent scholar, I think he had respect for my work as an independent scholar.  I was teaching second grade at the time, and you know so really wasn't--usually you wouldn't call the second grade teacher to be an advisor on National Parks Service.  But because he you know knew of and respected my work he recommended me, and so did ASALH [Association for the Study of African American Life & History].  I think the recommendations you know from both Simon's office and the ASALH board you know really probably were you know convincing that I would merit a place.  But Blockson had written 'The Underground Railroad' [Charles L. Blockson] book prior to that.  And it had, had written that cover article for National Geographic about the Underground Railroad, and he was chosen our chairman.
Speaker 1: Okay, in the 19th century there was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Committee.
Speaker 1: --a book written by William Still from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] who was a great organizer, around the country.
Speaker 2: He certainly was and he hid, well as you know, he was with a--he was a black Quaker that worked the vigilance committee and would interview people who passed through Philadelphia as they were making their escapes.  But get information so that if later other family members came he could tell them where the original group was planning to settle in Canada.  You know with the hope of being reunited and--or Canada or northern states, and he wrote this book.  But Charles Blockson said he hid his manuscript in the graveyard you know under an old tombstone, I guess, I don't know if it was a tombstone that had fallen over or someway he hid it in the graveyard, feeling it would be less likely to be discovered, you know, before he was ready to publish it.
Story_ID: 529210
Speaker 1: I think it's--[HistoryMaker Charles] Blockson told of one of his ancestors actually, was one of those who came through William Still.
Speaker 2: Is that right? I didn't know that.  I knew he had an--his family had an Underground Railroad story, I'd read an article some years ago.  'Cause he's from what, Norristown?
Speaker 1: Norristown, Pennsylvania, right.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  But I hadn't remembered the details of that.
Speaker 1: Yeah they said that inspired him to really get involved that you know when he saw his, his ancestors' name in Still's book ['The Underground Railroad Records']; it just made it real to him, you know.  It's not just something that you read about, that it actually happened to somebody like you.
Speaker 2: And somebody that's related to you, that just really makes someone would read.  Well that's what I felt, too, about the importance of the Illinois story, the story of the Midwest that I think before, well include people as old as I am and, you know, and, and students since then.  They've admired Harriet Tubman but kind of looked out you know thinking that that's history from the East Coast.  That's somebody else's history, but just to know that along the highways and waterways and railroads that we traverse today, that so much of this history happened.  And, and Illinois played such a pivotal role, although there weren't numerically as many Underground Railroad passengers here as in a state like Ohio or Pennsylvania.  Illinois was pivotal if you think that the Lincoln-Douglas [Abraham Lincoln-Stephen Douglas] debates largely were based on whether there should be an extension of slavery.  But slavery you know was kind a key word there, then the Dred Scott Decision [Dred Scott v. Sandford, 1857] grew out of the fact that Dred Scott had been--although he was enslaved, or while he was enslaved he was brought to the free, (laughter) the free State of Illinois.  And he argued that he should become a free man and Lyman Trumbull wrote the third, authored the Thirteenth Amendment--Senator Lyman Trumbull.  And then the Lovejoys were here, Elijah [Parish Lovejoy] and his printing press and his assassination.  And then where his brother Owen [Lovejoy] to follow and continue the work, you know there just--Illinois I just really feel played a role that needed to be known.  And for students here to be able to you know kind of take pride in and you know feel that our state had a lot to do, and this whole region with the a very noble chapter of American history.
Speaker 1: Now there's been probably this aspect of our history like a lot of other aspects are subject to a lot of revisionist.  In fact black historians from the beginning have been called revisionists before putting forth that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: What they said if you don't have a history, you create one or invent one, or something, I mean it wasn't that tag line--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --that some critics had made.  You know when, and really the fact that black people were denied the opportunity to learn to read and write.  Or access to the press in many cases a lot of--there, there in some cases, there was not documentation.  But now I think it's been really conclusively proved that there, that although it may not had been written, it's where histories of, of whites there you know, the history certainly happened and there've been, there's other supported evidence.
Story_ID: 529211
Speaker 1: There's also been a feeling on the part of white historians that are of--the more progressive white historians like Philip [S.] Foner and others that feel that white progressives don't get any credit in history.  It's,--they're considered radical or crazy, you know, in history.  Where most Americans see [President Abraham] Lincoln as the freer of the slaves, and they don't know anything about [Senator] Lyman Trumbull or [Justice] Salman P. Chase.
Speaker 2: I mean in Illinois, I mean here he was an Illinois senator and you could go through Illinois--college and, you know go to school from first through college and never hear a word about Lyman Trumbull.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Or and Salmon P. Chase at, at Ohio.
Speaker 1: And yet think that Lincoln was always had on his mind he's gonna free the slaves and was great emancipator, and he really was a middle of the roader who you know in those days (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He was a pragmatic politician.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Very pragmatic.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett's written about that misconception of him as a, as a, so he puts him in a, in a center as being for the right thing.  And the other people that were really abolitionists are considered crazy, radical Republicans on the other side you know; they don't get the, get the credit.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and well like Owen Lovejoy, for example, knew Lincoln and, and operated in Underground Railroad station in Princeton [New Jersey] and went, and later went to the U.S. Congress and worked to try to get slavery ended in Washington, D.C.  There were a lot of people who were really disappointed that Lincoln didn't act sooner or more across the board you know didn't, that the emancipation, the timing and details of the Emancipation Proclamation they felt were not as extensive as they should've been.
Story_ID: 529212
Speaker 1: This--all this leads to another question, do you think that black people involved with Underground Railroad have gotten their--have received their due in terms of--
Speaker 2: No, but I think there are black and white historians that now are giving credit where credit is due.  But I think in the past--years ago, remember Timbuktu Bookstore here on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], there was--or, or one, one time I had gone on a tour there and I think it was Chester Himes was telling this story of the, a father and a lion and--or, or you know a man and a lion and the father told his son about how the man went into the forest and tracked the lion down and shot the lion.  And the little boy said, "Daddy, the lion is the king of the jungle and he's strong and he's supposed to be smart," and everything.  "How come he didn't sometimes win," and the father said, "Well when the lion writes his story, the truth will be told."  And I just really, well the guy that was telling this story made the point that really it's essential for the actors in this, for all the actors in the story to have a chance to tell their story.
Story_ID: 529213
Speaker 1: What are you working on now?
Speaker 2: Well I reissued the 'Running for Our Lives' [Glennette Tilley Turner] and I'd like to--I'm working on, I've been interested in real-life, well explorers or adventurers--black people.  Well I've just really always wanted to learn about lesser known people who did extraordinary things.  And so I, I'd like to--I don't want to tell you, is what I'm trying to say (laughter) that--I'm writing a, a story of a person who did something very notable and, an, an explorer.
Speaker 1: Well we'll know sooner--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you'll know, yeah, yeah, stay tuned (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well you know they say it's kind of like a, I feel it's kind of as some other writers do it's kind of like a pressure cooker.  You know like if you store up your ideas and you're and you know and get 'em under pressure where they're really cooking, you know if you open the pressure cooker that it loses something.  I wasn't trying to say none of your business at all.
Speaker 1: I know what you mean, it's true though. If you--
Speaker 2: You just lose (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Sometimes you, the more people you tell the urge to tell it diminishes.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It's like letting steam out a pressure cooker.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm. So.
Speaker 1: If you have a great idea that's boiling, you should just keep it boiling maybe until you tell it in a form that you really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --think that's it gonna do the most good in.
Speaker 2: Right, well forgive me for feeling that way.
Speaker 1: No, that all right.  I understand, I understand.  You, you're productive, when you write and you getting more work out to children, 'Take a Walk in Their Shoes' [Glennette Tilley Turner] you have like a series of plays actually for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah they're short biographies followed by, and it's in its eleventh printing, so, even the paperbacks in its eleventh printing and it went through some hardcover editions.
Speaker 1: Illustrated by Elton C. Fax (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Fax, sure was.
Speaker 1: And you tracked him down got him involved (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well I didn't no, the editor did, I never got to meet him in-person, because you know at least the, the time that that was published.  Editors like to talk with the illustrator and the author, but they didn't want the two to meet.  I think they felt that authors might try to influence; you know impose their vision of what the art should look like on the illustrator.  Or that's what they argued; I think the editors just kind of like to be you know in charge.  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Make sure they don't get together (laughter)--
Speaker 2: So it was after the book was published and Elton was visiting some friends in Baltimore [Maryland], and my mom [Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley] and I were visiting some friends in Baltimore that knew you know the friends of Elton were visiting.  So they arranged for me to phone him, but he was leaving the next morning or some kind of way, or it was just a near-miss and you know and he just felt like he, he said, "I'm old, but I," you know, "could still command a pencil and paper."  And so I think he had thought he would live longer and I was gonna do 'Follow in Their Footsteps' [Glennette Tilley Turner] as a sequel to 'Take a Walk in Their Shoes' so you know I just look forward to meeting him and working with him on the next book.  But then he up and died, so I never had a chance to meet him in person.

Speaker 1: Is there one story out of all of the stories you've heard from the Underground Railroad and from black history in general that you think is the most significant one? I mean, or just really stands out as a most remarkable one?
Speaker 2: There are just are so many that are remarkable in so many ways, I just think that whole--the courage and commitment and resourcefulness of everyone involved.  You know are just the--traits that that stand out, but there just are so many cases.  I love the story of Harry--of Henry "Box" Brown and how he escaped and, and then arriving in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and shook with the hand of William Still and others you know.  When they, they thought he had not survived the trip and he hopped out of the box and he--but I had an opportunity to interview the last living relative of Harriet Tubman's and her--the person's name was Alice Brickler and she was Harriet Tubman's great-niece.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that, Alice--
Speaker 2: Brickler, B-R-I-C-K-L-E-R, and she told some stories of Harriet Tubman that were, well she told of her experience and how she happened to know Harriet Tubman.  But also some stories that showed a softer side of, of Harriet Tubman, and I just feel that she you know is just in a class by herself.  And so I would, if I had to choose my number one Underground Railroad character, it certainly without a doubt would be Harriet Tubman.  But there were just so many ingenious and wonderful things that were done.  I think what also stands out is that so many of the qualities of people working together and all are timeless and universal.  And I think there's some historic precedent where people of all races and economic and denominational identifications, you know have, have not let these be boundaries or dividing areas.  But they've transcended what might have been limiting boundaries, you know, and have really just done the noble thing.  And I think they did it once and we can do it again.
Story_ID: 529215
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Oh, I just, I, well I just there just are so many. I just really hope that, well the nation can rise up to its potential.  And also that black, the historian importance of the role of, of black people and the formation and building of this country will be acknowledged.  And that the education systems will tell this story to every child.  And then of course, I believe, like my grandfather did in--the power of voting.  But I just hope that the world will be, that the country will rise to its full potential and black people can realize their full potential.  And then on the international stage, that you know that there will just be the, the recognition of, you know, the merit and value of all human life, including that of persons of color.

Speaker 1: What did your parents [Phyllis Geraldine Jones Tilley and John Lee Tilley] think about your work?
Speaker 2: Oh they were very supportive of it; my mom underwrote the publication of that DuPage County [Illinois], that first version of the DuPage County book ['The Underground Railroad in DuPage County, Illinois,' Glennette Tilley Turner].  My dad was so pleased; he died shortly after 'Surprise for Mrs. Burns' [Glennette Tilley Turner] was published.  And, you know, so he got to see me published, or see me become a published author, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, speaking of your father, he was involved in--you were telling me some, some kind of a conflict with [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] over, over that, that position he held [executive director] with SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Which was in, I guess you described it as usurping a spot that Ella [Josephine] Baker (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Probably should've had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah I, I think that unbeknownst to daddy that Ella Baker should have had that job, or that that was really her concept.  And so I, I think she probably gave him, reminded him of that at times when Dr. King wasn't in the office.
Speaker 1: And from what you said, your father had the integrity to understand that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I felt he did.
Speaker 1: And it was felt also that Ella Baker as a result of not being able to do what she wanted to do at SCLC, helped form SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] as a result.
Speaker 2: That's something; it was a blessing in disguise.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's interesting so anyway that's something, so your father's papers, his correspondence with Dr. King--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --as, as when he resigned that position are now in the King papers [at The Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia], right?
Speaker 2: They will be published in the King papers ['The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr., Vol. I - VII,' ed. Clayborne Carson], daddy's papers are at the Amistad Research Library [Amistad Research Center] at Loyola [sic. Tulane University] in New Orleans [Louisiana] and then they--Dr. King's letter to daddy was in another collection.  But they, you know, were gonna--are gonna print both of them so they have the correspondence.

Speaker 1: What would you consider at this point, I guess when you look, well when you look back on everything you've done, would you do anything differently?
Speaker 2: No, I just think of you know that--remember [HistoryMaker Holmes] "Daddy-O" Daylie used to play the desdorada [ph.] on his jazz radio show and it talks about the universe's unfolding as it should?  I really think it, it does or it has for me, you know, it's even things that seem to be going in a direction other than what I wanted.  For example, when I wasn't able to get a job with a publishing house after college [Lake Forest College, Lake Forest, Illinois] and ended up doing advertising [in Chicago, Illinois].  I learned things there that later I was able to apply and it just seems there've been so many things that have occurred that maybe seem like a set-back or taking me a direction other than what I would have opted to do.  But then, you know, it led to something else--either opened a new door or gave me some new insights.  So I don't have any regrets, I'm very pleased and just eager to see what life holds in the future.

Speaker 1: At this point, when you look back at what you've done, what would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I guess to really try to convey the joy of being a lifelong learner and also to know one's own history.  I just really believe you have to know who you are before you can relate meaningfully to anyone else.  And you know to have a sense of, as [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] said, your somebodiness and that's in order to respect and, and appreciate someone else's somebodiness.  And so in my writing, I've tried to learn stories that made, or, or history I don't mean stories in the sense of fiction.  But really history that may not be generally known, and to convey that to young readers, particularly.  And so that they grow up, shored up and strengthened--nurtured by this knowledge, and I'll continue to try to do that.
Story_ID: 529219
Speaker 1: The last question is similar to legacy, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a person who is a people-person and a person who loves knowledge and loves family and wanted to do good in the world.  Or, or you know to, to make, well to make life good for everyone, you know, to just--I'm tongue-tied (laughter) but that idea.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.

Speaker 1: This is a picture of my parents, Phyllis [Geraldine Jones Tilley] and John [Lee] Tilley taken at our home probably 1969 at the dinner table.
Speaker 2: All right, go ahead.
Speaker 1: This is a school picture of me probably in the late '70s [1970s] when I was teaching second grade--first and second grade.
Speaker 2: All right go ahead.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my mother, Phyllis Jones Tilley, it was taken after she moved to, after she was widowed and moved to a senior citizen apartment building in Elgin [Illinois], probably in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: All go ahead.
Speaker 1: This is a picture I took with Studs Terkel shortly after I had received the Studs Terkel Award. He and I were at a dinner for Printer's Row Book Fair [Printer's Row Lit Fest, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: That one, go ahead. You can talk now.
Speaker 1: This is a picture I took with [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson, we were both speakers for 100 Black Men of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], and afterwards, we posed for pictures.
Speaker 2: Okay, go.
Speaker 1: The picture (unclear)--the previous picture was taken in 2003, at DuSable Museum [of African American History, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Anytime you're ready.
Speaker 1: This is a picture that was taken when I was a toddler, so it probably was about 1934.  And there's an old T-Model Ford [Ford Model T] in the background, if you look closely.  It was probably taken in Raleigh, North Carolina.
Speaker 2: Okay, now we're moving to the bottom photo.
Speaker 1: This picture was taken when I was about three years old and our family was living at Shaw University--on the Shaw University campus in Raleigh, North Carolina.
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead when you're ready.
Speaker 1: This is a book ['Surprise for Mrs. Burns,' Glennette Tilley Turner] I published in 1971, it was the first book I ever published, and it was especially meaningful because it was shortly before my father died.  And since he encouraged me to write, I was very pleased that the got to see this.
Speaker 2: Go ahead when you're ready.
Speaker 1: This book was published in 1989, 'Take a Walk in Their Shoes' [Glennette Tilley Turner] it was illustrated by Elton [C.] Fax, and is now in its eleventh printing in paper and it had several printings in hardcover.
Speaker 2: Go ahead with this one.
Speaker 1: This is a book ['Running for Our Lives,' Glennette Tilley Turner] that is based on my Underground Railroad research, Underground Railroad, about the Underground Railroad in Illinois and elsewhere in the Midwest.  It's a story of a family that escapes from slavery, and it was printed in paper many years after its original printing in 1994.
Speaker 2: Anytime you're ready.
Speaker 1: Much of my research has been on the Underground Railroad in Illinois; I'm kind of discovering details of that previously little known story.  And this book ['The Underground Railroad in Illinois,' Glennette Tilley Turner] is a composite of my findings, it was published in 2001.  I guess I should've said that was a collective biography with skits, but I guess it doesn't really matter.
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me when I was the editor of the Lake Forest College [Lake Forest, Illinois] yearbook in 1955.  It was a, a very meaningful experience because it gave me the idea that of how a book was put together and has since been very useful information.
Speaker 2: This is my college graduation picture; the picture that appeared on the senior pages in the yearbook, 1955.
