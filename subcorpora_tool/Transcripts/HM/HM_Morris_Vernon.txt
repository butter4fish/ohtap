Speaker 1: Alright.  My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm the interviewer today with the HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, can you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My full name is Vernon Robinson Morris.  That's V-E-R-N-O-N, R-O-B-I-N-S-O-N, and Morris, M-O-R-R-I-S.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story behind your name?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess a little bit of a story.  Vernon comes from the original name of my mother.  She was originally named Laverne.  She got her name legally changed, over the protests of her mother.  And--
Speaker 1: She didn't like Laverne?
Speaker 2: She did not like the name Laverne.  And I don't know the origin of Laverne, but my mother sort of emancipated herself from her mother.  And my grand, great-grandmother, took custody of her and then she changed her name to Gloria.  But my name, Vernon, came from her sort of making amends for putting that name aside.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Robinson was my grandfather's surname, Herman Robinson.  So that's where that comes from.  And then Morris is my father's last name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Date of birth is January 23, 1963.  Place of birth is Happy Valley, San Antonio, Texas.
Speaker 1: Happy Valley is the neighborhood, or--
Speaker 2: It's the [U.S.] Air Force base down there, so--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --nickname for the heat basin that they have down there.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Alright, and what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: My occupation, I am a Professor of Chemistry and Atmospheric Sciences at Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia].  I also am Director of the NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] Center for Atmospheric Sciences, which is a research center here at the university.  And I think that's--but profession, I'd say I'm a scientist and educator.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is the 28th of March, I believe.
Speaker 1: It's the 27th.
Speaker 2: 27th?  (laughter).  That's a tough one for me.  I've--I still haven't got back up on days yet.
Speaker 1: I think it's the 29th, yeah.
Speaker 2: 29th?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, just say it a little louder, so that, you know--the 29th.  It's the 29th, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  March 29th, 2013.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Now, where are at the present time?
Speaker 2: Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay, at Howard.
Speaker 2: At Howard University.  We are at the, in the Howard University Research 1 Building on the campus of Howard University in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26087
Speaker 1: All right. Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we always ask, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No. (laughter).
Speaker 1: (laughter) And for the last one--
Speaker 2: (laughter) I hope I get a yes on this one.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: It would probably be no.  But let's see.  No, I don't think I have a favorite phrase or saying.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not offhand that I know.
Speaker 1: So, "no" is not the favorite phrase.
Speaker 2: "No" is not the favorite.  It would sound like it is, but it's not. (laughter)
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Story_ID: 26088
Speaker 1: Alright, so I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  But we'll ask about them separately so we don't get them mixed up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Gloria Robinson Morris.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Port Arthur, Texas.  Her date of birth, ooh, I think 1932.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, there was a--you were telling us a story about how she was named Laverne at first, and changed her name.  Is, so, she just didn't like Laverne?
Speaker 2: She didn't talk about it a lot, but she did not like the name.  She did not--I think Gloria actually was her middle name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she liked Gloria much more.  She did not like Laverne.  It could have been the kids were making fun of the name or, I'm not sure.  She did not like it.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  And now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them, and what are the stories about them?
Speaker 2: The stories that I know--my grandfather, you know, separated from my grandmother sort of early.  He was sort of a vagabond.  He was a boxer.  I think he held some belts--middle-weight, light heavy-weight class.  Not the primary belts, but regional belts, in the U.S. during the time.  But when he left--he left when they were living in Omaha, Nebraska.  He's originally from Louisiana, but Louisiana through Texas.  And when he left, they eventually lost contact with him.  And so where he ended up, where he died, we don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know his name?
Speaker 2: Herman Robinson.
Speaker 1: Herman Robinson, okay.
Speaker 2: And we're trying to find out.  We've begun looking back, my sister in particular, and trying to research the family homes and the family history.  But his has been problematic.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My--
Speaker 1: Is there any thought that something might have happened to him?
Speaker 2: Some people feel that way, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Let's see.  My, on my grandmother's side, her great--her mother, my great-grandmother, I knew growing up, actually, when they lived in Omaha, Nebraska.  I used to go and stay there.  And she was born a slave--
Speaker 1: She was your--
Speaker 2: Great grandmother.
Speaker 1: Great grandmother, okay.
Speaker 2: --and free when she was in her teens.  And also from Texas, my grandmother, born in Texas.  And of course, my mother was born in Texas, all in the Port Arthur, Waco [Texas] area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At least my grandmother and my mother.  Mother, Port Arthur.  My grandmother I think was Waco.  And actually we recently found a house, the house of my great-grandmother, at least on the plot.  From Google Earth, we were able to see where it was.  And it looks like old slave quarters there, back behind an estate.  But the foundation of the house is actually still there.
Speaker 1: So, what was your great-grandmother's name?  Do you have her name?
Speaker 2: My great--I have forgotten.  Sorry, I'd have to-Eileen [ph.] was my grandmother's name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26089
Speaker 1: Now you say your great-grandmother was born in slavery.  Were there any stories about slavery that were passed down in the family?
Speaker 2: Not many.  I don't recall any.  I remember she would tell us stories when we'd go to Omaha [Nebraska].  She had a lot of traditional remedies, is what I remember from her.  If you'd run around and get cut on briars, or you get a cold or some sniffles or something, she would always--the remedy would always be from the backyard.  I don't know where she would get it, but it would be some poultice or some salve, or stick something in your jaw.  I remember she chewed tobacco pretty religiously.  (laughter)  But, you know, in terms of specific stories, I don't remember.  I was fairly young.  I was, you know, I was pre-teen when she died.
Speaker 1: Now, okay.   Now, you were born in '63 [1963], right?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Now I'm thinking, like, you know, slavery was over in '65 [1865].  And that would make her over 100 [years old].
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was old.
Speaker 1: So, that, does that sound about right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, she was--
Speaker 1: Do you think she was over 100 when--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was, she was, she was over a 100.  I think she was in her late, I know she was in her late nineties at the very least.  She might have been 103.  We had a couple of ancestors who really lived a long time.  I had an aunt who lived a really long time.  So, between the two of them, they were in their late nineties or a little over a hundred.
Speaker 1: And the other thing, too, is that people often--in fact I remember seeing a story in 'Jet' magazine in the '60s [1960s] about someone who had come out into the world to find out that slavery was over.  They didn't know.  Even--you know, where they were it was so isolated they didn't even know.  Nobody told them, so they--(laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) So that's a hundred years, almost a hundred years after slavery--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --people still thought they were in it.  They didn't know any better.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, now, I don't--so the case may have been, especially in those days, you know, and with the great distances in Texas--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you could, slavery could be over, but--
Speaker 2: They heard late anyway, right?  They heard--Texas--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Juneteenth was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah, named such because they didn't find out until June, when everybody else knew, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --about a year earlier.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.  So, it could have been, it could have been.
Speaker 1: Yeah, with communications being what they were in those days so, I don't know.  I mean, it's kind of mysterious.  I was thinking, you know, she had to be really, really old, but--
Speaker 2: She was really old. Yeah, she was really old.
Speaker 1: And people's conditions sometimes did not change after official slavery either, so they called it slavery, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you know, it wasn't much difference in, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, not in Texas, from what I understand.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, anyway, that's interesting.
Story_ID: 26090
Speaker 1: So, your grandmother, now what did your grandmother do for a living?
Speaker 2: My grandmother, I think was a housekeeper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, she was not educated at the college level.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, she could read and write and everything?
Speaker 2: She could read and write, yes.  She could read and write.
Speaker 1: And did she live in town, in Port Arthur [Texas]?
Speaker 2: She lived in--no, my grandmother lived--when I knew her, lived in Omaha, Nebraska.  But she lived in town in Omaha, Nebraska--30 North 33rd Street, is what I remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You could see Creighton University, basically.   From the hill she lived on, you could see Creighton University.  I used to go, you know, used to walk over there, when it was a much smaller school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now did your mother [Gloria Robinson Morris], did she grow up in Texas herself?
Speaker 2: My mother grew up in Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother grew up in Texas.
Speaker 1: And where?
Speaker 2: Port Arthur.
Speaker 1: In Port Arthur, okay.  Your mom grew up there.  And did she talk about what life was like in Port Arthur when she was growing up?
Speaker 2: She did talk about it.  She liked to dwell more on the positive things.  So, she talked about, you know, crabbing on the coast.  You know, talked about--she liked school a lot.  My mother got her master's [degree].  She went to Bishop [College, Marshall, Texas] and then Our Lady of the Lake [school], both in Texas.  She liked learning, she liked teaching.  So, I think her experiences in school with her school teachers were extremely positive.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Our Lady of the Lake--
Speaker 2: It's, I think it's an all women's school in Texas.
Speaker 1: Is that a Catholic school?
Speaker 2: It's a, I don't think it's Catholic.  It's Methodist, that's probably what it is.
Speaker 1: She got her master's in?
Speaker 2: Education.
Speaker 1: Education.  Alright.
Speaker 2: She had one sister and, you know, they were close, very close.  She didn't talk about her sort of rebellion and, you know, distancing with her mother very much.  But I got more of that information from her sister, my aunt, than I got from my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: So, and I think, you know, part of it was she found out later, really after her death, that there was some history of mental illness in the family.  My grandmother was in a, I guess it's a sanitarium, but she was, had to be taken away from the home for some time.  It's not, it's still not clear why or what the symptoms were that she was experiencing.  But it sounded like it was paranoia, maybe, you know, some sort of psychotic break, where she wasn't dealing with reality very well, and depression.  She recovered and, she was, you know, came back out.  But I think it was during that time that some of the transition to my great-grandmother being the caretaker for my mother took place.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The timing seems right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I did know, you know, the name [Morris' mother's first name at birth, Laverne], she did not like.
Story_ID: 26091
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name is Billy, actually, not William, but Billy.  B-I-L-L-Y, Verlett, V-E-R-L-E-T-T, Morris, M-O-R-R-I-S.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story behind his name?
Speaker 2: You know, I've often asked where Verlett came from, and nobody seems to know.  He was one of six brothers and a sister.  So, eight kids.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was his date of birth?
Speaker 2: 1930, July.  I didn't give my mother's day.  It was March--sorry, December 4, in '32 [1932].  My father is July 10, 1930.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was your dad born?
Speaker 2: My father was born in Arkansas City, Kansas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace them, and what are the stories?
Speaker 2: They go back--from what I know, I think we're still working on going back a little bit further.  But I think it was Robert Morris who, I forget the birthdate, but he came from Charleston, South Carolina.  Moved--migrated to Missouri--Sarcoxie, Missouri--southern Missouri, or southern-central Missouri.  And he had quite a few sons, one of which was my grandfather.  And they then, my grandfather moved to I think Pawnee, Oklahoma and eventually to Arkansas City, Kansas where he married my grandmother on my father's side, Georgia Drumgould.  So--
Speaker 1: Now, what was your grandmother's name, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Georgia, like the state, G-E-O-R-G-I-A.  Drumgould, D-R-U-M-G-O-U-L-D.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting name, Drumgould.
Speaker 2: Drumgould.
Speaker 1: I never heard that before.
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: Do you know where that comes from?
Speaker 2: I don't.  But I know there's a lot of Drumgoulds in the cemetery.  And she died quite a while ago, now.  But we do keep up with some of her relatives.  There are still some Drumgoulds in the Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri area.  And a lot, quite a few, were buried in the Ark City cemetery.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, okay.  So, your grandfather, Robert Morris, came all the way from South Carolina.
Speaker 2: Yeah, came from Charleston, made a stop in Missouri, another stop in Oklahoma, and then Ark City is right near the Oklahoma border.  So, in that area--Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri--there's a lot of Morrises.
Speaker 1: Now what did he end up doing for a living, your grandfather?
Speaker 2: My grandfather was, he was a cook in the [U.S.] Navy.  And when he came out, I know he worked in the slaughterhouses there in Wichita [Kansas], in the Ark City area.   And he had a farm there as well.
Story_ID: 26092
Speaker 1: So, did your father [Billy Verlett Morris] grow up, so he grew up in Arkansas City [Kansas]?
Speaker 2: Ark City, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Ark City, okay.  Now, what did he say about growing up?
Speaker 2: He said it was a lot of hard work.  His father was a pretty strict disciplinarian.  It's a town, it's very rural.  Even now, it hasn't changed much.  I think, you know, there are structures there that were there when he was a kid.  The downtown is essentially the same, you know.  We've been down there for the family reunions, and he points out churches that are still there, from what he recalls.  So, I think it was a slow sort of upbringing.  A lot of, a lot of family there, too.  So, you know, a very close-knit family, close-knit upbringing there.  A lot of sports.  They had horses, they had pigs, chickens, you know.  So, a lot of family chores for everybody.  So, I think that trickled down.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so your father, did he go to college, too, or did he--
Speaker 2: He did not go to college right away.  He went into the [U.S.] Air Force.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he finished college, actually, when I was in high school.  He went back to get his, to complete his college degree when I was in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And, okay, so he was, was he career Air Force?
Speaker 2: Career Air Force, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, a career man in the Air Force.
Story_ID: 26093
Speaker 1: And now, did, did he [Morris' father, Billy Verlett Morris] meet your mother [Gloria Robinson Morris] before he joined the [U.S.] Air Force, or after?
Speaker 2: He met, I think he met my mother when she was in the Air Force.  Actually, my mother went into the Air Force as well.  She was only in there for a short period of time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: They met on a blind date.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One of my father's friends knew one of my mother's friends, and they introduced them at an event that they were having for African American enlistees.  And they met.
Speaker 1: Do you know where they were?
Speaker 2: I don't know where they were.  My sense is that they were in Texas.  I believe that they were actually in Texas.
Story_ID: 26094
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about your parents' [Gloria Robinson Morris and Billy Verlett Morris] personalities, their sense of humor, how they walk, talk, their habits--who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Both as walk, talk, and sort of general behavior, it's probably my father.  I'm pretty easy-going, probably too relaxed, is what most people think.  But he was, my father was a drill sergeant for quite a while.  But he--a very good sense of humor, but underneath that was a very direct sort of person.  But he used to laugh and joke, so I probably take after him.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I've got one brother, two sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My older--my brother is older, born in 1960, three years older.  And then I have two sisters, evenly spaced by two years apart.  So, one is two years younger and one four years younger.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26095
Speaker 1: Now, I didn't--well, tell us what your mother [Gloria Robinson Morris] is like, even though--
Speaker 2: My mother was very kind, very empathetic.  And she was an outstanding teacher and educator.  She dedicated her life to teaching, so she taught elementary school, middle school.  She went on to become a principal, the first African American principal in Spokane, Washington where we were--did a lot in community outreach in setting up after-school programs, tutorial programs.  And really cared about education, really cared about child welfare, really emphasized being serious in school to all of us.  But she was a little more serious, a little more proper.  Maybe it came from the Bishop College [Marshall, Texas] and Our Lady of the Lake School [Texas], and being in a professional environment and having to prove herself quite a bit wherever she went, especially as an administrator.  So, she was very, she was a much more reserved person.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 26096
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: An earliest childhood memory?  I have some early memories.  I don't know if it's the earliest.  I remember doing a lot of exploring in the desert.  And the [U.S.] Air Force base that we lived on--where we lived on the Air Force base, I should say--ran up against the desert in Las Vegas [Nevada].  My sister was born in Las Vegas.  One of my sisters was born in Las Vegas.  The other was born in Phoenix [Arizona].  And so, I remember exploring, you know, just out in the desert around the cacti with my brother a lot.  And so that would--we only lived, I think, in each place about a year or two years.  So, that's my earliest memory, chasing after lizards and frogs and snakes and that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: It seemed like exploring around the cacti might be a dangerous thing for a--
Speaker 2: A little bit.  But my brother was there so, you know, following him.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Story_ID: 26097
Speaker 1: So, now you were born in--well, I forgot here--San Antonio [Texas], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, San Antonio.
Speaker 1: So, you, so how long did you all stay there?  Did you--
Speaker 2: We moved around a lot.  So, we actually were in San Antonio I believe at least twice, maybe three times, we were in San Antonio.  We were in San Antonio--we moved someplace else.  So, I know within two years after I was born we were in Las Vegas [Nevada], because my sister was born in Las Vegas.  And within two years of that, we were in Phoenix [Arizona], because my next sister was born in Phoenix, and she's two years down.  I know we came back to San Antonio, but I went to kindergarten and first grade--I think I went to pre-school in San Antonio--but I went to kindergarten and first grade in Japan.  And then from Japan we moved to Michigan, because I went to second grade, third grade, I believe, in Michigan.  And then we, I believe, moved to Washington State.  And there was a little back and forth when we moved to Washington State, because my father [Billy Verlett Morris] didn't move with us.  So, we moved out.  And then we came back, I think, back to Michigan.  And then when he got the permanent assignment, we moved back out to Washington State for good.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So did you finish high school in Washington?
Speaker 2: I finished high school in Spokane, Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my father finished his [U.S.] Air Force career at Fairchild Air Force Base out there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, my mother [Gloria Robinson Morris; career as an educator] and father retired out there, even after we left.
Story_ID: 26098
Speaker 1: We always ask this question, and there's a lot of places to consider when you answer this.  But what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: There was a lot.  You know, we were in a lot of different places.  You know, I think one of the things that influenced me a lot, was we would always drive.  With four kids, I guess at that time--you'd put them in a station wagon and you'd drive from Michigan to Washington State, or you'd drive down to--okay, we were in California for a minute, too.  But that was short.  Well, we drove everywhere.  And so, you know, I've seen most of the national parks.  I saw most of the national parks out West as a child, you know.  I saw bears and moose and elk and buffalo and, you know, you name it, we saw it.  Old Faithful [cone geyser, Wyoming, Yellowstone National Park]--you know, I remember--I can actually, I remember what it smelled like, you know, the sulphur--and seeing that environment.  A lot of exploring--I liked being outside a lot.  It was difficult for me to be inside, actually, for long periods of time.  That was my punishment.  If I got in trouble, I'd have to go into the, it was a den, I guess, or a library with all the books.  And I'd have to sit there and read.  So, being inside, they knew was my punishment.  (laughter).
Story_ID: 26099
Speaker 1: Alright.  Yeah, continue with sights, sounds and smells.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think being outdoors is a major thing, and seeing a lot of things.  You know, we came to Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia], went to New York as a child, saw Detroit [Michigan], saw L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  You know, a lot of travel.  So I saw Tokyo [Japan], you know.  I remember being, I remember--actually, a pretty vivid memory of mine is going to the beach in Japan, and how filthy it was, you know, and the smell of raw fish.  You could eat, you know, oysters there.  The food was great.  But the beach, I remember was just littered with trash and people laying amongst the trash on the beach--just kind of blew my mind that, you know, why don't you clean up?  (laughter)  But even then they had a lot of people, you know.  Tokyo was a really busy place, but the sights and sounds of Japan influenced me.  I like Japanese food.  I wouldn't say it's my favorite food, though, and I do like sushi a lot.  Sights--I guess did a lot of exploring, you know.  Catch--you know, caught a lot of snakes.  I don't know what my obsession was with snakes and frogs, but I would go hunting for snakes and frogs, even in Washington State where, you know, there's a lot more rattlers up there.  It's not as, you know--if you're in the desert, there's a lot of, you know, snakes that don't do anything.  They're just garter snakes and bull snakes and hognose and, you know, really big snakes.  But they're not poisonous, so you're at low risk.  You know, lots of lizards.  But--
Speaker 1: You ever encounter a rattlesnake--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --unexpectedly?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I had rattler's nests and stuff like that, yeah.  I guess somewhere, someone must have given me appropriate information.  I never got bit by a rattler, I never--I don't ever remember being in danger.  I remember seeing them.  I remember seeing Gila monsters [lizards], which were poisonous--coral snakes, but I don't ever remember being afraid or feeling like I was in danger.  Maybe I was, but I don't ever remember feeling that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, some pretty bad injuries when I was a kid.  We, when I was younger, especially on the [U.S.] Air Force bases, we had a, it was a game called Smear the Queer [game of tag].  Have you ever heard of that game?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Come on man, a couple people (intelligible) (laughter).  So, it's a game--basically if you don't have, if you don't have any equipment, you got a ball of any sort, you got a bunch of kids.  And basically you set up, and you've got a playground.  So, the boundaries of the playground are the goals, and the objective is whoever has the ball has gotta run, cross the goal.  And everybody else (laughter), got a tapping.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, we used to play that.  We didn't call it--
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, we used to have a lot of little kids--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so that's, that was the major game.  So we, I think I played that everywhere I went.  My brother was excellent.  Actually, my brother was, my brother really had (unclear).  I remember playing one time, you know, running trying to make it to the end, and there were these cement pylons.  Because in a lot of Air Force bases, you had, the barracks sort of for the housing, was around a central courtyard, and then there were fixtures there.  But you had some grass and sidewalk that you could play on.  And so, one time I got knocked, you know, running, I think diving for the end.  But they had these cement pylons there.  And I just, wiped out, you know, busted--put my teeth through my bottom lip, and I was out cold, out cold. I think I woke up, my brother was waking me up, like, "Time to go home, time to go home."  (laughter).  But when I went home I was, you know, I was just covered in blood.  I think I lost a tooth, you know, a bunch of nonsense.  But, you know, games like that--playing, you know, sort of aggressive games was--I remember that pretty vividly from when I was small.  But other than that, you know, we moved around a lot.  So the things that were common, you know--school bullies, games, you know, a lot of playing in big groups on the Air Force bases, you know, being the new kid in the school.  But I enjoyed it.  I think it made our family, you know, brothers and sisters closer.  We played around a lot together.
Speaker 1: Your brothers and sisters are your only constant, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I guess if you moved a lot.
Speaker 2: Uh huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: You were constantly around them.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so we were, we were pretty close, yeah.  But, you know, in between, you know, especially as we moved, we'd end up going back to Ark City [Kansas] or we'd go back to Omaha [Nebraska].  We'd stay there until my father [Billy Verlett Morris] and mother [Gloria Robinson Morris] worked out where the next place was, or whatever the next assignment was.  So I think because of that, it sort of accentuated, at least in me, you know, you're always in motion.  Go here, be here for a month, go down the--go up to Omaha, be there for a month.  Go back home, and I would be doing a new location that next year.  So, it was, you know, I talked to some people.  They have problems with that, but actually I like moving around, I like travel, actually, a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26100
Speaker 1: Now you started school in Japan, right?
Speaker 2: I started school in Japan.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And was that, well, you were on a [U.S. Air Force] base, right?
Speaker 2: We were on a base.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of the base there?
Speaker 2: I think it was Chofu Air Force Base.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: C-H-O-F-U.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.  I used to speak and write Japanese.  They taught us Japanese at that point in time.  My father was fluent in Japanese.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, alright.  And--
Speaker 2: Not anymore. (laughter)
Speaker 1: Okay.  I interviewed somebody yesterday that said that they were fluent in Chinese once, but when they were, you know, there.  Now they can't.
Speaker 2: If you don't, you know, if you don't use it, it's gone.  But I do tend to pick up languages pretty fast, even now.  You know, I get a lot of assignments where I'm someplace for three months or four months or six months.  And normally by the time before I leave, easily I can move around by myself, talk on the street, get what I need.  It's interesting, I like it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you started school as a little--well, in Japan I don't know if you really had an interest, you know, in school other than learning, just trying to learn how to read and write.  But, what, let's see.  Well, anything significant about your schooling in Japan, I mean other than the fact--well, the significant thing, you could speak Japanese.
Speaker 2: I loved my teacher.  That was, probably my favorite teacher was my first grade teacher there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mrs. Nakanishi.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Flat out, favorite teacher.  I remember we had a Japanese nanny, because both of my parents [Billy Verlett Morris and Gloria Robinson Morris] worked.  So I remember, in fact my sisters and I even laugh still about it.  (laughter) She couldn't make a peanut butter sandwich (laughter).  You know--
Speaker 1: What was wrong?  I mean what--
Speaker 2: It tasted funny.  It was just, it was just, maybe it was the food.  When we eat--we used to hate, you know, it's like every time we got home it was a peanut butter sandwich that tasted funny.  So it was like, you know what, we're not eating these anymore.  So, we would take them and then go off and play, and we would just toss them out, and try to eat some snacks.  She was really nice. You know, very nice, demure.  We were Air Force brats, so even then probably tested her patience.  But she was really nice.  She never, never had an expression on her face. (laughter).  Habusa [ph.]--I remember.
Story_ID: 26101
Speaker 1: Okay, now, okay.  So, well, starting school at age five in Japan, I mean, what was your sense of the world at age five?  I mean did you realize that that was something different, or did you, just took it for granted as--
Speaker 2: No, I think I got my, I realized that that was different when I came back to Detroit [Michigan].  There we had, you know, there was Japanese-American kids, there was kids from all over the place.  There was just a bunch of kids.  I mean, even, I think I even have that picture, my kindergarten picture, my first grade picture.  It looks like United Nations.  When I went to school in Detroit, Michigan, it was all black.  I think we had one white kid in the class.
Speaker 1: Now, where, did you go to school on the [U.S. Air Force] base in Detroit or was it in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: We got bussed, so I think we were in the neighborhood with--a lot of my uncles and stuff are in Michigan, there in Saginaw and Flint and Detroit.  So we had a lot, when we moved to Michigan, there was a lot of relatives there, a lot of cousins and uncles.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of your school?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't.  I might be able to find it out, but I don't remember the name of the school.
Speaker 1: It was mostly black, you know, students?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Now, what were you interested in--
Speaker 2: And that was surprising to me, because it was like, whoa, this is different than what I, my first couple of years. (laughter) But it was, you know, I had a good time.  But I do not remember the teacher.  I remember my kindergarten teacher, Miss Hamilton.  I remember my first grade teacher, Miss Nakanishi.  No clue who my third and fourth grade--I couldn't pick them out of--if you showed me a picture with me in it, I'd be like wow, that was, that was that person, huh?  No clue.
Speaker 1: Did you, did you have a favorite activity or subject at school at this stage?
Speaker 2: No, not then, no.  I liked, I began to like math when we began to do timetables because it was a challenge, who could finish first.  You know, who knows, you know, up through 15s or what have you.  So, it wasn't so much liking the subject matter, it was the challenge.  And that was, I think probably why I liked my first teacher.  So, I don't believe I was challenged that much in some of the grades, probably those middle grades there.  But, you know, I remember Miss Hamilton, Miss Nakanishi, always had, kept me occupied.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So probably what I thought was attention was just trying to keep me from causing a ruckus in class.
Speaker 1: Now, did you get a chance to get, to get out much in Michigan?  I mean, in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when we were in Detroit, the thing I most remember about Detroit was fighting in school a lot and the train tracks.  I used to take a lot of walks along the train, in the rail yard.  So wherever we were, it was close to a rail yard.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 26102
Speaker 1: Next move was to Washington State, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the next move for me at the time was Washington State.
Speaker 1: Was this in Spokane?
Speaker 2: Spokane, Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that's eastern Washington, not too far from the Idaho border.  And definitely finished middle school and high school there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I haven't really been back since.
Speaker 1: Now, were you developing an interest in any specific--were you developing an interest in science, I guess at that point, I mean, as such.
Speaker 2: You know, in terms of saying I want to be a scientist, no.  I was just--there, it was very isolated.  So there, I went from basically an all black school or majority African American school to, I think there was one or two African Americans in my middle school.  And I think there was seven out of about a thousand in my high school.  So, it was a much more isolated existence there.
Speaker 1: This is like '74 [1974], '75 [1975]--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or so.
Speaker 2: In fact, there's an expo, Expo 74.    We visited Spokane for a world expo that was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember I got lost at the expo.  And so we went a little bit later.  We visited, and I didn't realize we were visiting, because my father [Billy Verlett Morris] was thinking about moving out there.  I thought we went to the World's Fair and--having fun.  And then I think within a year, year and a half, we were moving out there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was in early '70s [1970s], mid-'70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Now, how did you get lost at the expo?
Speaker 2: Saw something and wandered off.  Just, just, you know, saw something and wandered off.
Speaker 1: Sounds like, I mean, you like to--
Speaker 2: (laughter)
Speaker 1: --explore things, that you go toward whatever you're interested in.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  It was only a couple hours.  It was only a couple hours.  I caught back up.  But I think I saw my brother through the crowd and just caught back up with him.  But I was never, it was strange because I realized, okay, a lot of people here, I don't know who everybody is, but I said, well, you know, I'll walk around.  I know which gate we came in.  I think I walked back to the gate that we came in.  I was like okay, I know where that is.  So, I'm just gonna, you know, no one's here waiting for me, so I'm going to go ahead and hang out and then I'll keep checking back to see if someone's here.  I never really went to report myself lost or anything, which probably again was a mistake.  But I just--It was good, it was a lot of stuff there, you know.  There was so much stuff.  And I just got in trouble for that, I remember, too.  But I just wandered off.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're about eleven [years old] at Expo 74.
Speaker 2: Yeah, something like that.
Speaker 1: Around eleven years old.  So, alright, so you finished like middle school and high school in Spokane?
Speaker 2: Middle school and high school in Spokane.
Story_ID: 26103
Speaker 1: In terms of popular culture, what did you do for fun?  Was it still outdoor--you know, exploring outdoors?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of outdoors.  We moved off [U.S. Air Force] base [Spokane, Washington], I think in junior school.  So we were on base for awhile, moved off base.  So I remember when we moved, the neighborhood where we moved was near a forest.  And so, and they were still building homes as well.  So there was--did a lot of exploring the homes that were not yet built, but you could go in and go through the attic and crawl up.  So we did a--built a lot of forts in the woods, you know, built a lot of things in the woods.  A lot of exploring in the woods.  I think one of my, I do remember a science project, middle school science project, which again was a challenge.  We had to, you know, come up with a science project.  So my project was to basically catch and characterize and mount as many insects as possible.  And I remember the teacher being overwhelmed by the result, because I literally had hundreds of different insects.  And you know, I just got swept up.  So, I was digging for insects, and plus we were near the woods, you know.  I was digging under trees and under stumps and carving things out.  And every time I saw a bug I took it and characterized it.
Speaker 1: What did you just like drive a needle through it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) Yeah, a needle, you mount on a Styrofoam board or something like that.  You'd mount it, you gotta say what it is.  You know, you characterize it, you keep your little (unclear) notebook.  And so I had, I had literally hundreds of beetles and bugs and butterflies and moths.  I caught everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went berserk.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: (laughter) But it was good, because it fed my, you know, I wanted to get out.  So that was--okay, I gotta go do my science project.  So, I could be out for hours, you know, in the woods, you know, mucking around.
Story_ID: 26104
Speaker 1: Now, did you know any scientists in those days?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Did you, did you like, you know, TV shows like Jacques Cousteau [French naval officer, explorer, conservationist, filmmaker, innovator, scientist, photographer, author and researcher who studied the sea and aquatic life] and--
Speaker 2: I did like Jacques Cousteau--I did like Jacques Cousteau.  Now that was a good show.  I liked that exploring.  In fact, yeah, there was something I did like.  But the thing that resonated with Jacques Cousteau was that he was exploring.  He was going out in places that nobody had been, you know.  Build some craft, go down and see stuff no one had seen.  The thing that intrigued me, I liked to read.  I was advanced quite a bit in terms of reading, probably because of so much time in the library.  But what I liked to read was explorers.  I liked history, and Magellan.  Actually, I just talked to a middle school class the other day.  And I said, you know, what-someone had asked me what I wanted to do.  I said I wanted to be an explorer.  And that was from, you know, reading these guys who'd get on ships and sail to wherever, and you know, chart a new course, chart a new area, you know.  That was, that was exciting to me, much more so than anything scientific.  I don't know, did not know any scientists, wasn't particularly encouraged to follow science, actually.  But, you know, but there were challenges.  Like I said, there were the challenges in math.  I remember in middle school, and especially in middle school is when you, when there's a separation between students.  You know, who does his thing better than somebody else.  And typically, it was in the math courses or the science courses.  So, I wasn't particularly enthralled.  You know, I loved this stuff, but it was, okay if that's the challenge, let me do better on that.  So, that's competition more than anything else.
Story_ID: 26105
Speaker 1: Now how were your grades in [middle and high school]--?
Speaker 2: Grades were good.  We, my mother [Gloria Robinson Morris] and father [Billy Verlett Morris] were pretty strict disciplinarians, and education was primary.  So, we were expected to get As.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, were you a part of any formal exploration groups like the Boy Scouts or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) I was in the Cub Scouts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was in the Cub Scouts.  I did not last long in the Cub Scouts--I did not last long in the Cub Scouts.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: I don't, I think it was too organized for me, which probably didn't sound good.  But I just, I didn't have the freedom to do things the way I wanted to do it.  And so I just, I just kind of lost interest.  Because you know, you have to do a certain set of tasks to get your badges, get your pins, and move up.  And some of them were fun.  And some of them, I just, I looked at and I said, I don't want to do that, which doesn't work well for you.
Speaker 1: Now did you have any, I mean did you get a chemistry set or anything like that, growing up, or can you remember?
Speaker 2: My father worked as a systems analyst, so the things that he'd bring home--we had an adding--you know, the first sort of computation, you know, computers were these desktop units that you'd have to program to do addition and things like that.  We had a lot of those.  I took a lot of things apart.  My parents were probably afraid to get me a chemistry set.  We did have a microscope, because when I started the project with the insects, my parents bought me a microscope so I could, you know, analyze sort of the insect morphology and the insects' characteristics better.  But actually, again, it was more exploration.  If there was something electronic, and I had to be inside, more than likely I took it apart.  I took apart toasters and radios.  I took apart the TV--knocked myself out, you know, because I hadn't unplugged it, and I was pulling the back off and knocked myself out.  A lot of just tinkering stuff.  But no, no science kits.  Never was in a science fair.
Story_ID: 26106
Speaker 1: Okay.  No science fairs.
Speaker 2: Never in a science fair.
Speaker 1: Now, did--
Speaker 2: Which I think is probably strange, but I was just never given the opportunity.
Speaker 1: So, they choose certain students to do it?
Speaker 2: They choose certain students to do it, and I was never selected.
Speaker 1: But you did like impress them with your bug collection, right?
Speaker 2: Impressed them with the bug collection.  I was at the top of the class, but it, you know, Washington State at that time, especially, was a fairly prejudiced place.  It was a fairly racist place.  So, you know, one of the things that my mother [Gloria Robinson Morris] sort of drilled into us is, you know, "You can perform.  You have to do better than everybody else to even get the chance, because you're not going to be given a chance just on, you know, first basic principles.  People are going to think that you're inferior, and they're going to treat you like you're inferior.  So, you have to out-perform."  So, these science fairs, you know, many of those, you know, science competitions and awards, things like that, were selected by the teacher.  And I was never the teacher's favorite.
Speaker 1: Reversing then, did you have any favorite teachers during this period?
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't, I did not.  I probably went in with a chip on my shoulder.  And that, you know, means you don't make friends with teachers too much.  I fought a lot.  Actually, there I got into boxing and wrestling because I was always on the playground fighting.  But then, if you move around a lot, you know, you begin to anticipate that the school bully, you're going to have to meet up with the school bully.  So, my brother and I would actually go and, you know, who is, you know, who's the guy that I was going to have to fight now?  (laughter)  And you know, again, that doesn't endear you to teachers so much.  So I, actually, I remember I was in the principal's office a lot when we first moved to Washington State, quite a bit actually.
Story_ID: 26107
Speaker 1: So in your neighborhood growing up, would there be other black families in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: We were the only black family for--there was one, there was one brother who was adopted, who lived in the neighborhood when we moved off the [U.S. Air Force] base.  And that was it until high school, and then there was one more black family moved in.  There was another guy who was retired from the Air Force, but they didn't have any kids.  So, there was a black couple who lived up the street with no kids.  One brother was adopted, and then until high school there was a family moved in that had two sisters.  And that was it.  So, most of African American community was on the other side of town.  And so the church that we went to, we went to an AME [African Methodist Episcopal] church.  That was where we were able to, you know, interact with the African American community, and we made a lot of friends through the church.  And so I kind of had two lives, so to speak.  You know, on the weekends we would go, go to the church and there would be some youth program or something over there and, okay, you know.  We'd make friends with them, and you'd come back, sort of isolated in the neighborhood.  But you know, you have, again, brothers and sisters.  We had four kids, so we make do.
Story_ID: 26108
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Gloria Robinson Morris and Billy Verlette Morris] like, spend, like time trying to cultivate your exploration interests or--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, they--
Speaker 1: --technical interests?
Speaker 2: Definitely, you know, anything that I wanted to do, they definitely supported.  You know, the exploration--they allowed me free--you know, go on out and, you know, be back before the sun gets down.  Or, and they gave me freedom, and that was probably the most important thing for me.  You know, book-wise if there was any subject that they saw me interested in, they'd buy some books, you know.  There'd be plenty, there's plenty of books to read.  And like I said, I pretty much made do with whatever was there.  So, I did get some electronics kits.  My father was always bringing home programming sorts of material.  So, my brother and I were programming, programming probably before high school, you know, junior high and high school, I was programming.  But, you know, the programs you wrote then were basically machine language.  It was very basic stuff, binary, and not the sort of sophisticated, the more sophisticated front-end programming that people do now.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I was thinking, now, so what were you interested in, in terms of popular culture stuff?  Did you, I mean, TV, radio--
Speaker 2: Music.  A good thing on the [U.S.] Air Force base is that, you know, you got airmen coming in from all over.  They got the latest music.  So, music was great.  I collected stamps, which I think fed into my, you know, the explorer, you could see the world through stamps.  And so, stamps was actually a serious hobby for me, more serious than anything that wasn't a sport.  You know, I believe like, stamps from all over the world.  So, you know I went through my allowance or whatever I would earn, you know, just on stamps and music.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What kind of music did you like?
Speaker 2: Oh, then it was disco and hip hop, you know.  So disco was sort of the stuff that, you know, if your parents had a party or something that like, you heard disco and R and B [rhythm and blues genre].  My father was a big jazz enthusiast.  So, they were pretty varied, but the parties would basically be disco and R and B.  My mother liked classical music.  So, if she had the chance to turn on the radio or turn something on, it would be, you know, classical--slow or calming music to calm us down.  My father would have the latest stuff, you know, rolling.  So, probably pretty eclectic music in the house.  But you know, I learned to like everything, I really do.
Story_ID: 26109
Speaker 1: You really didn't like school that much, and you were kind of impatient with it.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  Yeah, I think I needed to be challenged a little bit more.  And so I got bored with a lot of stuff, finished a lot of stuff early, and then, you know, got restless.  So, there was actually a time when my mother [Gloria Robinson Morris] would go to the school and tell them, you know, put him in the advanced program or we're just going to skip him some grades.  Otherwise, he's not gonna, he's going to become more of a behavioral problem.  I wasn't extreme, but you know, I remember just walking out of class, just, you know, just walking out of class.  I had one teacher in particular, and we just did not get off on the right foot.  And I just felt like she wasn't, her class was a waste of my time, and I just would get up and walk out, which I wouldn't tolerate if I was a teacher, either.  But--
Speaker 1: That's the way you felt.
Speaker 2: That's the way I, (laughter), I was very committed to--you know, I cannot do this.
Speaker 1: Now in high school, you said, well, you say there weren't any really memorable teachers at Spokane [Washington].  At either level, high school or middle school?
Speaker 2: No.  I remember my wrestling coach.  I remember my soccer coach.  The guy who gave me the science project was Mr. Linahan.  He had to be like my fifth grade, sixth grade teacher, somewhere along those lines.  But in terms of memorable in a positive way, no.  I don't even remember who wrote recommendations for me to go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you were a little kid when Apollo went to the moon.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I remember seeing it though.
Speaker 1: Did you, okay.
Speaker 2: In '69 [1969].  Yeah, it was on a little black and white TV.  I remember watching it, yeah.  That was in the kitchen, I think that was, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now you probably had, your parents [Gloria Robinson Morris and Billy Verlett Morris] probably believed it was being, actually, it was actually happening, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thought so.
Speaker 1: Now, I've interviewed some people whose parents didn't believe it, you know, didn't believe it.
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  I don't think that was the case at that--you know, that was, that was, that was fascinating.  I remember watching that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you kind of follow the space explorations at all?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I loved space.  I loved looking at stars.  I mean one of the good things about being in a lot of places we were, I mean Las Vegas [Nevada] skies.  I mean back then if you're out on the [U.S. Air Force] base, or Phoenix [Arizona] at night.  It's unbelievable.  I mean in Washington State there's no light pollution.  So, the night skies are amazing, yeah.  I've always, I always liked, you know, astronomy and, you know, the space exploration has always been interesting, even now.  Yeah, even early in my career, I wanted to, you know, consider trying to be an astronaut.  A friend of mine was an astronaut.  Actually, Michael Anderson, who's out of Spokane, Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean we're good friends, and went to the same church.  Definitely.  In fact, if someone influenced me, I'd say it was like friends and peers like that.  Mike was a bright guy, really nice guy, a little bit older than me, I think, maybe a year or two older than me.  His sister was my age.  But, you know--you know, he set himself apart by his attitude, and he's just really a cute guy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, now he had an influence on me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now did you have a telescope?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I had a telescope.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we had a nice, nice telescope.  I'm not sure who it was bought for, whether it was bought for me or my brother.  It was probably bought for my brother, and I just, you know, stole it or pirated it.  But--
Speaker 1: So, your brother's like, is he older than you or younger?
Speaker 2: He's older, three years older.
Speaker 1: Oh, three years older, okay, alright.
Speaker 2: Three years older.  So, he went through a lot of this stuff.  He was born in England, he was born in England.  And then they came back from England to San Antonio [Texas], and that's when I was born.  But he had, I think a lot of the stuff that I eventually got to, I think the microscope was actually his, now that I think about.  It was stuff that he had, that I would go and try to use.  That's what younger brothers do, just tag along.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you, as an Air Force kid, did you get a chance to go up in planes or helicopters much as a kid?
Speaker 2: We flew in planes, yeah, flew in planes.  Helicopters--I think I've only been in a helicopter one or two times, not a whole lot.
Speaker 1: It was, I mean, well, I know they don't, so you don't have like regular times to just go up in plane.  But I just wondered, you know, because you're in the [U.S.] Air Force, was there access to that kind of thing or was it something that you could do recreationally, even in the Air Force, I mean, the kids of the Air Force personnel?--
Speaker 2: No, you'd go to the hangars.  You could always visit the hangars.  A lot, you know, of my father's friends were mechanics or, you know, some pilots, we knew pilots.  So, there were definitely opportunities that you would get to see aircraft, get inside of aircrafts, see how they work.  I was less interested in flying than the machine itself, I can say that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26110
Speaker 1: So in high school you played soccer?
Speaker 2: I played soccer, wrestled, played most sports.  I played football until I broke my hand.  When I broke my hand and I couldn't play football, I started playing soccer.  So that was, it must have been maybe sophomore year or so.  I started actually playing competitively.  I wrestled and boxed.
Speaker 1: Alright, okay.  Alright, now what else did you do in high school?  Did you have a, were you a member of any clubs, or did you run for class office, any of that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: In high school I was a member of the German Club and French Club.  I took French, but I found German really easy.  Club--mostly sports teams.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, mostly sports teams.  I played a sport--and boxing wasn't part of the school.  Boxing was actually outside of the school.  And so--and soccer was actually outside of the school.  The soccer league wasn't a school league.  So, sports took up a lot of time.  And training for boxing is, you know, up early and doing road work.  Training for wrestling was doing road work.  So, you know, I was between trying to make sure I got As in the classes, which was a requirement, and keeping up with sports.  There wasn't a lot of time for other stuff.  We had a lot of church activities, though.  So I was in the church choir, believe it or not.
Speaker 1: So church when you were growing up, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, church--
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of your church?  It was an AME [African Methodist Episcopal] church.
Speaker 2: Bethel AME.
Speaker 1: Bethel AME, okay.
Speaker 2: Bethel AME.
Speaker 1: And the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: Mead, M-E-A-D.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a lot of church activities, so my mother [Gloria Robinson Morris] was heavily involved with, mother and father [Billy Verlette Morris] heavily involved in the church.  So, you know, the church dances and church picnics and, you know church outreach, you know, into the neighborhood.  They tutored.  So, it was not so much involvement in school activities, outside of sports.
Story_ID: 26111
Speaker 1: So was it, so your high school [Mead High School, Spokane, Washington] was overwhelmed with whites, you say.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, that kind of like put a, you know, a damper on the social activities, or--
Speaker 2: I think it was more than that.  It was just not very welcoming.  I think that more than that, kids didn't really know how to respond to you.  I did have some friends there, but the friends I had were people I guess who, you know--obviously folks on the sports teams, you know, you become friends with them.  But I didn't necessarily hang out them all the time, you know.  You got some sports stuff to do, practices, everything is good.  But when that ended, you sort of, you go your own way.
Speaker 1: The social life was basically, you know, on the black side of town?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Then the [Bethel] AME [African Methodist Episcopal] church and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, if I played hooky, I'd go over, I'd play hooky and go to someone else's school on the African American side of town and hang out with friends. (laughter)  So, that's, that's, and it was a long ways, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It took a while.
Speaker 1: Now at Mead, how are your grades at Mead?
Speaker 2: They were good.  I was on the Honor Roll.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was, I was, I think summa cum laude.  I was either summa cum laude or magna cum laude.  My grades were--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean I could not not have good grades.  That wasn't acceptable.
Speaker 1: Alright, alright.
Story_ID: 26112
Speaker 1: So, when you were a senior in high school--now I don't want to pass by anything that's significant in high school, so if it is, let me know what may have happened.  But when you were in senior, what were your prospects for college?  Did you have good counseling?  Did they sit down with you?
Speaker 2: I can't say I had good counseling.  I would say--you asked did I know a scientist.  And I, my mother [Gloria Robinson Morris] is a Delta [Sigma Theta, Inc.; sorority].  And she had, she was very active in Delta Sigma Theta.  And there was a college behind--I remember there were these woods, and then there was this sort of upslope in the woods, sort of a mountain we called it, but it was really just a hill.  And then beyond that I think it was, there was a college, I can't remember the name.  Whitworth--Whitworth College.  That's where my father [Billy Verlette Morris] actually finished.  Probably the most significant event in high school was that my father finished high school [college].  I probably would have gone to the [U.S.] Air Force had he not finished.  My father finished college at Whitworth College, got his degree.  Had he not done that, I probably would have gone to the Air Force anyway.  But my mother and father sort of reached out to students who were at Whitworth College.  And so, we began to meet the African American students who were at Whitworth College.  So they had a football program.  So a lot of--five guys from Texas--a football and basketball program.  It was a lot of guys from Texas, Louisiana, Kansas--for whatever reason they recruited in that area--went to Whitworth and played on the basketball team, in those areas that, you know, both my mother and father had ties to.  And so one way or the other, we started to have, when I was in high school, sort of this stream of college kids coming through.  Some of whom, you know, I'm still in contact with, actually, I visit when I get down to Texas.  One owns a car dealership.  One owns another business in Texas.  I think Brian moved out, he was in St. Louis [Missouri], he moved out to L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  And there was a young lady who got her Ph.D. [degree] in electrical engineering.  I cannot remember her last name, from Rensselaer Polytechnic [Institute, Troy, New York].  But she would always, when she came she would, "You know you should do this.  You should go get your Ph.D., you're smart.  You should do this."  Carolyn [ph.]--if her name comes to me while we're talking, I'll let you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, she was an electrical engineer?
Speaker 2: She was an electrical engineer.
Speaker 1: Teaching at the school?
Speaker 2: I think she taught at--
Speaker 1: At Whitworth?
Speaker 2: No, no, not at Whitworth.  She--but come to--I think she did something at Whitworth.  But she got her degree maybe at Rensselaer.  But that was the first African American Ph.D. I met.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She was encouraging you to go on?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Not only go to college, but get a Ph.D.
Speaker 2: Get a Ph.D., get a Ph.D.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which at that point in time, literally it flew over my head, because I wasn't thinking about going to college at the time.
Speaker 1: So you weren't thinking about going to college, even though you got good grades?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  No, I, a lot of my, most of my friends went into the Air Force.  My father had been in the Air Force.  I was a pretty good boxer, and I knew that I could sort of continue boxing if I went in the Air Force, which I really liked.  And while my mother certainly was saying, you know, you guys need to go to college, it was not, it wasn't resonating with me until my father re-enrolled and finished his degree.  And then I said, okay, well--.
Speaker 1: Well, what about your brother?   Now he's three years ahead of you.  Did he go to college?
Speaker 2: He's three years ahead.  He did go to college.  He went to Washington State [University, Pullman, Washington].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I visited him at Washington State, actually his first year there.  But it was nothing attractive about that, that I, that made me change my mind.  Whereas, you know--I mean it looked like school again.  And whereas some of my friends who were a little bit older had gone to the Air Force--had gone--stationed in Germany, and some of them got stationed in Spain.  And they're coming back, and "Oh man, it's the greatest thing," and you know, spinning the stories.  And I don't know if you've ever been on an Air Force Base, but if you go to the barber shop as a kid, you know, guys were telling all these, you know, tall tales.  You don't know it though, but you're listening to it, and like, "Oh man, I gotta, you know, I'm trying to do what they do."   And that--you know, it's a lot of years of listening to (laughter) stories about how great the Air Force is.  So I was, that was sort of on my mind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so what did your counselors say?
Speaker 2: My counselors, my counselors were willing to write me recommendations.  They did not give me advice on what I should do.  In my school, in fact in my high school, my mother had to actively intervene in my scheduling.  Because rather than put me in the math courses, even though I qualified for the advanced math courses, the college bound math courses, they put me in woodshop.  Or, they'd put me in auto.  You know, just "Oh, you don't want that class.  You know, you want this other thing."  So, you know, I don't mind woodshop, you know, the lathes and the mills and, you know, big machinery.  I have a good time.  You know, I don't mind auto shop.  But my mother wasn't having that, and it was a good decision on her part.  And I could do the math.  It wasn't that I couldn't do the math, it was that the perception was, no black students have ever done well on this math.  My brother had gone through the same, actually the same thing.  They had done similar things to him.  But he was more affected by, you know, not being called on in class, and getting sort of differential marks for the same work.
Story_ID: 26113
Speaker 1: So, so I did well in school.  I took, I took all the college level courses.  Actually when we took the, I think it's the PSAT [Preliminary SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test)/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test], one of the standardized exams you took, I got, you know, I was one of the highest scorers in the state of Washington.  And so in fact that's when I even met the counselor, because you got your information back through the counselor.  She probably wouldn't have talked to me otherwise, but that was, at that time I got recognized.  They had to take a picture of me, you know, in the local paper and the principal had to pose, you know, with me.  "Student from Mead [High School] gets some high honor."  And so, I can say that the high school principal and the counselor treated me differently.  You know, they asked me questions after that, whereas before I'm, you know, wouldn't talk to me.  But I had a lot of good college offers.  I had an offer from Georgetown [University, Washington, District of Columbia].  I came and visited Georgetown.  I had a tour through here where we saw Georgetown, [The College of] William and Mary [Williamsburg, Virginia], and another school in this area, for undergrad.  You know, I got accepted to both of those schools.  I think it was Lexington College, or something like--it was a smaller school somewhere up here in Virginia.  I got accepted at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I applied, you know, people sent me an application, and I was getting--because of my score, I got, I think I got a lot of attention for that.  My grades were good.  I wrote pretty well.  And so, I had a lot of opportunities.  But I probably applied for a lot of those things to make my mother [Gloria Robinson Morris] happy, to be perfectly honest with you.  I really had no intention of going to college until two things happened.  One, I actually took a, we came down to Atlanta [Georgia] to visit one of my mother's friends.  He used to work at Whitworth College [Spokane, Washington].  He got a job at Emory [University] in Atlanta, Georgia.  So he came down to Atlanta and went through the Atlanta University Center.  And I was, I had to be a junior, I had to be going into my senior year, actually.  And went through, by Morehouse College, Spelman College and Clark Atlanta [University].  Yeah, I, you know, it's not a very, not an intellectual decision I made, but I saw a lot of beautiful girls (laughter).  I was like, you know, I could go here if I went to college (laughter).  And so, I think Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia] had given me a full ride, full ride scholarship; it's an AME [African Methodist Episcopal] based institution.  They gave me a full ride.  And I said well, maybe I'll go to Morris Brown.  But when we actually visited, then I--Morris Brown's reputation within the AU Center is not extremely strong, and I think even then they were having some financial and accreditation problems.  But when I went and visited, and they said "Oh, you've got a full scholarship, what can you do?  Oh, you can take your courses anywhere, don't worry about that."  It was too, I didn't get a good vibe.  So, I said I'll apply to Morehouse, you know, it's another school over here.  I really didn't know anything about its legacy, anything about the school.  I basically saw-man, you got all of these sisters over here (laughter)(unclear). I'll go here, you know, it's better than the [U.S.] Air Force.  And so I applied.  That was really my turning point.  You know, the final decision, again, I think was highly influenced by my father [Billy Verlette Morris] as well.
Speaker 2: Now, what did he get his degree in?
Speaker 1: I think he got his degree in, I think it was in business.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think it was business.
Story_ID: 26114
Speaker 1: What was the highest level of math you were able to take at Mead [High School, Spokane, Washington]?
Speaker 2: Calculus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were ready then?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They offered all the courses.  They just didn't want me taking them (laughter).  Yeah, I took AP [advanced placement], AP calculus.  I took AP physics.  I did not take AP chemistry.  I took chemistry, did not like the course, did not like the instructor.  It was just memorization to me.  I didn't, I wasn't learning how things worked.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it wasn't a lot of experimentation or active--.
Speaker 2: I don't remember any experimentation.
Speaker 1: That's sad.  At any rate, so Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], you chose Morehouse and--
Speaker 2: I chose Morehouse.
Speaker 1: Now, Morehouse has a strong chemistry program.
Speaker 2: Exceptionally strong chemistry program, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, this is 1981, you graduated from high school.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Now did you get any special recognition in high school, or did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got a lot of awards.  I got a lot of scholarships.  The SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test], I scored very well on.  I got another recognition for the SAT.  I did very well academically but--and my parents [Gloria Robinson Morris and Billy Verlette Morris] did an excellent job of conveying to me, you have no choice but to do well academically.  There is no course that you cannot get an A in, so get an A.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's what we did.  And so I never, I never found school difficult.
Speaker 1: Now did they, but did they, were you like valedictorian or anything?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't valedictorian.  You know, I was close.  I know the guy who--I missed valedictorian by, you know, the salutatorian--there was some politics associated.  There always is.  As I've found out with my daughter, there's always politics.  I wasn't straight As.  I got As and Bs, mostly As.  But if you're going to be--I never thought about those recognitions.  But when I was in high school it was just, I gotta take these, I gotta get a good grade in this class.  It's gotta basically be an A.  And if it's a B, I have to have a reason why I got a B, not an A.  But if you're really trying to be valedictorian, your mindset has to be, I can only get an A in every course.  And sort of, I didn't have that mindset.  My mindset wasn't I got to get an A in order to be valedictorian.   So, I remember the guy--I'm trying to remember the guy, because we were always in the same class, and we were always competing.  And from my recollection, he never got a better grade than I did.  But such is life.
Story_ID: 26115
Speaker 1: So Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Tell us about, so you go to Morehouse, and this is fall of '81 [1981].
Speaker 2: Fall of '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: Go to Morehouse, took the bus to Atlanta.
Speaker 1: From Spokane [Washington]?
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, your parents [Gloria Robinson Morris and Billy Verlette Morris] didn't go with you or anything?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't go with me.
Speaker 1: And they didn't fly you in--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or anything, but you, now do [U.S.] Air Force people get any discounts on flights, or--
Speaker 2: (laughter).  They probably do, I don't know, I don't know.  At the time, we were pretty independent.  We were pretty independent.  I had gone to France and England as part of an exchange program in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you spend a lot of time, I mean was a long--
Speaker 2: I think it was like a month, just a month.
Speaker 1: A month, okay.
Speaker 2: You know, we would travel to our relatives by ourselves.  You know, I started driving pretty early up there, because you know, there are back roads and stuff you can drive on and no one knows, so we were pretty independent.  And so, put me on--"Okay, you know where you need to go?"  "Yeah, okay."  You know, I knew how to read a map.  Looking back, it's kind of funny, but then, you know, my father was like, "Okay, you know what you need to do, right?"  "Yeah."  "You go."  So, I showed up with my suitcase and my tie and my only suit.  I think I walked in, I took--to get to Atlanta, and you can get the MARTA [Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority] to West End.  And then West End, you walk down this street.  And I had no clue how hot Georgia is in the summer (laughter).  And so I had, you know, I'm carrying my suitcase and walking down, you know--Freshman Week, walking down, and it was, it was early.  It was seven in the morning, because we got to the--seven or eight in the morning, it was early.  We got to the bus terminal, the Greyhound terminal pretty early, rode overnight obviously.  And got in there, and I was just drenched with sweat, walking down.
Story_ID: 26116
Speaker 1: I had planned on majoring in biology and psychology [at Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] because I wanted to be--I remembered the essay that I wrote, because strangely, my youngest daughter wrote an essay with almost the same idea.  And I hadn't told her--but wrote almost, a very similar essay.  What I want to do, be a doctor who operates on brains, but also understands the chemistry of the brain.  So I want to, you know, I want to do everything.  So that was my essay intent.  I ended up taking one psychology course and zero biology courses, because I ran into Henry McBay [chemist and teacher] as I was cutting through chemistry.  Henry McBay is a legend in chemistry.  And--
Speaker 2: He is indeed, and we've heard his name a million times--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in these series of interviews.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, he's, I think I was his last student, one of his last students--actually the guy from 3-M who worked with him.  But in terms of undergrads at Morehouse, I think I'm the last one to have, he have taught, mentored and gone on and gotten a Ph.D.  But I was cutting through, you know, I got to Morehouse.  And in college, of course, you have a lot more freedom than you can deal with.  So I missed early registration, could not register for biology.  And so, I'm running around campus trying to get the other courses that I need.  I was actually admitted into the Honors Program and I didn't get a scholarship, although it wasn't full.  They said since you're applying late for the scholarship, if you prove yourself you can get, you know, more money.  So, I was trying to fill up my registration, and I cut through Merrill Hall which is chemistry.  Racing through--and I'm trying to figure out what am I going to take besides my honors, you know?  I think it's an honor's pre-calc [calculus].  If you're in an Honor's Program, you have to start in pre-calc.  So I had honors history and pre-calc, and might have, even have some of that--Marcellus Barksdale [professor at Morehouse College], did you interview him?  You should if have not.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Historian at Morehouse.  But a brilliant guy.  So, I was cutting through, and I see this guy sort of come out of his office and I'm sort of rushing through, and he said "Young man, yound man, come here." (unclear) You know--"What are you doing, what's your major?"  And I said "Well, I haven't really declared a major.  It was going to be biology, but I can't get into biology."  "So, you have to take general chemistry."  So, I said, "Okay, I can take general chemistry."  And he said, "Well, you ought to major in chemistry."  "Well, I really don't like chemistry and, you know, I don't, I never liked it in high school."  He said, "Do you like math?"  I said, "Yeah, math is okay, I like math."  And he said, "Well, why don't you major in chemistry and math?"  And I was like, I just told this guy I didn't like chemistry. (laughter)  He said, "If you major in chemistry and math, I'll get all your books for you, and I'll give you this calculator."  I said, "Okay, (laughter), I can do that."  And, you know, my first year, I didn't have, you know, didn't have too much money.  I was like okay, I can do that.  So, I signed up for his, his course.  I ended up getting the only A out of his course.  But, you know, he was a maniac when he lectured.  I mean he was, I swear he was writing with both hands on the chalkboard.  And that lecture hall, it was a recessed lecture hall, and you had six chalkboards.  So, you had three, and then you could pull three down and write on those three.  And that guy used every board, every board.
Story_ID: 26117
Speaker 1: So we were just talking about Henry McBay [chemist and teacher at Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and his--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the legend of Henry McBay--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --amongst all the black chemists.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think he's definitely influenced a generation of African American chemists, certainly through Morehouse, but also through Clark Atlanta [University, Atlanta, Georgia].  And I wouldn't have made it in chemistry and math had it hadn't been for him.  I would have been on a completely different track, there's no doubt.  I used to go to him, I went to him throughout the four years I was there.  I never did research with him.  I actually did research with John Hall, Jr. [chemist; also a HistoryMaker], and really it was those two guys who--you know, that department changed my course significantly.
Speaker 1: Now, what made Henry McBay special, you know?  You talk about his ability to deliver all this information--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --but what actually made him special?
Speaker 2: You can tell he loved what he was doing.  I mean there's the, the joy that he had in figuring out a chemistry problem, or relaying knowledge was just, it was tangible.  And for me, not having particularly influential teachers--or teachers who could hold my attention, to sit in a lecture--and you know, my mouth is open the whole time.  And I'm seeing things that I never saw in the same way before.  And then, you could talk to him.  He was the easiest person, ever, to talk to.  I mean, and talk about anything, you know, from girls to, you know, mathematical organic chemistry.  And you know, that's, you know, you need a person like that, I think at an age where you can be influenced.  You're looking for guidance, you know, which way should I go?  And I was like, you know, that's a guy I'd like to, you know--he's relaxed, he's comfortable, he's doing what he loves.  And that's a job I'd like to do.  And I saw a similar thing in John Hall.  I mean, he really did the things, he appeared to be doing things the way he wanted to do them, on his terms.  He had a joint appointment between Morehouse and Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] at the time, you know.  Dr. McBay was known all over the world.  And he said, okay, I can master this area.  And I love math, and chemistry is okay, I can deal with chemistry.  And the physics department there--Carlisle Moore was another big influence of mine, an extremely difficult professor.  Very few people got As.  Henry Gore was my math professor.  So I was really fortunate to go to Morehouse at that time, when you really had these sort of giants of education in physical sciences and mathematics.  Just some outstanding people, and outstanding teachers as well.  They really knew the material, but they really knew how to convey the material and challenge you.  There was no, no slacking off in those classes.
Speaker 1: Now, was Benjamin Mays [minister, educator, scholar, social activist; president of Morehouse College from 1940 to 1967; mentor to Dr. Martin Luther King] president at that time?
Speaker 2: Now, Bennie Mays was not.  He had retired, maybe a year or two before I left, because I went to his memorial service while I was Morehouse.  Gloster, Hugh Gloster, was the president.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then Gloster left, and it was, I forgot his name.  It'll come to me.  But it was Hugh Gloster, it wasn't--
Speaker 1: Was it a Luther White, not Luther White--
Speaker 2: No, it was, he was a businessman, a business background.
Speaker 1: Well, don't worry about it.  We'll just--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it'll come to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But yeah, I believe I was fortunate.  You know, J.K. Haynes [biologist; also a HistoryMaker], J.K. is still there.  I go back and visit.  You know, Morehouse replaced my high school, in terms of a place that I would go back to and say, that's my formative development.  You know, Dr. Gore left, Henry Gore left.  But I think Dr. Moore just retired, but I go back and visit Dr. Moore, who was the chairman.  I majored in chemistry and math, minored in physics.  So once I got started there, you know, it was a great set of guys I was studying with, and just fantastic and motivating teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, if I could have triple majored in four years, I'd have done that.  You know, I loved the courses I was taking.
Story_ID: 26118
Speaker 1: And you say that you think that you were the last Ph.D. student that was instructed by Henry McBay [chemist and professor]?
Speaker 2: I think so, I think so.  We've looked, we, actually I just got an award in his name.  And now we're looking back--and I was talking to some of my colleagues there, and he had moved on.  He had left Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  He left Morehouse shortly after I got there, within a year after I got there.  He went to AU [Atlanta University] Center, and he really wasn't teaching any of the undergraduate courses anymore.  He had a graduate student at the time, one or two graduate students.   But in terms of undergrads at Morehouse, I think I was the last one that he instructed.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So, you're the last Morehouse Ph.D., I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the last Morehouse student that went on--
Speaker 1: Student--
Speaker 2: --to get his Ph.D., yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell us about Marcellus Barksdale.  You mentioned him earlier, and I--
Speaker 2: History professor.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, I was in the Honors Program at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And so I keep up with a lot of the guys who were in the Honors Program with me.  Or, I was in the Honor's Program with them.  But Marcellus Barksdale was the history professor, taught us honors history.  And, you know, history is one of those classes that I took because I had to take--and I did not conceptualize it the way that he did.  He really made it come alive.  You know, I mean, the thing that I experienced there that I had not yet experienced in life, was instructors who made the subject matter attractive enough that, you know, I want to learn more about this.  It was more--okay, you're going to throw some stuff out, and I gotta master the stuff you throw out.  Then, next, we go on to the next thing.  But a really interesting guy.  Just, his classes were like a performance.  I mean, I'd say between Dr. McBay and Marcellus Barksdale, Dr. Barksdale, the classes were like performances.  I mean in every class, you know, three days a week, you know, throughout the entire year, you'd go in.  And it's a performance through which you learn a huge amount of material, and are inspired to go and do what's assigned and read more.  And that's, that's unbelievable.

Speaker 1: So, socially, now did you join a frat [fraternity] or anything like that, or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous).  No, I didn't.  My father [Billy Verlette Morris], you know, was an Omega Psi Phi.  My brother was an Omega Psi Phi, but I did not--I started to.  And, you know, you have to go through a, what do they call them, the interest group, sort of route.  But I had a scholarship that allowed me to be at the institution.  By the year end, my brother's still in college.  My younger sister's in college.  I got another younger sister who's about to go to college, so I had to basically do it on my own.  And so, the scholarship was my way of doing it on my own.  So, from what I saw going on in the fraternities, people were losing scholarships.  And there was, you know, hazing was, you know, was really at an all-time high.  But probably the straw that broke the camel's back was they were trying to haze the interest group.  Which, you know, even if my mentality would allow me to submit myself to hazing--which it doesn't and it wouldn't have--it definitely is not going to do anything when neither one of us got any commitment here.  So, I ended up getting into a fight with one of the (laughter) Omegas, and that was the end of that.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: Well, I can almost predict--
Speaker 2: A physical altercation (laughter).  So--
Speaker 1: Okay, but, were there any service group clubs or anything else that you were involved in?
Speaker 2: We actually, we actually formed a wrestling--it was only--we formed a club, wrestling team, when I was there.  We formed a club, soccer team.  I think both of those are now university sports, which I'm glad.  We formed the, there was an African student--an international--I forgot what we called it.  But basically, it was a spin-off from the soccer club, the football club.  Because basically, everybody who played was from a different African country.  But then there was no real organization of the African students, so we called it the International--because I was a member and I wasn't from Africa--and we called it the International something.  So in terms of clubs, those were sort of the things--and 'Mathletes', I was part of the 'Mathletes', which was a math society--had a close-knit group of folks who majored in chemistry, a close-knit group of folks who majored in physics.  So there were things that weren't necessarily university clubs, but definitely that was the social groups I was in.
Story_ID: 26120
Speaker 1: The one activity [at Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] that probably influenced me a lot--I hadn't thought about until recently, having a conversation about, with an undergrad [undergraduate student] here [Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia]--about why I'm committed to outreach--But there was an organization called the Frederick Douglass Tutorial Institute, and it was actually funded by a Morehouse [College] alum.  It was completely run by students.  And I remember just seeing a flyer.  And basically what it was, was student volunteers would tutor kids from Atlanta public schools, from first grade through high school in whatever subject they were having problems in.  And so we took over, I think Douglass Hall or, you know--one of the buildings on the weekend, we'd just come in.  We'd have, you know, the kids would sign up and say I need help in English, or they'd say I need help in math.  And so, I was math, chemistry, physics--I was the science tutor.  So when that, you know--you basically solicited, volunteered to come up at eight o'clock Saturday morning.  The kids would come in, they'd sign up, sign up for what they need and then you'd assign them to different tutors.  And they'd go off to one of the classrooms, sit down at one of the desks, and you'd work with the student.  And you'd do that for about three hours and then the guy would bring in lunch.  You would buy, pay for lunch, and bring in donuts and sandwiches and juice for the kids, and that was it.  And by sophomore year, I was director.  I can't even remember who was director when I came in, but once I started doing that, I was, I don't know why I was so wedded to it.  And so I directed that, I think, for three years.  I handed it off to, passed it off, I think to Calvin Thomas [ph.], who was a Morehouse brother from Bermuda.  And then I think he passed it off to another brother.  Hopefully, it's still going.  I don't even know.  But that took up a lot of time as well, because what we tried to do was develop it a little bit better.  So we advertised across more of D.C. [District of Columbia], actually structured some exercises that the kids could have.  Started, you know, interacting with the kids beyond that, so that during the week we would try to go to some of the schools where a lot of the kids came from and just, you know, show them that, you know, we really want you to do well.  And it's not babysitting on a Saturday morning but, you know, if you came and got help from me, you better be showing up for school, and you better be doing your work.  And so, that ended up taking up more and more time as I went on.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That sounds like a worthy thing to do.
Speaker 1: It was.  It was fun.  I found it fun.  I actually joined Big Brothers, and I had a little brother, a little sister, adopted really a family of kids who were struggling at first.  But, just bright kids, but they just, you know, gotta get focused.  And so, that took up a lot of time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 26121
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever take part in one of Henry McBay's [chemist and professor] quizzes [at Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]?  He used to do that, and--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah--
Speaker 1: --where he would just get all the students and he'd quiz everybody or, there was some kind of--do you know what I'm talking about?
Speaker 2: Well, he had a seminar which was--so if you say, "Sign up for my seminar," you think I'm going to go and someone else is going to speak, at least that was my concept.  But what it would be would, he would definitely challenge you to articulate what you know, and help develop in you the confidence to say something that's technically accurate.  And you have every confidence that you're right, no matter how much you're attacked.  That's what his seminars were like.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The quizzes that I had, I took him for General Chemistry 1, my introductory chemistry course.  So his quizzes were like exams.  They were very in-depth.  But again, if you listened to him lecture and if you followed what he was trying to tell you, you know, you could do well, I think you could do well.  But he had very high standards, always challenged you once, especially once he knew you.  He would not accept you coming in and sort of, you know, half-assing it.  You know, it's not acceptable.  And he had a seminar.  He came and got--so I took one course, took my first course from him.  And then he ended up leaving Morehouse but he taught a seminar in, I think, mathematical organic chemistry, which--I was like, "What is that?" you know.  So, he was like, "Oh, you should take it, you're a math major.  It'll be fine for you."  It turned out it was more, it was molecular orbital theory.  Didn't start off as a molecular orbital theory, it started off looking like synthetic organic chemistry, which I just don't do.  And so, yeah, I got hammered at first.  He was just, you know, he was killing me.  But then when it got to actually structural orbitals and how orbitals interact, and more of the physical aspects of organic, it got better.  But he showed no mercy in class if you were unprepared, none whatsoever.  But it wasn't personal.  It was, okay, next time you come in here, you need to know that, plus whatever else we go to.  And it was just, for me, it was what I needed.  And it was, he challenged you and you got to meet the challenge.  But that kept you, kept you engaged.
Story_ID: 26122
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a chance to explore Atlanta or the Georgia area?  Did you, you know, your penchant for wandering off and looking for--did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did, a lot.  You know, there's a lot of schools in Atlanta.  So, yeah, I explored.  I, my general experience, if I go to a new city is I jump on the bus and I ride the bus around town.  I take, you know, the first couple weekends I'm just going to ride the bus and I'm going to see where everything is.  And I'll ride it until I'm comfortable visualizing the map of the city, and then I won't get lost.  So, I did a lot of that in Atlanta.  I learned Atlanta pretty quick.  In Georgia, I, you know, Jesse Jackson [civil rights activist and Baptist minister; candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988] ran for president in, while I was in school.
Speaker 1: That was '84 [1984].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I guess you were a like a junior--
Speaker 2: And so I campaigned for Jesse [Jackson] throughout Georgia, and was very active in the voter education project, which--what was this guy's name?  Willie McCain?  I don't even know how I met this guy.  But through the voter education project, you had to team up with people, and then you would ride to rural Georgia and try to convince people to register to vote.  And so I rode in a pickup truck through a lot of southern Georgia, a lot of it.  And met a lot of people and saw a lot of things I hadn't seen before.  But learned a lot about Georgia through that program.  Yeah, so I did travel a lot in Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And plus, once you're in an HBCU [historically black colleges and universities]--I didn't go home for the holidays, for Thanksgiving or for Spring Break or any of those things.  I didn't have the money, and I didn't, you know, you'd chew up two and a half days on a bus and two and a half days back.  Why go?  So, you know, we'd go to other HBCUs.  So I'd, someone would have a car.  We'd drive to Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] or we'd drive to Bennett [College, Greensboro, North Carolina], or we'd drive to wherever.  So there was a lot of exploration in the Southeast.  In fact, I tell a lot of folks now--I guess it's gone now.  Freaknik [annual spring break meeting in Atlanta] started when I was there.  It was the D.C. Club's spring break, because no one had money to go anywhere.  And I was, you know, I hung out with some of the folks from D.C. [Washington, District of Columbia], because there was no Washington State Club. (laughter)  So I was like, I'm going to hang out with you guys, you're from Washington, from a different Washington, but we hang out.  And so the first Freaknik--we used to go up to, there's a park on Cascade Road, I forgot the name of park.  But we'd just go and cook out.  The first ones were--literally, we would scrape some money together and get some hot dogs, get some hamburger, get some buns, you know, get some beer.  And we're just going to hang out in the park.  And it really was like that up until about the last year I left.  Junior, senior year, the D.C. Club got much bigger, and so it got to be a bigger D.C. Club thing.  But then after I left, it just, you know, blew up.  In fact, I think Brian still promotes parties and stuff, so does Pierre.  But--
Speaker 1: They were the leaders of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --D.--
Speaker 2: Yeah, D.C. Club, D.C. Metro Club, because they're folks from Maryland and D.C., primarily.  But some of the guys liked to promote parties anyway.  And so I think they promoted a little bit, it started to pick up some steam, and once we graduated, they franchised it basically.  It turned into something, you know, turned into an Atlanta--you know, I don't know what it was.  I mean, I didn't recognize it.  It wasn't like that when we were there, though.  It was just, it was a low-key, go hang out and have a good time thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's really crazy now.  I mean it's--
Speaker 2: It's berserk, yeah.  You can see it on the web.  I was like, you know, (laughter) we just used to go cook out because we were broke.  (laughter)
Story_ID: 26123
Speaker 1: Now, when you were at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], did you become interested in atmospheric science?
Speaker 2: That came through research.  So I started research early with John Hall [chemist, also a HistoryMaker].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, the research that he was doing was basically physical chemistry.  And John Allen and Subhash Bhatia were sort of a team, a pair of colleagues.  Subhash worked for John Hall in his lab.
Speaker 1: Now, Su--
Speaker 2: Subash, S-U-B-H-A-S-H, last name Bhatia, B-H-A-T-I-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he had a research group.  He had some graduate students from Atlanta University, some undergraduates like me from Morehouse, and some other graduates from Spelman [College, Atlanta].  And so, he was a theoretical chemist, but he was applying theoretical chemistry to molecules of interest to stratospheric chemistry, because at the time, the ozone hole was a big deal.  Now they've just discovered it, why are we seeing the ozone getting eaten out over the Southern Pole, southern polar stratosphere?  Nobody really had an answer.  There's a lot of debate whether it was chemistry, whether it was dynamics, whether it was some combination.  And he also did some experiments on matrix isolation.  And so, I remember growing up and saying I want to get a job, I needed a job.  And him saying, "Do you know how to program?"  And I had taken a single Fortran course.  But you know, I knew machine language in binary.  So I said "Yeah, I know how to program," which was not true.  And he gave me, he gave me a stack of--at that time you had these printouts, computer printouts, of these long green sheets perforated as dot matrix printouts.  That was the code.  So he gave this binder that was about as thick as that bag, of code.  And he said, "This program doesn't work, I need you to fix it."  And that was my introduction to research with John Hall.  He probably--I'm sure he remembers it.  He'll laugh about it, if I told him that.  So, I sweat bullets, and then he left town.  He had to go to someplace on, (laughter) for business, or he went to China or something like that.  And he said, "When I get back, you know, fill me in."  There was no e-mail at that time, really.  I mean there was e-mail, but not as we know it now.  So, he went to China--forget it, you're not sending an e-mail back to Morehouse College for me to check in.  So basically, he was gone.  And so I was sweating bullets, trying to make this program work.  I got it to work, but when he got back he didn't even ask for it.  He said, "Okay, this is what I want you to do."  And he assigned me to some other--a completely different project.  (laughter)  Like, I need to tell him that.  He was just up here in [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia] and we were talking, we were talking about a bunch of different stuff.  I need to tell him that story.  But he assigned me to a completely different project.  I went and started working on the matrix isolation.  But I did learn, I did learn coding much better.  I learned, one of the first local area networks actually was at, was a project, a joint project between Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Morehouse.  So, Morehouse College had one of the first local area networks on a college campus, which was amazing.  But there locally, we got used to it such that when I went to other places setting up networks and programming, I actually knew how to do.  But I started working on matrix isolation experiments.  And those experiments actually take about ten to twelve hours to run, because you got to cool something down from room temperature, basically 300 degrees cool, you know.  So that takes a while.  And then you run your experiments.  So once you get your cold finger to about ten degrees K [kelvin], then you can start to run your experiment.  But it takes you a long time to cool things down that low.
Story_ID: 26124
Speaker 1: Now, what kind of experiment are you actually doing [with HistoryMaker, John Hall, at Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: So what we wanted to do is, we had a proposal for a specific type of short-lived molecule that we thought would deplete the ozone, or was responsible for depleting the ozone.  And so most of the research was, we had a couple different types of research.  But the one that I was involved in had to do with short-lived chemical intermediates and how very unstable, very short-lived chemical intermediates, can influence the chemistry of the atmosphere.  Some played a role in the stratospheric ozone depletion.  Some played a role just in lower atmospheric chemistry.  Some played a role in upper atmospheric chemistry.  But we wanted to really focus in on a technique that would allow us to isolate and characterize these short-lived intermediates.  And so the technique basically freezes it out of the gas phase.  So, all the molecules in this room present--are flying around a couple thousand miles an hour.  How do you, if something lives for a fraction of a second, how do you isolate it?  You freeze it.  So, if I can take something that's generated, but may only live for, you know, a millisecond, or a microsecond--if I create it in a matrix--so basically isolate it in a matrix of cold atoms, then it can't move.  And if it can't move, it can't react, which means it can't do anything.  It's got to stay there.  And if I keep it cold enough, it can't thermally fall apart.  So at ten degrees Kelvin, which is minus 260 degrees [Celsius] or so, you can freeze certain types of molecules.  You can fix them into a lattice.  And so, that technique allowed us to create and isolate very short-lived species.  And then you characterize them with infra-red spectroscopy or Raman spectroscopy.  And what you can do with those experiments then is compare that to model calculations.  And thus, verify that, okay, not only, you know, I have in fact created what I thought I created, now can I do some chemistry with it?  And so, it was a series of projects like that I started to learn physical chemistry and atmospheric chemistry, ultimately.  So I'm more of an applied physical chemist.  What I look at in terms of atmospheric chemistry is, really, what are the reactions that occur in the atmosphere that influence large-scale processes that may be in weather or climate or chemical composition?  And so, the techniques I apply are basically physical chemistry techniques, a lot of laser based techniques, or things like that, at that point in time.
Story_ID: 26125
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, you were in the early stages of computational chemistry, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think in terms of where it is right now with a lot of commercially available programs--really slick front ends--there was a much greater need to, a lot more uncertainty in the commercially available models.  So, you still had to program.  You still had to develop a lot of code at that time.  And so people were sort of actively developing code.  And during that time, even as an undergrad [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] I was still modeling, I was still writing code for models.  But it was, it was really, I think that the technology, the computational technology, was really developing rapidly while I was an undergrad and through my graduate career.  So, you went from basically having, you know, writing letters and calling on the phone, to internet and local area networks--to wide area networks and high throughput computing to the internet--you know, being widely available to everybody.  And so that really accelerated what you can do.  You know, between the time I started as an undergrad, running, you know, Gaussian 84 (unclear) something--Gaussian 80, I think is what it was.  It was some really early, you know, alpha version of code to, you know, my post doc [postdoctoral training] when, you know, we were doing (unclear) space calculations.  It was just a world of difference.  You know, it was like from rotary phones to cell phones.
Speaker 1: This was really a time of intense technological change.
Speaker 2: It was.  It really was.  It really was.  You know, the lasers, you know, the stability of lasers from the time I started till the time I finished, was completely different--the time scale of pulses, you know.  Pulse width probably dropped by easily fours of magnitude, you know.  You know, a thousand times shorter pulse width with control, with coherent control during that time.  So the types of experiments that you could do in probing transient species, you know, and characterizing transient species--their quantum mechanics, their structure, their reactivity, their potential energy surface--which was really not possible when I was a graduate student.  It just improved by leaps and bounds, I mean generations of change over a five year period, six year period.
Story_ID: 26126
Speaker 1: So, when you were on the verge of graduating from Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], then what were you, what were your--Now, you stayed in Georgia?
Speaker 2: I stayed in Georgia.
Speaker 1: And went to Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta].  But did you have any other options?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And why did you stay in Georgia?
Speaker 2: Why did I stay in Georgia?  I stayed in Georgia because, largely because my first daughter was born.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that implies that you met--
Speaker 2: Yes. (laughter)
Speaker 1: --the mother.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did meet the mother--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) I was thinking that, because--
Speaker 2: Yes, I--
Speaker 1: Did you meet your wife at Morehouse or--
Speaker 2: I met her while I was at Morehouse, about my senior year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so she, we had a daughter, Courtney, first daughter.  And born in '85 [1985].  So, that was the year I graduated.  So, I had options at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] and [University of California] Berkeley, largely because John Hall [chemist; also a HistoryMaker; Morris' undergraduate research mentor] was from Harvard, got his Ph.D. [degree] at Harvard.  So, you know, the selections of schools and the acceptances were largely driven by the folks who'd influenced me as an undergrad.  So, Troy Story and Jim King were out at--Bill Lester [chemist, also a HistoryMaker], were out at Berkeley.  John Hall had gone to Harvard.  He had some partnerships, some relationships with the folks at Ohio State.  And Ohio chemical physics was a pretty strong department.  They were doing some things that I was quite interested in--and then Georgia Tech, where John Hall also was as well.  And so, those were the only four or five schools I applied to.  I got accepted to all of them.  I chose Georgia Tech because I didn't see myself being separated from my daughter.  And I know--I tend to focus a lot--if I get into something that's challenging--I saw grad school as being something that really was going to be consuming.  And it would be tough to be successful, particularly in those programs, which are very, those are top programs in the area.  So I was looking at either physical chemistry programs, chemical physics, or atmospheric sciences.  And so, I looked at programs that were at the top in those disciplines.  And so to compete--what I expected was that if you go into one of the top programs, chances are you're going to be the only African American.  So the odds are going to be against you from the start.  And having distractions or--that's not going to cut it.  You could end up not doing well in any arena.  So, if I stay close to my daughter, that takes that load off my mind, and I can focus on the research and the study at Georgia Tech.
Story_ID: 26127
Speaker 1: And at the time, Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] was one of the top programs, still is, one of the top programs in atmospheric sciences in the country.  They had an outstanding reputation in terms of integrating engineering and atmospheric sciences, a lot of field programs where you develop instrumentation and put it on aircraft, on mobile platforms.  It was extremely well-known in terms of modeling atmospheric chemical modeling and cloud microphysical modeling.  So it was a good place to go.  It was a smaller department, they were very multi-disciplinary.  And the only problem was once I got there, John Hall left, I think about two years into my tenure there.  So I was without--and I think he left right after I got into candidacy.  So it might have been my third year.  But my second and third year, my primary advisor left, which can be traumatic, I guess.  But the good thing is that he had prepared me pretty well, because he put a very high premium on publishing your work.  And so by the time I'd gotten to that point, I think I had, you know, five or six publications already.  So--
Speaker 2: You mean by the time you got to the point of graduating from--
Speaker 1: Oh, no.  By the time I got to candidacy, just two or three years in.
Speaker 2: Okay, alright.
Speaker 1: So, any questions on whether I was a productive graduate student were already put to rest.  I was more productive than any other graduate student probably in the department at that point and time.
Speaker 2: Now, did you take time to savor a master's degree, or did you just go straight through?
Speaker 1: Straight through.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Straight through.  Straight through was a better choice for me.  And you know, the master's program there is a consolation.  So, if you don't get to Ph.D. candidacy, then you get the master's, or if--a few people in that particular program went to get a master's.  And--
Speaker 2: Okay, so you started there in '85 [1985]?
Speaker 1: I started in '85' [1985].
Speaker 2: Okay.  And you finished in 1990, but--
Speaker 1: I finished in '90 [1990].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 26128
Speaker 1: Can you tell us what your dissertation was about [at Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Dissertation was a theoretical and experimental investigation of, I think, short-lived inorganic compounds of stratospheric significance.  It's a mouthful.  But what I was looking at was basically--were basically, short-lived intermediates--chlorine oxides and nitrogen oxides that are formed, but either react very quickly or fall apart--very chemically unstable--that influence ozone depletion.  And so, I did the computational chemical calculations and coupled that with, coupled that with experiments, and then performed an analysis to show what this would mean in terms of larger scale chemistry.  So chemistry on the scale of, excuse me, regional chemistry.  So, I presented that at the time.  They said it was one of the best thesis presentations given in the department.  And I finished with about ten or twelve publications, total.  So, that was, I was productive as a grad student.
Speaker 1: So this was continuation of what you were doing at Morehouse [College, Atlanta]?
Speaker 2: It's a continuation--well, it's, I started out, well, I learned the techniques.  So, we really didn't get the papers published until I'd gotten to grad school.  So we worked on, it was a continuation of the work that John Hall [chemist, also a HistoryMaker] was doing.  So, he was looking at chlorine nitrates.  And what I've--eventually it was chlorine oxides and nitrogen oxides.  And so, a different family of species, but it, really addressing some of the same issues.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And answering some of the same questions that you--
Speaker 2: Trying to get at some of the same questions.  Certainly the stratospheric ozone was the same question.  What we began to explore, was some of them was actually the nature of the inner--the transition states that would lead to these unstable species.  Was there something unique about how reactants get to products on the potential energy surface that dictates stability?
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your findings basically expanded the knowledge of this--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) by examining how another chemical process--
Speaker 2: By looking at different chemical processes.  By looking at the actual potential energy surface and what role it plays, looking at a feature, the transition state, and what role it plays in determining stability of the ultimate products.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we also looked, sort of looked at other roles of these inorganic peroxides in the atmosphere as well.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26129
Speaker 1: Now just in, maybe in simple, in the simplest possible terms, what is destroying the ozone?  I mean, what is the worst perpetrator, I guess, in terms of destroying the ozone?
Speaker 2: It's probably nitrogen oxide.  In general, it's pollutants that come from combustion of fossil fuels.  So, any motor or anything that's burning gasoline puts out nitrogen oxides, a class of compounds which catalytically destroy ozone.  And so, the problem with it is not that for every one molecule of pollutant you destroy one molecule of ozone.  It's for every one molecule of pollutant, you destroy ten thousand molecules of ozone, because as it destroys it, it regenerates itself.  And so, that means you keep cycling, and destroying very rapidly.  And so that's the threat of chlorofluorocarbons [CFCs] which have been outlawed or restricted, to a large extent.
Speaker 1: Those are the contents of aerosol--?
Speaker 2: The contents of aerosol cans, of refrigerants.  At the time, some lubricants.  It gets into the atmosphere, and it's so long-lived that it gets up into the stratosphere.  And when it breaks down, it breaks down into very reactive molecules that catalytically destroy.  And there's no place for them to go.  When you get in the stratosphere, you stop moving up and you can't move down.  So you just get stuck in a particular layer, and unfortunately it's in that protective ozone layer that you get stuck in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so you don't want those pollutants getting into that stable stratospheric layer.
Speaker 1: Now what's the danger if they do?  You know, I mean, this--
Speaker 2: The danger if they do is if that layer thins, then we have a lot more UV [ultraviolet] radiation at the surface of the earth.  So your melanomas, your skin cancers, are going to go up.  Mutations from, you know, very basic ecosystems through more complex systems are going to increase.  Heating is going to increase.  So, the warming of the surface of the earth is going to increase.  So it's a cascade of effects, none of which are very positive.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26130
Speaker 1: Now, we have a large segment of the population that seem to believe that there's warming going on, and all of this is--
Speaker 2: It's--so global warming is--the average temperature of the earth is a useful metric in evaluating model performance.  It's probably not the best way of conveying what the impact of global warming actually is.  So, if one indicator of human health is--could be reddening of the face.  And it is.  But you're never going to see my face get red.  Does that mean I never get sick?  No, it doesn't mean that.  So, a single indicator is good for a lot of purposes.  But it doesn't mean that that's the only thing that will tell you what's going on.  It's useful, and it does.  So, you know, the global, the average temperature of the earth, is warming.  Does everybody experience it the same way?  Absolutely not.  Does the fact that everybody doesn't experience it exactly the same way mean that it's not happening?  No.  So, we've got to look at a variety of indicators that the global environment is changing in a way that's being influenced by what people are doing, and that's really the question.  You know, the earth is going to cycle through--ice ages and warmer periods.  Yes, it always does, and it will.  So, is climate change real?  Yes, it's always been.  Because if you believe that there was an Ice Age at any point and time in the past, it's not an Ice Age now.  So guess what?  It warmed.  Now, to get to the real question.  Do we have any influence on our environment?  I think if you ask any sensible person, is what people are doing, industrializing their living space, influencing the environment.  You have to say yes, it is.  The whole purpose of industrialization is to influence the environment.  And if you, you know, if you industrialize enough of the earth's surface, you're going to influence the globe, the global environment.  And it really is--on first principle, it's that simple.  Now, is it irreversible?  Does it affect, you know, millennial behavior of the earth's system?  Well, that's a good question, and we don't have all the answers to that.  But we definitely have answers to impacts on decadal kind of scales and time scales that are generational, that will affect our children and may affect our children's children.  And we've got to take a more intelligent approach.  I don't mean to advocate--get off my soapbox now--but, and, sometimes scientists have not done an outstanding job of conveying what the science means, and especially in terms of the global warming.  And so it's become politicized.  And people lock onto this, you know, well, it's not warmer in, you know, so-and-so.  Okay, but maybe it's winter there.  (laughter)  It's okay.  You know, but we could do a better job.  We have to do a better job.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And that's an area that I've evolved into.  Certainly, environmental issues I think are extremely important to me personally and in my career.  And so, we've got to be careful as to what we do.  I mean, the ozone hole is a great example.  It's that that, there's a natural process by which ozone thins over the poles.  But the fact that it was actually thinning to the degree that it was in the '80s [1980s], was influenced by human activity.  And there were, there are global implications of that.  And there are issues that are happening at the North Pole now, that are being influenced by human activity, and there will be global implications of that.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26131
Speaker 1: When you finished your Ph.D. [degree; at Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), Atlanta, Georgia], that was at, was it, did you find it like a tough process, you know?
Speaker 2: It was difficult.  It was challenging.  It was, you know, a Ph.D. is meant to be challenging.  It's, it's an endeavor that you should grow through.  It's a solitary sort of thing.  You're on your own and you're tasked with creating some new knowledge, something that's going to advance the field, demonstrating to a very critical group of peers that you belong, that you should be credentialized in the same way that they're credentialized.  And I think that's, that is difficult.  It was meant to be difficult.  It was at Georgia Tech.  Georgia Tech was a very, a tough environment.  It's a very competitive environment.  And they pride themselves on being competitive, and that only a few get through.  But on the other hand, there's a lot of resources there.  Their integration of engineering throughout the curriculum, even the graduate curriculum, is admirable.  I like how they've done that.  The program that we designed here [Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia] is largely patterned off the inter-disciplinarity of the program that I went through.  I think it really brings a strength if people can adapt.  But it was tough.  There weren't any other, there were some Africans who were in the department.  They did not move through.  I was the first African American to get their Ph.D. from that program.  And it was easily ten years later, ten or twelve years later, before the second one got it.  The third one was actually a student from Howard University, who just finished not too long ago.  And the fourth finished just last year.  So, the program has not significantly increased its diversity in the last thirty years.  So, in fact, we've produced more African American Ph.D.s in atmospheric sciences here at Howard in the last ten years, as that program has in the last fifty [years].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, well--
Speaker 2: But there were good friends there though.  I had some really good friends, friends I still keep in contact--some Chinese students who are back in China, guys who are still down in the Atlanta area, guys out at NCAR [National Center for Atmospheric research, Boulder, Colorado].  So, the program was small.  I think the students within the program were competitive, but not in the cut-throat way that there's a lot throughout the campus.
Story_ID: 26132
Speaker 1: You know, I took courses [at Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), Atlanta, Georgia] in engineering, took courses in physics, took courses in math, took courses in chemistry.  And there, I was not invited to any study groups until I set the curve for the class.  And then people knew my name.  But in some of the classes where, you know, it was eighty people in laser physics--you know, there was eighty, a hundred and something people in the class--and multiple choice exams.  You just kind of go through, you know.  Nobody spoke to me until almost the, I think it was about the final.  And they had figured out, you know, that's the guy who's getting the high score.  You know, in chemistry, the same way--I took some courses.  But in chemistry I had a good, you know, I had a good relationship with some of the professors in chemistry because the classes were a little bit smaller.  And the way I took notes--I was advised--I forgot who gave me the advice, but when I got to grad school they advised me, take notes as if you will have to teach the course the next semester, and you'll get an A.  And they were right.  And so, one of the professors noticed me taking notes.  The way I took notes is I would take very copious notes during the class and I would go get the books that were referenced in the class, and I would fill in the notes or rewrite the notes.  So, my notes for a class looked like a book.  They literally looked like a book.  And so, one of the professors, you know, noticed my notebook, you know.  And halfway through the semester I had, you know, a three ring binder that was just, it was filling up-he was like, you know,  "Are those your notes?"  I was like, "Yeah, these are my notes," you know.  "No problem."  "Can I see them?"  "Yeah."  He looks at them and he says, "Are these my lectures?" (laughter)  I was like, "Well, they're kind of your lectures."  (laughter)  "They're my notes from your lectures.  But if you say, go--I took this from, you know, Reich [ph.; textbook], then I'm going to go and check Reich out of, you know, the library and I'm going to see what you missed and what I missed, and I'm going to fill it in.  So when I go back and study, I got it."  And so, he actually made copies of my notes to use as his lecture notes, which I thought was, "Okay, that's good, I must be on the right track."
Speaker 2: Sounds like it.
Story_ID: 26133
Speaker 1: Now, who ended up being your advisor for Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Doug Davis.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, Doug Davis is an atmospheric chemist, has a physical chemist background, but an atmospheric chemist in the atmospheric sciences program at Georgia Tech.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Where did [John] Hall [chemist; also a HistoryMaker] go after, I mean, you know, Dr. Hall?
Speaker 2: He went to, he's back at Morehouse [College, Atlanta] now.  But he went to, went to Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio], and then he formed his own company.  But he went into the private sector for a while.  He was actually doing motivational speaking for some time with Bill Gillery.  William Gillery?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.  William Gillery, right.
Speaker 2: So, the lineage that I come through--John Hall, Bill Gillery, goes back to Dolphus Milligan.  I worked at a place called Dolphus E. Milligan Science Research Institute.  Dolphus Milligan was one of the pioneers of the matrix isolation technique.  I think he was out of [University of California] Berkeley.  And so, and that was sort of the connection back to Berkeley as well.  Bill Gillery, I think went to Berkeley.  And so, these were guys who basically brought that technique to Morehouse, and I used that laboratory for some of the work that I did at Georgia Tech.
Story_ID: 26134
Speaker 1: When you finished your Ph.D. [degree; at Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), Atlanta, Georgia], I have a note here that you went to work with NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization], Advanced [Study Institute, Erice, Italy]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went out to--one of my regrets, I guess--. When I finished my Ph.D., I finished in December.  I finished in the summer.  I had some strange advice.  I had published a number of papers--
Speaker 1: 1990, right?
Speaker 2: 1990.  And so, I'd imagined I was going to finish in the spring of 1990, in May, in March, you know, do the graduation ceremonies.  But when I got ready, I was writing up my thesis, the advice I got was, "Hey, you published a bunch of papers.  All you got to do is put your papers together and put an introduction on it, and you'll be fine."  Well, I took that literally, and obviously naively.  No one's going to let a thesis like that get out of their university.  So, when I realized that, it was too late to actually put a thesis together, because even then you're still typing your thesis at that time.  It was in 1989, 1990--you may have a word processor, but a word processor--still you're typing on the word processor, and I'm not a skilled typist by any stretch of the imagination.  So, I could not finish in May.  So I spent the summer--this graduation ceremony is in May--I missed the summer putting my thesis together, and turned it in as soon as the fall semester started.  But then I needed to get a job, and I basically took a scholarship from NATO to go and study in Erice, Sicily, on I think it was cosmos chemistry.  It was basically a chemistry of the interstellar medium.  And so, my philosophy for going out from my Ph.D., was I wanted to go out and get some new experiences, sort of expand my technical skill-set--my technical toolkit--learn more about the field and try to get, make some new contacts.  So, I was there--I went there for basically the rest of the year to study, learn about interstellar molecular grains.  So, in space there are these clouds.  Or, mass tends to condense in space--gases and particles--which are called dust.  And in those clouds of gas and dust, there's some unique chemistry that's going on.  You start to get star-forming regions and planatestimal forming regions, and these dictate the nature of stars and planets in more distant parts of the galaxy, which was interesting to me.  A little on the esoteric side, but it was interesting and was challenging from a mathematical physical chemistry perspective.  And I didn't speak any Italian.  I spoke some French and English, but there they speak primarily Italian.  If you leave the school, they speak Italian.  But it was nice, culturally it was a nice change.  I wanted to get away from Georgia Tech.  I was actually pretty drained from being at Georgia Tech, mentally.  So I wanted a break.  And the only regret is I did not march across any stage for my Ph.D.  I said mail it to me, that's fine.  I was ready to leave.
Speaker 1: Was your family upset about that at all?
Speaker 2: My mother [Gloria Robinson Morris] wasn't happy about that one.  I explained to my father [Billy Verlette Morris].  I think he understood, you know.  A lot of frustration going through--it's a tough system to go through.  I think it's tougher on African Americans, differentially.  And there's no real, how do you say, support system.  And so, the Ph.D. is tough enough by itself.  But when you really don't have a support system, it makes it even more difficult.  And that's why there's so much attrition there, actually.  Their support systems actually need a little more.  They've developed in engineering.  Gary May [electrical engineer; also a HistoryMaker] over there has done an excellent job.  But it doesn't extend beyond--it's starting to develop in chemistry because it's gotten a lot more students in chemistry--a lot more receptiveness in chemistry there if you hired some African American professors in chemistry.  But in the physics department, in the math department, in atmospheric sciences, it really hasn't changed since the '80s [1980s].
Story_ID: 26135
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how long did you spend in Sicily [NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) Advanced Study Institute, Erice, Italy]?
Speaker 2: Just a couple months.  It was just to the end of, the end of 1990.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, in 1992, I guess you did, this is a post-doctoral fellowship at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories [Livermore, California], was it?
Speaker 2: I should have been in there in '91 [1991] to '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: '91 [1991] to '92 [1992], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went out to Lawrence Livermore National Labs.  I was in the physics, computational physics division.  That is where I learned that I did not want to code for a living.  So, I picked up a lot of skills between undergrad and graduate school.  And one was programming, I could program.  What they wanted me to do out there--and that was--during that time, object oriented coding and programming was on the rise.  In fact, the first, one of Steve Jobs' [late co-founder, chairman and CEO of Apple, Inc.] first products was called the NeXTstation.  I don't know if anybody remembers that.  It was a black workstation.  Then, workstation development was actually spinning up there, too.  So, you're getting a super computer on your desk, or some machine, a computational machine that was somewhere in between the PC or the desktop computer, and the mainframe computer.  Because mainframes were still these big, you know, they weren't room-sized anymore, but they were half room-sized modules.  So, if you wanted to do something, do more powerful modeling, you wanted this desktop workstation.  So, the challenge I got was to start, do the coding, to modify computationally intensive programs and develop these front ends that commercial users or--would make--facilitate, more people to use programs like, you know, molecular dynamics programs or computational chemistry programs or kinetics programs.  So, the idea is, if I go and I build my model for the kinetics of Saturn's--kinetics of any atmosphere--I know the code and I know how to use the program because I wrote it.  But chances are, as a scientist writing code, nobody else would be able to use it.  What object oriented code did was, in front of all that computational coding, it put in an interface, much like the interfaces you see on just about every program now, where you can slide a button if you want more intensity in your volume, a slider.  At that point, that didn't exist, actually in coding.  You had to go into some control screen and type commands.  And so, what I was doing there was actually creating those interfaces, that someone could come in and basically run research code the same way you would run an app [application], basically on your cell phone or iPad or anything like that.  And it was useful.  I saw the utility of it, but it wasn't science.  And I did not enjoy not doing science.  And Lawrence Livermore is another isolated environment, very 'cubicle-ized.'  So, you come in, it's in the middle of nowhere.  It's a compound in the middle of nowhere.  And then your building is isolated from the other buildings.  And then you work in a cubicle inside an isolated building in the middle of nowhere.  And that was--
Speaker 1: That seems to be kinda like-- (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (simultaneous)--Oh, my "God."  Yeah, it was just the worst (laughter)--  It was de-motivating.  So, I finished that and then I went to the University of California.
Story_ID: 26136
Speaker 1: Okay, this is the University of California at Davis?
Speaker 2: At Davis, yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: That's the one with the talking eggheads, I think on the campus.  There's a sculpture of these two--
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: --eggheads talking.
Speaker 2: I don't know if I was--I don't know if I was there when that was there.  I might be Davis.  They've really grown since I was there.  It was the bicycle campus when I went.  And when I worked with another Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] alumni, William Jackson, Bill Jackson [also a  HistoryMaker].  If you haven't interviewed him, you should interview him.  And that's back in physical chemistry.  So, I went to the chemistry department there and I worked in physical chemistry.  And it was back to science, and developing laser based systems that would look at chemistry that was relevant to interstellar medium.  So, I kind of circled back to some of the things that I had explored in Sicily [Italy, at the NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) Advanced Study Institute], but now developing instrumentation that will allow me to simulate processes that occurred in comets or interstellar molecular clouds or extra-solar atmosphere.  And so, infrared chemiluminescence experiments, time-resolved experiments, laser induced fluorescence.  Bill Jackson is one of the co-founders of a technique called laser induced fluorescence.  Actually he developed it here [Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia]--between here and NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Goddard [Maryland], Howard University and NASA Goddard--he was at NASA Goddard for a while, came to Howard University.  And so, propagated some techniques there, and did quite a bit of computational chemistry to support the time-resolved experiments that we conducted.  Actually, I set up the network in his lab.  That was when the primary internet tool was Mosaic.
Story_ID: 26137
Speaker 1: And Gopher--there were these--bulletin boards were probably the best way of accessing the internet at that time.  So we moved from that to, from bulletin boards and Gopher, to actually an internet--a net server.  One of the first, I think we were the first group in the building to have its own net server.  Physics had some, but chemistry didn't at that point in time.  So, I was there for a couple of years, yeah, for a couple of years.  Built some set-ups, published papers in computational chemistry, published papers in physical chemistry and chemical physics.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, so is from 1992 to 1994?
Speaker 1: Uh huh.
Speaker 2: And now, you joined the faculty at Howard [University, District of Columbia] in '94 [1994], right?
Speaker 1: In '94 [1994].
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, did you have other offers, and why did you choose Howard?
Speaker 1: When I finished, I sought-I did have some other offers.  I interviewed at a couple of different places.  But what I wanted to do, over the protests of several people, was teach at an HBCU [historically black colleges and universities].  And so that, and if you want to teach at the graduate level, that limits your options, although I sent out letters to a number of schools that had strong chemistry departments.  So, you know, North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia], Howard University, Clarke Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia], FAMU--Florida A and M [Agricultural and Mechanical] University [Tallahassee, Florida], were pretty much the places, that I said okay, they have graduate programs.  And I was thinking about developing graduate programs in chemistry.  And I also wanted to, in the back of my mind, I wanted to explore the possibility of starting an atmospheric sciences program somewhere, where minority students, African American students, would have a better opportunity of pursuing that type of science.  So, I interviewed at, I interviewed at North Carolina A and T.  I teased my friend over there, who's the former chair.  I went over there and gave an interview, and they didn't call me back.  In fact, Alvin Kennedy is Chair over at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  I think he was at North Carolina A and T when I came and gave my seminar.  So I tease him too, whenever I see him.  I went to, actually I interviewed at UC [University of California] Santa Cruz.  But, you know, the issue there is that they're, they pay you very cheaply as an assistant professor in the UC system, because you have the privilege of working in the UC system.  And I just, at that point in time I had three daughters, and that just wasn't going to cut it.  You know, living in South Bay and, you know, making, you know, forty thousand dollars a year or something like that, you know.  I, that's not a good family decision for me.  If I were single, I probably would have took it.  But I wasn't.  So, I wanted to move back to the East Coast as well, where I'd be closer to family.  So, I had an, I also got an interview here at Howard University.  And the real opportunity that opened up here was that they had just gotten an, a major NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] center to look at terrestrial and extra-terrestrial atmospheres, which was my expertise.  But they had nobody who had expertise in the area.  And they received a, basically a very critical review from their external--the NASA Review Committee--saying, if you don't get an expert in here to lead this center, we're taking the money back.  And it was a, you know, a ten million dollar center.  So, that's two million a year for five years.  So it was two million dollars a year for five years.  They were in their first year, and they just, they had not sort of turned the corner.  So that was an opportunity for me, obviously.  I was well-suited to come in and assist.  And so they brought me in, in the summer, to sort of do an evaluation of their program and see if there was a good fit.  And I came back in and gave a talk.  I must have come, I came back and I gave a talk in, it was January.  I came to D.C. in January from Davis [California].  So, I had a little leather coat on and some, you know, dressed like a Californian at that point in time.  And we had an ice storm here.  It was ridiculous, a culture shock and a shock to my system.  But I end up giving the seminar, and it was fairly well-received.  And so I came back in the summer and ran a summer program here, and finished off negotiations to come as a faculty member in chemistry.  And then through that center, was promoted deputy director of the center.  Sort of changed the scope in such a way that it matched up more realistically with NASA mission goals with respect to the atmosphere.  And we were also able to develop an atmospheric sciences graduate program, which was the first at any HBCU in the country.  And it's been going--where are we?  We're at '13 [2013], so this is the fifteenth year.  We'll be in its fifteenth year this fall.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 26138
Speaker 1: Now, who was here [Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia] when you got here, in atmospheric science?
Speaker 2: Nobody.  Who was degreed in atmospheric sciences?  Nobody was, nobody here actually had a degree in atmospheric sciences.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] center had people who were working in various aspects of applied chemistry, applied physics.  But in terms of environmental measurements, atmospheric modeling, there was nobody.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were the first, were you the first to come?
Speaker 2: I was the first to come.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Actually, the summer program, Greg Jenkins [atmospheric scientist; also a HistoryMaker] helped out on that first summer program.  But he went, he went back to Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania], or he went to NCAR [National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, Colorado].  And I came here.  I think Greg came down--When did I come down, in '97 [1997] or so--'96 [1996]?  He came down a couple years later.  But then he left.  Well, we actually began to recruit, actually.  So once we got the green light to develop an atmospheric sciences program [Howard University Program in Atmospheric Sciences (HUPAS)], we had to recruit some young faculty who were, who could really fit into that program, as well as into some of their parent departments.  So, and we tried to get Greg to come--Everette Joseph, Sonya Smith, Anthony Reynolds.  We've, over the course of the next probably ten years, we tried to recruit about six or seven people to come in and really augment the program and get it rolling.  And some stayed and some left.  Greg, I think came, left, and came back.  Sonia Smith has been here for the full time.  Everette Joseph came and stayed since about '97 [1997].  So, I think Everette came, I think, in '97 [1997] or '98 [1998].  I think Greg came in '96 [1996].  Sonya came in '97 [1997].  Everette came in '98 [1998].  Anthony came in '99 [1999].  And Belay [Demoz] must have come in 2001 or so.  So, we gradually built the program through some additional hires.  But it's a robust program.  We've got national recognition right now, basically for changing the national statistic in African Americans and Latinos getting their Ph.D. in atmospheric sciences, or a leading producer.
Story_ID: 26139
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you got here in '94 [1994], they gave you something called the Mordecai W. Johnson New Faculty Research Support Grant.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a small--
Speaker 1: Is it actually confined to new faculty or what?
Speaker 2: It's not confined to new faculty.  It's, the program has evolved over time.  But at that time, it was specifically designed for new faculty, sort of to provide a start-up package with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, it did not provide me with a lab, but it did provide me with some resources where I could buy a workstation and start doing some computational work.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, now, so in those first years, you were developing, did you develop any graduate programs then?
Speaker 2: The first couple of years, yeah, we actually, I started developing courses for the program [Howard University Program in Atmospheric Sciences (HUPAS)].  The first couple years I was trying to spin up my research.  And I'm trying to identify some lab space, to tell you the truth.  But we, I started teaching the first courses for the program in 1996, '95 [1995] and '96 [1996].  So we were running the summer program, trying to recruit and generate interest, developing some courses, but also I had to teach in chemistry and try to get some papers published.  The program formally started in 1998. I actually applied for tenure early, applied for tenure in 1997, three years after I was here.  And I sort of did because if I wanted to have a little bit of security--not a little bit--I wanted some job security if I was going to try to do some program development, because that's not going to necessarily get you tenure, and it will definitely take up a lot of time.  So I tried to get, you know, several papers out early, get some external funding, you know, do the things you need to do to get tenure, and then try to shift focus a little bit and try to get the program installed.  So, I was fortunate enough to make both of those things happen.
Story_ID: 26140
Speaker 1: The National Science Foundation [NSF] gave you a Career Award in '97 [1997], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was a major thing.
Speaker 1: That was to encourage young people, young scientists to--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that's, that was a major, that's a major award the NSF gives.  I think there's only one that's higher.  It's actually the same award, but it's presidential.  The same program, but it's just the best of the, the highest rated proposals in the program get the Presidential Award.  So, but the Career Award is very prestigious.  And so, I think I was the first Career Awardee at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia], actually.  But because of that, its prestige, the publications that--I would imagine--would be the thing.  It would be hard to reject tenure for that.  No matter what school you are at in the nation, if you get a Career Award, you get tenure.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that one--
Speaker 1: You've got the University Merit Award, too, here, right?  That's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's some local recognition for--I'm pretty active as a researcher here.
Speaker 1: So, that's a Howard University award?
Speaker 2: That's a Howard University--that's a university...
Speaker 1: Is it given annually?
Speaker 2: That's given, I think at that time it was bi-annual, or biennially.
Story_ID: 26141
Speaker 1: Okay, so how was your time spent basically, proportionately, between teaching and doing research and administration [at Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia]?
Speaker 2: It was probably equally split.  Administration wise, I had responsibilities in the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Center [Center for the Study of Terrestrial and Extraterrestrial Atmospheres] as deputy director.  And so, I was responsible for the day to day work--the reporting, you know, development of strategic mission and goals and business spokesman for the center.  And I also ran some of the outreach programs, writing proposals to help supplement some of our other programs.  And early on, teaching.  The teaching load was probably more than most people, because I had to teach both in chemistry--in order to earn tenure in that department--but I also had to teach in atmospheric sciences so that we could spin up that program.  And then research, you just have to do.  You have to, you gotta publish papers to stay solvent.  And so it was, it was really taxing.  But the early, you know, the first probably five or six years was a lot of nose to the grindstone.  But, you know, looks like it's paid off.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Alright.  So, the program, the graduate program actually starts up in '98 [1998]?
Speaker 2: Right, '98 [1998], it got approved by the Board of Trustees.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that was four years which, again, looking back, it's kind of record time.  It's the only inter-disciplinary degree granting program here at the university.  And we put together and had it approved within the four years, which is actually pretty remarkable.
Speaker 1: Now, how big was your staff, I mean in terms of your, I mean the faculty of the department?
Speaker 2: At that time?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We probably had in '94 [1994], I think, I mean '98 [1998], was we probably had three people--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --three or four people.  It's Sonya [Smith], Everette [Joseph], Greg [Jenkins, also a HistoryMaker], myself.
Speaker 1: Okay, four.
Speaker 2: Yep, three or four.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: And, and that's when we spun up, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: But we also had, so we had a good relationship with NASA.  So we had adjunct professors from NASA at that time.  We had a couple of adjunct professors from NASA, probably two.  I think it was Rich and Walls.  Actually  Rich, Walls and Dean Duffy.  So, it was three adjunct professors from NASA.  It turned out that one of the professors who taught me at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] left Georgia Tech and became the lab chief at NASA Goddard.  In fact, NASA Goddard [Maryland] recruited pretty heavily from Georgia Tech, because the atmospheric science program there had pretty high prestige, and did the type of modeling and data assimilation, data integration, that was very germane to NASA's earth science program.  So, it was, we had a per chance meeting.  I had a technical review of the research center at NASA that called over to Goddard.  And so we're sitting at this long conference table in his office.  He's sitting at one end and I sit down at the other end.  And we're talking, and I see him looking at me, you know, kind of, do I know this guy?  But I didn't say anything until the end of the meeting and I walked up and I said, "You know, you taught me fluid dynamics in grad school."  And he was like, "I knew I knew who you are." (laughter). Franco Einaudi, who was probably one of my favorite professors there.  Actually, even though he's not, didn't teach in the area that I performed research in or emphasis, but Franco was the lab chief for the lab of, used to be atmospheric chemistry and dynamics at Goddard.  And we sat down and talked, and after that, he's been a huge supporter of our program here.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his last name?  It's Franco--
Speaker 2: Franco, F-R-A-N-C-O, first name.  Last name, E-I-N-A-U-D-I.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know, he basically allowed for NASA scientists to become adjunct professors.  He encouraged them to become adjunct professors in our program.  You know, allowed our faculty and students access to facilities there.  My first lab, I had trouble finding a lab space on campus.  My first lab was at NASA Goddard.  He provided me lab space to do experiments over there.  So, he's definitely been a mentor and friend and colleague.  He's retired now, but we're still in touch.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Howard has this ongoing partnership with NASA Goddard-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And now what is, now is this in Beltsville [Maryland], or--
Speaker 2: No, Beltsville is different.  So the Beltsville facility is in--Howard has some land, had some land in Beltsville since the '60s [1960s] or late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s].  And basically we saw an opportunity out there to develop an observational facility, a research facility that would be focused on atmospheric sciences.  Because I left Howard to work for NASA in 19--, in about 1998.
Story_ID: 26142
Speaker 1: Okay, this is when you were the visiting scientist at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Goddard [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Visiting scientist when I changed my, I changed my status.  But it was during that time, '98 [1998] to 2000, 2001 or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But when we came back, it turned out there was an opportunity--when I left, I wasn't sure I was coming back.  And so, I got an extended appointment there.  And a number of things were troubling me.  One is I still didn't have lab space on the campus [Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia].  Even though I thought I'd proven that I'm productive, I still couldn't come up with any lab space.  And NASA was providing me with lab space.  They were providing me with a lot of support.  And at that time, it was really a fun place to work.  You know, they had money, they were launching rockets.  You know, every six months a new program went up in space, and doing a lot of exciting, very exciting things.  So, I was there, and then we, we were doing some experiments, basically putting some of our new equipment, our new devices on aircraft and flying them in the aircraft.  We actually had one experiment where we flew into a hurricane with a particle measuring device.  So I was really having fun.  You know, one of the projects I worked on is on the [International] Space Station now.  I mean, if they had continued doing things as they were doing it, I might still be there.  But they went to full cost accounting, actually.  And so then I started looking back at Howard and saying, well, they've taken sort of a lot of the fun out of the way we do things at NASA.
Story_ID: 26143
Speaker 1: And a new opportunity was also coming up for a NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] Center [for Atmospheric Sciences; Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia].  And NOAA is much more steeped in surface-based observation than NASA is, and for a different reason.  So--
Speaker 2: Now, NOAA stands for?
Speaker 1: NOAA stands for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Speaker 2: And this is a government--
Speaker 1: A federal agency, it's a federal agency housed within the [U.S.] Department of Commerce that has a mission of maintaining healthy oceans, environment and atmosphere.  So the Weather Service is part of NOAA.  The National Marine Fishery Service is part of NOAA.  There is a Satellite Data Center.  So, all the weather satellites and environmental satellites are managed by NOAA.  The data system, the Data Information System is managed by NOAA.  The Ocean Service is managed by NOAA.  So, there's an opportunity to compete for a fairly large program, a fifteen million dollar program, and I decided to compete for that.  We had, we still had the colleagues that I was working with.  I had not relinquished my faculty position, even though I had been gone a couple years.  And so, we decided to compete for that.  And one of the elements of the proposal that we put forth was that we would take this land in Beltsville [Maryland], or at least a portion of the land in Beltsville, and convert that into a national user's facility for developing next generation instrumentation for validating satellite instrumentation for training students for all things environmental, aligned with the NOAA mission.  And so that's how the Beltsville facility, for us, began to get developed.  We--there's a telescope out there, an astronomical telescope, that was donated to the university.  It had over time been left to its own.  So, one of the first things we did was we renovated that, converted that into a laser radar for atmospheric sensing.  And that was something that NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] really resonated with.  So NASA actually funded a large part of that project.  But once we got the proof of concept, we can actually use that for short term weather and meteorological phenomena.  So we can roll that into a resource for this NOAA proposal, research capacity.  And so, over time we ended up winning the NOAA Award.  And so, that's the center that I direct now.  We've had it for twelve, going on thirteen years now.
Story_ID: 26144
Speaker 1: What's the AEROSE [Aerosol and Oceanographic Science Expeditions] project?
Speaker 2: Oh, AEROSE.  AEROSE was one of my favorite projects.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it involved a lot of field campaigns, sort of migrated from working in, with computers in the lab, developing instrumentation and deploying that instrumentation in space and on the surface, the surface ops.  So, AEROSE is really, is an acronym, another acronym.   The Aerosols and Ocean Science Expeditions is the short of it, the expanded version of it.
Speaker 1: Aerosol--
Speaker 2: Aerosols and Ocean Science Expeditions.
Speaker 1: --Ocean Science Expeditions, okay.
Speaker 2: And it started off--we were interested in how emissions from Africa, the African continent, can influence a regional and global scale phenomena.  What I mean by that is Africa, in Africa there's a huge desert, largest contiguous desert in the world, Saharan Desert.  It constantly pumps out dust into the atmosphere, and this dust gets lofted up.  It doesn't just drop back down into the desert.  It actually moves around the globe.
Speaker 1: There's an annual event in West Africa, I read about years ago in--
Speaker 2: Oh, it's--
Speaker 1: --the history of the West African empire. It's called the Harmattan--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Harmattan, yeah--
Speaker 1: then it comes through--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Harma--
Speaker 1: --air from the Sahara.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it's really hot air, dry air and a lot of times filled with dust.  The Harmattan actually comes a little bit towards the south, so it cuts across the Sahara down into northern Nigeria and Ghana and Sierra Leone, you know--Benin, Togo.  But that affects things regionally.  In fact, it was part of a UNESCO [United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization] subcommittee on what does that, what impact does that have in terms of social and economic structures there?  But in addition to it blowing down there during a certain time of the year, it actually blows out over the tropical Atlantic, gets into the U.S. Caribbean, gets into Florida, gets into the U.S. seaboard, gets as far as Houston, Texas.
Speaker 1: Now, does it follow the Gulf Stream basically, or does it--
Speaker 2: It doesn't follow the Gulf Stream.  It follows what's called the easterlies, the easterly waves.  So there's a--the trade winds, it blows with the trades.  But it takes a different trajectory depending on the season.  And in addition to that, natural phenomena, you have slash and burn agriculture in Africa.  And because you have such dense and rich vegetation, huge amounts of Africa may be burning, especially Central Africa may be burning at any given time.  And the smoke, and particularly from those fires, also gets caught up in these trade wind flows and easterly flows, and come across the Atlantic Ocean into South America into the U.S., into the Caribbean into North America.  And as you, you'd literally have tons of particulate mass that's moving through the atmosphere annually.  And so, what does that do to the atmosphere?  Well, nobody really knew.  There are some folks who have been monitoring dust transport for some time.  So you know that the dust is coming from Africa, and you know when it comes more to the north, you know when it comes more to the south.  You can see that from the satellites.  But questions pertaining to does it affect drought?  You know, does it affect rainfall patterns in North America?  Does it affect agriculture in North America?  Does it affect coral reef ecosystems in the Caribbean?  Does it affect human health?  We see asthma rates skyrocketing in the Caribbean in the eastern seaboard.  Allergies are skyrocketing.  One of my students at Maryland is working on emergence of new pathogens and emergence of aggressive pathogens with respect to crops and respect to people.  And if you look at where those populations are coming up, they're right inside these passageways of the dust.  So, is it connected, or is it causally connected, or is it circumstantial statistical relationship?  Nobody knows.  Nobody knew.  Certainly ten years ago, nobody knew.  So, I got some collaborators in the Caribbean, and we said, why don't we set up an experiment where we can measure this dust?  Actually, measure what are the characteristics of the dust as it comes through?
Story_ID: 26145
Speaker 1: Now when does this, does this start around 2003?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, our first mission for AEROSE [Aerosol and Oceanographic Science Expeditions] started in 2000, was in 2004.  So we actually started the work around 2000, 2001.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the motivation for the work, some satellite--you know, so, NASA's [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] trying to do everything from satellites.  There are a lot of things from satellites--so was NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration].  Well, these dust storms are noise.  You know, you can't see the ocean if you've got a dust storm going through.  In fact, what you end up having to do is throw out loads of satellite data because, one, there's too many clouds in the way, or there's this dust and these aerosols in the way.  So their noise turns out to be very interesting stuff for me, because I look at it and say, well, if you've got all this surface area from all this dust, there's all kinds of catalytic chemistry that could be going on.  So, what's happening?  Well, they didn't actually care what was happening, because they were just saying if you know a way of removing this from our signal where we can retrieve better data, let's partner.  And so, we started doing these, some aerosol experiments, while I was at NASA on how to characterize the dust.  Because if you really know what the dust signature is, you can subtract that from the satellite, and you get better data, and you get more data versus throwing out so much, and especially in the tropical Atlantic, you know, that's where our hurricanes are spawned.  That's where the trade winds come that bring the wet season.  And so, we started saying well, how will we best do this?  And for me, go out and measure it, you know.  And so we started doing some small experiments around Puerto Rico to measure dust storms to characterize the nature of the dust that came through, and put a proposal together in 2003 to do a campaign at sea, to go into a storm and actually measure inside of the storm to see if we could take some comprehensive measurements inside of a dust storm over the ocean where they'd never been taken before.  And the payoff from this, is that you actually have data that you can use to constrain models of the global atmosphere.  And so that improves hurricane modeling, because the dust season is the same time as hurricane season.  What's the interplay?  Again, nobody has any answers, because no one's gone out and taken any measurements.  Where are the energetics of the atmosphere near the dust?  Does the dust change the energetics of the atmosphere in a way that increases hurricane intensity, or decreases hurricane intensity?  Well, no one's taken any measurements, so we don't know.  How does it affect sea surface temperatures?  You can't see through it from satellite, and no one's gone out.  You don't know.  So there were these series of questions we came up with that we convinced NASA and NOAA that we can get answers to these questions and we can help improve your models.  We can help improve your satellite retrievals, but we've got to go out there and take these measurements.  And I really did not believe that they would hand over their flagship research vessel to a guy from Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia] who's never really sailed on ships before.  And in fact there was a friend of mine, Roy Armstrong, who's a professor down in marine sciences in Puerto Rico [University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus].  And we'd gone out on his ship to take some measurements around Puerto Rico and do some mapping, and try to understand some of the dynamics of the aerosol distributions down there, and how they related to coral reef damage.  At one time we thought it was green fungi that were pathogenic to the coral reefs.  And so, he said, "You know, you should just, just ask them, you know.  All they're going to say is no.  You can do it."  So I said, okay, I'll write a proposal.  And they accepted the proposal.  They came back--not right away--they came back and said this is interesting, we'd like more information.  And so, 2003, we developed, really developed the idea for a full blown proposal, thirty days in the tropical Atlantic.  And how would we predict where the storm was going to occur?  How would we track it down?  What measurements would we take?  You know, particularly the whole program plan.  And we went out in March, 2004, naively, again, and we interacted--we caught one of the largest springtime dust storms on record.  And what we thought would be a "won and done" sort of mission, you know, ten years later we're still learning new things and taking measurements.  I've been out every year since then.
Story_ID: 26146
Speaker 1: What have been the most important findings in this period of time?
Speaker 2: You know, we've, there's two things.  Well, there's a number of things.  I said--one of the things that we've been able to do with the data set is really enhance satellite retrievals.  And so we understand a lot more about the interplay between the dust, the dry air, and the shear, and how it affects hurricane development.  We're learning a lot right now about how smoke and dust differentially impact clouds and cloud formation.  One of the greatest uncertainty is in whether and how models represent climate change, is a representation of clouds and aerosols.  And so, the interactions between clouds and aerosols are very important.  We'll be able to show that the dust actually does influence rainfall variability in a way that was not accounted for before.  We're doing some things now.  I think our next big contribution is going to be the throughput of biological mass between continents.  You know, one of the things that we don't understand is connections between climate and health very well.  And so, you know, as the, as North Africa continues to dry, that drought intensifies, the desert expands.  You have more intense, more frequent dust storms.  And what that's basically doing is, when the dust comes across it's carrying some nutrients to the ocean, some nutrients to the Amazon, some nutrients to rainforests and vegetation in the Western Hemisphere, but it's also carrying invasive species.  And those invasive species have differential impacts on infants and the elderly and, you know, regular adults.
Speaker 1: (unclear) These are in the form of spores and seeds and--
Speaker 2: Some are spores, a lot of spores--spore forming fungi, bacteria.
Speaker 1: Okay, (unintelligible)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, really teaming with microscopic life that's viable.  For a long time people felt, you know, the bacteria aren't going to play any role at all.  And most of the fungi doesn't affect people anyway, and is not going to have a major effect on anything.
Speaker 1: So, there's moisture in this wind, I guess?
Speaker 2: Well, it's coming out of the ocean, so it picks up moisture.  So it's coming from the desert, extremely dry, but then it comes over the ocean where it picks up some moisture in the lower parts of it.  But in the central part of it, it actually retains it's very, very dry character, almost all the way across the Atlantic Ocean.  And we, the measurements that we have taken actually show that.  So there were a lot of assumptions that it comes across, but all the dust falls out.  Or, it comes across and it loses--there's no way that it could preserve its character from Africa to Central America.  But we've shown that it does.  We have measurements all the way through.
Speaker 1: Now, what's an example, can you give me an example of an invasive species and just airborne across Africa--
Speaker 2: There's one that causes, the disease it causes--well, the manifestation of the infection causes a blindness.  So it's known in different parts of Africa as sand blindness or, I forgot one of the other terms, but it's called mycetoma.  And it is non-native in the Western Hemisphere.  But we can show that there is throughput during certain of the dust storms.  Think of the region. Because it's not uniformly distributed throughout the Sahara Desert, and there are, the Sahara Desert abuts several different other deserts, and there's regions within the desert that are different in nature.  But dust storms from Africa that are moving mineral dust mass across the tropical Atlantic Ocean can move significant amounts of viable and virulent pathogens in bacterial form.  And that's, I think--I don't know that that's been shown significantly other than our--outside of our work.  You can culture things.  So, you can take--it's one thing to say okay, I'm going to take a dust swab off of that window sill and then try to culture what's there and make it grow.  Or, if you do genomic mapping right now, genomic tracing, all DNA that's of everything that's ever been alive that landed there, you'll see.  That doesn't mean it's virulent.  It doesn't mean that in fact you could get infected by it.  And so, we developed some techniques by which we can extract and characterize the DNA from these airborne samples that is specific to the strains that are virulent and that are viable.  So, we've gone beyond the traditional culturing techniques.  And this certainly expands what my training has been.  But it's connected to the things that I'm interested in.  So, through these airborne roots or through the atmosphere, aerosols are vehicles for a number of things, a number of influences, that range from human health to food security to drought and heat stress.  There's extreme heat stress inside these dust storms.  You're standing on deck and this stuff is blowing over you.  You can feel the temperature rise ten degrees.  I mean, within an hour.  And it's, that stress is magnified if you're an infant or you're someone with a respiratory ailment or you're elderly, living in a place where trade winds are the way you cool off.  Well, that can cause death, actually.  And so, relating climate change to death, or a climate change to public health, you know, it's understanding the physical aspects of these flows, in addition to the chemical and the biological aspects.  And so, we've, I think this--AEROSE is one of the only campaigns to really look at multi-dimensions of this natural phenomena and how it changes and affects everything from social behavior, economic behavior, to basic meteorological behavior and weather patterns.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26147
Speaker 1: We were interviewing Professor [Gregory] Jenkins [atmospheric scientist; also a HistoryMaker], and he was talking about annual, I mean, periodic trips to--
Speaker 2: Senegal [West Africa].
Speaker 1: Senegal, right, right.  And then, you know, so do you take students on these-
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely.  The, the [AEROSE (Aerosol and Oceanographic Science Expeditions) project] cruises are rooted in science, and they serve, you know, scientific initiatives within NASA [National Aeronautic and Space Administration] and NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration].  The [U.S.] Department of Defense [DOD] is now interested in some of the things we were doing with the, in Homeland Security, with tagging airborne pathogens.  The [U.S.] Department of Energy [DOE] is supporting some of the work.  So, there's definitely science there.  But as a professor, as an educator, you've got to bring the next generation of folks along.  So, there are no cruises that do not have students on board.  And in fact, we solicit not just students from Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia], we do a national call of opportunity.  So the students from Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] have gone on, the students from FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], from the University of Maryland, from the University of Texas, from--we tallied the numbers, actually, because we're putting together another article.  But I think we've had somewhere between 30, 45 students who've gone on these ten--nine cruises so far.  And they probably represent, they probably represent on the order of between ten and twenty universities nationwide, as well as international.  We have had collaborators from Argentina, from France, from Germany, from Spain, from Senegal, from Ethiopia--
Speaker 1: China, I believe, too.
Speaker 2: From China.  We've got, there's someone from Barbados--sorry, Trinidad, who's already contacted me and wants to go on the next cruise coming up this fall.  So, it's, I think the science is rich.  The training is very rich, because it's very collaboratory.  It's very inter-disciplinary and integrated.  It's very international, and so, I think the opportunity--I would have loved to have had this opportunity as a student myself, because I think this helps you look at the landscape of science and the opportunity that you have to address, you know, large-scale problems by, you know, a lot of focus on a particular expertise and how it relates to other folks, other disciplines, other countries, etcetera.  So we definitely have students on.  In fact, we have sites that are set up--land based sites that are set up, to help coordinate measurements during AEROSE.  So, we've had sites in Senegal that were launching balloons and doing coordinated measurements while we were on the ship, near Cape Verde. We've had people in Cape Verde launching--people on Canary Islands just to the north, you know, taking coordinated measurements.  So, we, it's not just the ship, but there's also land based coordinated measurements.  Satellite overpasses are coordinated where we're validating those satellite overpasses.  And we've had aircraft out, as well.  So, we've, it's quite a comprehensive, it's really a very comprehensive mission.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26148
Speaker 1: NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] is the primary funder for this?
Speaker 2: NOAA is the primary source of funds for this.
Speaker 1: For AEROSE [Aerosol and Oceanographic Science Expeditions project], okay.
Speaker 2: So, we, so it provides the ship.  So we sail on the Ron Brown Research Vessel.
Speaker 1: Is the Ron Brown named for the former [U.S.] Secretary of Commerce?
Speaker 2: Named for the former Secretary of Commerce.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which you know, someone from--where was she from?  Someone contacted me.  She's a sociologist, and she was doing a study on how African seafarers could detect hurricanes.  And so she, I don't know how she contacted me, but she called me and we were talking.  And I was explaining about AEROSE.  And she said, "You know when I get done with this--" she's working on her Ph.D. [degree]. She said, "When I get done with this, I need to write a story on AEROSE, because there's too many parallels that you're missing by focusing on the science."  So, we're sailing on a vessel that is named after the first African American Secretary of the Department of Commerce through the Middle Passage.  We, and literally our first ports were the ports--we went to Christopher Columbus's house and we sailed, you know--
Speaker 1: This is in Trinidad?
Speaker 2: In Canary Islands.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because on his first voyage, he came through Canary Islands and sailed down, went to Espanola through Puerto Rico, and that was our first cruise.  And our first cruise actually happened--we were out to sea between Cape Verde--and Cape Verde--in Senegal on, I think it's called, I forget the name of the day it's called.  It's like March 25th, but it's like the African American Slavery Day.  It actually commemorates, you know, the Africans who lost their lives during the Middle Passage.  We were at the point where the majority of folks allegedly jumped ship, where they had just lost sight of land and before you hit the open ocean.  So, a lot of, a lot of, I think little details.  In fact, there was something called the Slave Ship Mercury.  It's 18--, I have the report, someone told me about it.  Our first cruise was, our scientific team, I think was nearly a hundred percent Puerto Ricans and African Americans.  There was something called the Slave Ship Mercury in 18--, the 1890s.  And basically what it was, New York was getting overrun with children of immigrants, these--I forgot what they called them--urchins from African and Spanish descent.  So, what they did was that they were going to put these guys on a ship and teach them a lesson.  They actually sailed almost our same track. And it was--and collected information on dust.  They actually had, I have the report.  And so--
Speaker 1: In 1890--
Speaker 2: This is the late--
Speaker 1: --put these kids on a ship and--
Speaker 2: --put these kids on a ship because--
Speaker 1: And shipped them out of the country, or to--
Speaker 2: --to ship them, to try to get them--because they were causing trouble in the streets.  And so they said, we're going to teach these kids how to be seafarers and take them out and collect data.  And so they sent them out, basically on the same track, collected data, and filed a report.  That's one of the first reports since [Charles] Darwin.  Darwin reported that there was Saharan dust on his ship when he sailed down from Europe down to Argentina.  But this track across the dust transport track, is the first recorded one.  And it had almost the same demographic composition as our first AEROSE cruise.  And so, jokingly, among us we say we're the second Mercury cruise.  But there's just a lot of little things that are ironic, I guess in that mission.  But we've, it's been a huge scientific success, a huge scientific success.  And I'm surprised, actually, that it's gone this long.  When we first started out, we thought we would be lucky if we get out there to piggyback. But it's been really good (unclear).
Story_ID: 26149
Speaker 1: What about the NCAS [NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Center in Atmospheric Sciences] Weather Camp?  Is this for college students or high school students?
Speaker 2: That's for high school students.  High school students and middle school students.  And we actually run some elementary camps now.  So, one of the--outreach has always been, I think, important.  And I'm committed to making sure that the kids get good opportunities to be exposed to science and scientific careers and the opportunities that are there, because I think that's lacking.  And so, through the research center here at the NOAA Research Center we developed a program, programs at multiple levels to allow kids access to science, and in particular, the atmospheric sciences or climate sciences.  And so, it's grown from a summer program, one week program here in D.C. [District of Columbia], to as many as thirteen different camps nationwide.  They all use our same sort of model, where we have a lot of hands-on activities.  We bring in scientists, we bring in non-scientists who use the scientific data.  We bring in anyone who's working in a field that depends on the knowledge of climate environment and meteorology, to show that if you get technical background we'll allow you opportunities in areas you never thought of--into insurance, into aviation and avionics, all types of energy fields.  I mean the energy sector right now is strongly dependent upon the nature of the environment, weather and climate.  That's really what's driving it.  And so, it's, right now we have a two week camp here.  What we manage, is we manage four camps through the NOAA Center--a camp in Texas, a camp in Jackson, a camp in Puerto Rico and a camp in D.C.  Those are the high school camps.  And then we have some middle school camps that we also do in D.C.  And we've expanded out to some satellite camps in New York, Nebraska, Arizona, Houston, Miami, North Carolina--I feel like I'm missing one.  And then we have also actually done some international camps.  I did one in the Philippines and one in Ethiopia.  There's a camp in Barbados that's being run by a former student, it's run on a regular basis.  We're going to have a camp in South Africa, actually, in January during their summer.  And so I think we've, through that, we've developed sort of a model for how to get kids excited about science by connecting them to the environment.  And maybe it's related to me, running around all the time.  As soon as I get out of the house, run around and explore.  But I think it's, the easiest way to show relevance of science is your environment.  That's what surrounds you--that there's physics, chemistry, biology that surrounds you all the time.

Speaker 1: Has your work been recognized by the university community here [Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia]?
Speaker 2: I mean, yes, I mean it's, we published, you know, it's something we go back and forth about.  That's why I hesitate.  So, most of the research, all the research, we go out and present and we publish and get it out in the scientific community.  And one of the things we haven't done so well is market on campus.  It's just an afterthought.  So, we're starting to do more of that.  You know, if we do something, we send them a press release.  If we, you know--try to get Howard communications to come out to some of our events that we hold on campus.  So I think they're becoming more aware of the national, international, impact of our work.  But typically, I'd say maybe three years ago, nobody on campus knew anything about, you know, our NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] Center [for Atmospheric Sciences].  Our NOAA Center is--well, about 30-35 million dollars we've raised.  But NOAA knows about us and NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] knows about us, and the scientific community knows about us.  But as a scientist you just kind of go about the business of science, and you forget that you live in a political environment and you live in an environment that communications and marketing are really critical.  And it's something we're conveying to our next--our students, as we go along, so that they don't learn, you know, in sort of a retarded way.
Speaker 1: Have you been covered in 'Howard Magazine', I mean, Howard--what do you call it, 'The Hilltop' [student newspaper], or the--
Speaker 2: I don't think we've ever been in 'The Hilltop'.  I don't think we've ever been in 'The Hilltop'.
Speaker 1: Now there's a big color magazine that they do.
Speaker 2: I think it's the 'Howard Magazine'.  I'm trying to think.  I think we had, I think we had--there was an article on us when we first got the NOAA Center.  And so it really didn't talk about what we've done.  But by the same, in contrast, in the 'Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society' [BAMS], which has circulation of 30,000, I think we've had three cover issues.  So, I, you know, we kind of put blinders on and say I'm a scientist so I'm going to speak to the scientific community.  And we have forgotten that there's a Howard community that might be interested in what we do.  And we're starting to do that now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But so, we've actually been talking about getting an article in the Howard Magazine, because I think, I don't think Beltsville [Maryland]--you know, the Beltsville campus had a fire recently.  And people had no idea.  And we lost about a half million dollars of investment in the fire.  And the overwhelming response was, "I didn't know that was out there."  But yeah, you probably should know if you've got a couple million dollars invested in some acreage nearby.  People should probably know a little bit more about it than that.  So, we've got to do a better job with that.  I'd say in the science departments, it's known.  And in engineering, will probably know.  Outside of that, I'd say the majority of people probably have no clue.
Speaker 1: Actually, I know Afro Studies knew yesterday, they knew about it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But you know, you said it's--I know my daughter graduated from communications--I don't think she ever heard of it.
Story_ID: 26151
Speaker 1: We're [NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Center for Atmospheric Sciences, Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia] actually, in other words, starting to expand as well as, we actually have people from communications in our research center.  And we have people with sociology and anthropology in our research center.  And we've been reaching out to some of the other--because there are cultural and social and economic factors that influence how we should be adapting to climate change or environmental stress and change.  And there is, there's factors that inform us on how we should study it, as well.  If I, you know, Greg [Jenkins; atmospheric scientist; also a HistoryMaker] goes to Senegal.  Well, you can't just blaze into Senegal and say "Hey, I want to take a bunch of measurements."  You probably need to understand the cultures there.  And so, teaming with African American, Afro-American Studies, or African Studies, really can be a huge help.  We're actually teaming with history.  We're teaming with history and African Studies when we go down to South Africa--because water cycle and rainy season, the pastoral community down there--the African farmers actually go to a local person.  They don't trust the meteorological agency.  They have sort of this oral tradition, historical record, for when they're going to plant and when they should move or change crops.  And it goes through this person who's local.  And we want to go in, and we're actually going in to help set up some observational sites to help them deal with the drought and rainfall variability there.  But what we've said is, okay if we just come in, we're just, you know, we're a third party group who's going to come in and try to tell somebody what to do, when they're not even listening to you.  You know, we've really got to close the loop.  And so the historians and the African Studies folks are going to connect us in such a way where we sit down and say okay this is how, you know, this is how your world view, you know, is aligned with what we're trying to do.  And we're trying to help you help the farmers here.  And I sort of start the communication, not by coming in and setting up equipment, but coming in and actually just having conversations about what's the best way for us to come in and help.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I think that's a--in developing the issues in Africa, I found that's a much better way of getting things done.  Otherwise, projects fall through.  And we just had, a site in Mali fell through with the civil war.  You know, the cultural divisions in some countries, you can't do things being unaware of them.  It just will not work.  And the Touareg are notorious for--you know, they're notorious for going back on their word.  But their value system is different, which is what we found, working there.  So you can work with folks if you understand where they're coming from, a lot better.
Story_ID: 26152
Speaker 1: What are your future plans?
Speaker 2: Future?  I'm going to step down as chair [Department of Chemistry, Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia].  That's my most immediate future plan.  Of chemistry, I'm chair of chemistry right now, and that's just too much, that's just too much.  Beyond that, you know, we're looking, I'm very interested in translating some of the things that we're doing to African nations, in terms of the program development, in terms of research capacity, development.  I think there's a lot of critical--in terms of establishing observational capacity in regions that there are no observations, that will help us understand climate variability better.  So, I'd like to evolve towards international programs.  We're working out a new research building that's coming on-line here, I believe.  And so we'll be able to conduct some new types of experiments as well, some basic process studies on aerosol microphysics that allow us to get to the, the biochemistry of the aerosols.  What makes, what in the aerosol, the different types of aerosols, makes pathogens viable or not viable, and how do they nucleate--looking at some particular aspects of nucleation physics and aerosol microphysics.  So, I want to get back into the lab and get out in the field and do some program, a little more program development.  Less administration, more program development.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 26153
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently, if you could go back and tweak it?
Speaker 2: With, like I said, marketing on the campus [Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia], I would have done that differently.  I'd be a little more aggressive about marketing the program on the campus, from the start.  Not too much else.  I think we've been pretty successful in doing some of the things that we've done, you know.  I don't know.  I don't think I would have done too much different.  Nothing major, nothing major.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just thought of something that's outside of what we normally ask about at this time.  But how, what's been the response of the African and Caribbean students in terms of taking some of these research techniques home to where they come from, and--
Speaker 2: Well, it's been quite good.  I mean, that's, we have a number of alumni who come from Caribbean nations and from African nations, and they, you know, they are certainly part of the backbone of our collaborative networks.  And so we've, as I said, we have a very strong relationship with the Met [Meteorological] Agency in Barbados, where the former alumni is there.  Strong relationship with Trinidad, where we have a lot of alumni down there.  We've, I have an appointment at UE Mona in Jamaica--advise in-field students, and we've interacted with their department quite a bit, make visits.  The University of Virgin Islands, we have, just forged a collaboration where we're going to help them develop observational capacity.  We've got observational sites in Puerto Rico, although that's U.S.  In Africa, in Africa we've been a little more sporadic.  Greg [Jenkins; atmospheric scientist; also a HistoryMaker] is in Senegal.  And we've had Senegalese scientists who actually have come out and received training at Beltsville, have been on the ship for the AEROSE [Aerosol and Oceanographic Science Expeditions project].  And so I think, I think we've developed the capacity to certainly have, provide advanced training in Beltsville [Maryland], and also provide advisement and consulting and assistance with integrating observational and research systems in the countries.  We focus more on Africa than the Caribbean, because the Caribbean actually has a little more infrastructure, especially the British speaking Caribbean, through ECMFW [European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts] for the European center.  You know, African countries that are most susceptible to climate change tend to have the least resources, the least connections, you know.  Ethiopia, Sudan, Niger, Chad, Mali--you know, Senegal.  Unfortunately, half the country tends to have a significant Muslim population that goes along with having very poor relationships with Europe, in terms of research or technical infrastructure.  South Africa is in sort of a different pickle in their transition from minority and majority leadership.  Huge unemployment rates, huge illiteracy rates.  And so, trying to change the course of the majority population compounds really the problems that they're going to have with their environment.  They've not cared for their environment.  They've over-mined it, they've over-grazed it in certain areas.  And so, I think bringing in experts that have a sensitivity to the native populations, as well as having the content, the technical content, the expert content knowledge, I think is something unique to what Howard can bring over there.  And you know, we've--marketing on the university helps expand, I think, the number of people who can get involved, that can make a significant impact.  So, I think--there's a big program in South Africa, and so we're going to go down and--we went down this fall and had a really good meeting with the University of Pretoria, the University of Johannesburg, the Kawa (unclear) Institute, which is their historical institute that links us to regional leaders.  And I think we can really build from that, and do well.  I think Greg's doing a good job in Senegal.  There's a number of other faculty who have very strong relationships in Senegal, and Mbye Cham from [Department of] African Studies goes over there and teaches a course over there.  Abdul-Aziz [Yakubu] from math [Department of Mathematics] has a nice relationship with some of the universities in Mali, the University of Bamako.  So, I think in some of Sahelian Africa and Mali and Senegal, we've had some good connections.  We've been in Mali.  We have a good relationship with some folks over there at the dust region.  But as I said, the civil unrest there is, you can't take students into that environment.  Sudan, we've been developing some new relationships in Sudan.  We got some new MoUs [Memorandum of Understanding] in Sudan, and I think, I think they're actually handling southern Sudan's independence pretty, surprisingly well.  And so, I think there's some opportunities there.  And we've got folks from pharmacy who are already over there doing some work in terms of HIV [Human Immunodeficiency Virus; causative agent of AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)].  Actually, pretty extensive HIV awareness and education and mitigation programs that Howard's involved in, in East Africa and southern Africa.  And so, building on top of those, some of the science that helps people stay viable, I think is where I think we can make a big impact.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26154
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back at everything you've done to this point in your career, what today would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I think in anyone's legacy, there's probably going to be in the people that they've influenced.  So, I'd say the program, I'd say the atmospheric sciences program [Howard University Program in Atmospheric Sciences (HUPAS)] has made at least an impact on short term, and I hope that it stays viable for years to come.  I think that would certainly be a legacy.  The [NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Center for Atmospheric Sciences (NCAS), Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia] Weather Camp Program is, you know, we're seeing our first--some of the students from the first camps have received their Ph.D.s.  And we're trying to collect information on, you know, was the camp a major influence?  Was it just coincidental that you happen to see it and go?  You know, what is the impact of that?  But I think if we can sustain and expand that network, I think we're going to influence the next generation, is where you make your legacy.  I love science.  There's always going to be the next question.  Where there's a next generation, you can take advantage of that.  And whether there's a next generation that can propagate science, is more of a question.  And hopefully, we're doing that through the outreach and through the education programs.
Story_ID: 26155
Speaker 1: That kind of leads to a question we always ask.  And that is, what are your some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: You know, I hope we can, you know--I think that we are, we're really in peril of becoming tangential to society if we don't have some stake in technological development.  You cannot solely be an end-user.  You have to be a creator of technology, and you have to take ownership of science.  You know, you can, you can, you run a risk of being marginalized if you just--you know.  In the direction that we're going right now, you know, even the investment at our HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities], if you look at the demographics of the technical workforce where you're a fraction of one percent, and dropping, you know.  How are you making, how do you make decisions?  How do you influence policy, if you don't have the information?  If you don't have the resources, you're not training people.  I think there is a big push to--away from, science that's dangerous for us.  So, that's one thing.  I think another thing is, mission realignment of historically black colleges and universities.  A lot of us are working off of mission statements that were created in the 1860s.  And no viable organization ignores progress made between 1860 and 2000. You've to realign, you've got to re-visit, and make yourself relevant.  And so, I think there's, you know, science is not the only way.  I think you've got to integrate across sciences.  But from what I see here at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia], for example, is a huge phobia of, you know, STEM, science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  And if you look at, you know, attrition rates for the African American male--if you've been on campus in the last couple of days, you walk from one end of the campus to the other-- and didn't recognize that we're about 70 percent female and 30 percent male, and we're doing well compared to many campuses.  That's, that's a problem, and we're not doing things to address it.  You know, we're just not.  And I think you gotta, we have to re-engage in the community, and we've got to re-engage the community in saying hey, where are the opportunities going to be?  And the opportunities right now are largely in technical fields.  They're in the energy sector.  They're in, you know, data analysis sectors.  They're not necessarily in sports and entertainment, you know.  They're not necessarily in law.  And in the medical fields, the greatest opportunities are really in medical research, you know.  So you've got to, we've got to change our messaging, and we've got to change what we provide to folks to get them prepared to be successful.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26156
Speaker 1: Now, tell us something about your family.  Now, you've got four daughters now?
Speaker 2: Three daughters.
Speaker 1: Three?  Okay, three daughters.
Speaker 2: Three daughters, three daughters.  And I have, I count my nieces--three nieces, and two nephews and a grand nephew.
Speaker 1: And they're all in the [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia] area?
Speaker 2: No, no.  My three daughters are here.  My three, one has graduated from Howard [University, Washington D.C.], French, political science, she's working in Virginia.  One is graduating from Howard this year.  She just got accepted to Syracuse [University, Syracuse, New York].  I think she's going up to Syracuse for archeology, anthropology, for her Ph.D. [degree].  And my youngest is at George Washington [University, Washington, D.C.].  She's majoring in chemistry.  And then my sisters and brother are all in Atlanta [Georgia].  Now, my nephew is up here in Maryland, though he's going to Bowie State [University].  And his son, they're here.  So, that's about everybody.  Then, that's everybody in the immediate--my father's [Billy Verlette Morris] down in Atlanta now.  And that's it, in the immediate area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is your mother [Gloria Robinson Morris] still--
Speaker 2: My mother passed.  She passed in 2010.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your family's still close, very close.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I--my sister's daughter goes to school in Savannah [Georgia] so, you know, I see her a lot at Charleston [South Carolina].  So I run down, you know, if I'm in Charleston, I try to get down and check on her.  So, anytime I'm anywhere close by--we've got cousins up the East Coast in Connecticut and Boston [Massachusetts].  So, anytime I'm anywhere near the cousins, I check in on them or they check in on me.  So, we're, we're good.
Speaker 1: That's good.
Story_ID: 26157
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  It depends on by who.  Hopefully, with a smile.  As someone who was honest, worked hard, you know, cared about the next generation, I think.  But it depends on who's there to remember me.  I think my daughters will remember me probably in the same way, laughed a lot.  But, yeah, I think that's it.
