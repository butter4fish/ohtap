Speaker 1: Do you remember your father much?
Speaker 2: Not much.
Speaker 1: Okay, so.
Speaker 2: See, I was raised by a brother, my oldest brother [Clinton Daylie], and his wife.
Speaker 1: Then why don't we go back and just state that your mother died.  She died when she gave birth to you, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So if you could just state that.  You can give her name, though, and your father's name.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Lucinda, and she died at my birth, and I just don't have anything but pictures or photographs of her and fondness that my oldest brother, who raised a sister and myself, gave us mementos of her that I keep with me at practically all the time.  I'm sorry.  One time, I didn't--I have a little locket with her hair in it, a sprig of her hair.  That's the only thing that I have of my mother.
Story_ID: 17486
Speaker 1: And your father's name.
Speaker 2: Richard, Open-the-Door Richard.  My father was a very interesting person.  He was self-taught.  He was like a veterinarian.  He taught himself, and Covington, Tennessee--see, I went back for the first time in 1978, and I took my sister-in-law who raised me along with my oldest brother [Clinton Daylie].  When she passed, well, I took my brother--he was pretty upset and broken up--and put him in the car and drove down to Covington.  That was my first trip back to Covington, Tennessee, since he brought me up here [to Chicago, Illinois], and in Covington there's the town, the heart of the town.  There's a circle, and if you divide that circle in half, one half of the circle is the white business, and they have air-conditioned, wall-to-wall carpeting.  The other half of the circle are the black businesses.  It's--you know, you go up three steps with the wooden sidewalks, the wooden booths with the knotholes in it, and they have a street that I was surprised when I--it was in 1978.  I had just gotten my new car because I didn't want to have any problems driving my brother back down.  I wanted everything to go smooth, and so when we got down to the heart of Covington, the first person that he sees sitting there was an old school chum of his.  He had not been to Covington in 40 years.  The first person sitting there after he said that he was Richard's son, oldest son, well, "oh, yeah, well, you must be"--"well, this is my youngest brother."  There's a street in the other half of this town, and that street is called "Nigger Row."  It's still called "Nigger Row" right today.  I just--I didn't want to believe it so I had just bought this new [Cadillac] El Dorado, had the license plate on it, and it was parked across the street under the meter, and so about, oh, ten minutes after I was sitting there, talking, listening to my brother renew old acquaintances, up walked the little sheriff, over, looked at the car and he came right over to where we were sitting on Nigger Row.  There were about three of the old settlers sitting there talking to my brother and myself, didn't need any electronic equipment, didn't need to type and find out and trace my license.  All he said was "that sure is a fine-looking car there," and the fellow who had been--went to school with my brother years ago and my brother had been talking to him told him, he said "yes, that's Richard's youngest son.  He owns a radio station in Chicago, and he's here.  He's just--Clinton's wife just died.  He's here on the--they don't need any electric."  The cat told him in less than five minutes, gave him a history, so the guy said "oh, well, that's all right then. " I didn't have to worry.  I was all right so the difference in--they said to me "Daddy-O, you know that--see that little place right over there?"  I said "yeah."  They said "well, your sister used to own one of the cocktail lounges there," and it was Ruby's Lounge so we walked over, and it's still a little lounge with--oh, just the difference is right over on one half of the circle, air-conditioned, wall-to-wall carpeting, very modern.  Now on the other side, it just hasn't improved one bit.
Speaker 1: Were these places, like you know, like your sister's place, was it on Nigger Row?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 17487
Speaker 1: Tell me who your siblings are?  Your brother was Richard, right?  No, he was--.
Speaker 2: Clinton.
Speaker 1: Clinton.  Okay.  The oldest brother, the one who raised you was Clinton.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I have five brothers--Clinton, Denton, Benton, Oliver, and, well, myself, you know.  We were five.  See, there was thirteen of us in the family, and so I never knew four of my sisters.  They passed before I ever got to know them, and so it was quite a revelation when I went back there.  Covington, Tennessee is--everybody should, from the South, if that's where you were born, you should go back to your birth place just to take a look--I went back.  My brother had never been there in forty years.  I put him in the car, and we were driving around.  I said "show me where we were born, where I was born," and we drove down up one little dirt road and down--hillies, and then there was a frame, a foundation, that was no house but just the foundation, and in that foundation were just branches and trees and growth, and he said "that's where our home was."  He knew exactly where to go after all those years, which is amazing, and he said "right over there was the Salem Baptist Church," and I said "well."  I didn't want to challenge him, but one of my sisters with me who lived in Memphis [Tennessee]--she had moved to Memphis so she was riding with us--and so in the yard of the church they had a cemetery, and that's where they buried the members up there, and so there was one gentleman that they called "Preacher."  I never will forget him.  When they introduced us and said "this is Richard and Jenny's son, youngest son," and all of a sudden they didn't have me--each time I was introduced, I was no longer just working on the [radio] station, I owned the station, and it kept getting bigger and bigger--.  So this one guy that they called Preacher, he had on his overalls--I want you to get the picture--Preacher was standing there, and so he said "boy, I want you to know that your dad was a favorite of mine.  There's nothing that I wouldn't do for your father, Richard [Daylie], before he died, and after he died, I just--every--I want you to know I took it upon myself now."  His wife was sitting over there in a chair, and she's doing like --(shakes head for no)--I've never seen her before, and she's--(shakes head for no)--but he's continuing to tell me.  He's selling me.  "I go every week once a week, and I tend to his grave.  I won't let a weed grow on his grave."  And I said "well, that is so nice of you, Preacher."  I put my hand in my pocket and pulled it out, and I gave him $20.  I just slipped it to him.  I said "that is so nice, and I really appreciate you doing that."  "Oh, no, I don't want that.  I do that because Richard was a friend of mine," but he's putting the money in his pocket all the time, and his wife kept saying--(shakes head for no) you know, so I didn't know so finally she finally had the chance to get close to me.  She said "he's telling you a story.  He didn't do any of those things he said" so that's when we finally went over to the church, and we were all over the--you know, but he--and he's not a preacher.  They just call him Preacher so he just clipped me for. (Laughs).
Speaker 1: That was your experience at Covington
Speaker 2: --
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Good old boy comes down there from the big city so they sold me the London Bridge again.  I keep buying it.
Story_ID: 17488
Speaker 1: Did your brother--you said there were four girls and there were the five boys.  Now what were the--you said there were a total of thirteen.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but there were two brothers, Alfred, that died real young.  We never really got to know them.  They were, you know--they were--I'm only talking about those that I knew and that migrated either to Chicago [Illinois] and I had an opportunity to meet them.
Speaker 1: Now how did you end up getting to Chicago?  I mean, how did your brother end up here?  Did he come--I mean, your mother [Lucinda Daylie] dies [1920] and then five years later your father [Richard Daylie] dies [1925].
Speaker 2: Yeah, but when my mother died--well, Clinton, who was the oldest, my oldest brother, had married Joanna, and he and Joanna moved to Chicago at the time that my mother passed, and we moved to Morgan Park [neighborhood on far South Side of Chicago].  Well, I'm going by what they told me, 113th Street and Elizabeth, and so that's how I know that my father passed when I was like five.  That's how--he came up to visit us, and I was five years old, and he [Clinton] said "boy, this is your father," and I was just saw the man.  I didn't know who he was.
Speaker 1: So you came with your brother?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I see.
Speaker 2: He promised my father that he would raise a sister.  I have a sister named Lucille who is now deceased, too.  Lucille--see, I'm the youngest in the family so you know we're old livers.  Now I have a brother, Oliver, who is eighty-six years old, and I wish you could see him.  You saw how I had to struggle getting up these steps.  Oliver comes up the steps two and three at a time, and you know, and I feel like--but Oliver is very agile for his age.  I had a brother named James.  James also expired so the only one that's living now is Oliver and myself.  There was Denton and Clinton and Benton and James.  They're all gone, see, and Lucille.  There's Ruby.  There's Sula and Nazarine, and--
Speaker 1: (Pause).
Speaker 2: (Dailey tries, but cannot remember the rest)
Story_ID: 17489
Speaker 1: What are some of your earliest memories of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, just working hard because my brother, Clinton [Daylie], was a hard worker.  He impressed upon me, on my sister [Lucille] and I, that you either--there are two ways to get money.  You work for it or you steal it, and he said "you're not going to be under my roof if you're a thief," and he worked at Griffin Wheel Company.  He made wheels for the trains.  He worked hard, and it would take him from Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois], 113th [Street]--it would take him like two and a half hours to get up in the morning, 4:00 in the morning, catch a streetcar, and ride all the way to Griffin Wheel Company, and he always had chores for me to do.  In the summer he would always say "boy, we are going to--we are going to dig up the lots."  He would always have four lots for our gardens out there, plenty of space, and we had one fork, and "we," I found out backward, is "me" so he would come home.  "We" became "me."  He gave me the [pitch]fork, and I always had to dig.  Everybody else had a man out there in Morgan Park with a horse and a plow, and I think he charged like seventy-five cents to plow up a lot.  No, my brother gave me that fork, and I had to dig up each of those lots.  He said "you know, this is going to pay for your food that I give you," and so I had four lots that "we" dug up.  Then he would say "when I come home from work tonight, we are going to plant" because he'd always plant by the moon, he'd look at the calendar, and he did everything.  He got that from his father, from our father [Richard Daylie].  We'd plant by the moon, and so anyway "we" meant "me" so I'd have the rake out.  Then he would stand there and show me how to plant, and so I worked very hard, and we had the best garden in Morgan Park.  Across the street from us were neighbors that would have their lawn parties with the Japanese lanterns, and the fellow played Hawaiian guitar.  You know, he had his own orchestra, and his daughters and sons had their little parties.  I'd be out digging up in the garden.  Now we've got string beans and onions and cabbages and tomatoes.  Now my brother is saying "you've got to take some vegetables over to the Vaughns and the Hennings," and I could not understand that.  They didn't help me plant, help me dig it up or me plant it, but those were his orders, and I never challenged him because he was very strict.  He would whip me with his belt, see, and when--if my sister-in-law [Joanna Dailey] told him "Clint, that boy said--," he'd just start taking his belt off when he'd come in from work so he was very strict discipline.  But I thank him for it because I have always worked hard, and work has never hindered me from earning a living, you know.
Story_ID: 17490
Speaker 1: Now how much older was he [Clinton Daylie] than you at this time?  I mean was he like twelve, thirteen, fourteen twenty?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  He was huge.  Big Brother was fully grown, you know.
Speaker 1: So you called him Big Brother?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  I had Big Brother--Clinton I called "Big Brother."  Benton was "Little Brother."  See, they were all older, and Oliver was the next, see?  They were all older right on down to Albert, and I was the youngest.  The girls were in between.
Story_ID: 17491
Speaker 1: Morgan Park [neighborhood on far South Side of Chicago, Illinois] at that time [1920s] was a very rural area.  It was rural, right?
Speaker 2: Um hmm.
Speaker 1: So you grew up--would you call it more--people don't think of Morgan Park as being--it was a suburb sort of or it was part of Chicago, but it was.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was rural.  It was very rural.  At 113th [street] where we lived there was nothing but open spaces.  You could walk out, and there was prairie.  You could have--they had goats and have the goats feeding out, and the guy would be walking his cows out, and you know, it was just like--that's why they moved out there, you know.  They came right from Tennessee right to Morgan Park.
Speaker 1: Now was it a black community still then or was it?
Speaker 2: It was--the section that we lived in was black.  We--always remember the railroad tracks.  There were two tracks out there, the Rock Island and the Pennsylvania.  We lived in between the two tracks on--when you were west of the Rock Island, that was the white neighborhood.  When you were east of the Pennsylvania, that was the white neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Black neighborhood.
Speaker 2: No.  We were in the middle.
Speaker 1: Oh, you were--okay.
Speaker 2: We were in the middle.  See?  We were--it had a lot of action in there, very nice community, you know, but we were between the railroads.
Speaker 1: Now are there any of the people that you grew up with that we might know, I mean, that were part of that neighborhood or came out of that neighborhood at the time you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, "Duke" Slater, Judge Slater, Fred Slater went to Iowa [University, Iowa City, Iowa].  He was an All-American football player and later became a judge.  We didn't grow any big name celebrities or anything.
Speaker 1: Now you went to--for elementary school, you went to.
Speaker 2: John D. Shoop School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And then you went from elementary school to high school?  Is that right?
Speaker 2: To Morgan Park High School [Chicago, Illinois].  That was on the other side of the tracks.
Speaker 1: Was Shoop mainly black at the time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It still is.
Speaker 1: Morgan Park was white?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It's still white.
Speaker 2: But when I graduated from Shoop, my class graduated in 1934, and we were trying to enter--our class was going to go to Morgan Park High School, and they went out on strike.  The Morgan Park High School went out on strike because they didn't want blacks coming into that school.  They had some blacks.  They had enough.  [Singer] Frank Sinatra came out and talked to the students, and he happened to be in the city.  I never will forget that, and that kind of stands out in my mind so--but then two years after that, I was captain of the basketball team, the first black captain in the sport.
Speaker 1: So when he [Sinatra] came out, you mean, he helped to integrate it?  Is that what happened?
Speaker 2: Yes, because they were boycotting.  The whites were boycotting.  It was in all the newspapers and radios.  That was before television.
Story_ID: 17492
Speaker 1: Now what were you like as a young person, I mean, and when did your interest in sports--?  I know you say in here about, you know, "I was an athlete and a school scholar," but I mean--but I want to go even, you know, when you were back at Shoop [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  What was the young Holmes Daylie, you know, like?  Was he a dreamer?  Was he mischievous?  Was he well-behaved?  Was he, you know, rambunctious?  What were you like?
Speaker 2: I was mischievous, and I was always athletically inclined, you know.  I grew up on the playground, participated in all the sports.  You know, when you're raised on the playground, when you played basketball, you ran over to the basketball court, and there was always somebody--"I'll take him" because, you know, the guy was a pretty decent athlete, and he played a fair game of basketball, and--I had never played basketball because that seemed like a stupid game to me.  You know, I was just about nine, ten, eleven years old, and so when I happened to be playing softball one day--I never will forget--and so we finished playing that, and they ran over to the basketball court from the softball court, and anytime that we had a game, whatever it was, touch tackle football, they said "we'll take Daylie."  I was always the first one chosen.  Well, here it is.  I ran over the basketball court, and they kept picking all around me and over me because they had never seen me play because I couldn't play.  I never played basketball, and I kept waiting for them to select me, and finally I said "I want to play."  They said "you can't play," and that hurt me so I stayed on the playground.  They closed the playground at nine P.M. every night.  They turned their lights out, and I went and bought me a rubber basketball, and I stayed on the playground, and I would shoot the ball in.  It would hit that rim, and sometimes it would bounce and run all the way across the playground.  There was no one out there but me, and I continued to do that.  They were never going to say "I couldn't play that game" anymore so I waited, and then the game broke up one day, and they said "let's play basketball," and so I went over there.  I stood up there.  They picked all around me so I chose my team, and you play as long as you win, and I had watched them play, and I just picked me four guys, and we just kept winning, and they kept saying "where did you learn to play?"  Well, I didn't know the rules so good, but I knew how to put the ball in the hole, and I knew how to dribble, and I got fancy with it.  I was good on the playground, same way with swimming.  I liked to drown my nutty self.  I left the playground in the summer once and went over to Ada Park where they had just opened a swimming pool.  They put a brand-new pool out there, Ada Park [Chicago, Illinois], outdoor pool, and we left the playground, and we ran over there, and I saw those little kids.  They'd come out of the shower.  Those little kids'd run and jump in the water and "come on and swim."  I could not swim, but I--so I ran and jumped in the water, and I kept--(flails arms)--I was drowning, and the lifeguard who knew me, watching me on the playground, he knew that I was a pretty good athlete.  He thought I was clowning.  I was drowning, not clowning, but drowning, and so finally one of the guys said "hey, he is--we've never seen him in there" and finally reached down--because I saw those little kids run and jump in that pool and swim and come right out so that's when I said "well, get down there in the low end where the water is where you can stand up and learn to swim," and that's what I did, but I didn't know.  I just.
Speaker 1: So you swam.  You played basketball.  You played football, right?  Did you do track?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I wasn't--I didn't--I was on the relay team.  See, we had in Morgan Park [neighborhood on far South Side of Chicago, Illinois] what we called a Morgan Park Week, and that was a celebration where we had track and field meet, and we--everybody looked forward to Morgan Park Week.  We had swimming.  We had all sorts of races.  We had baseball, softball, you know, and that's--but everybody in Morgan Park that grew up on the playground, it was just natural we did that.
Story_ID: 17493
Speaker 1: There was a fellow named Steve Thornton.  We called him "Bear Man," and he was a semi-pro softball pitcher, and they traveled.  He traveled with the [Chicago] Hottentots, [professional traveling basketball and baseball team] and he had watched me play softball.  I played shortstop and third base, and he traveled on the road, and whenever they needed players, sometimes he would come and get one or two of the players that he knew from the playground that could fill in for a day or two and make short trips like Indiana or Michigan, you know, and he would pick me up.  I would've paid them to play, but he--I said "you mean you're going to pay me" so I went--he's the one who introduced me to the Hottentots.
Speaker 2: So what was that--had you graduated at that point when you got introduced to the Hottentots or not?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay so you start playing with them?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I played high school [sports]--like all kids, in high school, automatically you would play.  You was on the swimming team, you know, and you played basketball, and you played baseball.  Bob Kennedy who was with Cleveland [Indians baseball team], later on the manager, Bob Kennedy was a Morgan Park High School [Chicago, Illinois] baseball player, and he and Don Calloway who played out in Blue Island [Illinois], they had a league [baseball] team, and so they would come by and get different players, select them, and have them when they needed them to fill in, and they would come and sometimes pick me up and another fellow out there named J. T. Peters, and we'd go and so--and the Boston Goodwins, we played basketball with them.  They were the basketball team that played the Trotters, played the [Harlem] Globetrotters [traveling professional basketball team].  They traveled.  They played the same circuit that the Globetrotters played.
Speaker 2: You know, we hear so much about the Negro baseball leagues, but this was the Negro basketball leagues sort of, right?  But they would play for entertainment, right?
Speaker 1: There was a team called the Zulu Clowns.  Now that's where I drew the line, but they would dress you up in the grass skirts and the grass around the wrists and around the neck and they paint, (gestures at face), and the stone earrings and play barefoot with the--and play basketball, Zulu Clowns, and they were very, oh, entertaining, but they kept trying to get--I couldn't live with myself if I played with them, but they paid good money, but no, I couldn't cut that.
Speaker 2: But you got paid when you played with the Hottentots?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: And where did you travel?  What places--what were the places you traveled?
Speaker 1: Well, Boston [Massachusetts], New York [New York], Mexico.  We went all over.
Speaker 2: And how many people were on the team?
Speaker 1: Oh, a regular team.
Speaker 2: I mean, was it thirteen?  The only reason I say--[photographer, writer, director] Gordon Parks [Sr.], I think he said there were only five of them, but they never took a break or six--.
Speaker 1: Well, that's a--you're talking about basketball.
Speaker 2: Basketball, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh, yeah, right.  Five players, but only five can play at a time.
Speaker 2: I thought you just said there were just five?
Speaker 1: Five at one time on the floor, but maybe what could've happened that they only had five players period, and they had to play all the time.  Yeah, that could've happened.  See, now we had a station wagon, and it was rough.  We would play.  We'd travel into a city, and our names would be all on the marquee, and we couldn't eat in the restaurant.  We couldn't live in the hotel.  We had to sleep in our station wagon, and as soon as we got out on the floor, "oh, we were stars."  They just applauded, and you know, and so those were rough days, but they were fun, too, you know.
Speaker 2: So what age are you at this point?  Are you like sixteen or fifteen when you're playing with this team?
Speaker 1: I was seventeen, eighteen.
Speaker 2: Seventeen, eighteen.  Okay.
Story_ID: 17494
Speaker 1: So you went to all--this is a big deal, you going to all these places, because it's not like you've see anything other than Morgan Park [neighborhood on far South Side of Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: I would have paid them.  You understand?  I would have paid them.  At twenty, when I was about twenty-three years old was when I was really--there was a guy in Chicago that had a professional basketball team named Meacham, and Meacham was the only black businessman that produced equipment for sports equipment, knee pads for basketball, and he had his own shoes, and so he would send teams out on the road.  We played for him, and he was the first guy that--he never went out, and he would sit down with a ruler, slide ruler, and he could tell us how many miles we were supposed to travel on that gas, and he would only pay us by that, you know, and we had to wear his equipment, and he's doing all right.  He was--I learned a lot from him.
Speaker 1: He was a smart guy?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now before when you started playing with the [Chicago] Hottentots [professional traveling basketball and baseball team], were the Hottentots--were they black-owned or white-owned, and were you playing for white or black audiences?
Speaker 2: We're playing before white audiences, but they were black-owned.  Now the [Harlem] Globetrotters [traveling basketball team] were white-owned, see.  Abe Saperstein owned the Globetrotters, and Abe would have two and three teams of Globetrotters.  He'd have a Globetrotter team out East and a Globetrotter team out West, you know, and they would be playing, and they'd have the uniforms, and they'd go through there, and the money would come to Abe.  They would pay you, you know, but.
Speaker 1: It wasn't as much as he was making.
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: Now the thing I also learned was the Globetrotters--weren't they supposed to start here in Chicago.  They started here in Chicago, but how did they get the name Harlem Globetrotters?
Speaker 2: He just took it.  It meant "black," Harlem, New York.  You know, when you say "Harlem," you knew that was a black part of New York so Harlem meant black so that's how they got it.
Story_ID: 17495
Speaker 1: How many teams were there like this?  I mean when you played the circuit, like you say next--but your audiences were--so you were there to entertain the audience, you know, with your--so you did all the spins and the--you know.
Speaker 2: We--every time we [Daylie's traveling professional baseball and baseball team] played, we--just like the [Chicago] Cubs [baseball team] travel into each city, that's what we did, you know?  The marquee was up.  Our posters were up, and we traveled in there.  We'd come in in our little station wagon or trucks or whatever, and we unload and put on our uniform, and then sometimes it got pretty rough.  I remember playing in Missouri, you know, and, see, we bet on the games, you know, and they had what they call a "Betters' Row," "Gambler's Row," where all the professional betters would sit, and you could always get a bet so when you came in, if you wanted to bet, you'd look at the team and place a bet.  You'd go there, and somebody there would take your bet so I remember one time we were playing in Missouri, and so they were saying to us well, you're not supposed to win this game, and so we were playing, and it was like a sheriff had his big hog leg [pistol], and I kept hitting the ball pretty good, and there was a man on second [base] and third [base], and it was like the seventh inning, and we were one run behind, and I was up to bat, and he took his gun and put it in front of him like this (pantomimes placing gun on lap) and said--got around in back of the backstop--you know how the backstop is--and he was kind of looking through the little wire, and he said "nigger, you ain't gonna hit that ball, are you, if you expect to go home?"  I said "I'm gonna hit the ball, and I'm gonna go home."  He says "all right, but you're gonna go home in a box."  I said "well, you just let him throw that ball and see.  We'll see who goes home in a box."  You oughta seen me striking out.  I just--(pantomimes swinging a baseball bat).  No, but we had some--but you have to put on a front like you weren't--but then they would follow you to your car.  The police would take you to your car so I said "no more."  That was the end of my.
Speaker 1: So you were playing basketball and baseball on the road like this?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Both?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 17496
Speaker 1: Now how many teams were you--did you have a season that you played?  Was there a season or this wasn't--it was just like you were booked in different places around.
Speaker 2: In the winter we played basketball, and in the summer we played baseball, and if it was with the [Chicago] Hottentots [professional traveling baseball and basketball team], we played that little softball, which is that 12-inch softball, but you still play with gloves, and that's a popular game in the suburbs, see, and blacks were just beginning to really become involved in it, you know, in the last eight, nine years, but we made some nice money, too.
Speaker 1: Who were the teams you played against?  What were some of their names now?
Speaker 2: Oh, just local teams.
Speaker 1: Local teams.  Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, that's where the money is.  It's a local team.  Just like we go to Mount Greenwood [Illinois] and we play so there's a team up in Mount Greenwood that would get the best--they would stack up.  They would bring in.  They'd go out, and they'd import some teams.  They'd get the best team, and we'd come in with our team, and they said how much money you got, you know, but we'd stack up, too, sometimes, you know.
Speaker 1: So this was black teams playing black teams in front of white audiences.  No?
Speaker 2: Black teams playing white teams.
Speaker 1: Would the white teams get upset if you beat them?
Speaker 2: When you're down in the South for the money.  They're losing that money.  That's why [they would get upset].
Story_ID: 17497
Speaker 1: So you did this from like--you started at seventeen, and you said you did this until you were twenty-three.
Speaker 2: Well, off and on, off and on.  I did this off and on even up until I was in my middle twenties, thirties back when they would come in.  I'd get a call, and sometimes they'd say "hey."  They'd call me "Schoolboy."  "'Schoolboy,' you wanna make this trip?  We got a"--I'd say "yeah, okay."
Speaker 1: Now why did you have the nickname "Schoolboy?"
Speaker 2: Well, I used to look pretty young, and I started young, you know.
Speaker 1: And what things did you learn on the road?  Were there any other experiences that, you know, you had during that period that you'd like to share?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that what my brother--the background that my brother [Clinton Daylie] gave me was a good education that kept my feet on the ground because I was exposed to a lot of temptation, gambling, narcotics, you know, the whole gamut, and I played on teams with fellows that were a lot better than me, that were professional, had played with the [Harlem] Globetrotters [professional traveling basketball team] and made big money, but they gambled their money off, and so I would loan them my money, and I would loan them a dollar on a dollar, you see, so it was, you know, and they would get--while they were borrowing my money, you know, it was all right, but when they had to pay it back--so I would call up ahead.  When we'd get back to Chicago [Illinois], I would tell them, I said "look, Joe Blow.  Don't pay him.  He owes me X number of dollars," and because if Joe Blow got the money, I was out of luck so I used to come back, and I'd have my money that I made and money that I won, and then I had the money that I loaned so it was quite an education.
Speaker 1: Well, you were smart in business then.
Speaker 2: I was a good hustler.
Speaker 1: Right.  A dollar on a dollar, that's not bad.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, when they need it, when they want it, you know.
Story_ID: 17498
Speaker 1: So you come back and you--is there a point where you say that you got tired of that [playing professional sports]?  You got tired of it, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, because I could not--regardless of how much money I had in my pocket--see, what really made me upset was when we got into a town or city, our name's on the marquee.  People are waiting.  We're the main attraction.  We can't eat in the restaurant.  We can't live in the hotel, and when we get in the gymnasium, we're the stars, but when we get off, when the game's over, we gotta get out of town quick.  You know, I just got tired of that.  That's when I just--hey, I just--well "I can make as much money tending bar.
Speaker 1: "
Speaker 2: And you tended bar.  Was that when you went to DuSable [Lounge, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Um hmm.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you got a job there, and you're--okay, you're in your mid-twenties, and was this a prominent bar in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  That's where all of the stars and show business people--[singer] Lena Horne, [pianist, composer and band leader Count] Basie, [pianist, composer and band leader] Duke Ellington--you name 'em.  That's where they all came.
Speaker 2: (Pause).
Speaker 1: Now how long did you work there?
Speaker 2: About seven years, and then I went from there to the El Grotto, but the same--two of the same owners of the DuSable had purchased an interest in the El Grotto, which was in the Pershing [Hotel, Chicago], so they hired me out there, Pershing, which was a larger place and more glamorous, and they had the show down in the basement, the El Grotto with Earl Hines Orchestra and the chorus girls, and you know, it was the place.  [Radio host] Dave Garroway and all of the celebrities came there, and so it was like being on stage because--well, there's a picture I brought, a little picture where I'm standing there with one of the bartenders, and it was a good time.  It was like--you name them.  Sooner or later they would come into the El Grotto Supper Club--[vaudeville comedian] Dusty Fletcher, Kitty Murray.  These were big, black entertainers, just Lena Horne, [pianist and bandleader] Earl Hines.  We had chorus girls from--they would come in from every second show.  They would do two shows.  Then they would bring in a new group of chorus girls so it was exciting times.
Story_ID: 17499
Speaker 1: [Illinois State Senator] Cecil Partee, the late Cecil Partee, was a waiter at the El Grotto Supper Club [Chicago, Illinois], and he was attending law school [at Northwestern University Law School, Chicago, Illinois], studying for the bar, and I was going to radio school [at the School of Radio Technique, Chicago, Illinois], and we had a pact, he and I.  He would come by the bar, and he would have his tray, and he would say "hey, Daddy-O, we gonna make it, and when we make it, I am going to be your lawyer."  I said "it's a deal" so--but he made it way before I did.  He was President Pro Tem[pore] of the [Illinois State] Senate, and he was nice people.  He did very well, but those were good days.  We had--they just--at the El Grotto right behind the bar, there was a room, and you go into that room.  It was just an open room, and we had gambling back there where they would be playing blackjack, shooting dice, and they would send out through the door and order drinks, and I would send them or I would take their drinks back there, and they would just tip me big tips so it was a nice little hustle for me so--and the chorus girls would come off the stage and come right back to the bar, and they would run a tab and tip me big so that was good, good times.
Story_ID: 17500
Speaker 1: Now when did you decide you were going to go to radio school?  That's what we sort of missed along the way.
Speaker 2: Well, how it happened, there was a [radio] disc jockey, a very prominent, very popular disc jockey named Dave Garroway, and he was on NBC [National Broadcasting Company], WMAQ in Chicago [Illinois], and Dave came on, and he was popularizing--he was boosting [jazz singer] Sarah Vaughan.  He would play Sarah's records and promoting her, and Sarah was working then at the old Rhumboogie [Club, Chicago, Illinois], which was just a little nightclub, and so I had never met Dave Garroway so one night I'm tending bar, flipping the ice, catching it in the glass, and saying my rhymes like a guy would come in and "say give me a Scotch."  I'd say "Scotch and soda?"  "Yeah."  "Do you want to be great and drink it straight or do you want me to mix it or do you want to fix it?"  You know, I'd be rhyming, and so Garroway came and sat at the bar, and I'm working the bar so I'd give a guy his drink, and he'd count his change, and I'd say "wait.  Don't want you to leave here acting strange so watch me closely while I count your change," and I would count his change, and then I would palm the top dollar, see, and stick it down my collar.  Then I would lean over with the dollar sticking out of my collar, and I would slide his change over to him, and he was "ha ha" and be fooled.  I said "no, no, count your money because I don't want you leaving acting funny."  "No, I'll count it."  I said "count your money," and he would count "seven, eight, nine, seven, eight, ni--" and I said "see there?  Don't holler.  Here's your dollar sticking down my collar," and he would laugh and say "well, you keep it," you know, and that's how--so it was a fun thing with me so this guy's sitting there watching me, and he said "do you have a script or are these just some things that you say ad lib?"  I said "I'm too hip for a script" so he said "you ought to be in radio," and I said--I never thought about it.  I said "yeah."  I don't know.  I gave him some flip answer, and I'm working the bar because I worked alone at that time so Sarah was at the table with her husband and a party, and they got ready to leave so they came back, and she said "Daddy-O, do you know Dave Garroway," and I said "no, but we had a little session here" so they left, and about three weeks later I'm working, flipping the ice and doing my thing, and I heard this voice that said "well, I see that you don't have any ambition because you're still doing the same thing.  You just want to be a bartender.  That's the height of your ambition."  And that hurt me so I didn't want him [Garroway] to know he got to me, but I started thinking, and there was a disc jockey on the air in our city who will remain nameless but who was not--well, he raped the King's English, let's put it this way.  And so I said "hey, I'm better than he is."  I had been listening to this guy all the time, but I never heard him.  Then when Gabe said that, "I said I'm better than he is, and I'm not even on the air" so I said "okay."  So I went and got the Yellow Pages [business telephone directory], and I thought I should get a book, look up public speaking.
Story_ID: 17501
Speaker 1: I thought "that's the direction I should take" [career in radio broadcasting] so I got the Yellow Pages [business telephone directory].  While I'm thumbing through it, I saw School of Radio Technique, broadcasting, [Chicago, Illinois] and I said "hey, this sounds like what I should have" so I made a call and said "yeah, that's where I want to go" so I registered and went down to the School of Radio Technique and took the course, and when I was getting ready to give them my money, the fellow said--I never will forget Fred Robins--he said "now wait.  Are you sure this is what you want?"  I said "yes, I'm certain."  He said "well, now I don't know whether we can play--"  I said "look, I don't want you to do but one thing--give me the course.  That's all I want from you."  So--because I was the first black that they had in their school, and they had in their ad "we have a placement service" so he didn't want to take my money knowing that he couldn't place me.  I said "I don't want you to do anything but give me the course" so he said "all right" so I took the course, and then I was working one night and the same fellow, Charles Cole, Charlie Cole, who was one of the owners of the DuSable Lounge [Chicago, Illinois], who came out--originally I was tending bar out in Morgan Park [neighborhood on far South Side of Chicago] that had a little cocktail lounge in a house where all of the players would hide away.  They'd come from the South Side out there and have a drink with their friends, and he saw me working, flipping ice, and they had ten waitresses, and I was the only bartender, and I just kept them all working and moving, and they had tables all around, and he asked me if I'd like to come work for him.  I said "what are you"--I didn't, you know--"What do you pay, money?  What do you think I make here, peanuts?"  You know, I had to be hip.  I didn't want him to think that he could steal me away from The Pace establishment [bar in Morgan Park] so he said "well, when you get ready to move up, come see me."  So that's how he hired me from there to the DuSable.  Now I'm taking this course, and I'm tending bar for him at the El Grotto [Supper Club, Chicago, Illinois] because he's hired me from the DuSable to the El Grotto where he has an interest in also, and he said--I was talking not to him but to a customer that "I'm trying to get into radio."  I said that many a time, and the only difference is he heard it, but he'd been drinking, and he was drinking his Scotch.  He says "well, why don't you come seem me tomorrow, and I'll get you a sponsor because I'm gonna have Keely Distributorship," and I said "don't get too happy now."  He's been drinking.  He won't even remember this tomorrow.  So bright and early the next morning, I called.  He was at the Pershing [Hotel, Chicago].  I called him.  I said "do you remember the conversation we had last night?"  He said "yeah, I told you that I was going to sponsor you with Keely Distributorship.  I know what I said."  And I said "well, I don't want to go and spend my money now if that was just your Scotch talking," and he said "well, it's up to you."  I said "no, I'm going" so that's when I went on down there [School of Radio Technique] and took the course, and after I finished the course, true to his word, he got me a half hour a week, once an evening, every day, six days a week, half hour, and that's how I started on WAIT [radio station, Chicago, Illinois], 820.
Story_ID: 17502
Speaker 1: Then the other jocks [disc jockeys], the other black jocks, tuned in, and they were--they heard that I'm playing [pianist, composer, bandleader Count] Basie and "Lady Day" [jazz singer Billie Holiday] and [jazz singer] Ella [Fitzgerald], and instead of encouragement, I got "well, he won't last."  I just continued because I knew there was a market for that because Basie and Duke [Ellington, composer, pianist, bandleader] and [pianist and composer] Fats Waller and all of them, [singer and bandleader] Billy Eckstine, they've been in business all these years so you mean they're going to go out of business because I got into radio?  So they must be doing something right, somebody's listening.  So all of a sudden all the jitneys [taxi cabs]--they had 1,200 jitneys on South Park[way, in Chicago, Illinois] it was then, and you could get in one jitney.  They would charge you a dime, said you were too young.  You didn't know anything.  They had jitneys that were in competition with the buses, and so you would ride--you'd get in one jitney, and you could go from 63rd to 22nd Street for a dime, but if they turn off one half block, it was fifty cents, see, so I just had all the cab drivers, the 1,200 cabbies--they would just--"let's get Daddy-O.  Have you heard Daddy-O?"  You could get in one cab to the next cab and never miss a record.  They were the ones that really promoted me.  I didn't have any advertising agency budget or nothing like that.  They were driving down with customers in and out, and then they'd say "who is that?" and they'd say "that is Daddy-O."  They promoted me.
Story_ID: 17503
Speaker 1: Was rhyming always something you did even as a young person?  When did that come about?  I mean when did you start rhyming?
Speaker 2: Well, when I started tending bar [at El Grotto Supper Club, Chicago, Illinois] you know, because it was just a gimmick that I had, you know, because it helped me with tips, you know.  I said--it was--ladies would come in with their gentleman friend, and so I gave them service, you know.  If you were wearing your fur, well, there's a cabinet there that I had my whiskey locked in, but I had hangers that I would take your fur and put it in there so that no one could walk off with it.  That was a service.  I didn't charge nothing for that, but that pleased you, and that pleased your gentleman friend so you would tip me, see, so--and I would say things like "well, I just want you to tell your friends when they come in, you know, that Daddy-O will treat you right, day or night, so don't get nervous if you want the peak in service,  come see me."  And I would just, you know, whatever it was.  I can't think of anything, and I used to write poetry, and I used to write lyrics for songs, see?  I used to write songs.  The late [singer] Dinah Washington, I wrote a song called 'Joy Juice.'  It was on the flip side to her 'I Can't Get Started With You' on Mercury Records.  See, as a bartender, hazards are part of my trade.  Now 'Joy Juice,' that was juice meaning whiskey.  Then I wrote a tune that [trumpter] Cootie Williams and [saxophonist] Eddie "Cleanhead" Vinson recorded called 'Juice Head Baby's Blues.'  "I got a woman and she's--" I forgot the lyrics--"Juice Head Baby, mean as she can be."  I forgot, tt's been so long.  But anyway the bridge in it is: "I worry when she's--ah, I worry when she's salty, and I worry when she's quiet.  I worry something when she's on a whiskey diet" or something.  I can't--it's been a long--hey, that's been forty years ago, but Eddie "Cleanhead" Vinson and Cootie Williams did that, 'Juice Head Woman Blues,' so all of my tunes were about whiskey, you know, and then I said "I have to start writing pretty things" so I started writing poetry.  Like I wrote--my titles were--oh, they were--'If."  Look at that word.  Don't that grab you?  'If'--that's a beautiful title.  "If night were day and day were night, then I would change them around and make them right.  If the sky was one huge blanket of blue, I'd have it brought down just to cover you.  If of Father Time I had control, then I'd keep the years reversed so you never grow old.  If I could measure your life by miles, I'd keep each block just pregnant with smiles.  If I could rob the sun of its brightest rays, then I'd set them aside for your rainy days."  I used to just sit down and write poems.  I've got a book of them, you know.
Speaker 1: And you started writing poetry in high school or did you start when you were a bartender?
Speaker 2: No, when I was a bartender.
Story_ID: 17504
Speaker 1: So the bartender period, so that had a lot to do--and what about your interest in music?  Did that start earlier or was the exposure you have because you were bartending?
Speaker 2: It all centered around the bartending, see, because--look, I'm dealing with musicians, and they would come in and--like 'Juice Head Baby Blues' [song written by Daylie], there was a girl named Lovey Taylor, and Lovey was from Texas, and Lovey used to come in, and she would be sitting there.  She would drink 100 proof whiskey and would just--I said "what do you want for a chaser?"  She said "a hundred men."  You know, that was her thing, and she would just drink it without a chaser, and then she would just, without a word of warning, reach over and grab the lady next to her, the man next to her, and slap him, and I was the only one that could control her.  I'd say "oh, you're my baby.  You're my juice head baby," and that's how I started.  "I got a juice head baby.  She stays drunk all the time.  When she can't get whiskey, she almost lose her mind.  I worry when she's salty.  I worry when she's quiet.  I worry when something when she's on a whiskey diet."  Well, anyway I can't think of it--but that was that area when I used to just write, you know.  I got a lot of them, never did nothing with them.
Story_ID: 17505
Speaker 1: The other question I have for you, what about your--I know you have the one nickname of "Schoolboy," right?
Speaker 2: (Nods for yes) Um hmm.
Speaker 1: But when did "Daddy-O" come in?  Was that a radio?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  No.  That also happened at the bar.  During the war--see, that's a wartime expression.  During the war, everybody started--when they came into the bar, when they didn't know the bartender's name, they'd say "hey Daddy-O."  Everybody was "Daddy-O," but it just stuck with me.  You could go into any bar "hey, Daddy-O."  You'd see a cab driver, "hey, Daddy-O."  It was just an expression.
Speaker 1: Where did that expression come from?  It just was there, I mean.
Speaker 2: (Shrugs shoulders) It used to be "Sam," you know, like "hey, Sam," "hey, Mack," but I don't know where just "Daddy-O" came.
Story_ID: 17506
Speaker 1: Now who were some of your favorite performers at the time that came through, either through the DuSable Lounge [Chicago, Illinois] or, you know, the El Grotto [Supper Club, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: [Jazz singer] Sarah [Vaughan]--I loved Sassy.  See, and I used to name--give them nicknames like the "Classy Miss Sassy Vaughan" and "June Christy."  You know, I named her the "Misty Miss Christy," and I would always try to identify, you know, some of them, but I just--.  I liked the Ramsey Lewis Trio.  They had a good little [jazz] trio, and they'd been playing around the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], and they were good, but they just couldn't launch.  They couldn't get off the ground, and so I went to [record producer] Leonard Chess, and I said "I want to record them," and we recorded 'Carmen' [Ramsey Lewis Trio song].
Story_ID: 17507
Speaker 1: So you were talking about some of your favorite artists.  You said [jazz singer] Sarah Vaughan was one of them, but who else was?  What were some of her favorite songs that you liked?
Speaker 2: I try not to have favorites because, you know, there's just so many of them, just like with [pianist, composer, bandleader] Duke Ellington.  Everybody says "well, what was it?  Off of Duke's records, I know that you had to have one."  They all laughed when I said "yeah, but one that I loved--you ridiculed me--is 'Air-Conditioned Jungle.'"  It was one that I thought was--you know, because it was so picturesque.  You could just hear the different changes in the melodic--but I don't have--I try not--see, when you play records every day, if I got hung up on "I like this," then I'd start featuring that.  I just tried to--when a record would come in, I'd play it, and I'd listen, and then I'd hope that the fans would say "oh, I like that.  Will you play it again" or something, you know, because I played--I scheduled--I programmed records for the fans, you know.  That's what I attempted to do.
Story_ID: 17508
Speaker 1: Do you remember the year you started with your show?
Speaker 2: 1948, October.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You know you're better with these dates than you think--you've been getting some dates.  Okay.  You were telling, you know, you were saying earlier that all the black deejays [disc jockeys] were on the right-hand side, the far right-hand side?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now how did you end up being with WAIT [Chicago, Illinois radio station] and what--and you said that was in the middle of the dial?
Speaker 2: No.  It was on the left.
Speaker 1: The left-hand side of the dial, and how did the--you know, he sponsored it, but it was?
Speaker 2: See, the left side of the dial is what we called the network band, WMAQ [Chicago radio station], you know, see, WBBM [Chicago radio station], WGN [Chicago radio station], right down.  That's a network band.  Then when you get down, WCFL [Chicago radio station], and you get down, WJJD [Chicago radio station], but down there on the end, that's where all of the minority jocks [disc jockeys] were, but when I got my sponsor [owner of the DuSable Lounge Charles Cole], see, I said "I am going to select my station," see?  So I went down to WAIT, and I made an appointment with Sil Austin.  I didn't know him.  I walked in, and he was a golfer.  He was sitting there.  He was tolerating me, and he had his golf club out, and he was listening "yeah, yeah, what is it?"  And I said "well, I have a disc jockey show."  He said "yeah, you and fifty other colored jocks."  I said "but I have a $25,000 contract."  And he said "oh, yes?"  I said "I have a national client which you can't get on your station without me," and that's how I--and he said "who is your client?"  I said "I'm not tellin' you because you can't get him.  I don't care how good your salesman is.  He bought me, not your station, so now I want you to take your best shot."  That's how we--so Sil Austin--I never will forget, and so he said--because, see, I knew Charlie Cole.  Charlie Cole was the one that said "go.  All right, go to school.  You're gonna get it."  Well, I knew that I had that in the bag so when he found out that I was serious and I could come to him with that $25,000 contract, he said "when do you want to start? " I said "well."  He said "I can move some things around."  I said "no, I've never been on the air.  I'd like to start on a Saturday to get my sea legs, get a little experience for about four or five weeks, and then by that time the agency will have gotten a copy together for me, and I'll have a little experience, and I'll feel comfortable."  So that's how I got there, see.  I didn't want to get down there where those jobs were scrapping--and so it took them awhile to find out down there within the network bands because people were saying "I understand you're on the radio."  I said "yeah."  They said "well, I looked for you.  I couldn't find you.  I said no, I'm not down there."
Story_ID: 17509
Speaker 1: Now the jitney [taxi cab] thing [taxi cab drivers promoted Daylie's show], how did that happen also?  Why did you choose--because you talk about these jitneys, but did you go to the jitneys and say, "you know, I want you to do this" or did word spread or did they like jazz?
Speaker 2: They were all jazz fans.  See, they all loved--see, the other jocks [disc jockeys] were playing [blues musician] Muddy Waters and, you know--but no one playing [jazz singer] Billie Holiday and [jazz singer] Sarah Vaughan.  They would play one or two Sarah Vaughan--so I knew if I got in there and I played, you know, Vaughan and [pianist, composer, bandleader Count] Basie and [pianist, composer, bandleader Duke] Ellington and [singer, bandleader Billy] Eckstine, I'd be able to carve out a nice piece of the market.
Speaker 1: And so you started on Saturdays for like a month?
Speaker 2: No, for about four weeks.
Speaker 1: For four weeks, okay.
Speaker 2: But just once every Saturday for four weeks--so for four Saturdays, yeah.
Speaker 1: And were you scared when you first go on the air?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I could sing (unintelligible).  I had written my opening.  "It's 5:00 in Chicago [Illinois].  Time to stay in the know with Daddy-O."  So Fran Weigel was the staff announcer.  He was supposed to read my intro, and then I was going to read--go into my copy so I wrote it all in rhyme, see, so if it had music, I could sing.  I practiced it so I knew it with my eyes closed.  I could sing it so after the fourth week--well, the agency had the copy, and they had finalized everything.  We got together on the money, and I said--so I started, and I was on six states right across the board.
Speaker 1: What time?
Speaker 2: 5:00 to 5:30.
Story_ID: 17510
Speaker 1: How long did it take you to build an audience?
Speaker 2: See now, the top jock [disc jockey] was Al Benson.  He was on from 4:30 to 6:00, see, and so I started at 5:00 so now they were saying "how are you gonna compete against Al Benson?"  I said "it's all right."  I knew so when I went down to the stop, which there was a bus where all the cab drivers would stop there right across from Robert's where they would have coffee, and I'd say "fellows, I'm starting my show so be sure and ear check me because I'm gonna be dedicating a record to you," and you know, I'd dedicate a tune to them, and they would tell 'em, and they'd hear their name.  That was it, and then pretty soon they would "beep, beep," blow their horn when they would see me driving, and then when I got on five nights, ha, it was all peaches.  They said--then when I would tape, see, I would work live Monday through Friday and tape the Saturday, and I would be driving down South Park[way in Chicago, Illinois], and they'd say "hey, man, we got you on and you--."  You know, so it was a tremendous help they were, and they were all down in the Loop [downtown area of Chicago] and you know.  People were saying "who is that" so they were really promoting my show.
Speaker 1: And Al Benson, what station was he on?
Speaker 2: WGES [Chicago radio station].
Speaker 1: WGES.  Okay, but he played more blues and things, right?
Speaker 2: But he started out playing just what I was playing--[jazz singer] Billie Holiday, [pianist, composer, bandleader Count] Basie--because, see, Al Benson was the uncle to Bernice Shavers.  They owned the Groove Record shop.  That was the hippest record shop in Chicago.  They were right across from the Regal Theatre in the basement there.  They had--that's where--when they had the stage shows at the Regal, all of the entertainers would flock over there because they had all of the records, and so Ernie and George Leaner, they would program Al's shows when they first started, and they were programming jazz, and he had a swinging show, but then the record companies got to him, you know, and so they wasn't getting to him to play Basie and Lady Day [Billie Holiday] and them, you know, but for those other records.  So pretty soon there wasn't no room for Basie and Lady Day so I had that to myself.
Speaker 1: So in that whole time what are you learning about, you know, being on the air and all of that?  You know, is it surprising?  You didn't have a call-in or anything like that.  People just--they heard you play.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I did several types of shows.  After I was on for a few years I had a talk show we called 'Rap Session,' you know, where people would call in, and we'd discuss certain things, you know.  Then I went into the T.V. show because I got tired of just playing records, and there were other things that I felt that I wanted to get my teeth into so--and then the interview went on the T.V. show that I could sit down and discuss things with them.
Speaker 1: On T.V.  But now, didn't you go over to WAAF [Chicago radio station]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But that was after--how long were you on WAIT [Chicago radio station]?
Speaker 2: Oh, about seven or eight years, and then I went over to WAAF.

Speaker 1: "Daddy-O" Daylie, I'd like you to give some perspective on black radio because [disc jockey] Al Benson--he was like sort of the start, right, in some respects?
Speaker 2: No, there was a disc jockey named Eddie Honesty, Junior, out in Hammond, Indiana.  He was the first pioneer, and in Chicago [Illinois] at the same time was a disc jockey named Jack L. Cooper.  Jack L. Cooper was a big, big jock.  He was on a little 250 watt station, but he was very popular, very big, but, you know, he was an old carnival barker, but he did a good show, and he pioneered.  He made it possible for Benson.  Then, you know, Benson opened the doors for me and Sid McCoy [disc jockey] and Norm Spaulding [disc jockey], and there was "Open-the-Door" Richard.  I can't think of his last name, but I wish I could.  I'm gonna try to find him if I can.  He's quite a character, but he was quite effective for awhile, you know.
Speaker 1: Now this is before WVON [Chicago, Illinois radio station] then.  I'm just trying to understand.  I'm just saying the time that you came in, WVON, did it exist?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: But it was--was that the time when people like--okay, I'm just--if you give some--bear with me because I'm not from Chicago.  That's why (laughs), but bear with me.  When--just describe because you said you started in 1948 on radio.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Al Benson was a giant then.  He had been in business for about eight years or so or 10 years.  Sid McCoy had been established in the business.  Norm Spaulding had been in the business.  I was a "Johnny-Come-Lately," you know.
Speaker 1: But they are on the right-hand side of the dial, on the far end?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all of them.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) All of them.
Speaker 1: All of them are there.
Speaker 2: Are you--you're the first one who became central in this band, and you also took jazz.  You were known for jazz and your rhyming.  Were they rhyming also?
Speaker 1: Well, Al Benson started trying to rhyme.  He had a script writer named Bennett Aids who was an advertising agency, and he had an automobile agency as one of his clients called The Angel of Broadway, and so what he would do, he would listen to my show, and he would take some of my rhymes, and then he would put them into commercials and put them on Al's, and Al would be trying to read them, you know.  It was hilarious, but.
Story_ID: 17512
Speaker 1: So they were surprised by your success in some respects, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  [Advertising writer] Bennett Aids said--he said to me one day that he wanted me to do some things for him, and I said "no."  I was in the Bud Billiken parade [sponsored by the Chicago 'Defender' newspaper] every time they had their annual parade, and so this year, this particular year, they had [fictional cowboy hero] Hopalong Cassidy as the star so I put on my--I rented the cowboy outfit, hat, guns, and the whole bit, and so I had been announcing I was going to challenge Hopalong Cassidy to a duel because he was invading my territory, and that's when--you know, the Bud Billiken Parade, if you've never been to it, it is something.  Oh, it is a day.  So it was a beautiful morning, and I had on my cowboy outfit, and they had the reviewing stand, and all the dignitaries were on the stand, and Hopalong was there with his outfit on, his two guns, and I came along on the float with my outfit on.  When I got to the stand, I said "hold it, hold it."  I said "Hopalong Cassidy," and they--everybody looked.  I said "I'm Dragalong Daddy-O, and you have invaded my territory, and I challenge you to a duel," and I looked down, and all the little kids had their noses on the stage, on the--looking, watching, and they were saying "you can't beat Hopalong," so I said "when I count to three, I want you to reach for your weapon.  One, two.  What comes after two?"  He said "three," and I grabbed and dropped my guns and everything, and he took his out and shot up in the air, and the kids said "I told you he couldn't beat Hopalong," you know, and so everybody applauded, you know, and so that's how I met Hopalong Cassidy.  I got a picture with him.  I had never met him, you know, and he was saying he didn't know whether or not I was a quick draw.  I said "I can't even draw with a pencil," but I have enjoyed a good forty years in the business.
Story_ID: 17513
Speaker 1: I retired in 1988, and the wife [Marcheta Daylie] and I--I call my wife the "War Department" because she can declare war in a minute, you know, when things don't go to suit her, but I say that in jest.  She's a beautiful person, and she just has a heart as big as that (points) television set there, and she was the one that was really responsible for us getting involved in that Operation Christmas Basket because of a letter that we received from a lady who said that she had no food, and they had turned her lights off, and so if I ignored her, then she would not have anything for Christmas.  So Christmas Eve, the wife and I made up a basket, and I got in the car, and we went looking for this address, and I never will forget.  We went to the address, but there was no lights, and I said it was an abandoned building, and I was getting ready to walk away, and I happened to look down in the stairwell to the basement, and I saw a flicker of light, and so I said "I wonder if she is in the basement" so I just went, took a chance, and I knocked on the door, and so this faint voice--you could tell she was old, and she said "who is it," and I said "Santa Claus" so she said "come in, it's no lock on," and I opened the door, and there I stood with this box with a turkey. tt was a good package.  But there was no wood, no flooring.  It was dirt, and there was this lady.  She had to be seventy, seventy-five years old, and she said "which one of God's helpers are you?"  And so I didn't know what to say, you know, and she said "I've been praying for some bread," and she opened up her refrigerator, and there was nothing, not a crust of bread.  She said I knew that he answered my prayer, and that's what started my operation so that was the best Christmas that the wife and I ever had.
Speaker 2: Now when did that occur?  You were on radio.  You weren't on T.V. at that point.
Speaker 1: No.  I was on radio.
Speaker 2: In the '50s.
Speaker 1: Well, that was--yeah, around '50, '50 or '51.
Speaker 2: And when you--you know I had--are you getting tired?
Speaker 1: No, no
Speaker 2: I wanna go--you know when I was reading the book--well no, let me finish talking about Operation Christmas Basket.  You continued that for a lot of years, didn't you?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Talk about some of the other things.  You did it every Christmas.
Speaker 1: And it was very successful, and it just blossomed because people got involved.  It was people from the suburbs, you know.  The whites would come and bring their children, and they would make cash donations, and then they would ask if they could deliver a basket.  They wanted their children to see how well-off they were, and they even delivered baskets, and so that went on, and it was really blossoming.  It was getting bigger and bigger.  We were up to about 450--well, I've got a picture, as you'll see in that package there, of the boxes that we had, but what happened was the gangs.  It reached the point where the gangs started shooting at the people who were bringing the food in for the poor people, and I didn't want, you know, one of those nice people to get injured trying to help some poor people eat so I just cancelled.
Story_ID: 17514
Speaker 1: Where did you meet your wife?
Speaker 2: Where?
Speaker 1: Where or when?
Speaker 2: I met her at the DuSable [Chicago, Illinois], see.  Her uncle was one of the owners of the DuSable Lounge, and she worked in the checkroom, and so I would come by, going to the bar to work.  The checkroom was right there, and I would always, you know, flipping and trying to be hip, but that's how we met, you know.
Speaker 1: And her name?
Speaker 2: Marcheta.
Story_ID: 17515
Speaker 1: I want to take you back to the DuSable Lounge [Chicago, Illinois] because that's where you met Redd--did you meet [comedian] Redd Foxx there or he just performed there because there's a story that I read.
Speaker 2: No, Redd Foxx--Redd Foxx was at Robert's [Club, Chicago, Illinois].  I met Redd on the corner of 48th and Prairie [in Chicago, Illinois].  He was playing with a little band with a tub.  They had a tub with a broom handle stuck in it with a string on it, and that was his bass fiddle, see, and I didn't know who he was, and so when I said "who is that," and they said "man, you don't know that's '58th Street Redd?'"  He wasn't popular.  He wasn't a big name then.  He was "58th Street Redd," and then shortly after that he started in show business, and I remember him doing a stand-up routine at Club DeLisa [Chicago, Illinois], and that's when I walked up to him and said "hey, I'm Daddy-O," and he said "well, you know, what do you want from me."  You know, he just talked down to me, and every Mother's Day I got a card from Redd Foxx.  It would say "Happy Mother's Day, you mother," and it took me all these years, and until the day he died I was never able to convince him that I wasn't his mother.
Story_ID: 17516
Speaker 1: See, I would always take shows out to the different hospitals and the sanitariums because I would get fan letters, and they would say "Daddy-O, you're always taking shows out to the hospital or this, that, and the other, or out to the prisons, and you don't do this" so I said "okay."  Well, I took a show out to--whenever I would take shows out, whoever was in town out at the clubs I would always take out the best shows.  I wouldn't go and get just local talent.  I'd go to [Club] DeLisa [Chicago, Illinois] and get their stars and whoever at the Regal [Theatre, Chicago, Illinois].  I'd get their top stars and the Rhumboogie [Club, Chicago, Illinois] and the chorus and the band.  I'd take out an all-star show.  So we're out at Vaughn Hospital, [Edward] Hines [Jr Veteran's Hospital, Chicago, Illinois], but the Vaughn Unit, and so they had all, you know, the veterans that were paraplegics, and some of them were on the stretchers laying, and then some were in the basket, first time I ever seen a basket case, you know, where it's just--you look down, and there's this kid there with a big beautiful smile with no arms and no legs in a basket right in front of the stage, just so happy that you thought enough to bring him--.  So--and the nuns and the nurses are around so Redd was on the show, and I had told Redd [Foxx, comedian] "now, Redd, you know you can't go out here using blue language.  I don't want you up there cussing."  And he said "oh, man, you know, I know how to act."  So now there was the nurses and the nuns standing along, and Redd got out there and he said--I introduced him, and he said "Daddy-O Daylie, give him a nice hand.  He'd get together and bring shows out here and get people out of bed and everything and come out here in the middle of the day like that when I should be sleeping and everything, and he then tried to tell me how to do my show, said I told that mother--ha, ha, see there?  You thought I was gonna say mother--.  Ha, ha, no, I ain't gonna say it."  You know, he said "I know how to act, but it sure is difficult.  Sister, would you mind plugging your ears up for a minute?"  He just figured--he joked like he was going to cuss, and I was just perspiring because Redd--I didn't think Redd was--but he didn't say that.  And then one time I had Redd, and we were at Robert's [Club, Chicago, Illinois] in the back in the parking lot.  I had [Count] Basie's [pianist, composer, bandleader] band and Stanley Turrentine's [saxophonist, bandleader] group and Redd Fox.  So he said--he came out on the stage, and he said--now remember, he's on 'Sanford and Son' [popular television show, 1972-1977].  Now all of these couldn't get into Robert's with--we had seats for 3,000 on the parking lot, and along the upstairs rooms they had sold the rooms in the outdoors, and it was packed.  So we had a lot of people that came to see 'Sanford and Son,' brought their kids, their families, and their wives.  So Redd came out, and he's got this cocaine (gestures at nose)--when he walked past me.  I said "Redd, clean yourself up.  You got that snow on you."  And he went out there, and he said "all right now.  All of you MF's, kiss my--."  Right just "bam," and everybody sat up, and they started getting up and running with their children, leaving because it wasn't that good old [Fred] Sanford [lead character of 'Sanford and Son'], you know, that they had been seeing on the--well, Redd was something.
Story_ID: 17517
Speaker 1: He [comedian Redd Foxx] was--but could be funny, but when he wanted--I wanted to play his records, and I couldn't play his records to promote his opening so he gave me a record where he had edited out--and it was a little 45, and he had taken out all of the curse words, and I would play that, and it created a lot of excitement for his opening, and [disc jockey] Sid McCoy and [disc jockey] Norm Spaulding and them, they wanted to know where I got the record.  So I let them make copies of it, and that was the first legitimate record that we could play of Redd's, but he was a talented guy.  But now, look, you can walk down the street, and you hear rap.  You can drive down the street.  Have you heard these rap records?  Have you listened to what they're saying?  Redd wasn't saying anything as bad as that.  He was saying the same thing.  I can't understand where the world's going now so I got out of the business in time because I--you know, I would be so out of place up there trying to say "you can't say that on the air now" and now they're--(shakes head).
Story_ID: 17518
Speaker 1: Do you have any other Redd Foxx [comedian] stories?  Did you--you liked him as a performer.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Redd Foxx, oh, Redd was--he was a very talented guy, very, very talented.  I just wished that he could have received the exposure that he was entitled to that Richard Pryor [comedian] and them are getting in the late, you know, but Redd--Redd used to--at Robert's [Club, Chicago, Illinois] in the upstairs room their little--.  Now, you've got to get the picture.  Robert's, we call it the "Penthouse on the Second Floor."  Well, Redd was working there, and so he's doing his act, and the waitresses there, walking by with the trays and everything, and so Redd saw one of the waitresses that had been going with one of the black waiters, and then all of a sudden she had changed partners, you know, and had gone white [dating a white waiter].  And so Redd started singing when she came to him with the tray: "dum, dum, dum, da, da, bye, bye blackbird," you know, (laughs) so just the in group knew what--every time she'd come through with the tray because he was sitting there, you know--.  He came out to escort her home, and Redd would sing "gonna pack up all my cares and woe, see that, here I go.  Bye, bye, blackbird," and look right at her.  He's funny.  He's just--he's a funny dude.
Story_ID: 17519
Speaker 1: How about, you know, you also worked with Dinah Washington [singer], didn't you?  Did she get her start here?
Speaker 2: "The Queen."
Speaker 1: So do you have any stories that relate to her?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, "The Queen."  Let me think now.  I just can't think of--oh, there's so many.  I just can't think of because I'm trying to get it in mind because I see her, [singer, bandleader] Billy Eckstine and Dinah Washington.  Dinah had taken over the club, Robert's [Club, Chicago, Illinois], at 63rd, and she was singing there and the(pause)--oh, I know what it was.  Slappy White [comedian], there was Slappy White and Billy Eckstine, Dinah Washington, and we were all in the club one night, and Dinah was working there.  And so Dinah got up on the stage and was performing, and Dinah said--let me get this right.  Dinah said--oh, Dinah said--(pause)--Slappy White said--that's what it was.  Slappy White said they went to do a show out at the hospital, out at [Edward] Hines [Jr Veterans] Hospital--'ll get it right--and said that they were leaving the hospital, and there was a mental ward, and so they had the guards there, the security there so that the patients couldn't get out.  And so as they were leaving, they would come along, and you would announce yourself, and they would say "all right.  Go back over there.  You're the patient, and with the show you're over here, and the patient over there."  And Dinah Washington called herself "The Queen" so when they came up there, and so this guard, security said "and who are you?"  She said "I'm 'The Queen.'"  He said "over there" (points).  He figured she was crazy talking about she's "The Queen."  He had never heard of her being "The Queen."  He said "you get over there in that line.  You belong here with the rest of us," but he would just be--just--I can't tell it like he [Slappy White] did, but he would say "that's the line for you."
Story_ID: 17520
Speaker 1: Now Joe Williams [jazz singer] was another friend of mine that I helped because Joe was a very talented guy, and a lot of people didn't know that Joe had a nervous breakdown.  He completely fell apart because Joe always--he had a beautiful voice.  Joe always wanted to sing ballads, you know, beautiful stuff, and--but when Joe was singing ballads, see, the market--the audience wanted to hear someone who looked like Joe sing blues.  You had to look like Billy Eckstine [singer, bandleader] and Tyrone Power [actor] if you're gonna sing ballads and beautiful tunes.  And that broke Joe's heart to the point to where it all--it just made him flip because he wanted to sing pretty songs, and he could sing.  And he went away.  They put him in a mental institution for about two years, you know, and you know how he died.  He was--he had a home in [Las] Vegas [Nevada], and he had had another breakdown, and he was on his way--.  His wife had put him in the hospital, and then he left the hospital and was trying to walk home [when he collapsed and died in March 1999].  There he was out there in Vegas trying to walk home with the [hospital patient's] band on his wrist and when they fell out, because he was trying to make it home.  He was a good-hearted dude but died alone.  All the people he'd knew--.
Story_ID: 17521
Speaker 1: Well, the MGAT--there was a group called the MGAT Plus Three, which was a very, very talented group--(pause)--but that was a jazz group, Paul Serano, Nicky Hill, Walter Perkins, Mel Favors.  We've had some good, good groups but they were on Chess [Records].  See, I started a jazz label for Chess Records, and I had a series called 'Daddy-O Presents.'  And I recorded [pianist] Ramsey [Lewis]'s [jazz] trio out of that, the MGAT Plus Three, and I recorded [trumpeter] Clark Terry and a group of all stars from [piansit, composer, bandleader] Duke [Ellintgon]'s band out of that, and I established their jazz catalog for Argo Records, but I'm trying to think.  (Pause).  There was a young lady named [jazz singer] Teri Thornton that few people heard about.  Oh, she was such a talent.  And [jazz singer] Lorez Alexander [Alexandria], a Chicago [Illinois] talent.  They were ahead of their time.
Story_ID: 17522
Speaker 1: I have one more question that relates radio.  You and your producing, because you started your radio program and then did shortly after you get started with community events and was that common, you know, because you said you were doing these shows at the Oriental Theater [Chicago, Illinois], you know, and the county jail and at the hospital.  Was that all so I'm just wondering how that even started?
Speaker 2: Well, because there was a warden at the [Cook] County Jail [Chicago, Illinois], Warden Johnson, and the inmates out there would listen to my [radio] show.  He allowed them to listen to my show, and so they prevailed on him to call me, get in touch with me to see whether or not I would bring the show out to them, and that's how I got started with the prisoners.  And--but when I take shows out, I didn't take just local talent.  I remember taking a show out to the county jail when Nancy Wilson [jazz singer] went, and she was pregnant, and she couldn't go out to Indiana with us.  We were leaving there [Cook County Jail], and then the next day we were gonna do the show for the inmates in Indiana but couldn't because it was too much for her.  But we had [blues singer] Jimmy Witherspoon.  We had Joe Williams [jazz singer], and we had Sweets Edison [trumpeter].  I had a group that was out of [drummer and bandleader] Red Saunders' [Club] DeLisa Band that played, and I would take part of the DeLisa show, and what I would do, I would have the show--start the show if it's in the summer--I would do it out in the yard, and they would have it set up so that on one side we'd have all of the male prisoners, and over on this section would be all the ladies.  But if it was in the winter, then we would have to start a show over in the men's side and start it.  Then while they were performing, I would take them over to the ladies tier, you know, and that's how I would work the shows, and then they would take us into the dining room and feed us, you know.  But only the top stars I would take [to my benefit shows], and I always tried to take the top talent out of there because I figured if I was in that situation [in jail], I would want to see the top talent, you know.
Story_ID: 17523
Speaker 1: Oh, well, there's a difference when I promoted concerts, yeah.  At the Auditorium I brought [comedian] Bill Cosby.  The first time he came to Chicago [Illinois], I presented him at the Auditorium Theatre here in Chicago.  And I had [jazz singer] Nancy [Wilson].  I presented Nancy at the McCormick Place [convention center, Chicago] for a fundraiser for Marillac House.  Not this [current Chicago Mayor Richard M] Daley, his father [Mayor Richard J Daley] was the mayor then.  And see, Marillac House is a settlement house over on the West Side of Chicago, and so there was--I think it was twelve nuns there, and that's their home, and they work in the streets and in the alleys, and they live there.  So Mayor Daley at that time thought that they were too active in the black community so he penalized them by removing, I think $20,000 that the city had appropriated for them.  So taking that from their budget, that really crippled them.  So I said "okay, I'll help you, sisters."  So I called Nancy, and I developed a night with Nancy, evening with Nancy Wilson at McCormick Place, and we had--oh, it was a gala affair, and we raised--I was able to give $40,000.  And I had a picture, but it was in a frame of these nuns, but I didn't know whether or not you wanted to see that.
Story_ID: 17524
Speaker 1: Can you tell me why you moved to WAAF [radio station in Chicago, Illinois] in the first place before we get to the [television] show?
Speaker 2: Because I was involved with the gang thing [Daylie spoke out against gangs on his radio show], and so they were putting pressure on me, trying to get me off the air, and they had the owner.  At that time the station [WAIT, radio station in Chicago] was owned by Atlas, and they had Ted Jones was the manager, general manager.  Ted Jones is black, and so they had it all figured that they were gonna get rid of me because of pressure from the gangs, see.  They were using all their reaches because I was putting a lot of heat on them [the gangs].  I was saying "okay, don't be calling me."  Now on the air I'd say "don't be calling me.  Now if you want to impress me, then you let me know whether or not you endorse the gangs or if you are going to collaborate with what I am saying."  And so all of a sudden the phone would light up, and so those that read--as long as--they had no one to put any pressure on them, and they could zero in on you--so I just said "well, if I'm gonna lose the show, I'm gonna go down fighting" so I said--I got this call from the station, WAIT.  They wanted to meet with me at 8:00 in the morning before I went on the air.  I knew exactly what they wanted so I called a press conference for 8:30 that morning at the station, and so when I came in at 8:30 there were cameras from Associated Press and all of them, and they were all in the office cluttered around there.  Now all of a sudden they want to know, they being management, and the owner of the station "well, what's going--who called the station?"  Well, then they found out that I called a press conference so they wanted to know why I called a press conference.  When I walked in, I said "well, I'll let you know as soon as I come out of this meeting what this conference is all about."  I said "what I think it's pertaining to is my stand against the gang.  I think they're getting ready to release me so as soon as I come out of this meeting, I'll let you know."  When I walked in [to the meeting], Atlas said "oh, Daddy-O, no, we're not thinking of--you're too valuable a property."  They were getting ready to release me, and so I said "what is it that you want?"  "We just wanted you to tone it down a little bit.  Don't quit.  Just tone it down because we don't want you to get injured."  I said "okay."  So I went back out, and I apologized for calling the press conference, and then so I just went on over to the station.  After I got off the air I went over to [W]AAF and started negotiating, and I moved over there.  I told them.  I said here's what I'm involved in.  Now you have any problem with it, and they said no.  See, what they were doing is you can see on there at ABC [American Broadcasting Company] on Channel 7 [WLS in Chicago] they closed the station down one Sunday because they had threatened to bomb the station because they knew that my show was on Sundays, but it was taped on Thursday and played back on Sunday so they thought I was taping on Sunday so they threatened to bomb the station, and they closed the station.

Speaker 1: Why did the gangs concern you, and why did you take the position against them?  There had been gangs in Chicago [Illinois] for awhile before that, but what about these gangs here?
Speaker 2: Well, they had--they being the gang, The Peace Stone Nation.  They were organizing all of the businessmen on 87th Street [Daylie owned a bowling alley in this area] so I was working for Operation Breadbasket [organization dedicated to improving the African American economy], their second Black Expo.  It was over at 47th Street at the old South Center building, and so I was so involved, I didn't know. Jacoby [Dickens, entrepreneur] was dealing with them, you know, so while I'm over here fooling around trying to help Breadbasket, they're [the gangs] about to take over my bowling alley, and so I just said "okay."  I just stopped everything, and I went for broke.  I went back, and I said I'm going to use everything that I have to fight them with.  I got on the air, and I started saying "well, okay."  So what they were doing, they were having their youngsters, little kids, little kids.  They were sending little kids into the bowling lane and throwing paint up on the walls, throwing firecrackers out on the lane, and the "Main 21" [leaders of the gang], you see, were out there with their red berets on standing in back.  I had a 24-lane house, and I'd come in.  They were standing in back of the--and they had a men's league, all men, and I looked up, and they were packing up their bowling balls, leaving.  They were frightened of these punks so I said "what do you all want in here?"  And they said "well, it's our territory, and you're on our turf."  I said "okay, okay.  I'm going over to the office.  Who's the spokesman?"  I said "I'll be right back.  You all be here when I come back," so I ran to the office, and they said "okay."  Well, when they saw me come back out, they all left so that was the beginning of this pressure so that was the first wave to try it.  And then after that they tried to say that we couldn't have the Expo in the South Center because it was on the Disciples' [gang] turf, and I said "well, that's not--Reverend [Jesse] Jackson--that's your problem, Jesse.  The Bowling Starlite's [bowling alley in Chicago, Illinois] my problem, but this is your problem," and that's when Jesse's foot was in a cast, and he was saying "well, Brother Daddy-O, I can't, man," and he'd kick it out so he asked me to handle it, and I said "well, look, if you all want to, whatever steps you feel that you have to take."  So they talked to, I guess, the chief, and that's when they had me meet with their lawyer, and he was saying "well, all you had to do is go and speak to the chief."  I said "I didn't have to speak to the chief when I went to buy the bowling lane.  Why I got to speak to him to keep it?  You know, who is this chief?  What do you mean chief?  Chief of what?"  So when he saw that I wasn't going to bend, you know, he just told him it was gonna be too hot if they killed me so I guess they kind of backed off a little bit.  That's how that tapered off, and that's when I moved my wife out of the city, and it's been rough.  I couldn't complete my--but that's another story.
Story_ID: 17526
Speaker 1: Why did you go into a bowling alley business with Jacoby, and how did you meet him?  How did you come to know [entrepreneur] Jacoby Dickens?
Speaker 2: Well, see, I had a merchandising concept I developed called the Daddy-O Fun, F-U-N, Fun League, see?  I had a marketing concept.  Since I didn't have an advertising agency, I didn't have a big budget so I had to focus attention on my unit.  So what I did, I said what do people do?  They want to have fun.  So I was just organizing them in what they were already doing.  So when they were playing softball, I went out and organized a softball league, called it the Daddy-O Fun League, and I got them uniforms.  I got sponsors for them.  I had a twelve team league, fifteen men on a team, all uniformed, out at 71st and King Drive [Chicago, Illinois] and had the [Chicago] Park District put bleachers there.  They said "we can't put bleachers."  I said "what do you mean?  It's just a Park District property.  There ain't no bleachers here, and you've got bleachers out there up north.  Why can't you have bleachers here?  Show me where in the black community where you have any bleachers."  And they put bleachers out there so three nights a week under the lights we had a softball league where people come out, and they were enjoying football, and who was playing?  Former athletes, the guys that used to be with the [Chicago] Hottentots [professional traveling baseball and basketball team] with me and old ladies with arthritic and last scabs, and then I organized bowling leagues.  Why?  Because it's the bowling there, and that's how I got into the bowling.  I met Jacoby because I looked up one day, and he was in one of the leagues that I was organizing.  That's how we met, and so I didn't know Jacoby, but I knew two or three of the guys that were bowlers, and so I said "well, now I need somebody to act as directors and commissioners of the bowling league."  So I bought them bowling shirts with "Daddy-O Fun League Commissioners," put their names on them so I could get these dudes to work, take care of the business.
Story_ID: 17527
Speaker 1: But [entrepreneur] Jacoby [Dickens] was on just the league [Daddy-O Fun League] that he bowled in Tuesday night, which is the league I was in.  I had two leagues, Sunday morning men's and Tuesday night mixed, and so Jacoby was the president of our Tuesday night league, and Jacoby was "(makes growling noises)," you know, and he didn't like my attitude because I was saying "this is my league, and this is the way we're gonna do it," and he was going "we're gonna be--now that I'm President, it's gonna be a democracy," and I said "okay."  And there was about four or five in this league that would run a crazy man sane because they wanted to just--against everything.  They were against the (unintelligible)--so I looked up one day, and they were getting to Jacoby.  He said "sit down!"  I said "oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait now.  That's not being democratic."  And he said "well, she's getting to me."  So to make a long story short, I got rid of all the commissioners.  I said "if you will stay, I'll get rid of the rest of them."  And so that's how he and I got together.  Then when we got a chance to buy the bowling lane [Bowling Starlite], see, I said--they wanted to put it up for sale so I said well--the guy, the owners, the two owners asked me if I could find them a buyer so I said "yeah, I'll do it; will I get a commission?"  And he said "yeah," so I went--Jay [Jacoby Dickens] and I went to have coffee, and we talked, and I said "do you think we can put it together?"  He said "what?"  I said "wherever we can get this," so I mortgaged my house.  Jay took out a mortgage on his, and I went back, and I said "I found you a buyer."  They said "who?"  I said "me and Jay," and I said "I want my finder's fee."  And he said "you've got to be out your tree," because he was upset with me because he didn't want to sell it to me in the first place.  But anyway that's how we--then I went to Washington [D.C.].  That's when SBA [Small Business Administration, government agency established in 1953]--we got the first kind of sizable loan.  They were lending minorities ten thousand, fifteen thousand [dollars].  I went to SBA.  I went to spend about two weeks in Washington, got a nice little chunk, and came back, and that's how we got it.
Story_ID: 17528
Speaker 1: So then the bowling alley--then the leagues [Daddy-O Fun Leagues] really take off with the bowling alley [Bowling Starlite, Chicago, Illinois], I mean when you own it, right?  More or do they take off anymore?
Speaker 2: We only had two leagues before we--no, I didn't tell it accurate. When we bought the bowling lane, we had promoted--from the two leagues, I had thirty leagues.  It was only thirty-six leagues in the house, and thirty-two of them were Daddy-O Leagues [recreational sports leagues owned by Daylie], you see.  So when he said he wanted a buyer, I said "okay, but the Daddy-O Fun Leagues don't go with the sale.  I'm gonna move it to a black-owned house."  Robert's Bowling Lane [Chicago, Illinois] over on--so when he looked, and he saw he wasn't selling much then, but he wouldn't give me the percentage.  That's how Jay [entrepreneur Jacoby Dickens] and I got it [Bowling Starlite bowling alley].  Then Jay bought Skyway [bowling alley in Chicago, Illinois], and I went into business down on 13th and Michigan [Chicago, Illinois] right up here.  Yeah.  It was the old hospital, old St. Luke Hospital, and opened up a food service company, catering company, and I went to [Chicago] Mayor [Richard J.] Daley, and I got thirty-six day care centers for senior citizen sites and mentally retarded kids.  I had five trucks, and I opened up the old St. Luke's--when St. Luke's moved west, they just abandoned all the equipment, stainless steel.  I went in there and looked and saw all of that equipment.  I just spent about $5,000 and cleaned up everything.  I had it all so when my competition heard it, they were trying to close me.  My inspection was better than theirs so that's how we--but Jay went back into the bowling.  He was smart.  He stayed with what he'd known.  I went over, and it was all right.  I did all right.
Speaker 1: So that was a business.  You were serving senior citizens and the mentally retarded.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The bowling alley you got, wasn't that in the early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You've gotta get all that from Jacoby because he always tells me like he remembers dates.  Like he'll say "well, we're celebrating our twentieth something," and I said "yeah, okay."  Dates don't mean nothing, you see, but I had--I kept good, talented secretaries that kept me abreast, and then when I went out of business and retired and I let the secretaries go, and I didn't have good habits of recording everything, and I have senior moments.  They go into senior hours and days.
Story_ID: 17529
Speaker 1: Now let's talk about, okay, the start of the T.V. program so you are at WAAF [Chicago, Illinois radio station].
Speaker 2: (nods for yes) Um hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You moved over there, and Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] dies [1968]--King is buried.
Speaker 2: And I'm on the air, and I'm talking about Dr. King's funeral, see, and I'm urging the fans not to rebel, not to destroy, not to be destructive, but I wasn't preaching, you know.  I'm just talking to my fans.  And I guess some kind of way that they heard about it over on Channel 7 [WLS, Chicago] because I wasn't on Channel 7, and so I got a call asking "would I come over there and talk to them?"  So I went over there and they had already talked to (pause) [disc jockey] Herb Kent.
Speaker 1: I was going to say--okay, because Herb never made it into the final group, but go on.
Speaker 2: Because Herb was--when they said "Herb, we want you and Daddy-O to do it," but Herb said he didn't need Daddy-O.  That was before I even knew that they were negotiating, and so when they said that, well, I just said "okay," and then all of a sudden over at Channel 7 they're calling and said "come over.  We'd like to talk to you."  And I went over there, and so the President of [WLS Channel 7, Chicago]  ABC [American Broadcasting Company] said "well, Herb Kent and his manager's been over here, but they don't want to work with you so you must be a bad fellow."  I said "well, I guess I am."  So that's how that went, and so they said "well, what do you want to do?"  I said "I want to get a black producer."  He said "there's no such thing as a black producer."  I said "how old is television?"  And he said--oh, well, whatever you like--if he said ten years old, I'd say "well, eleven years ago there was no white producer--so--I know a fellow that's talented enough.  He can read a stopwatch.  He can time.  He can put together a show so let's start our own show."  He said "okay so who is that?"  I said "[journalist] Vernon Jarrett."  I hadn't even asked Vernon.  That's how I--and then I said "now we need somebody that can--because the kids are the ones that are going to throw the bricks in the windows."  So then [journalist] Warner Saunders was with the Better Boys Foundation, and he said "where are the youngsters?"  He's a youth leader so it was only natural that I would think of him.  I said "let's get Warner."  So Warner had never been in television.  I'd never been in television so I said "let's do it together."  So we did the show, and we called it 'Stop.'  We did one show called 'Stop,' and we put it--oh, and the Modern Jazz Quartet was in town.  I got them.  [pianist] Ramsey [Lewis] was in town.  [Jazz singer] Joe Williams was in town burying his mother, and so I put together a show called 'Stop,' and [baseball player] Ernie Banks was on.  And so you know, to come on right on after the [Dr. King] funeral, and we got no negative response.  And in fact, it must've been pretty positive because they asked me if I was interested [in continuing the show] so I said "yeah, if Warner--" and so that's how we got that show.
Story_ID: 17530
Speaker 1: So how was that whole experience, having a team, but you did one show, ['Stop'] right, and then it turned into a whole series?
Speaker 2: (nods for yes) Um hmm.
Speaker 1: Was that on Channel 7 [WLS, Chicago, Illinois] or was it on?
Speaker 2: Seven.
Speaker 1: And what was the series called?  Wasn't it 'For Blacks Only?
Speaker 2: '
Speaker 1: 'For Blacks Only,' but the first show, the audition show called 'Stop' was just like one show that we did to try to keep the natives quiet [after the funeral of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].
Speaker 2: (laughs) That show went very well obviously.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And how do you like this experience because T.V. is--it's new to everyone there, you [journalist] Vernon [Jarrett], [journalist] Warner [Saunders].  You've got Warner, right?
Speaker 1: I enjoyed it, but it's like anything else, you know.  After awhile it's just--and then as I got older and just--see, you know the business is--what people don't realize.  It's a very lonely business.  Now, you go to work.  You're in a studio, see?  Solitary, you work.  You're working in front of a camera.  You're working alone, engineers in the--so what happens?  You leave there.  There's no audience.  It's an invisible audience, and so radio is pretty much the same.  You go to work, five hours or three hours or whatever you do.  You're working alone, see?  Like here, at least there's a communication.  At least I'm talking to someone.
Story_ID: 17531
Speaker 1: Why do you think that people were--didn't want to deal with it [threats from street gangs]?  You think it's because they infiltrated themselves so quickly?
Speaker 2: Fear, fear.  That's all, fear.  It's just that simple, and if I had had any other partner other than [entrepreneur] Jacoby [Dickens], I would never have stood up.  I would have sold out and got what little money I could and ran, but Jacoby's a stand-up guy, and he said "yeah, let's go," you know, but they had organized Walgreen's [pharmacy].  They had everybody and was--we were next to Walgreen's.  They had the bookstore.  You get out of here.  What is this?  What has that got to do with civil rights?  Tell me.  Just makes me angry when I think about it.  My blood ain't--see, I'm wearing patches and things.
Story_ID: 17532
Speaker 1: Do you think that--they [Chicago street gangs] impacted you in lots of different ways, though.  Did they impact--I mean, they made threats against your wife and your family, you were saying, right?  Were there other ways that they impacted you businesswise?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They shot into my bowling alley, you know, and they shot--I had security, and one night in the front door on 87th Street, the double doors, the security guard came in the door, and one of them [gang members]--you know, you'd just see a teenager standing outside, and when he walked in the door and got into the double door inside, well, they walked in behind him, pushed the door open, and shot him in the back. [Entrepreneur] W. L. Lillard--I had W. L. Lillard [private investigation company].  Do you know W. L.?  Ask him.  I hired W. L. Lillard.  That was W. L. Lillard's man that they shot.  Oh, the sin--and when you just--see, I said--[radio commentator] Paul Harvey on his program one night was talking, and he quoted me because I said "these are not Robin Hoods.  These are just hoods robbing," see?  Now I don't care how you paint it, try to make heroes out of these zeroes.  And they--one lady called me.  I was bowling in the Sunday morning league, and the phone rang, and they paged me.  I went to the phone, and it was some lady, and she said "Mr. Daylie?"  I said "yeah."  She said "are you busy?"  I said "yes, I'm bowling.  I'm in this league," and I said "but we finish at 2:00."  "Well, I don't know how to say this, but I have a daughter who is fourteen years old.  I overheard her talking, and I just don't know how to tell you, Mr. Daylie," and she starts crying.  And I said "was it you're trying to tell me?"  Well, that's when I had my bodyguards, and so she said "no, I just want to look you in the eyes when I tell you this, and it's difficult because it's my daughter."  And I said "where do you live?"  She said "I live over here at 83rd."  I said "well, four blocks.  Come on over."  I said "I'll send somebody after you."  She said "no, I'll be over."  So I went on back to bowling so about twenty minutes later I get another call.  It's the lady again, and she said "Mr. Daylie, I just have to tell you.  It was my daughter, and she was talking about shooting you.  Whoever she was talking to on the other line was telling her that the contract was out on you."  And so she was supposed to do it because you wouldn't suspect it because it's a kid, and I said "well, then there's nothing I can do about it.  It's your daughter.  That's your problem," I said.  "But I do have guards, and I'm going to do whatever I can to protect myself."  And so she was just crying, just hysterical so they just--it's just--(waves arm) I don't even want to think about that.  That's a little minor thing.  They had my pictures up on the basement of the bookstore, my picture, [Chicago] Mayor [Richard J.] Daley's picture, [Congressman] Ralph Metcalfe's picture, and these were the hit parade.  They were supposed to get us in the basement of a black bookstore.
Story_ID: 17533
Speaker 1: Why didn't the community rise up, you know, because you have--I mean, all I know is that every time I mention your name, you're viewed as--you know, they say you're a good person.  You did so much for the community.  Why didn't the community rise up?  That's different--[U.S. Congressman] Ralph Metcalfe, that's a whole different thing, you know, I mean, except he was--but I'm just saying.
Speaker 2: But I was upsetting their apple cart.  I was the enemy.  So was Mayor [Richard J.] Daley the enemy.  Irvin France was the enemy.  Oh, it was tragic.  I just--it's a rotten way to live.
Speaker 1: So when [gang leader] Jeff Fort was arrested or when he was convicted, did you feel safer at that point?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  No, because I just felt that, you know, the man upstairs looks out for me.  Now if they can kill the President of the United States, he has the Army, Navy, and Marines (laughs).  Who am I with four bodyguards or one?  Hey, you know, who are you kidding, but--and if they're gonna use kids to get you.  You know, a little kid comes up, and imagine what the mother, the mother had to--now that kinda got to me because, you know, you start looking at every little girl, you know, that comes past you.  You know, I kinda flinched, but other than that, hey, I can't go around--.  That's no way to live, and I've lived a long time now, you know.  I'm on His time.
Story_ID: 17534
Speaker 1: I want to ask you when you look at your career, what your thoughts are about your career.  You've had careers, but let's talk about your broadcasting careers because this is something that you know, you--well, you got shamed into it sort of, right?  You got shamed into it.
Speaker 2: (nods for yes) Um hmm.
Speaker 1: Thanks to [radio host] Dave Garroway.
Speaker 2: Garroway.
Speaker 1: Garroway, so when you look back over that career, what are your thoughts about it?
Speaker 2: I just wonder what I could have accomplished with an education.  Now I was--what little I accomplished, I accomplished at a tremendous handicap, you see.  So that's the reason when I talk to youngsters, I tell them "a man's knowledge is his bank book.  Get as much knowledge as you can, and that's something they cannot take from you."  You know, I was so busy grabbing and trying to--but when I think of my brother [Clinton Daylie], he had a third grade education, and he worked hard all of his life making wheels for trains, but he bought a home.  He was able to send my sister to college, send her to beauty college, too, so she could open up her--but I just want every youngster that I can touch to--oh, it's hip now while you're young to talk rap talk and wear the gold chains, but when you get up and you retire, are you going to have your own home?  You know, it's such a sad commentary.  I never pass a man on the street, a beggar, that I don't give him something.  I just can't.  They [others] say "Daddy-O, you've got to be stupid.  Don't you realize he's got a building in the block?"  I say "well, okay, now he has a building and 50 cents."  I give [to] him for what he represents.  He represents a man who cannot help himself so he has to beg so, you know, when you prepare yourself, when you retire, are you gonna retire in your own home or are you going to have to worry about where you're gonna get your next meal from?  Nothing like that education, and I guess you wonder well, "why didn't you get one, you dumb ox?
Story_ID: 17535
Speaker 1: What about black radio because you were at the early stages of black radio, and what would you even describe as black radio?  Was that radio hosted by black people?  I mean you had a jazz show, and now they're calling jazz "American music," and they wouldn't refer to it as black music so my question is what do you define as black radio?
Speaker 2: Now?
Speaker 1: Well, then or now.
Speaker 2: Well, I thought you had discontinued.  I thought it was over.  Well, if--at one time we had--remember we went through stages with sepia?  They call it "sepia radio."  Then they called it "rhythm and blues."  Then they called it "black radio."  Now we're black, but I just think that rap--they're trying to classify rap as black music--that has the connotation of being what black folks like.  Well, it's just another segment because I still enjoy good jazz, and when I relax, I really enjoy [Italian orchestra leader Annunzio Paolo] Mantovani.  You know, I enjoy good strings.  So when you say "what is black music," is it black because I enjoy it or because I play it?  Is it white because [clarinetist and bandleader] Benny Goodman played it?  I don't know how to really--is it black because [pianist, composer, bandleader] Duke Ellington composed it?  How can you play 'Mood Indigo' [Ellington composition] and not really have a spine-tingling feeling and realize that a brilliant man wrote that, not knowing whether he's black, white, or green, but an artist.  I can't classify blues as black music.  [Blues singer and guitarist] Muddy Waters played blues, but so hey, listen, how can you play it on the harmonica now?  The whites are playing blues harmonica as guttural as any black musician that I know of.  Music is music.  Don't be putting a tag on it.  Just enjoy it.
Story_ID: 17536
Speaker 1: But radio--I went back to radio and the role between--because all of those artists [musicians] could have been creating, and had there not been people like yourself [disc jockeys], they might not have had the livings and risen to where they were or where they got to.
Speaker 2: Well, but--that's true, but--that's the luck of the dash, that's all.  Because when I look at a young artist that's coming along. that's talented, that's creative, and that really hone their talent, that study their talent, I don't take time to wonder "is he or she black or white."  My concern "is it good or is it bad?"  I just don't--I'm sorry.  I can't give you any--I wish they wouldn't put tags on it because if a guy's prejudiced, he's not gonna play anything that's--you know, if he figures he's a black musician, just play it if you like it.  If you don't like it, don't play it.
Speaker 1: Is there any deejay that came along after you that you thought that that person really had their act together?  They got what it takes.  I mean the industry has changed a lot.
Speaker 2: No.  I'm being very frank with you.  I'm going on record now, and what I'm about to say is going to really knock me out of the box.  I watch mostly the T.V. shows now because all I hear is, when I turn on the radio, is rap, you know.  Oh, I get [radio host] Dick Buckley on WBEZ [Chicago radio station], and [radio host] Richard Steele plays nice jazz.  Other than that, I don't listen to radio so I'm not very informative.  I'm not giving you much information, but that's the best I can do unless you want me to create some--.
Story_ID: 17537
Speaker 1: What about the black community?  Are there hopes or concerns you have about the black community?  It's a relationship you've had for many, many years, a very strong relationship with the black community.
Speaker 2: Well, I hope that--what I really hope, and I mean this sincerely, is that the young brothers don't destroy themselves or the community that they exist in.  Because when you go out and you want to go into a jazz club or where they're playing jazz, if you don't feel comfortable, because, you know, the brother is smoking drugs--and I'm not a stogie.  I'm not a--hey.  But I think about the young one who turns in on BET [Black Entertainment Television network] and to 'Comic View' [television show].  Have you watched that?  Now I just think that's--if I was gonna rate it, I'd have to rate it as the most destructive thing for the young mind.  I can't understand.  Has it reached the point where the comic has to talk about sex in such a guttural view?  I mean, I just--I have never--I'm embarrassed, and I'm a hundred-year-old dude so If I'm gonna sit there with my grandson, and what kind of chance does he have?  I just don't--I'm gonna start a campaign.  'Comic View,' change your view--because it's not funny.  So that's all I have to say.

Speaker 1: If your mother [Lucinda Daylie] and father [Richard Daylie] could have seen your success, what do you think they would have said?
Speaker 2: I don't know, but I do hope that they would have been pleased that someone in there brood made some strides that showed a fair amount of success, but when I look at my brother [Clinton Daylie] who raised me, I think he was a very successful man, and my sister-in-law [Joanna Daylie], I just know that with her limited education what they accomplished so--.

Speaker 1: Can you me two or three of your favorite rhymes?
Speaker 2: (Pause). Well, the thing that I used to--it wasn't a rhyme--but the thing that I used to sign off with and people still see me and remember is that when things are--"when you're troubled, and I don't care how dark things get, there's always hope.  When you get to the end of your rope, tie a knot and hang on."  Now that's my favorite because that's what I used to sign off with.  You see, "when you get to the end of your rope, when everything else is, then you tie a knot and hang on in there."  That's been my philosophy.

Speaker 1: This is the record library in my den, and I have 42,000 records.
Speaker 2: You still have those 42,000 records?
Speaker 1: Since I've retired, I've sold maybe 10,000, and then I've given away another five or 6,000, and I have a friend who was a rock and roller who has discovered jazz, and now he just claims them.  I let him come down, and he goes through my records, and now he's an avid jazz fan, but I still have I know a good, I guess, 20,000 records or more.
