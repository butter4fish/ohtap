Story_ID: 14971
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm going to ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side of the family.  But we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Her name is Mattie, M-A-T-T-I-E, Viola, V-I-O-L-A, maiden name is Payne, P-A-Y-N-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Man, you know, I have to look that up, but she was born in Madison, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Madison, Arkansas.  Okay, and what do you know about the relatives on her side of the family or how far back can you trace your ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: Back to my great grandparents.
Speaker 1: And what were their names, and what did they do?
Speaker 2: Richard and Viola Johnson.  And Richard was, born in Mississippi, and lived most of his adult life in and around Forrest City, Arkansas and lived to 103 years old.  And when I knew him, it was very close to the end of his life.  And he was a basket weaver.
Speaker 1: And he lived in, where in Arkansas, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Forrest City.
Speaker 1: Forrest City, all right.  Is that near Madison?
Speaker 2: Four miles.
Speaker 1: Okay, the same area, basically.
Speaker 2: Yes, same area.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you grandfather or any of your relatives tell you stories of that era, stories of the family?
Speaker 2: You know, there are stories that I remember, but I was relatively young when he passed.  So, you know, I, don't really know a lot about, you know, those stories.  I heard some from my grandmother.  But they were of, you know, just growing up in the South, both the idyllic parts of growing up in the South and the more difficult parts of growing up in the South, near the turn of the century.  The idyllic parts are the parts that I remember the most because they were the parts that, at least my grandmother seemed to care most about.  You know, the, country, the country life, a simple life, you know, canning foods and growing up on a farm and, you know, struggling to make ends meet as a family and as a community, but doing it in a loving environment; you know, church being a very strong part of that environment, and an affinity for the outdoors, a love of the outdoors.  A lot of hunting, fishing, self-reliant enterprise.  You know, everything was made.  During that time, very little was bought at a store.  So they did everything from take cotton and make it into cloth to growing almost all of their foods and what they would call "putting up" foods, which was canning foods, you know, butchering animals and putting them in the smokehouse.  You know, those were the kinds of stories that I remember, you know, the most.
Story_ID: 14972
Speaker 1: Okay, so what are the difficult stories?  You said there were two kinds, and did you talk about the--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I mean we talked about some of it like my mother's [Mattie Viola Payne's]--my grandmother's husband had to leave Arkansas very quickly because he got into a run-in with a white guy, you know, there in Arkansas.  And, you know, everybody in the neighborhood knew that they were coming after him.  So he had to leave and, you know, flee north early on.  And then there were a lot of other stories.  I lived with my great grandparents [Richard and Viola Johnson].  My--yeah, my great grandparents for one year when I was eleven years old.  Every year somebody--they were so old that every year somebody had to come down to Arkansas and stay with them and help on the farm.  And that was my year.  And I remember crossing the Mason Dixon Line--this was in 1958, going from Indiana to, I think Kentucky is where we crossed the Mason-Dixon Line.  And, you know, white only, colored only drinking fountains and having to move to the back of the bus and having to go around the back to buy something to eat, when in Arkansas.  Having to move off the sidewalk whenever someone white would pass, and pass in the street.  And then move back to the sidewalk.  The white only and the colored only schools.  All of the blacks in the community having to get on the truck to go chop cotton in the spring and pick cotton in the fall.  You know, those were all, all memories that I have, you know, directly.
Story_ID: 14973
Speaker 1: Did you mother [Mattie Viola Payne] talk about growing up in Arkansas?  Do you have a sense of what it was like for her to grow up?
Speaker 2: She, never really talked a whole lot about her Arkansas experience.  For my mother, most of her experiences that we've talked about and shared began in Indiana when, you know, as a, young girl when she had moved to Indiana.  I, kind of felt like, that much of her Arkansas experience is pretty traumatic because it's not something that she ever really wanted to talk about in depth.  I know she did not really enjoy a great relationship with her father before he left.  And, you know, that--things were just so different, you know, then.  It was a very patriarchal society.  In a way, the, men were very dominant and domineering.  But the women did all of the work and were the primary breadwinners in--to a great extent.  And, you know, and, some of what I've heard indicates that, you know, because men, you know, there were not able to, you know, really be breadwinners, to really earn well.  You know, that, many of their frustrations were taken out on the family.  And so you had a very abusive environment by today's standards where the children would be more than spanked.  They would be whipped, you know, for any violation, and, you know, things of that nature.  So I think that, my mother was traumatized to some extent by that because her conversation, even to this day, you know, rarely relates back to her early days in Arkansas.  And when it does, it's very brief, very non-descript.
Story_ID: 14974
Speaker 1: Okay, so how old was she  [mother Mattie Viola Payne] when the family moved--when she moved north and what were the circumstances under which they moved?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, my grandmother was the matriarch certainly of our family.  And she moved from Arkansas to Indiana and was the first member of our family to do that.  I never really have found the story out about exactly what led her to do that.  What I think happened was that she had a friend who had moved to Indiana.  And once her husband was gone, you know, she was kind of left in the, family of her, husband's parents.  And that was an uncomfortable situation for her.  And I think she decided to take her daughter and her son, who was three years older than, my mother, to live up north, and she did.
Speaker 1: Was it South Bend?
Speaker 2: Yeah it was in South Bend, Indiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So did your mother talk about South, you know, growing up in South--well, how old was she when she, went to South Bend?
Speaker 2: I think about thirteen or fourteen years old, you know, when she went to South Bend.  And I think, you know, times were very difficult, you know, for them.  My grandmother was a domestic.  And she found employment, you know, right away, but you know, at very meager wages.  And, you know, it was a lot of changes for them, you know, temperature changes, you know, cultural changes.  I, can surmise that they kind of felt a little bit like fish out of water because things were just so different than what they were used to.  But the year after my grandmother moved up, one of her sisters and her sister's husband moved.  And then another one moved shortly thereafter.  And they established the family.  And the entire family basically migrated from Arkansas to Indiana.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, Indiana has had a reputation in the North as being a kind of a down South, up North state.  One time the Governor [David Curtiss Stephenson] was the Grand Dragon of the [Ku Klux] Klan in 1928.  I mean it's just, it's--it does have the reputation of being like you're passing through Mississippi on the way to Ohio or something when you leave Illinois.  I mean it's not-- it can be rough in Indiana even though it's different from Arkansas.  But did you get a sense of that from her at all?  Did she notice a difference or did she ever talk about that?
Speaker 2: I, think that my, grandmother thought Indiana was manna from heaven, you know, by comparison to her experience in, Arkansas.  So she was very happy there.  You know, she found a church home, you know, very early on.  And throughout all of her years in Indiana she was a member of the same church and stayed in the same neighborhood.  And, it was pretty close in that neighborhood.  And there was--the big difference I think is that African Americans in Indiana during that time seemed to do a lot better than they did in Arkansas.  You know, you had plants like Bendix [automotive component manufacturer] and Studebaker [automobile manufacturer] that were in South Bend during that period of time.  And a lot of blacks worked at those plants.  And those were, you know, decent-paying jobs for the, for the time.  And so you had a number of, of black people that just lived so much better than they did, you know, in Arkansas.  And the conditions of--while they were not equal, they were not, you know, blatant like they were in Arkansas.  I mean you did not have to get off the sidewalk or you didn't have white-only and colored-only facilities.  You know, you can go to the movie theaters and go to the--attend the same schools.  And, you know, things of that nature.  So that there were a lot of improvements in Indiana versus, you know, the experience that they had in Arkansas for sure.
Speaker 1: Now, did the university make a difference that you know of, Notre Dame being there?
Speaker 2: I never knew anybody that worked or went to Notre Dame, you know, as a child.  Certainly, until probably the last twenty years or fifteen years maybe, members of my family began to matriculate at Notre Dame.  But, you know, before that, Notre Dame was bells that you could hear.  You know, it wasn't a meaningful part of, the life that I knew anything about growing up on the lake in South Bend.  You know, it wasn't even anything that we discussed.  I don't even ever remember being on the campus.
Story_ID: 14975
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your father and give us your father's full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: His name was William Webb.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Don't have a clue.  My father and my mother [Mattie Viola Payne] were married basically for about a year.  He was significantly older than she was.  I was the result of that year worth of marriage and we had very little contact with him throughout the rest of, the time of his life.  And he passed away in 1968.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he live in South Bend [Indiana] too during that period?
Speaker 2: He lived, in South Bend and in Gary [Indiana].  And then he was the first person that I knew that relocated to California.  And about the best thing that I can say that he did for us was provided a place for my grandmother and I to go to move to California, which was, you know, really a, great blessing to us.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you don't really know much about his background or his--or your relatives on that side or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, not really.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Do you know where he was from originally or was he originally from Indiana?
Speaker 2: No, they were--yeah, his mother and father settled in Gary, Indiana.  And he was from some--they were from Alabama.  Yeah, most of the family was somewhere near Anniston, Alabama, and--
Speaker 1: Oh, Anniston, that's that famous town where they burnt the bus up that time--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --during the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so.  You know, like, like most blacks from the North, their roots are definitely in the deep South and families matriculated to find a better life.  And some did and some didn't.
Story_ID: 14976
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell me about growing up.  What's your first childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Oh, running around and playing with the kids in the neighborhood.  We had a lot of kids in neighborhood where, I grew up in South Bend [Indiana], who were really my age.  All the homes in the area were single-family homes.  They were small, but they were single-family in a well-kept neighborhood.  And everybody had a ball.  We had the free reign because there was, you know, no crime or fear of danger.  And everybody was always at everybody else's house, both the adults as well as, the kids.  It was really a, neighborhood, a real neighborhood, where people cared for and about each other, knew about each other.  And it was a small town so; there were very few secrets, a lot of gossip.  And, you know, we all tried to contribute as much as we could to it.  Probably the first thing that I, really, really, really remember, I was about four years old.  And I was, you know, they had some fifty-gallon drums in a, a lot in the neighborhood.  And we were all jumping from the ground to the drums and climbing on the drums.  And one of the drums has a, had a jagged edge.  And I fell on the jagged edge and, cut myself on my leg.  I still have the scar.  So I, see, you know, see that every day.  So, I, I'm frequently reminded of that early memory.
Story_ID: 14977
Speaker 1: Well what was the--was it an all-black neighborhood?  I guess, I suppose so, I would guess, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it--South Bend [Indiana] was, you know, really very segregated.  You know, you didn't think about it during those times.  But we lived on the lake, what was called the lake.  And the part of the community that we lived in was entirely black.  I went to Western Avenue Elementary School.  And that school was very mixed and the primary, White ethnic group was Polish.  And so that's really what I knew, until I was about seven or eight [years old], was that everybody was either black or Polish.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you lived on the lake, was that lake, Lake Michigan or--?
Speaker 2: No, no.  They just called it the lake.
Speaker 1: You were east of that.  But, yeah.
Speaker 2: They just called it the lake.  It was more like a swamp than it was like a lake, but that was the area.  As I recall it, they, they just called it the lake.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it wasn't a real lake.
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't a real lake at all.
Speaker 1: It was kind of a swamp, huh?
Speaker 2: It was kind of a swampy area, and they just called it the lake.
Speaker 1: All right.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of the neighborhood when you grew up?
Speaker 2: The sounds that I remember, I mean you could always hear kids playing, always.  There were always lots of kids who were always playing, riding bikes, playing stickball, running, playing tag, you know.  In the winter, climbing the hills and sledding down, you know.  So I always remember a lot of laughter and a lot of, you know, just noise and yelling and, you know, just good times, you know, as a kid.  I really--it was a very happy time, I think for everybody in the neighborhood.  It was a very happy time, carefree time, just as it would be for kids anywhere, you know, that age, six to, you know, nine years old, eight years old.  It was, you know, pretty incredible.  I remember my mom [Mattie Viola Payne] drinking Cokes [beverage] and ironing in the living room and listening to [musician] Sarah Vaughan and [musician] Della Reese and, you know, people like that.  That was, you know, her favorites.  And so music was a big part of, our lives.  Every--at church as well as outside of church, you know, everybody always had the radio on.
Story_ID: 14978
Speaker 1: Now, what church did you attend?
Speaker 2: It was New Salem Missionary Baptist Church in South Bend [Indiana].
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you said your grandmother--was that the church your grandmother went to?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah.  Everybody in the family.  My grandmother went, everybody had to go.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the music was real strong in the church too?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, real strong, you know, real strong.  My grandmother always sang in the choir.  And, and I--she, we come from a very non-musical family in the vocal tradition.  You know, most of us couldn't carry three notes, you know.  And my grandmother was that way too, but she could lip-sync real well, you know.  And so that was, that was kind of her.
Speaker 1: Okay, did she have a favorite musician herself?
Speaker 2: I would imagine the person that comes to mind would be Mahalia Jackson.  I mean she just was in love with Mahalia Jackson.  And, you know, and I, remember Mahalia Jackson coming to South Bend and, seeing her in South Bend at a bigger church than the church that we went to in South Bend.  And my grandmother just wouldn't have missed that for the world.  So I would imagine Mahalia Jackson had to be probably the person.
Story_ID: 14979
Speaker 1: Okay, any other sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: You know, I remember the trees.  You know, there were just trees everywhere, you know, big trees, the kind of trees you could climb up in and have a great time, you know.  And so, you know, we did.  And I remember drives out to the farm areas and going out and picking cherries, you know.  And, you know, you'd pick your own cherries, you know, and pick bags of them and buy them for a lot cheaper, and corn and, other vegetables.  So I, you know, that's one of the things that I remember.  And that was--it was always a fun time when we would do stuff like that.  You know, I--we did a lot of family things, you know, get in the car and go over to somebody's house, and, you know, you'd eat and, you know, play with them.  And the kids that were there and, you know, always trying to listen to the grown folks' conversation and understand what was going on in the world.  And that was difficult to do because that was very discouraged.  You know, and that was the era in, our family and neighborhood where children were to be seen and not heard, you know, that type of a thing.
Story_ID: 14980
Speaker 1: And I, remember I learned a lot about the culture of the black community, you know, there [South Bend, Indiana].  You know, the big Sunday dinner and the preacher coming to dinner and always having to have the place of honor and the biggest place and first food off the table.  And, you know, that was just a tradition that happened in, everybody's house, everybody did it that way, you know.  And the preacher was the, the minister of the church was the most revered person in the community; respected, admired, taken care of, revered, you know, person.  So, and--
Speaker 2: Did you have a good preacher?  I mean did you like him actually, and did you think he was a good preacher?
Speaker 1: I, yeah, I was really--I was eight years old when, I left the last time.  So, you know, I, I didn't have any way to feel other than the way everybody else felt, you know.  But there was this little store right on the next street.  We lived right next to the alley.  And you'd walk right down to the alley, and behind our lot was the lot of a--my stepfather's parents.  And they had a little store downstairs.  And so that's where we used to all go get ice cream, you know, stuff like that.  And that was, you know, really again, I mean that was, it was the collecting point, particularly for the kids because every time we had a nickel, we'd go buy some ice cream.
Story_ID: 14981
Speaker 1: Now, was TV and radio a big deal?
Speaker 2: TV wasn't.  I mean I, don't think--I left South Bend [Indiana] for the last time in 1958 and we did not have a television.  But radio was a big thing, you know.  And I can remember people gathering around the radio to listen to fights or baseball games or broadcasts from churches in Chicago [Illinois], and, you know, that kind of thing--you know, news about the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was big, you know, real big back then about, you know, what the NAACP was doing.
Story_ID: 14982
Speaker 1: And did your mother [Mattie Viola Payne] like follow, or your grandmother follow the Civil Rights Movement, you know, closely?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, don't think--I think everybody followed it closely, you know.  You know, everybody was very concerned about the Civil Rights Movement.  It was always a topic of discussion, you know, every day, because I remember Emmett Till [fourteen year old boy murdered in Money, Mississippi, 1955].  I don't remember the exact year, but I remember Emmett Till and what a big topic of conversation that was everywhere you went in the community and, and those horrific pictures.
Speaker 1: That's '55 [1955] I think.
Speaker 2: But there were lots of lynchings, you know, that were going on.  You were always hearing about, you know, lynchings in the South.  And, you know, riots and, you know, I was, constantly aware as a young kid of turmoil that was race based going on somewhere.  It wasn't happening in South Bend [Indiana], but it was happening somewhere.  And it was always something that everybody was very close to, everybody was concerned about, everybody was communicating about; the topic of sermons, you know, on Sunday, you know, about treatment of blacks by whites and, and how the Lord was going to, you know, cause that to change, you know, basically.
Speaker 1: Okay, did they focus on the Little Rock Nine [Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas] at all in your household since it was an Arkansas, you know, kind of based event?
Speaker 2: Well, I, can't remember exactly what year that would have--
Speaker 1: It was '54 [1954]?
Speaker 2: --happened.
Speaker 1: [U.S.] Supreme Court decision [Brown v. Board of Education case, ended segregation in public schools], and then I think later, I mean probably '55 [1955], '56 [1956].
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's--no that I can recall specifically.  But, of course, I was born in '48 [1948], so, you know, there was a lot that was going right over my head at that, you know, period of time.  So that may have been, but it's not something that I can really, really recall specifically.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now everybody knew Governor [Orval] Faubus in Arkansas--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --even though they may not know anything about Arkansas.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Everybody knew Faubus, [Alabama Governor George] Wallace, yeah.  You know, everybody knew Wallace, you know.
Story_ID: 14983
Speaker 1: Tell me about school.  Now, what were things like at Western Avenue Elementary School [South Bend, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Well, again, you know, I was very young.  I don't remember all that much, you know, about it, but, you know, it was mostly good times.  You know, first sports competitions, you know.  And it's when I learned that Polish or Pol- we called them Pollacks at the time, they were very strong.  The boys were strong, okay.  And you had to come right when you were going to deal with them because they were bullish.  They were very strong and, not afraid to be physical, you know at the same time.  So, you know, the --it was--one of the things that I remember very clearly though is that the blacks were always the fastest, you know, when it came running.  And you're always running out at recess, you know, always having races, always running.  And blacks were always the fastest, not always the strongest, but always the fastest.
Speaker 1: That fits in with a lot of racial stereotypes, but it was (laughing) true.
Speaker 2: It was true.
Speaker 1: It's true.  Tell me, now, you were there through third grade, I guess.  You were eight or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I lived one year in Texas with an aunt and an uncle who were in the service, came back for one year when I was in the fourth  grade.  And then I spent the fifth grade in Arkansas, you know, with my great grandparents.  And then in the sixth grade, we had moved to California.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, well, how did all that take place?  Now, how did you get from--you moved to, you were in Texas for a year you said first--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --and then--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, third grade in Indiana, fourth grade in Texas.  My uncle was in the [United States] Army.  He was stationed at Fort Hood in Killeen [Texas].  And I spent a year with them.  And they came and picked me up in a car, and we drove, drove back.
Story_ID: 14984
Speaker 1: How did--was your mother [Mattie Viola Payne] with you during that time [during his changes of residence between third and sixth grade]?
Speaker 2: No, just myself.
Speaker 1: She stayed in South Bend [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, and then you moved to California with your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yes, with my grandmother.
Speaker 1: But your mother stayed in South Bend?
Speaker 2: My mother stayed in South Bend.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: My--by that time, my mother had remarried, had had other children, you know, three-- four other children.  And so, you know, she was staying there, you know.  My grandmother and I, you know, just really needed to make our own way in the world.
Speaker 1: Ok, it sounds like, your story sounds like it's--people don't necessarily--I don't know if it's a genre for this, but it seems like a lot of first sons of black women are being raised by their grandmother, in a way.  So the grandmother becomes a mother in a lot of senses even though the mother is still alive.
Speaker 2: Right, well that definitely happened for me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the grandmother and the, son make that bond, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 14985
Speaker 1: So, now did you--you explained earlier how you got--who brought you to California.  Now, someone in the family moved there first?
Speaker 2: My father [William Webb].  My father had moved to California and was living there, came back to visit and, you know, painted the picture of the land in milk--of milk and honey.  And my grandmother and I decided that, you know, hey, things weren't going to get any better in South Bend [Indiana].  So, you know, let's try California.  And we got on a train in 1959, in July of 1959 and set out across the country and moved to California.
Speaker 1: See, that's interesting because in those days, just as a kid, hearing about California in the media made it seem attractive to, I know to me and probably a lot of other kids.  A friend of mine ended up moving there.  And I envied him.  I said, "Wow, he's moving to California.  There's Disneyland, and, you know, I mean it's sunny."  You know, it just seemed like a good place to be, you know.
Speaker 2: Man, I thought, I just knew that the streets were going to be paved with diamonds and gold and that it was definitely going to be the land of milk and honey, you know.  And it was towards the end of July, 1959 when we arrived.  And the, and when I got off the train, the first thing that happened is that smog hit me and my eyes started burning.  And, you know, it was, just awful.  And, you know, my, father picked us up from the airport.  And the drive back to South Central L.A. [Los Angeles, California]--the train lets you off right in Downtown L.A., Union Station.  And the drive back to L.A. was just so disappointing because I didn't see a movie star, and there was no diamonds and gold on the streets and, you know, but it was California, Palm trees and, you know, the whole smog and the whole nine yards, you know.  It was California.
Story_ID: 14986
Speaker 1: Okay, now what did you--well, what was your neighborhood like?  Give us an impression of what your neighborhood was like in California once you got there?
Speaker 2: We lived right in South Central L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  And the neighborhood was almost exclusively African American.  We lived in a duplex.  You know, it's a one-building structure with two dwelling units, you know, there.  But it was very similar in so many ways to South Bend [Indiana], lots of kids, lots of people to play with, you know, right in the neighborhood.  Differences:  there were parks, you know, quite a few parks.  And you could go swimming and, you know, parks had swimming pools and, you know, things like that.  So everybody in the neighborhood would go--cost you a nickel, you know, you'd go swimming.  Walk up to the park and go swimming and that kind of stuff.  And the church we joined, again, always the center of life and the center of the community, of our life in the community was Greater Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church, which was right down the street.  So we didn't have a car, my grandmother and I didn't have a car so we could always walk to church.  And we always went, you know, several nights during the week, plus, you know, basically, all day on Sunday.  And so the church, you know, becomes your extended family and your, you know, closest sense of community, you know, in that place.  And, you know, people really look out for the members of the congregation of the church.  And that's basically what happened to us or for us.
Speaker 1: Okay, were there other people from Arkansas there that were from your--near where you all were from?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my, grandmother had a cousin who she got in contact with that was from Arkansas and had moved to California.  And so we were in touch with him, I'd say probably within six months of the time that we moved.  And he had a daughter who was maybe three years or so older than I.  And, you know, it was, just another person, but two years after we moved out, of course, other members of the family started to come out.  So within five years, you know, my mom [Mattie Viola Payne], my brothers and sisters, my grandmother's--one of my grandmother's sisters, some of her other sisters' children had all migrated to California.  So we had quite a little clan growing right there in California.

Speaker 1: Okay, now what school did you attend in Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 2: Well, believe it or not, I went to Western Avenue Elementary School [Los Angeles, California] for the sixth grade.  And then I went to Foshay, James A. Foshay Junior High School [Los Angeles, California] and Manual Arts High School [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: James A  Foo- how do you spell Foshay?
Speaker 2: F-O-S-H-E-Y [Foshay].
Speaker 1: Okay, and Manual Arts?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Now, how were you in school?  Were you--and how would you describe yourself as a little kid?  You know, were you, I mean--well, you were older then.  You were like a middle-sized kid, but how would describe yourself?  What kind of personality did you have?  What did you like to do?
Speaker 2: I liked to show off and show out, you know.  I was precocious.  That's probably the nicest way, you know, I could say it.  I was always into something that I didn't have any business being in, you know.  But I, never, you know, was, I never did anything really bad.  But, you know, I was the person that was going to definitely pass notes, you know, tried to do anything but what the order of the moment was, you know.  I was not the most obedient, you know, child in the world, but it wasn't because I was wild. It just, my mind was, you know, always wandering and roaming.  And, you know, I always had dreams and visions and things that I was, you know, wanting to do other than what I was doing at the moment, you know.  And by the time I was twelve, I was selling--they used to have two newspapers in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  The 'Herald Examiner' came out in the afternoon, and it was sold on the corners.  And so I, sold the 'Herald Examiner' on the corner and made two cents a paper.  It was probably my first job.  And by the time I was fourteen, I was, in addition to doing that, carrying the 'L.A.Times' [newspaper] in the morning.  And I had a bike and a paper route, you know, in the mornings.  And when I was fifteen I got my first paycheck job.  So I worked--from the time I was thirteen, there's never been a day I haven't had a job.
Speaker 1: That's remarkable.  Now, were you a good student?
Speaker 2: I was a-- I, was a good student when I went to school enough days to earn the right to have a grade.  I always got good grades, but there were some semesters in high school that I missed so many days of school that I--it couldn't be counted.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, why did you miss so many days?
Speaker 2: Just because I was working, you know.  It was basically my grandmother and myself.  As I indicated, she was a domestic.  I think she made a dollar and a quarter an hour.  This is 1960, '61 [1961], '62 [1962], you know.  And by that time, she and I were just living on our own.  So, you know, there was no question but the fact that I had to work.  So I had, as I indicated, a paper route.  I was selling papers on the corner.  I had an after-school job, after I stopped, you know, selling the papers on the corner, and was big enough to, you know, be able to, do that kind of a, kind of a thing.  And, my after-school job really was bus boy and dishwasher at a restaurant, a coffee shop.  And so you would close the coffee shop and get out about midnight and just a lot of days I was just too tired to get up and go to school the next morning.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you were working hard.  You were really, you know, not only did you--sometimes you had three jobs it sounded like?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sometimes.
Story_ID: 14988
Speaker 1: Now, were there any figures in the community or even on the job, any bosses or teachers that made an impression on you, a positive impression?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the first person that I would say made a big, impression on me was a lady who my grandmother worked for, a Jewish lady.  And, and she was just tremendous to my grandmother and tremendous to me.  And I, don't know why, but she was very nurturing and very encouraging, and, you know, really thought that, you know, I could so something, make something of my life.  And, she was probably the first person out of my circle, you know, people in the church and, you know, that kind of stuff, that were really nurturing and encouraging and supportive.  She was the first person that, that ever was--that I ever really remember having a big impression on me in terms of, you know, encouraging me to do with my life, what my potential would be.  And her name was Sally Smalley.  Her husband's name was Morris.  And he was a very rotund guy, never said very much but he was always very much in support of his wife, you know.  And so he would always pat you on the back and say, "Now, you listen to Mrs. Smalley.  She's telling you right," you know.  You know, these are things that you can do.  And then my sixth grade teacher I remember, you know, very much.  She had this real long beak of a nose.  And she was just the sweetest, kindest person, you know, that, you could ever meet.  And, and she took all of the kids in that class under her wing.  You know, you could really tell that she really cared about you personally.  And she'd take a lot of time with each of us, individually, and she took probably more time with me than, anybody because I definitely thought I was the teacher's pet, you know, in her class.  The minister at our church.  His name was A. W. Lott, Alzo W. Lott, Reverend Lott.  Man, he wore them sharkskin suits and those shiny pointed-toe shoes and drove a Cadillac [automobile].  And I ain't never seen nobody drive a Cadillac before.  And, he could preach, you know, sho nuf preach, okay.  He'd raise the hairs on your neck when he got to talking about the Lord and, and all of that.  And, but he took a very special interest in the kids of the church, you know.  He, definitely always said that the children are the future of the community, the future of the church and, you know, he really directed the adults in the church to pay attention to the children of the church in a very, a real and special way.  So, he was a person that I will never forget, you know, in my life, because he was--in addition to, you know, being the moral and religious example, he was the success example too because of, you know, a beautiful home in the parsonage next door to the church and, all of that.  And, and he established scholarships from the church to help young people in the church go to college.  And that was a very big thing in that church, was directing and guiding, young people to go to college.
Story_ID: 14989
Speaker 1: Okay, were there any negative examples in the neighborhood of guys who were successful and were doing the wrong thing?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, you know, I grew up in South Central L.A. [Los Angeles, California], negative examples were everywhere, you know.  You had a lot of, you know, alcoholics.  You know, I, never smelled a marijuana cigarette until I was sixteen in [Manual Arts] high school.  So there wasn't a lot of drugs in the neighborhood where I was and with the kids that I grew up with.  You know, there weren't a lot of drugs, guns, you know.  About the worse thing--gangs were really clubs, you know, in those days.
Speaker 1: Social clubs like--?
Speaker 2: They were, they--compared--and they weren't the [gang] Crips and the [gang] Bloods.  You know, we had the [gang] Bartenders, and, you know, the[gang] Gladiators and the [gang] Slausons and, you know, but comparing, comparatively speaking, I never saw anybody with a gun.  I never saw anybody cut anybody, you know.  And I went to all the high school parties and, and all of this.  And that, that just didn't happen, you know, in the, in the early to middle '60s [1960s], you know, in Southern California.  So all of that kind of thing was later.  The thing that I remember that was, you know, we, got in trouble for, was there was a club on Washington [Boulevard] and Western [Avenue].  And [comedian] Redd Foxx used to perform at this club.  And as young kids, we would stand outside and just crack-up because we could hear everything that Redd Foxx was saying.  Of course if my grandmother finds out she would just be so disappointed, you know.  But, you know, and that was the kind of thing.  [Comedienne] Moms Mabley used to play there and, you know, we used to go to the, and stand outside, even as kids, at 5-4 Ballroom [Los Angeles, California], and listen to the music, you know.  And [musicians] Ike [Turner] and Tina Turner would be playing there and, you know, people like that would be playing there.  So that, that was, you know, the kind of thing that we used to do.  We used to see people fall down the stairs, drunk.  We used to see people get in fistfights, you know, that kind of thing.  That wasn't an uncommon thing.  But in terms of, you know, what you know today as crime and gangs and violence and the hard drugs, you know, it just wasn't something that we saw.
Story_ID: 14990
Speaker 1: Did you see any of the celebrity life in Los Angeles [California] as a kid?  Did you--did the kids go over to the studios at all just to see them?
Speaker 2: No, never.  Not one time, you know.  The biggest thing that we saw were some of the, the big ministers in town.  You know, they had some very flamboyant churches and ministers in town.  And, and they had this one guy, I mean we used to go as kids --you know, kids, nobody had to ask us or tell us to go because it was right up the street from us, they had a movie theater that got converted into a church.  The guy's name was T. M. Chambers, Jr.  I'll never forget him.  And he used to preach from a stepladder, seventeen steps.  He'd climb up the stepladder.  And he'd have his handkerchief, and he'd be preaching all the way up the step ladder.  And when he got up to the top, he'd finish his sermon.  And he would jump off.  And all the sisters, the elders in white would run up to him and, you know.  And that was a show, you know.  And, and all of the big-time street people in town would come out.  So you'd have the ladies in their furs and big cars, and, you know, the guys who, you know, they would all come to his church on Sunday night for his broadcast.  You know, one night he'd preach out of a coffin.  The coffin, he'd be preaching, and you wouldn't know where he was.  And the coffin would slowly open, and he would sit up in the coffin and the church would gasp.  That was the, that was the kind of entertainment that we had.  And then we used to sing on the corners underneath the street lights.  You know, and you could go--if you drove down one of the streets in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], you would, you wouldn't drive three or four blocks without seeing another three or four or five, six people standing outside and singing, you know, singing, you know, the early Motown [record label] songs or some of the other songs that were, were going on.  [Musician] James Brown was very popular, and you'd have groups that were trying to imitate James Brown and that kind of stuff.  So, you know, the things that we did were things that were, for us, a lot of fun, but didn't have--we didn't have any money, so it didn't, didn't cost a lot of money.
Story_ID: 14991
Speaker 1: Well, when you were in high school, were you-- you went to Manual Arts High School [Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Yes, Manual Arts.
Speaker 1: What was your career-track then?  What were you thinking about doing, you know, I mean--?
Speaker 2: I mean I was just thinking about working, you know.  High school was something that was a mandatory requirement for me.  It wasn't anything that I was really committed to do because I, you know, I had all these other responsibilities and things that I had to do.  The things that were most fun for me in high school was I was in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] in high school.  And that brought a lot more discipline into my life.  That, that whole military arena, you know, the drills and the things that you went to, the uniforms and the, fact that you, had to comply, you know, follow the rules there.  I was--from [James A. Foshay] junior high school through high school in the choir.  And in drama, and even when I missed academic classes, I always made all of those things, you know.  So high school was a lot of fun for me during the times that I was, you know, really more able to go to school or chose to go to school, you know.  And then my best friends and I, we all went from the corner to a band.  As we got older, you know, we had one of those [musician] James Brown-type bands.  And we used to, you know, play at different places that teenagers would go to and different parties and that kind of stuff around town.
Speaker 1: What did you play?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't play a musical instrument.  I sang background, way in the back (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were involved in a lot of, and some things--you did have some activities in high school that you participated in.
Speaker 2: I had a lot of activities, a lot of activities.  And a lot of my friends and I worked at the same kind of places, you know.  And I, I certainly wasn't the only one getting on the bus and getting home at twelve, one o'clock in the morning after working, you know. Several of us from the same school worked at the same restaurant.
Story_ID: 14992
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduating from [Manual Arts] high school [Los Angeles, California], I mean what did you think you would do?
Speaker 2: Well, I, well the one thing I knew I wasn't going to do, is I wasn't going to go to Vietnam and the [United States] Army.  You know, I didn't feel like I was ready to go to college.
Speaker 1: This was like 1966?
Speaker 2: It was '66 [1966].  And, you know, really, you know, I, obviously had to register for the draft the same as everybody else did.  And I know that I did not want to go in the Army and go to Vietnam.  So, you know, I knew I wanted to go in the [United States] military.  And so I applied for the [United States] Air Force and the [United States] Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard came through first, so that's what I did.
Speaker 1: That sounds like a good move.  I mean people, in retrospect, have said, you know, if a young black man was to get in the service, you know, you know, the [United States] Marines was probably the worst place to go, Army.  Probably, you know, Air Force and the Coast Guard, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Guard the Coast and (laughs)--
Speaker 2: Or the [United States] Navy.  A lot of, the guys went to the Navy, but, you know, I, looked at the Coast Guard because I, was only going to be going up to Alameda [California].  That's where basic training was in Northern California.  So I wasn't going to be far away.  And, you know, I--the worse that can happen is that I get on a ship, maybe get on an icebreaker and, you know, have to go up, you know, north of Alaska, you know, that kind of stuff.  And, you know, and I, thought it was going to be pretty much adventurous, and, and it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you knew you didn't want to go to Vietnam.  What was discouraging about that?
Speaker 2: It wasn't so much at first I didn't want to go to Vietnam.  I didn't want to go to the Army, you know, I just didn't want to be a grunt, you know, in the Army.  I didn't want to do that.  And then in--early on in Vietnam a brother of a friend of mine had gotten killed.  And I had been engaged in conversations at their home because I was at their home all the time, you know.  And, you know, and there were just some real bitter feelings about a wasted life and why, you know.  And even in, those early days, there were a lot of people asking those kind of questions.  And, you know, my experience culturally is that we're a very emotional people.  And that family--and all of us were very, very emotional about that situation.  And that kind of colored that experience for me and made me know that wasn't what I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 14993
Speaker 1: Okay, and so you joined the [United States] Coast Guard?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  And where were you--did you go to Alameda [California]?
Speaker 2: I went to basic training in Alameda.  And then I went to, to Groton, Connecticut after basic training to Radioman school, became a Radioman, and then went back up to the Bay area [California], to the radio station in San Bruno [California], which is right across from the San Francisco [California] International Airport.
Speaker 1: Okay, how did you like the Coast Guard?
Speaker 2: There were parts of it that I really liked.  I, really--first of all, it was the best food I ever had in my life up to that point in time, consistently.  The food was great.  And it was plentiful.  It was very abundant, you know.  And secondly, it was the easiest work I ever did, you know.  By that time, you know, I was so used to getting up early and going to bed late and working, you know, lots, doing lots of things.  And just to be able to have one job was, was pretty great, you know, I thought.  And, then I liked all the places I got to go, you know.  Like I said, I went to Connecticut, got to see New York for the first time, got on the airplane for the first time in my life, you know, got transferred down to Monterey [California].  And so I had some great, you know, duty stations.  At the same time, the things that I didn't like is that most of the officers that I came in contact with were from gulf port states.  So they were from Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia.  A lot of the officers in the Coast Guard were there.  And they had a lot of those kinds of attitudes that you would expect from white officers from those areas.  And it was during the heavy time of the Civil Rights, you know, Movement.  And I remember I was at the radio station when there was a riot that was going on.  And, you know, as I--I was the only black, you know, at this radio station.  And as I walked in, you know, the officers made a point to make some pretty pointed and ugly comments, you know, about what was going on.  So it was uncomfortable from that standpoint, but overall and on balance, it was a good decision.  And it was a good life.
Speaker 1: Now, you were in the Coast Guard when Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was killed [April 4th, 1968], right?
Speaker 2: I was.  As a matter of fact, the riot that I was mentioning was immediately after Dr. King's assassination.
Story_ID: 14994
Speaker 1: Was the [United States] Coast Guard very sympathetic about Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.'s assassination] or--?
Speaker 2: Not at all.
Speaker 1: I didn't think so.
Speaker 2: No, as a matter of fact, the exact opposite would be true.  It was a very, very difficult time.  And I was in the [San Francisco] Bay area [California] during the time of the Black Panthers [black activist organization].  So [Black Panthers co-founder] Bobby Seal and [Black Panthers co-founder] Huey P. Newton and [Black Panthers member] Eldridge Cleaver and, you know, you know, all of that era and DeFremery Park [Oakland, California] and all of that was happening during that time, Berkeley [California] and the Peace Movement, all of that was happening during that period of time.  And, man, I'd go to everything.  You know, sometimes I'd go in uniform, get in trouble.
Story_ID: 14995
Speaker 1: What were some of your experiences as you checked out the hippie movement and the [Black] Panthers [black activist organization], and I mean did you go to some interesting lectures or events?
Speaker 2: Oh, I went to everything I could possibly go to.  I mean I never really checked out the hippie movement because that wasn't primarily a black thing, you know.  That was primarily a white thing, you know.  And so, you know, black folks, we were, you know, over doing things in the churches.  You know, they had some white churches and black churches as well that were--that had feeding programs.  And the [Black] Panthers had a feeding program.  And a lot of us in the [United States] military volunteered for their feeding program.  And, you know, [Reverend] Jesse Jackson and whoever else you would think of would come to town and speak in the park in Berkeley [California].  And so we were up, in and around Berkeley or the park because there was always activity that was going on.  And you were a part of it, and your black consciousness was a big movement, you know, you know, of the time.  And [activist] Angela Davis and her fine sister, Fania Jordan. I couldn't, I mean went a lot just to see Fania you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I heard her speak once too.
Speaker 2: You know, and, you know, that was the era of, all of that.  And, and I felt and feel privileged to have been an observer and maybe a participant on the fringes, you know, of that.  I think all of us were very, very affected by the civil rights struggles and conflicted at the same time, you know.  I think all of us loved and admired Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], but not all of us believed that non-violence was, you know, the way.  We, were more obedient than belief--well, you know, most of us of the same age as [National Director of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] Rap Brown, and we more felt that way, you know.  Give me mine, now, by any means necessary, you know, but didn't have the means necessary, you know; just had the feeling, but not, excuse me, not the, not the real ability to execute that feeling or the real desire to execute that feeling either.  You know, it was just so frustrating, you know, being anywhere from eighteen to twenty-two [years old] and feel like your opportunity to advance was limited by something other than, as Dr. King would say, "The content of your character or your ability."  You know, it was, just, a lot of people, you know, were in, revolt in their spirit, you know to a system that was depressing to people.  And, but by the same token, it was a, very, a real high party environment.  You know, it was one of those dangerous environments.  It was work hard.  It was play hard.  It was up all the time, from early to late, doing something, you know, whether it be handing out leaflets or participating in picking up food over here to deliver it over here or, something.  And every chance, you know, most of the people that I knew had, they did something to help.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you ever hear [activist] Malcolm X speak?
Speaker 2: Never heard Malcolm X speak--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --other than via television or movies or that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 14996
Speaker 1: Well, how long were you in the [United States] Coast Guard?
Speaker 2: I was in the Coast Guard for a little over three years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so about 1969 you got--or '70 [1970]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the end of 1969, I got out the Coast Guard.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, this time we had made the transition from being negroes to black--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and, and even the news--we were black on the news now, instead of negroes, all of a sudden--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you have a sense of how that happened because I still can't pinpoint the time when (laughs)--
Speaker 2: Well, I think we went through-- in, my lifetime, we went through from being colored to being negro, from being negro to being black, and from being black to African American.  I never really understood exactly when the change occurred.  I just always was a part of going along with the change, you know, and feeling that each one was more progressive, redefinition than what was happening in the past.
Story_ID: 14997
Speaker 1: Now, was it--you mentioned, the breakfast programs of the [Black] Panthers [black activist organization].  Many people have commented that that was one of the most wonderful things that the Panthers ever came up with.  If they didn't do anything else, that was--and I'm not suggesting they didn't do anything else, but I'm saying that's one thing they did that really benefits the community, and not only in California, but in New York and other places where there were headquarters, they--talk about the food program.  Were you -- you said you helped out with that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  You know, I had a car by then, and so, you know, like everybody else, you know, we'd drive into markets or wherever we could to get donated food to participate--you know, to contribute to, you know, the, the breakfast program and the food program in general.  So.
Speaker 1: Another thing that's going on in terms of food in those days was that, I think prior to the late '60s [1960s] or the mid-'60s [1960s], people that ate breakfast usually ate it at home or something and, or if they ate lunch they'd go home and eat or something.  But these fast food restaurants started proliferating in the mid-'60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Yeah, and the first time I ever saw a McDonald's restaurant was in 1967, you know, in the Bay area [California] .  So, I know they started in 1955, but the first time I ever saw one was in 1967.  So--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there weren't a lot of them in the black community.
Speaker 2: There weren't, you know.  There just weren't.  I think this one was in Richmond [California].  And so you're right.  You know, breakfast was, was something that you ate at home, if you ate at all.  You know, you ate breakfast at home or, you had a, a church or, you know, some other type of institution that was providing it.  Oakland [California], during those years, was--man, they had some very, very, very poor sections of Oakland and some people that were in, real dire straights and in real need.  And, and in San Francisco [California], they had an area like that also.  So, you know, there were, there was a lot of need out there.  And we had clothing drives and, you know, as well as food drives that were going on at that time.  And some of them were sponsored by some of the churches as well.
Story_ID: 14998
Speaker 1: What kind of things do you think you learned in the [United States] Coast Guard that you really took with you, you know, for the rest of your life?
Speaker 2: I, think the Coast Guard was where I first learned about ambition, you know.  I went from an E-1 [enlisted rank], when you join to an E-5 [enlisted rank], very quickly, you know, in the Coast Guard because I was very ambitious, you know.  I studied hard, applied myself, you know, really wanted to do, well and felt like doing well was very important.  I wanted to compete, you know.  Other than in sports or music, it was the first that I ever wanted to compete at a productive activity, you know.  And I wanted to be the best at what it was that I did.  I remember the--this was, you know, during the time when all the communication with the ships were Morse code.  And we used to have a speed key, what you call speed key.  So instead of taping down like this, the key had dots and dashes, and you went like this.  And it, it automatically put the dots and dashes in.  So it would go a lot faster.  Well, the Russians were the fastest senders of Morse code in the world.  And, I just worked and worked and worked to be fast enough to be able to read Morse code that the Russians were sending.  And I was able to do that.  And so that was one of the things that--ways that I could distinguish myself because I was the fastest at doing that on the West Coast of the United States.  And it, became clear to me that in order to dis- you could distinguish yourself by being better.  You know, that was--I kind of began to, say that business or, was like basketball.  And I looked at being a radioman as being like basketball.  You just had to score the most points.  And I started trying to score the most points.
Story_ID: 14999
Speaker 1: Did you know what you were going to do when you left the [United States] Coast Guard?  Were you going into--did you have a job already lined up or--?
Speaker 2: Not a clue.  While I was in the Coast Guard I took USAFI courses, which was United States Armed Forces Institutes, the correspondence courses.  And I took my first college courses that way.  And then when I was stationed in Monterey [California], I went to Monterey Peninsula College [Monterey, California] and took courses at Monterey Peninsula College.  So when I got out of the Coast Guard, I had quite a few college credits, both through USAFI that were transferable, and through Monterey Peninsula.  So one thing I knew is I wanted to go to school.  And the second thing was, the day that I got out of the Coast Guard--I got out on a Friday, that Monday I had a job.  I was selling cars, you know.  And so I enrolled at Cal State, L.A. [California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  And all my classes, during the whole two-year period of time that I was Cal State L.A. were from 6:00 to 10:00 at night.  And I always worked, you know, during the daytime.  And that's how I, you know, went to school and, and got my degree.
Story_ID: 15000
Speaker 1: Okay, where'd you go to school?
Speaker 2: Cal-State L.A. [California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, I'm sorry.  Cal-State L.A. okay.  So when did you get out?
Speaker 2: In 1972.
Speaker 1: And you majored in--?
Speaker 2: Political Science.
Speaker 1: Political Science, okay.  Now, why Political Science?  Did you see yourself going into law or something like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wanted to be president, you know.  I, your Political Science was just--first of all, it wasn't Math and I was not very good at Math, and it wasn't Science.  So it, seemed to me it was doable.  Secondly, I, not too long after I started selling cars, I found out that, you know, I, I had to have something that was more dependable and reliable than a commission (laughter).  And so I went to work for a friend of mine, you know, and helped me to get a, secure a job for the War on Poverty.  And I worked at one of the War on Poverty programs in South Central L.A. [Los Angeles]  And I was an education worker, helping, you know, under-privileged families, you know, really engaged in the educational system and in the educational--education of their own children.  And I, liked that, you know, and I liked doing that.  It was, I thought, something that was beneficial and helpful.  And then I got elevated a couple of times in a short period of time.  And I got noticed and, and got hired at the Community Action Agency, which funded all the War on Poverty programs in Los Angeles County.  And by that time, I was well along the way, and, you know, at Cal State L.A., and moved up into management.  And just about the time I graduated, I was high enough in management to be running one of the programs at the agency, you know.  And, you know, getting involved really in the political process because what you had, you have five supervisors, and I think at the time, there were nine city councilmen.  And each, one of them had a district.  And for our programs, we had about twelve million dollars a year for our programs.  And we had to distribute this twelve million dollars a year.  And you could never satisfy anybody, you know, the, need and the demand were so great and the competition was so great for the money.  And the pol- the politicians all--never were satisfied with how the money was distributed.  They never felt like they got enough in their district.  And, you know, I felt like it wasn't predicated upon what was best--the greatest good for the greatest number.  I felt it was just predicated upon the politics of the situation.  And that, you know, just really, you know, didn't sit well with me because I felt like we could have done so much more for more people had we been distributing, you know, the resources that we did have based upon the needs and where it would do the most good.  And, I didn't feel like we were really allowed to do that.  And I couldn't accept it, ultimately.  So I decided that I needed to go into private industry.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when was this, about what year was this that you left the Community Action Agency?
Speaker 2: 1973.
Story_ID: 15001
Speaker 1: Well, what did you--is this when you started with McDonald's [Corporation]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was McDonalds, did they have a special program going on then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they did.  They had something called--it was a accelerated management development program.  And, you know, ultimately, it's what I wanted to do and they wanted to do it with me.  It was, real interesting how I came to McDonald's.  A friend of mine worked for a company called Bernard Haldane [Associates].  And they were headhunters, basically.  And what, their niche was, they would do a psychological profile on you as an individual and compare that with a company.  And so they did that for me.  And the guy did it for me for free because this was something that people were paying lots of money for.  And, of course, by this time, you know, I felt, you know, I've got some stuff going on now, you know.  I'm pretty good.  I've got some management background and experience, you know.  I've got some college experience.  I'm, out here.  I didn't want to be a sales person.  So I didn't want to work for Anheuser-Busch [Inc.].  I didn't want to work for IBM [Corporation] and I didn't want to work for Xerox [Corporation] cause all of my--the people that I knew that were working for those companies were in sales.  Now, they had--and I didn't want to work for a pharmaceutical firm because my cousin and other people that I knew working for those firms were in sales.  And I just didn't want to be a route sales person, even a fancy one in a tie.  And so, you know, the options were pretty limited.  And I'd always worked in restaurants all the way through high school.  And I liked working in restaurants and so the opportunity came to go work for McDonald's.  And they were young, dynamic.  The year I joined them, the previous year they had just done over a billion dollars.  And they had lots of growth potential, you know, and lots of people helped me to see that and give it a shot, been with them ever since.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you start off as a corporate executive or a trainee?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the first twelve years of my career were on the corporate side with McDonald's.  And I started out working in the restaurants as a, trainee really, and worked four months as an Assistant Manager and then three months as a Store Manager before moving into middle management with the company to learn the business.
Story_ID: 15002
Speaker 1: Okay, how many different positions have you held at McDonald's [Corporation]?
Speaker 2: Well, I was a Area Supervisor, Field Consultant, Sales--Sales Manager, which at the time was the first level of supervising middle management.  I was the Director of McCopco [McDonald's corporate office] for the L.A. [Los Angeles, California] region, the Director of all operations for the L.A. region.  I became the Director of the National Operations Department when I relocated to Chicago [Illinois] in '79 [1979].  And then in 1980, I went back to Los Angeles as the Regional Vice President.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And now what position do you hold?
Speaker 2: Well, in 1985, after the [1984] Olympics [Los Angeles] in December of 1985, I, I knew I never wanted to come back--to leave Southern California again, you know.  And, and I knew that once you make that decision and you make it clear that you're not willing to relocate, that, you know, your value to the corporation as an executive of the corporation, is diminished because basically, the job that you have is the job that you're going to have as long as you do that job really well.  And, by that time I had three children and--two children, and another one on the way.  And I wanted to be, to stay in McDonald's, but I wanted to be a franchisee, so I could ensure that I would continuously be able to live at home.
Story_ID: 15003
Speaker 1: So in 1985, I became a [McDonald's restaurant] franchisee.
Speaker 2: Okay, did you start with one?
Speaker 1: Two.
Speaker 2: Two, okay.  All right.  And did you start in the Pomona [California] area?
Speaker 1: Yes, I did.  As a matter of fact, both stores were in Pomona.
Speaker 2: Okay, now by this time, I know the--I started hearing about, and maybe it started before, but black McDonald franchisees had-- I heard about them in the early '70s [1970s], I mean, how long has McDonald's had black, black people in, you know, owning franchises?
Speaker 1: I want to say 1968 was about the first African Americans.  Herman Petty here in Chicago [Illinois].  And then, there were four in Los Angeles [California].  Herman's brother and three other gentlemen who became franchisees.
Speaker 2: Okay, and it sort of spread around the country.  I was telling you about Clay McCargo in Dayton [Ohio], who I heard about in the early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Right, Clay was one of the early--
Speaker 2: He was one of the first ones, yeah.
Speaker 1: --one of the early franchisees.
Speaker 2: All right.  Well, tell us about what do you have to do as a franchisee?
Speaker 1: Well, basically, you own and operate your own business.  You know, you have, a contract with McDonald's called a franchise agreement, and you also have a lease with McDonald's.  So you don't own any of the property.  You lease the building and the land from McDonald's.  And it's a triple net lease.  So that means you pay everything.  And you pay them a base rent and a percentage rent.  And as long as you live up to the obligations of the franchise, you operate the business yourself.  You charge whatever prices you feel like, you know, you can or need to charge, you hire all of your own employees and you operate the business as your business.  You're wholly responsible for it financially in every way to make it a success and to make it go.
Speaker 2: Okay, so from what you're saying McDonald's in Chicago could charge a different price for a Big Mac [hamburger] as one Pomona or New York or--?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that, that definitely happens, even in Chicago.  You know, not every McDonald's has exactly the same price.  They're all very similar, but they're not all exactly the same.  Each franchisee has the right and the obligation to charge the prices that they feel like, you know, is the appropriate price for their market, you know, that they're in.  So, you know, now a lot of our prices are set, and we all--because they're advertised.  And, of course, every time we advertise a price, like the dollar menus, for example, all of us agree to do it because it's advertised.  But if it's not an advertised item, the franchisee has the, the right to, you know, to, to set their own prices.
Story_ID: 15004
Speaker 1: Now, how does the--this is just something that intrigues me, you can see the national ads on television for a promotion, you know, of one type or another or--can you choose to be a part of that or be not to be part of it?
Speaker 2: Well, you can.  I mean, you know, what you're obligated to under the [McDonald's Corporation] franchise agreement is to spend four cents out of every dollar that you take in on advertising and marketing to promote the brand.  But it is not very intelligent for you to be paying money to promote the brand and then not participating in the thing that you're promoting.  And you're, you know, really would be alienating, you know, your operation from your customers who are seeing this ad on television, and then coming in expecting it, and not being able to get it at your restaurants.  So we don't generally have very many people that choose to, go that route.  And if they do, they're not a part of the system for very long.  You know, McDonald's is--you, you are the franchise business.  You are not completely independent.  You know, it's not like I had Reggie Webb's Hamburgers and I could do everything any way that I wanted to do it.  I'm a part of McDonald's and the reason that I brought into McDonald's is because that name and that brand, McDonald's stands for something that has value and meaning in the marketplace.  And so my objective is to increase that value and meaning in the marketplace, not to decrease it.  So, we have a system in place that the franchisees actually contribute the vast majority of the money that goes into that advertising.  And they make the vast majority of the decisions.  And so we authorize and empower them to make decisions that we then agree to abide by.
Story_ID: 15005
Speaker 1: Okay, now, it doesn't seem as though it's that hard to make a McDonald's [fast food restaurant chain] work in a black community.  For some reason, black folks tend to love McDonald's, now, and above all the other restaurants in the community.  It seems, you know, so it would seem.  I mean you hear kids talk about, "Take me to McDonald's," you know.  I mean they go other places too, but McDonald's seems to be--even the guy who played J.J. on [television program] 'What's Happenin' [sic, television program 'Good Times'], you know, he dreamt of having, getting a Big Mac [McDonald's hamburger] was like the best thing he could get, even above, beyond like a rib dinner.  Or he didn't talk about, you know, eating lobster or steak.  I mean he talked about getting a Big Mac, you know.  A lot of kids, young people seem to think that way, you know, McDonald's meal is a big treat, you know.  I mean I don't what, what is your take on that?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, first of all McDonald's is the first restaurant chain to come to the black community, you know.  During the time when supermarkets and other chains wouldn't even think about going into the black community, McDonald's came into the black community and brought their product conveniently to African American consumers.  Secondly, McDonald's is the first of any of those chains to share the wealth with the black community.  You know, there're roughly 350 African American families that own McDonald's restaurants around the United States.  We own about 12 percent of all of the restaurants, and that what percentage we are of the population.  And so, you know, we--that's a significant business opportunity for the, African American community.  And we've done the same thing with suppliers.  One of our suppliers is [advertising agency] Burrell Communications, and they've been in McDonald's longer than, I have.  And, you know, McDonald's was one of the first companies to employ an African American-owned advertising agency.  So McDonald's, I think, has gone about their business in a way that not only benefits the community as consumers, but benefits the community.  In other words, many of our, our plants are located in African American communities so that the employment base is close enough to, or in the community so that people can take advantage of, those jobs, you know, that are created there.  So I, can only give you this one example.  We had riots not too long ago in Los Angeles [California], after the Rodney King situation.  You know, there was not a McDonald's restaurant in the African American community that was adversely affected at all because one of the most remarkable things that you'd ever want to see, is you'd go down blocks upon blocks and see businesses that had been burnt out, some of them African American owned, but McDonald's not touched.  And that's a tribute I think to the operators in Los Angeles and around the country who have given back to the community, not just the large corporation, but the individual owners who are members of their community, who contribute to their community, who are engaged in leadership and the organization within their community that strive to better the community.  And I think most of the African American owners that I know of, you know, are people that I'm very proud to be associated with, that are deeply committed to the betterment of the community and to making sure that the benefits that McDonald's provides to every other community, through Ronald McDonald House charities or through anything else, are equally shared by African Americans.
Story_ID: 15006
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does seem--and this is just, I guess, my own experience in coming out of Dayton [Ohio], that Clay McCargo's involved in a whole lot of McDonald's [Corporation] stuff in the community.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then you come here to Chicago [Illinois], and there's [African American McDonald's Franchisee] Cirillo McSween and Blanton Canady (ph.) and other people involved in community activities and events.  I mean they host--[radio station] WVON I think even sponsors an annual broadcast from the jazz McDonald's on the West Side.  And, I mean it's--well, how do the--I know that, I've been old enough, long enough to know that the national McDonald's is not--the black McDonald's, the National Black McDonald's Owners and Operators--I mean the Operator's Association must have a lot do with this, I would guess, and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, it has.
Speaker 1: And just the--
Speaker 2: I mean they [The National Black McDonald's Operators Association] formed in 1972, and it has been advocating the kind of changes that have come about in McDonald's ever since, and creating an environment where McDonald's understands the value to their business of operating in the way that we have grown to operate, you know, over time.  And I think they really do, genuinely understand, the value to that, business.  You know we represent about 12 percent of the population, but my estimate is that we represent at least 16 percent of McDonald's business in the United States, you know.  And, and when you look at it from a business perspective, you know, it is good business for McDonald's to have Gospel Fest [Chicago].  It is good business for McDonald's, you know, to support all of the community-based organizations that it does support.  It is good business for McDonald's to have African American owners, you know, in our communities.  It is good business for McDonald's to have African American suppliers and to help them and assist them get into business, particularly when very few other companies are.
Story_ID: 15007
Speaker 1: I was commenting, and we're rolling again now, that in some of the rougher neighborhoods, McDonald's [fast food restaurant chain] seems to be like a retreat from the, some of the activ- other activity in the street because management is different than say, some of the local eateries, otherwise, you know, the rib joints or the places where people are operating behind Plexiglas with a microphone and that sort of thing.  I mean right down the street from a McDonald's in my neighborhood, you know, to get something to eat, you have to talk to somebody behind Plexiglas with a microphone or something--and they may not even have one.  And then you have to yell at them and tell them what you want.  And they, they serve your food through the spinning, revolving door.  And, you know, there's not even any, you know, contact, you know, with the customer.  I mean they try to keep it--they minimize the contact.  They're afraid, I mean, I--actually, you could sense it.  McDonald's still has an open counter, you know, you can see people fixing your food.  It's relatively clean, you know, and kept up, you know, I mean, what is--so you were just speaking to the consistently of management practices that made it work.
Speaker 2: Well, the operating standards, first of all, are the same.  The development standards are the same.  It doesn't make any difference if you're, you know, in a high-crime, ghetto area or you're in a very exclusive Oak Brook [Illinois].  You know, you can be on 79th Street [Chicago, Illinois] or you can be in Oak Brook, McDonald's is going to be the same.  You know, the operating standards are the same.  The products are the same.  The, training is the same.  The hiring standards are the same.  You know, everything is basically the same.  And, and in McDonald's we believe, particularly, the African American operators believe, that the stores in the African American communities ought to be operated at least as well as the stores outside of those communities.  Now, it is difficult.  Any time you're in an area that has high crime, you're going to be impacted by that high crime, but the good people in the community value a business that values them.  And the value you value other people is by providing a comparable product at a reasonable, comparable price and doing it with respect and dignity.  And that's what we try to do at McDonald's every day.
Speaker 1: Yeah, did Mc- has McDonald's ever, to your knowledge, ever considered like putting up Plexiglas and that sort of thing and to-- or changing the design of a neighborhood McDonald's to--for the--in the interest of safety or--?
Speaker 2: Well, of course, we, do what we have to do the same as any other business does.  I mean our first obligation is to protect the people that work there, you know.  And we, are not immune from all of the ills that are outside of the door.  We just try to be above that situation.  We try to create an environment where people value having this facility in their community to such an extent that they don't misuse and abuse it or, and especially, misuse and abuse the people who work there.  But there are McDonald's restaurants in areas that are so difficult that we do have Plexiglas up.  And, and we could not operate in that environment if we did not.  The environment itself is just that difficult to operate in.  But it is certainly not the preference.  It is something that happens very rarely.  And every time that it does happen, we have to make the decision about whether we choose to stay there or not.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it's rare because I--in Chicago, at least, in Englewood [Chicago neighborhood, South Side], which was the murder capital of the United States in the mid-'90s [1990s] and in South Shore [Chicago neighborhood, South Side], and the beat that McDonald's is in, South Shore, it's the highest--had the highest murder rate in the city in '95 [1995], '96 [1996], '97 [1997].  I mean these are, you know, rough neighborhoods by any standard, and McDonald's has never, you know, saw--you know, of all the businesses in the neighborhood, has never like closed itself off.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, all of those neighborhoods are operated, and owned and operated by African American families.  And those families, in many instances, come from or live in or live near those neighborhoods.  And they are absolutely engaged because their livelihood is, based upon how well their McDonald's does in that neighborhood.  And so, you know, when you are a stakeholder to that extent, you stand for something and you also stand against people who are trying to destroy the neighborhood.  You're trying to build the neighborhood up, as opposed to, you know, people who're trying to destroy it.  And there are always a cadre of the majority of people from that neighborhood who are really there to build it up as opposed to tear it down because it's their neighborhood, you know.  And it's difficult, but, you know, we, want to be a part of the solution, not a part of the problem.
Story_ID: 15008
Speaker 1: Okay, in terms of the profile of owners--recently in Chicago [Illinois], even as we're sitting here, the DuSable Museum [of African American History, Chicago, Illinois] has an exhibit where they're, they are, where they're exhibiting a portion of the life of Cirillo McSween and his relationship with Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and [Mayor] Harold Washington and other people as a community leader, and activist.  And Cirillo McSween is one of the--I guess he the, some of the most high-profile McDonald's franchises in the city; one down--two downtown in the Loop [central business district, Chicago, Illinois] and one at the Field Museum [Chicago, Illinois], I believe, if not more.  I don't know if he owns more.
Speaker 2: Well, he also owns the ones in the United Terminal at O'Hare Airport [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So it's interesting though that--and I've never really focused on McDonald's [Corporation] before, as, you know, in this kind of conversation, but there's a lot of history here, you know, and relationships in terms of the black community and McDonald's.  Also, if you go down to--and I've been the Museum of Broadcast Communications [Chicago, Illinois].  They used to have a kiosk with black ads, you know, where they would show the old Burrell [Communications, advertising agency] ads from McDonald's and, the--as well as Coke [The Coca-Cola Company], you know.  And the profile that they give McDonald's was--seems to be a positive one and one that is--links McDonald's to--or, reminds the black community of its heritage to jazz and black history and other things, Africa, you know, in a way that maybe some other ads might not.  I mean I, don't know, is this--do Burrell's ads reflect the wishes of the national minority, you know, owners or black McDonald's owners?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, absolutely.  We, are very, very proud of our culture and the contribution that we have made to McDonald's and to, you know, the United States and the world.  Popular culture is more affected by black culture than any other culture, I believe.  And I think that you only have to take a look at rap music today.  You know, the vast majority of rap music is not bought by blacks.  And while I'm not an aficionado of rap music as a person of my age, to see how it has affected all of society, to see how dress that starts in the African American community becomes the standard for young people around the world, to see it--and, that, has always been true.  There're so many values that have impacted, you know, our society that have come from our community.  And one of the ways that we try to reflect and honor that is to reflect it in our commercials.  We want to reflect our culture in the most positive way that we can, you know, in our commercials.  You know, when you, think that McDonald's is one of the largest advertisers in the world, certainly one of the largest advertisers in the United States, you know, those commercials get seen and heard by millions of people, many, many, many times.  So they do make an impression.  And they make an impression upon young people in terms of what they can do.  I remember the commercials, the Calvin [character's name in the commercial] commercials, and most people will, will remember those Calvin commercials as being very, very positive, you know, because they express something that is very meaningful to our community.  And that's the value of work, the value of morality, of ethics, of standards, of character.  And those are all of the things that you learn by coming to work and becoming associated with McDonald's.  And you learn to be consistent in those things, as well as the things that we reflect in the way that we communicate to the public about what our real core values are.  And, you know, it is about business to be sure, but it is more than about business.  This is about life.  We don't get the opportunity to get any these days back.  And how we leave things is the only real mark that we make.  And I never saw a hearse follow anybody to the cemetery, you know.  But there are people who can be touched and whose lives can be improved by the example and the opportunity that we help to create.  And that's really what we're trying to do in the National Black McDonald's Operators Association and in McDonald's as a whole.
Story_ID: 15009
Speaker 1: Okay, now, on the negative side, McDonald's [Corporation] has taken some hits lately for the quality of food and the high-fat content, lack of nutrition.  It's been criticized for that.  Somebody even sued in one state.  They said that the reason why they were real fat is because of McDonald's food, and they ate too much McDonald's food.  And it's injurious to their health.  And there's been a movie now ['Super Size Me'] where a guy eats McDonald's, you know, and he super-sizes everything.  And he gets super big, you know, in the movie.  I've never--I haven't seen, but I think that's the premise, that eating McDonald's all the time is not going to be good for you.  Is there--and that, with the, I think there's evidence now that the black community is the fattest community, most overweight community in the country, you know, now.  I mean, is--did that--what do the [National] Black McDonald's Operators [Association] think about that?  And has there been discussions about the kind of food that's being served and what it should be like?
Speaker 2: Well, let's, look at the kind of food that's being served, you know.  We have lean hamburger, the best that you can get.  We have bread.  We have cheese, you know.  We have chicken, grilled and fried.  We have salads, you know.  We have potatoes in terms of French fries.  We have a full range of breakfast items, you know, eggs, bacon, sausage, hot cakes and the same kind of things that you get anywhere, you know, when you're buying high-quality.  You're not going to find--you never hear of anybody getting sick eating at McDonald's, you know.  So it, is high-quality ingredients and high-quality going in.  I've never seen anybody at McDonald's force anybody to eat anything, you know.  I've seen a lot of overweight people that never go to McDonald's, you know.  So I, think that, first of all, I think we have, McDonald's has a--have a responsibility to offer a variety of choices of food.  And I think we, we're doing, you know, that today better than we ever have before.  And there are lots of healthy choices on the McDonald's menu.  But people have to make those choices.  And they have to make those choices for themselves.  I, think that I have to accept responsibility, both for my health and the choices that I make.  And you have to accept responsibility for your health and the choices that you make.  Each one of us might make some different choices and still wind up being healthy because it's an individual thing.  I have members of my family that can look at food and gain weight.  And I have other members that can eat everything that they ever thought that they wanted to eat, and never gain weight, you know, at all.  And so what we try to do at McDonald's is to, change with the time.  The times that we're in today is promote healthy choices, healthy lifestyles, because, you know, it's to our advantage to have everybody eat well, be healthy, live long and come often to McDonald's.
Story_ID: 15010
Speaker 1: And especially these days, a lot of kids these days eat exclusively at fast food restaurants almost.  And this is something that wasn't true when you and I were growing up.
Speaker 2: I don't think it's true today.
Speaker 1: You don't think so?
Speaker 2: I don't accept that a lot of kids eat exclusively at fast food restaurants.  I haven't seen that to be true.  But there are a lot of kids that have very sedentary lifestyles, you know, both, kids that aren't affluent and kids that are, you know, and more of the kids that are because they're on the computer, and more of the kids that aren't because they're in front of the television.  And so it just seems to me that what you have to do, is you have to evaluate what is really happening in our society.  And I, think we have two things that are happening in our society.  One is our, lifestyles are too sedentary.  And two, is that we're, we are consuming more food with that sedentary lifestyle than ever before.  Well, the natural consequence of both of those are going to be obesity, fat, you know.  And so we've got to get a point where we're back to more active lifestyles and where we have a more balanced nutritional platform.  But, you know, you take a look at, our school systems today.  Many school systems today, because of economics, have dropped athletics as a requirement.  You know, when, we were going to school, we had gym every day, five days a week.  We had gym every day, and we had all kinds of intramural activities that, in most school districts, that doesn't exist today, you know.  And I'm, just saying that I think that there are a lot of reasons why the consequences that we see exist.  And it's up to all of us to change the input in order to change the output.

Speaker 1: Is there a--has there been any discussion amongst the McDonald's [Corporation] executives, the one's that are [National] Black Operators Association, about educational stuff for the community around nutrition and so forth?
Speaker 2: Man, we have so much of it today.  You know, you go into every McDonald's restaurant in the United States today, and there are several different pamphlets about nutrition.  You know, there's the labeling information is available in every McDonald's restaurant today.  And the, way we picture our products today, more prominently emphasizes, you know, the, salads and the other choices that go along with it, whether it be apple dippers or a fruit and walnut salad or, you know, all of the things that we have that--you know, and our Happy Meals [McDonald's children's meal] today, you know, you don't have to get a Coke [beverage] and French fry.  You can get a milk, you can get a chocolate milk, you can get an apple dipper, you can get other things to go along with the chicken McNuggets or whatever else you're getting.  We're providing the choices.  We're providing the education.  We're providing the marketing to try to change the habits, but people are still making their own decisions.  We cannot make decisions, you know, for people, particularly, for grown people.  And we cannot make decisions for people about their children.  You know, that is their responsibility, and we're trying to, in every way that we know how, to encourage them to be responsible in those decisions.
Story_ID: 15012
Speaker 1: Okay, now what's the National Leadership Board?
Speaker 2: The National Leadership Council, we have about 2,800 owners of McDonald's [fast food chain] restaurants in the United States. And of the 12 [thousand]--13,000 McDonald's restaurants, we own about 11,000 of them.  And the National Leadership Council --we're divided into twenty-two regions.  And each region elects a representative to the National Leadership Council to represent the interests of the owner-operators in, our dealings with the company.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you're the--are you--you're the past--
Speaker 2: No, I'm the current chair [Chairman].
Speaker 1: --current Chair, okay.  All right.  Okay, so in that capacity, you represent these--
Speaker 2: All of the [McDonald's] franchisees in the United States.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And that must keep you very busy?
Speaker 2: Very busy.
Speaker 1: Now, what do you--what's the toughest thing to do in that capacity?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know if there's any one single thing that's tough to do.  You know, we are an organization of 2,700 presidents. Every person's the president of their own company.  And so I, always say this that, you know, my number one objective is operator unity because if, you know, if we want to go in two different directions at the same time, we're no longer an organization.  We have to go in one direction.  And so we have to organize ourselves to be able to make collective decisions about what that best direction is and to have the support of the vast majority to do that.  And it's, an art as opposed to a science.  It's not always easy to know where that is or how to get to that point with so many people of diverse backgrounds and far-flung geographies and difficulties in communicating and that kind of stuff.  The second thing I would say to you is that, the way that I look at this in my leadership, what I'm trying to do, is I equate McDonald's to the goose that lays the egg.  And our objective is to pet the goose, to feed the goose, to care for the goose and get it to lay more eggs.  And we've been doing that very well.  You know, there's very little friction or conflict between McDonald's Corporation and its franchisees.  And we don't always have exactly the same interests.  You know, we don't, earn our incomes in exactly the same way.  You know, we pay them a rent and a service fee.  So every incremental dollar in sales that they do, produces incremental revenue for them.  But it doesn't necessarily produce incremental revenue for us.  You know, the cost of producing has got to be less than, what the benefits are in order for it to work out for us.  And there have been times in the past where there, that that has--where we've had some differences.  And what we've been able to do in the last two years, I think, is work through those difference very creatively, very affirmatively, very collaboratively so that today, we're on the longest sustained growth cycle in my thirty years at McDonald's.

Speaker 1: What about the Next Generation Program [McDonald's Second Generation Program]?
Speaker 2: Well, most of us are of age to have children, some of us, children and grandchildren.  And, I have to raise my hand on that one.  And for many of us, our children would like to come into the family business.  But we are, individually, the franchisees.  And the children are not guaranteed a place in the business.  They have to qualify and become franchisees on their own merit.  And the Second Generation Program allows them a, special and specific opportunity to meet those qualifications.  It clearly spells out what the qualification says, provides a process for those children of current franchisees to get approved, to be a part of their parents' business or, and/or to be a part of, becoming a franchisee on their own.

Speaker 1: What do you--I was watching [motion picture] 'Coming to America' the other night, and this guy was running McDougal's [McDowell's], you know, (laughter), had started his own, you know, similar to McDonald's, but not quite the same thing.  But, just --that's a comic little lead into what do you plan--what are your future plans?  What are you doing, you know, in addition to McDonald's?  Or do you have any other plans within McDonald's [Corporation]?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I'm just continuing my career, you know, in McDonald's.  I've been in McDonald's for thirty years.  I don't plan on doing anything else, and I don't need to do anything else, you know, at the same time.  I have a son whose an approved McDonald's owner, decided that this really wasn't what he wanted to do.  And he's in mortgage banking, and I have to ask him for a loan now, every now and then.  And I'm very proud of him and happy, you know, that that has occurred.  I have a daughter who graduated from the University of San Francisco [San Francisco, California] and is working with us in the business and is a partner in one of our stores and, will continue to grow and, get approved probably some time this year, finally, by McDonald's as a franchisee on her own right.  And then I have a son whose a, sophomore at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia].  And I just left him earlier today, going back to school.  And, I, want to be in this business and give him the opportunity to be in it, if this is what he chooses to do.  It's what I chose to do, but it's not what he needs to or has to choose to do.  He has to make his own way in the world.  So, you know, really for me and for my wife, at this point in time, is, we've done most of everything that we wanted to do, you know, in McDonald's.  I feel very proud to have been associated with McDonald's all of these years, and I'm looking forward to being associated with McDonald's for years to come.  It gives now the opportunity to spend more time, more quality time guiding and helping and assisting, you know, my children and the people that I work with and who've worked with me to help me to, to be successful.  And it allows me more time to contribute at the level of the National Leadership Council or past Chair of the National Black McDonald's Operators' Association and, to be involved and engaged in the community that my businesses are involved in.  And I enjoy each one of those roles immensely.  And, as long as, and I continue to enjoy them, I'll continue to do this.
Story_ID: 15015
Speaker 1: Okay, so we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: First of all, I, deal a lot of, people who are--have overcome tremendous obstacles and barriers to be successful, people who are my peers, the children of my peers, the children of people that I don't know.  I, I'm at a lot of colleges and I see an awful lot of African Americans in college.  I, see African American CEOs [Chief Executive Officers] of major corporations I never saw before.  I see an African American owning an NBA [National Basketball Association] basketball team.  I've never seen that before.  I, I'm rarely on an airplane or anywhere in the world that I've been fortunate enough to travel that I don't see African Americans doing the same thing, you know, that I'm doing.  I'm rarely at a place where I am the only one, you know.  And I love that.  I love that.  I love the fact that more and more people are becoming more and more successful for real.  And so I want to start by answering your question in the positive because I think that, based upon, you know, my start in life.  You know, I don't think that I have any gift that is abnormal in any way, shape, form or fashion, other than maybe good fortune because I've had a tremendous amount of good fortune.  But I've also taken advantage of that good fortune, and I think that the people that I know, who are doing well are in a very similar situation.  And if we can, you know, many, many, many more people can.  And I think it's a part of our role is to encourage people by example to do that and by our assistance to do that.  And I see that happening with, my friends and associates and people that I know and people that I meet, you know, all over the country.  I, am concerned that the, values that have caused us to overcome slavery, to overcome reconstruction, to overcome Jim Crow, you know, are dissipating in a lot of young people, you know.  I, would not, couldn't imagine not voting with everything that happened in my lifetime to create the opportunity to have a voice and a say.  But many young people haven't had that experience, and I, don't know how to transfer it.  And I don't think we, as a community, know how to transfer it.  I'm concerned about values that are expressed in the, current music, you know, that we hear, the words and beyond the words, the tone, the tenure and the meaning.  Meanings are changing so rapidly.  I'm concerned about the, degradation of life, of the value of life.  So many of us are killing each other, injuring and maiming each other.  You know, it's crabs in the barrel times many, you know.  It's not just pulling other people down.  It's ending, you know, their life for no good reason.  You know, these are, things that I think have got to change if we're going to make the kind of progress that we're capable of making.  Lastly, I, I'm, very concerned about the competitive position of our young people in the world because I think many are concerned with style versus substance.  You know, and every day that you do not compete is a day that you lose.  And because you choose not to compete, does not mean other people are choosing not to compete.  And there are so many that are choosing not to compete, you know.  And that continues and perpetuates the cycle of incarceration.

Speaker 1: Tell us about the 365 Black program at McDonald's [Corporation].
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's, a program, I think we're in our third or fourth year now of this program.  And instead of looking at black history as something that we do one month out of the year [Black History Month, February], we're looking at it as something that we do 365 days out of the year to continuously recognize the contribution that, the African American community has made, you know, to America and to the world.  And we've made a tremendous contribution to America and the world.  And, you know, and, and we're still making a tremendous contribution, probably a greater contribution today than ever before.  And it is a way to recognize and acknowledge that, but it is also a way to communicate that in a way to try to inspire young people by the example that others have set.
Story_ID: 15017
Speaker 1: Okay, and you were just recognized by, with--by that program right as a--did you receive an award for that or--?
Speaker 2: Well, I, think I will be receiving an award for that.  When I worked for the company [McDonald's Corporation], we started something called the Black Employee Network.  And it was, the same thing as a National Black McDonald's Operators Association, a self-help group; a way that we can work together to encourage each other in, an environment that, while friendly, not necessarily all, always comfortable, you know, and to create also a better understanding between the, general McDonald's environment and the specific contribution that African Americans do bring.  And to acknowledge the differences as well, because there are differences.  You know, we are basically a much more emotional people.  We operate out of our emotion to a much greater extent than, some of the cultures do.  And those differences are very real, particularly in the business environment. And it's important to understand other cultures as well and understand how our differences in, our cultural norms can be overcome to deal--to make business decisions.  And so all of those were things that, you know, we were early, I think, pioneers in, and trying to help, and they're things that still exists today in McDonald's.  And one of the reasons why, in my mind--because McDonald's supported in the early days, is one of the reasons why they're recognized today as one of the most hospitable places for minorities to work and to earn a living.
Story_ID: 15018
Speaker 1: Okay, now, if you--when you look back over your life and the things you've done to this point, and you're still fairly young, what-- is there anything that you would, anything major you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Oh, there, are lots of things I think that, I would do differently.  You know, every person makes mistakes in their life.  There's, not any person that I've talked to, you know, that has, been perfect.  So there, are things that, you would change, you know.  I probably would have been a little less flamboyant in my spending in my earlier days and a little more conservative.  And I'd probably have amassed and accumulated, you know, more wealth if I had done that.  But, by the same token, I might not have had as much enjoyment out of my life, you know, and comfort in my life had I of, done that.  I probably would have understand the value of friendship earlier in my life.  Today, I understand the value of friendship, and it is the, commodity that is most meaningful to me, is family and friendship.  You know, it is not the acquisition of things, you know.  Things depreciate.  Val- the friendships and the relationships that you have appreciate exponentially. And your friends do more for you than you could possibly expect to be able to do for yourself.  And, I'm happy that I learned that lesson, you know, at, this late stage, but I wish I had of learned it a little bit earlier and it had been much more meaningful to me earlier.  I would say those are probably the two biggest things.
Story_ID: 15019
Speaker 1: In that same regard, did your grandmother live to see you become successful?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, my grandmother was ninety-three when she passed.  So she passed about five years ago.  And we got an opportunity to do an awful lot together.  You know, everybody that ever knew her called her Mama Annie.  And she is by far the guiding force in my life.  I think of her every day.  And I think of all the things that I learned from her and am guided by them every day today.  One of the reasons why I feel so strongly about the need for values for young people is because, you know, I--you know, in my life, I could have gone a number of different ways.  But it was, you know, that strong love and that strong will, that strong hand, and that communication of those strong values that really kept bringing me back when I tried to stray.  And I know that that is something that is essential for us to redevelop and recommit to in our community for the young people of our community.
Story_ID: 15020
Speaker 1: Also, I guess when you look back at all the things you've done, and we always ask this question, so I'm not just picking on you.  What would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I, hope it's something that I'm still to, do because I, don't--I think legacy is something that you begin to consider when you're through or nearly through.  And, I don't think that I'm through or nearly through.  So I, could tell you what my wish is.  My, wish is for each of my children to be happy, to be happy people.  If, I could have one legacy, one gift of god, that would be the gift I'd ask for.
Speaker 1: Okay, and is there anything we haven't asked you that you, would--you think you need to address?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think you've been very thorough.  You know, I, I can't think of a thing.
Story_ID: 15021
Speaker 1: Well there's one last question, similar to legacy, but slightly different and that is, sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I think I would like to be remembered as a very proud, black man.  I think that would be the ultimate, you know, for me.  I--there's so many people I have so much respect for.  But the people that I have respect for were good husbands and were good fathers, you know, people who carried forward and carried through with their responsibility to other people.  They were good members of the community, and they were good friends to other people.  They were caring, nurturing and sharing.  And, they helped other people to realize their dreams.  There's a guy named Zig Ziglar whose a pretty popular speaker in America today.  And he wrote a book.  And the book is entitled, 'See You at the Top'.  And his view is that you can get everything that you want out of life if you just help enough other people get what they want.  And I believe that that is true.  You know, I believe that at--if you're at the base of the pyramid and you help everybody at the base, the base gets wider and it pushes the top up.  That has been my experience in the main, and, and it's my hope to be viewed that way.
