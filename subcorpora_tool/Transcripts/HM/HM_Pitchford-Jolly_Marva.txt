Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, management makes me ask everyone five People magazine-ish type questions that--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: The first question is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Chicken.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: The fall.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.

Speaker 2: (Laughter) And I love it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do, do you have a favorite--let's see (unclear) do you have a vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I've spent a lot of time in Africa, but that was more soul searching.  My vacation destination would be country-type thing.  I've been going in the mountains up in Mexico, and it's very barren, and I like that.  So I would say Guadalajara, Mexico--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --is one of my favorite places.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I do.  It is, it, it, it's funny how it escapes me (laughter) right now, you know.  It'll, it'll come back to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, if it comes to you as we go--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that's fine.
Speaker 2: But it, it, it will, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 608022
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Floyd Pitchford, Sr.] side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But we'll start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Mattie, M-A-T-T-I-E, Luise, L-U-I-S-E, Williams Pitchford [Mattie Williams Pitchford]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --P-I-T-C-H-F-O-R-D.
Speaker 1: All right, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is May 9th, 1915.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How, how far back can you trace that side?  Is there a history that's shared?
Speaker 2: I can--in terms of what I know, my mother's mother's name was Matilda [Matilda Williams], and her father's name was Butler [Butler Williams], with both Williams.  I do not know my grandmother's maid name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And are there any stories about them?  And what, what, what kind of life did they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My--the story about my maternal grandfather is that he was a marksman; he hunted.  I mean, he had just a regular job, you know, per--but he hunted.  He was known as someone who they had to handicap him, because they wouldn't let him shoot first if they were going after certain kind of prey.  You know, so he had to wait.
Speaker 1: So if you shot it, you got it.  Is that what--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what it---
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he let the others take some, take some shots.  But I understand he was a very, very quiet, but very strong personality, you know, but gentle.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can--are there, there--can you give us a sense of what kind of life he lived and what--
Speaker 2: My sense is, just based upon the family he comes from, comes from a, a very stable family, mother, father in the, in the home, and he was very, very into family.  I don't know what his day-to-day life was like.  They were not farmers, you know.  And, but what they did every day, you know, I just really, I don't have a clue.
Speaker 1: So your grandparents, did, did they work for--
Speaker 2: They didn't work for anybody.  People worked for them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay?  That's why I'm saying I'm just not sure.
Speaker 1: Is this in Crenshaw [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is in Crenshaw, right.  And they were very well established there.  They had been there for--they were--this is the story: that they, a group of them, and I don't know who all they is, but some uncles and my grandfather, they took a wagon from North Carolina, because they heard that in Crenshaw you could get land for ten cents an acre, and--but you had to clear it.  And seven of them came to Crenshaw and cleared the land that they claimed, so, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they, they became landowners early on (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: So this would be in the 19th century when they came to Crenshaw.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, sure.
Speaker 1: And is there a, any stories in your family about slavery or Reconstruction?
Speaker 2: You know, not that I know.  I want to explain that.  When one comes from the country, there is a certain isolation to that.  You basically are surrounded by other country families.  And we came together as a large family on Thanksgiving, Easter, Christmas, those kinds of holidays.  But other than that, I mean, you know, there was like stuff to do on the, on the farm and many stories we just never heard about, you know.  My mother didn't share them if she knew them--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know.  And nobody else that I know, and, and I was a talker from early on.  I'm not sure I asked the right questions, but.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you do know that your grandfather came from North Carolina.
Speaker 2: That's what--
Speaker 1: That's the story.
Speaker 2: I'm--that's the story that I've heard, 'cause I've asked, you know.  Many of them were reluctant to talk, you know.  I don't--you know, I can imagine what that's about, but I don't really know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, that's--so--
Speaker 2: My mother, on the other hand, or we--my grandmother, all I know is my grandmother had a stroke, young.  What young is, I'm assuming thirties, and was basically not very active, you know, had to be cared for in very special ways.  So, my grandfather, my mother, and my aunt were responsible for those, you know, helping with those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you know, that put a certain kind of situation in action in the family when you have to provide that much care-giving.
Speaker 1: So did you know both your grandparents (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I--no.
Speaker 1: --on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: I never saw either.  These are just stories I heard about them, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: I've seen one grandparent [Pitchford-Jolly's paternal grandfather, Bob Pitchford].
Story_ID: 608023
Speaker 1: Now your--when we were--before we started the interview, you were telling me that your mother died young.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did--would--did, did you have a chance to know her?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  I, I would call myself a mama's girl--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in that my mother was a creative lady, and I was a creative kid.  So, dumb stuff, you know, messy stuff that I did, she kind of forgave me for doing it.  So we had this little pact going.  Plus, I have to tell you something about my name.  My name is Marva [HistoryMaker Marva Lee Pitchford-Jolly].  And Joe Louis's wife name was Marva [Marva Trotter Louis], and that's how I come by my name.  So it was always Mattie's [Mattie Williams Pitchford] little girl, named after Marva.  You know, so I was, you know, kind of--
Speaker 1: Now did you--
Speaker 2: --special.
Speaker 1: So was--well, we know that Joe Louis, the fame of Joe Louis--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --during that era was tremendous.
Speaker 2: Oh, I mean, it--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --my mother just thought the world of him, you know.  Him and Teddy Roosevelt [President Theodore Roosevelt] I think my mother (laughter) just, you know, those two.  So, there was always talk about what Joe Louis was doing.  We always listened to the fight on the radio, you know, even as kids.  I mean, you know, the radio was special because you didn't use that battery up for just anything.
Speaker 1: Okay, it had battery power?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, people used to come--
Speaker 1: --a lot of people now--
Speaker 2: --from other farms to here, listen to our radio, you know, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, your mother didn't know Joe Louis's wife, but, but she--
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, no.  No.  She'd died if she had been able to meet him (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, that's possible now, but I just thought--
Speaker 2: Oh, it was--
Speaker 1: --I'd ask, but--
Speaker 2: --but we didn't know that--
Speaker 1: --but, okay.
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: But she was just, just inspired by the fact his wife was named Marva?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  And you know, Ebony would do pictures, you know, so my mother would see pictures.  My mother, since we--are we talking about my mother now?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: My mother was extremely gifted as a singer, I mean really.  Pregnancy interfered with a lot of stuff.  My mother got pregnant, and, and my family, both sides, decided you, you, you know, y'all are at the end of the line in terms of freedom, you know.  This is a marriage situation, so they got married.  But my mother was an extremely gifted singer.  And we're not, we weren't church people, even though they belonged to church and she tried to get us to join.  But when my mother would tell somebody in town that she was gonna sing the first Sunday, she'd get the word going, right, and it would just spread all over the place.  And the church would just be full, because she truly could, I mean really.  And my aunt--my mother never said this to me, but my aunt said to me that when they were little they dreamed of her being a singer, you know.  So I always had the sense, even as a little kid, that both of my parents [Mattie Williams Pitchford and Floyd Pitchford, Sr.] suffered from having to short circuit dreams based on, you know, some irresponsible action, as nice as it might have been, that just kind of hooked them together for, for life, you know.  I don't know that it would have ended that way had things taken their kind of natural course and they aged a little bit more, whether they would have married each other.  I'd like to think they would, but you know, doesn't mean that they would.  But, and she, she always--our food was wonderful because it was pretty.  We set the table, you know; we ate as a family always.  You didn't--it wasn't like I, I, I got caught up; I--no, no, no.  Dinner was--breakfast, supper, and dinner, three meals a day in Mississippi you made them all, you know, and that influenced me greatly.  My mother always had friends, you know, a friend, somebody that she really respected and loved.  So, you know, that, that impressed me a lot--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but mostly that she let me make mud pies and (laughter), and play with dirt, mud and stuff all the time, you know.
Story_ID: 608024
Speaker 1: Now did she--now did they have a, a school in Crenshaw [Mississippi], or did she have to go someplace else for, for school or what?  Did they have one--
Speaker 2: They, oh, they had a--
Speaker 1: --for the black--
Speaker 2: --school in Crenshaw.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, oh, sure.
Speaker 1: But how big a place is Crenshaw?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, it ain't (laughter)--(unclear)--you know, we're talking--I'm trying to see the sign as I pull into town.  It says "Welcome.  You're entering dah, dah, dah, dah, dah county--," maybe three thousand people, and that's counting--that's reaching way out.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: It's not big; it's a small place.
Speaker 1: So your, was, was your family land like in town proper or, or, or the land that your, your grandfather bought?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no, in, in the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandfather had--my father's father [Bob Pitchford], had--he owned all of the land.  He talked my father [Floyd Pitchford, Sr.] into--they lived in Memphis [Tennessee].  He talked him into, I would call it a betrayal.  I mean, it's, it's harsh language, but he tricked my mother [Mattie Williams Pitchford] into coming back to Mississippi.  And all of a sudden he had inherited forty-six acres of, of land from my grandfather, who tried to run everything.
Speaker 1: Okay, now wait. I'm--let me see.
Speaker 2: My father's father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, my mother ends up back in Mississippi, okay, not back--yeah, back in Mississippi.  She had--
Speaker 1: Okay, it was--
Speaker 2: --not--
Speaker 1: --it was, it was her father [Butler Williams] that was from North Carolina, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Her--yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.  We're gonna get to--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --his father too--
Speaker 1: Okay, so we--
Speaker 2: --'cause--
Speaker 1: Okay, we're gonna get on him in a second--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --on, on your father.
Speaker 2: But, you know, my mother was always trying to make life better.  And she's told stories, you know, at night, or when it was raining, or in the wintertime when there was nothing to do after you feed the, the animals.  But our land was in a--it was wonderful 'cause lots of trees.  We had probably about two or three acres that you didn't, we didn't put anything on, you know.  Hickory nut trees grew, pecan trees, you know, persimmons, those kind of things.  And the animals just kind of--we had a couple of those places.  But we raised cotton, and that's a hard job, one I never appreciated; didn't do much of it, but I knew.  When I was real little I told my mother, "I can't do this.  I'm leaving soon as I can."
Speaker 1: Now, and we know the rest (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, we, we're gonna find out the rest.
Speaker 2: Right (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But--
Story_ID: 608025
Speaker 1: I just wanted to ask a few more questions about your mother [Mattie Williams Pitchford] now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, now she went to school in Crenshaw [Mississippi].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And do you remember the name of the school?  You know the name of the school?
Speaker 2: Crenshaw--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Elementary School [Crenshaw Elementary School, Crenshaw, Mississippi].  And they had a--
Speaker 1: I know often--
Speaker 2: --high school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, often the schools--I know they were segregated then--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --and that, you know, sometimes they name them Crenshaw colored school or something like that.
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: We didn't have--
Speaker 1: They didn't do that?
Speaker 2: There was no, no, no such--just Crenshaw.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Now what the white school was called, I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I really don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, and you know, sometimes the schools are named after some local black per- person that made a contribution to it.
Speaker 2: Crenshaw wouldn't have done that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They weren't ready to do those (laughter) kinds of things, you know.  And there was no--there was a separate, a separate culture in that black people did what they did from an entertainment, all those kinds of perspectives.  But in terms of people coming together, it just, it, it wasn't going to be.
Speaker 1: Where black people and white people--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.  And even the--
Speaker 1: Wasn't much--
Speaker 2: --little person who was supposed to be a sheriff (laughter) on the black side, he didn't have a gun.  You know, just everybody--
Speaker 1: Oh, there, there was actually--
Speaker 2: --knew him.
Speaker 1: --a sheriff on the black side of town?
Speaker 2: Well, they, but they didn't call him that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, the, the old folks had a name for him.  I mean, it wasn't a nice name.  But he just kind of settled stuff if--
Speaker 1: Was he paid by anybody?
Speaker 2: Probably the man who owned the furniture store, I mean, that's the way they did business, you know, just kind of haphazard.
Speaker 1: So the man that owned the furniture store, you think--
Speaker 2: Well, he could have been the person.  We didn't have a mayor or anything like that.  They might now, you know.  But the man who owned the furniture store was very powerful, 'cause that's not all he owned, you know, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was kind of informal kind of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --setup, but everybody knew how--
Speaker 2: But you knew the rules.
Speaker 1: --what the arrangement was, yeah.
Speaker 2: You, you, you, I mean--
Speaker 1: The rules.
Speaker 2: --you know, you knew the rules, very subtle.  Or, what shall I say?  Invisible silence or something.
Speaker 1: Was there a downtown part of Crenshaw?
Speaker 2: Well, we wouldn't call it downtown.  We'd just call it town.  That's, that's, that's, you know, ain't no down and up.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Ain't no, ain't no sense in--
Speaker 2: It's just--
Speaker 1: --going down 'cause--
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).  It, you know, it's--wait a minute.  I can count the stores for you: one, two, three, four.  It might have expanded.  I, I no longer have family there, so I rarely go there.  But we're talking a small place, I mean really.  Couple of cafes, and they are not necessarily on the main little drag but on--it's one road.  Okay, somebody'll open up a store on the back road, but that's, that's a different entity, you know.  It's black side of town, white side of town, and each one's got about four stores, stores on each side.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the black--
Speaker 2: That's about it.
Speaker 1: --the black community--
Speaker 2: Gas.
Speaker 1: --had its own stores and--
Speaker 2: Always, yes, still do.
Speaker 1: Gas, too?
Speaker 2: That, I'm not sure of, 'cause they got this little gas station, and I don't know who owned it.  It seems like it's in the same place it was when I was a little girl.  You know, it's nothing elaborate.  It's not like four pumps.  This is a pump, so you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What did your mother tell you about growing up?  Now she--you said she could sing.  Did she want to be--become the--
Speaker 2: She sang all the time around the house.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she want--
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: --to become a professional singer or--
Speaker 2: Never said that to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her sister said it to me, you know.  It was probably something they had talked about as young girls.  It is my sense always that it's was something that bothered my mother.  I mean, I, I felt that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you said that she lived in Memphis [Tennessee] for a while.  She went to--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --school in Memphis.
Speaker 2: Sure.  When my mother and father [Floyd Pitchford, Sr.] got married, they got married in Memphis.  And you know, I guess they were leaving the family.  We have family in Memphis as well.  They got married there, and that's where they had the babies.  And then after--the, the first two children were twins [Floyd Pitchford, Jr. and Flo Pitchford].  After they were born, you know, they're off to Mississippi.
Speaker 1: So they, they came back to Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, well--
Speaker 2: My mother did not like that.
Story_ID: 608026
Speaker 1: Let's get to your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: Can you give us your, your father's full name and spell it for us (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Floyd, F-L-O-Y-D, Pitchford [Floyd Pitchford, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth.
Speaker 2: Nine, ten, nineteen twelve [September 10, 1912].
Speaker 1: So his birthday is almost the same as yours.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, one day difference.
Speaker 2: I was his birthday gift.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I am a twin as well.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, we have to get to that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we will (laughter).
Speaker 1: But, but, all right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Was he a twin too?
Speaker 2: My father?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Just the first two children.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see, okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: And the, then the next and the third two.
Speaker 1: So well, what do you know about your father's side of the family?  Where, where was he--
Speaker 2: My father's--
Speaker 1: --where was he born, first of all?
Speaker 2: My father was born in Crenshaw, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know a lot about his father because that's who I knew.  He's the only grandparent that's, that's alive.  But in terms of, of my father, that's who I'm talking about or am I talking about his father?
Speaker 1: Well, let's go back first, and then we'll pick your father up.  Let's--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --try, try to go back--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --to as far as we can.
Speaker 2: This is a, this, this is to me just an outstanding story.  They tell me that my grandfather came walking through town, leading his horse with one hand, with a Winchester [rifle] on his shoulder, riding boots and a leather coat in the middle of the summer.  No one had ever seen him before.  He did not speak to anyone as he walked all the way through the town.  And he ended up with a bunch of land, looked like a white man.  He shaved all his hair, so I don't know what his hair was like, never saw it.  He would tell no one where he came from.  I have heard--and one of the things I'll do when I retire is take a look at it, that he is as well from the Carolinas, you know, so.  But I, I have no idea.  His name--you wanted--did I give you his name?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  No.  What's it?
Speaker 2: His name is Lesley Robert Pitchford, known as Bob Pitchford.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You better not call him by none of that other stuff.  I don't--
Speaker 1: Bob Pitchford, okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I mean, and he meant it, too.
Story_ID: 608027
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So he showed up in Crenshaw [Mississippi] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He showed up.
Speaker 1: He was already grown, and--
Speaker 2: Right.  And I tell you this story--he was a young man.  I tell you this story because it's his pattern.  He's an extremely disciplined man.  He is very focused.  He's a strange, strange man.  He doesn't talk very much.  He gives orders to people.
Speaker 1: Do you suspect he was in the [U.S.] military at one point?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so at all.  I just think whoever raised him, I think he was raised in a very disciplined environment.  He could read.  He could write.  So I think that he, I really think that he is probably the son of a black woman and a white male and probably not just a fly-by-night situation.  I would assume that this is someone who educated him, just based upon his skills when I knew him.  Lot of people his age could not read and write, you know.  He could do business.  And the other thing was he bought a lot of land.  You just don't show up with money, you know.  And he hadn't robbed a bank or nothing.  So, I, I've always just kind of said to myself that here's a family that probably was told: here is some money, go forth.  You know, make a life for yourself and your family.  He got a start that a lot of people didn't get, you know.  He really didn't go through that, that struggle thing.  And he really was the patriarch of the family.  It was at that point where my family became more father side of the family oriented than the Williams side of the family oriented.  They're city folk or town folk; we're country people, you know.  And those two cultures don't fit together in the most comfortable way, because the folks in the city thinks that the folks in the country are just absolutely duds (laughter), you know.  But my grandfather, he, he ran a farm.  He had people work for him.  Like I said, man, people were scared of him.  I wasn't, but, you know.
Speaker 1: You have any sense about how he got along with the local white power structure?
Speaker 2: They didn't mess with him.  They called him Mr. Bob just like everybody else, because he, he told them that anybody that belonged to him, he, he--that's, that's how he would describe it.  Anybody in his family that belonged to him, if anything happened to anyone in his family, the same thing would happen to the person who did it.  And if anybody came on his land anywhere, and he--I mean, he told people this.  And if anybody came on his land, either on our place or his place to make trouble, they would not leave.  So, you know, we never had any trouble.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're, we're gonna pause here (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They cleaned that up real nicely.

Speaker 1: Okay, we were talking about Bob Pitchford [Pitchford-Jolly's paternal grandfather, Lesley "Bob" Pitchford].  And so, both--it seems that both sides of your family are pretty well off in terms of black life in those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They had property--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --and nobody really messing with them.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that's, those are two great--
Speaker 2: Those were wonderful--
Speaker 1: --you know, conditions.
Speaker 2: --beginnings.  I'm, I'm really proud of it, and I--our stories don't get told much, you know, those of us who--you know, man we didn't struggle.  We weren't poor (laughter).  I mean, you know, we weren't--life was kind of okay.
Speaker 1: So you were born on the tail end of the Depression [Great Depression].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But from what I've heard from other people, I guess you--
Speaker 2: But it didn't affect--let me--this is how my mother [Mattie Williams Pitchford] dealt with it.  Number one, my father [Floyd Pitchford, Sr.] had too many children to go to the war [World War II].  So we didn't have to worry about going to the war.  My aunt didn't have any children.  My mother had I don't know how many at that point.  But what my mother couldn't get, my aunt could get with stamps.  You know, you used stamps in those days.  And since we had a bunch of kids, we got sugar and all that stuff.  You used stamps 'cause sugar was rationing.  And so we just swapped off as families, you know, with all of that stuff.  But we were fine.  Plus we raised most of what we ate, you know, canned.
Speaker 1: Yeah, from what I understand the cash was hard to come by, but--
Speaker 2: Cash was.  You didn't see--
Speaker 1: The resources--
Speaker 2: --no whole bunch of money.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You did not.
Speaker 1: You could get the resources, right, the food--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, oh, sure, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And we shared too with--there were a couple of families that lived reasonably close to us.  See, that's the other thing.  People don't live close to you.  You know, they, they, they, they way over, you know, they on the farm way over there.  So we, we kind of grew up as our own little team, you know, our own little--and it's kind of still that way--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for those of us who are remaining.
Story_ID: 608029
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your mother [Mattie Williams Pitchford] and father [Floyd Pitchford, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: I don't know it.  This--but this I do know.  And poor babies were kind of headed for trouble I think from, from the beginning, because they met in school, of course.  And my mother--I am told that my mother just falls head over heels in love with this country boy.  That's exactly the way they describe it.  That is a no-no.  You know, it's almost like marrying somebody outside of your religion, 'cause they're just country and clunky.  And then they found out whose son he was, you know, so that made it a bit better.  But they just never really appreciated him at all, 'cause he was just country.
Speaker 1: But the Williams didn't like--
Speaker 2: No, the Williams didn't.  They, you know, they were kind of snooty.  But it was just an attitude that town people had.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they, they met in school, and, and they fell in love.
Speaker 2: They fell in love; she got pregnant.  They got married, and this us (laughter).
Speaker 1: About how old was she when got married?
Speaker 2: I'm guessing about sixteen--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: And so they went to Memphis [Tennessee] to, to get married, you were saying.
Speaker 2: See, I don't know how their wedding--I doubt it.  I would assume, since my family was--not my immediate, my, my aunts and grandparents and stuff was active in church.  And once that happened to you, you didn't sneak off nowhere and get married.  They married your behind right there, so everybody can see that these are (laughter) mistakes that we don't make.  So I am just sure that they got married in Crenshaw [Mississippi], moved to Memphis to start a new life, you know, because there were people there who could help them as well.
Speaker 1: Did they have family in, in, in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --in Memphis?
Speaker 2: Yes, as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father was kind of a wild child a little bit I think.  You know, they sometimes had to look for him (laughter).  He don't know I know all this stuff, but (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they--and you know, it, it's this deal he made with his father [Bob Pitchford] to return to the farm, you know.  And I don't know what his employment situation might have been in Memphis as a young person, 'cause he's young too, you know.
Story_ID: 608030
Speaker 1: Did he come from a large family?
Speaker 2: Yes, but only six of them survived.  There were many more born and got wiped out by smallpox, scarlet fever.  You know, when the fevers came through, a lot of people didn't survive, and he had a lot of siblings that did not survive.
Speaker 1: You said, I think you said your grandmother on that side was--passed away before you were born.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories about her and who she was?
Speaker 2: No, I don't--my grandfather [Bob Pitchford] would have had to tell it or my father, and neither of those--those are the, those were two silent men, by and large, you know.  And it, and, and what's funny about it is they were silent even though they were asked.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, they, they--it was not something they were ever prepared to really talk about.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so your parents [Mattie Williams Pitchford and Floyd Pitchford, Sr.], after the first set of children were twins, you say your older, older--
Speaker 2: Si- right, brother [Floyd Pitchford, Jr.] and sister [Flo Pitchford].
Speaker 1: --brother and sister.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So they're, they're fraternal twins.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And after they're born, your parents moved back to Crenshaw [Mississippi].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and who's born next?
Speaker 2: My--I have one sister who is born next named Johnnie Mae [Johnnie Mae Pitchford].  That's my grandmother's name as well.  And then my sister [Larva Pitchford Cunningham] and I are born.  We're fraternal twins as well though, even though I don't know that there's a lot of difference in some of that except looks.  Then my brother [James Pitchford] and a sister [Bobbie Pitchford Baker], and then way on the tail end comes another little brother [Charles Pitchford] (laughter).  He was an accident, and he lives in Liberia, so.
Speaker 1: He lives in Liberia?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, well, do you--
Speaker 2: But I don't know any stories about my Grandma Johnnie at all.
Speaker 1: Her name is Johnnie?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Johnnie Pitchford?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do, do you know her maiden name?
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I heard once Singleton [ph.], but I'm just--you know, I wouldn't write it down if I were you.  I just--
Speaker 1: So you never met any of her relatives or anything?  They never came around?
Speaker 2: None, never, never.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 608031
Speaker 1: Well, tell--do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I mean, my earliest memories, actually Thanksgiving memories, because the two things.  I, I've always been captivated by people and the smell of food.  And at Thanksgiving, I can remember, and I was really very, very little, but I can remember all of these people, you know.  I cannot tell you any of them, but they smelled good.  You know, they had on cologne and stuff.  You know, and I'd never--I don't know anything about, about cologne.  And you know, they was chewing gum, and they had on heavy clothes.  It was just--and cakes, pies, turkey, you know, and it was just--and nobody was in pain.  Nobody was fussing, you know.  It was nice, just really--and I always remember that.  And, and every year it would, it would happen, you know.  You'd get lugged off to somebody's house to enjoy all these people that you don't even know, you know.  You might get around to asking, "What's your name?  You know, you my aunt?  You my cousin?"  You know, that kind stuff, you know.  And the other is I happened to have, in many ways, liked the country; the other, as really a young kid, doing stuff, you know.  There was a freedom living in the country that I can't imagine in the city, 'cause we could just roam off, you know.  And those are my memories.  But the most salient I, I would suspect would be mud pies, man.  I loved them.  I ate them, I (laughter)--
Story_ID: 608032
Speaker 1: You're already into it, but we always ask this question: what are some of the sights, and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  Oh, my goodness, growing up, one of the smells I absolutely loved was when it rained really hard.  Okay, and it's, this is in the summertime.  It rained really hard, and then the earth is drying, and there is that smell, you know.  I also loved the smell of the spring with all the different kind of weeds and flowers and stuff that's out.  I loved the sound of, of cows, believe it or not, you know, chickens, birds, loved the sound of birds, particularly in the mornings.  I can't say cars 'cause we didn't (laughter) really hear the sound of, of, of cars.  Smells, god, chicken, of course, but stuff with herbs in it.  I would describe it that way.  That could be many different things, but I loved basil.  You know, my mother [Mattie Williams Pitchford] cooked with herbs, and you know, we grew them.  I--when I've been away, for instance, one of the, my favorite things to do is to come home and bake or grill some chicken, cook some greens and some corn and some sweet potatoes and some cornbread.  That just seems to get my journey back on track.  You know, it just, there is nothing to me like the smell of either turkey dressing and macaroni or chicken, greens, sweet potatoes, cornbread.  That--those are just, they're in my bones, you know, even though I eat all kinds of foods, you know.  But those will ever--you know, you just go hmm, you know.  You know, you can smell that Sunday dinner cooking, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's starting to get in my bones now too 'cause I listen to (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I enjoyed, I enjoyed the preparate- the preparation of food is a lot like art.  You know, you just--there's this little process that you go.  And, but the smell of dirt, I just, I really do love the, the smell of dirt.
Story_ID: 608033
Speaker 1: Now what about some of the sights?  What did it look like?
Speaker 2: In--I'll just start at our house and, and, and branch out.  We had, we called it a ditch--in the city they'd probably call it a stream--that ran right in the front of our house, I mean, not in the yard, of course, but right in the front, and on it grew plums.  To the right of our house would be an orchard that's got peaches, plums, et al.  In front of our house is a huge apple tree that my family said was there before they even came, so you know, very--part of it is dead, and the other part is just flourishing very--you know, that kind of apple tree, that the fence has grown in--the barb wire fence has grown into it.  They're flowers in the front yard, both sides.  We have a walkway that, that comes, that faces the plum orchard.  To the left, that's where a certain patch of, of something is growing, okay.  There are also trees along this, this body of water that extends way beyond our land.  It goes all the way, almost to the town, and where you can fish, you know.  So someone, a bunch of us, so somebody's always sitting out on the banks or, or something.  In the back there's lots of woods over to the side, and then you just get into whatever's growing, cotton; you have hay growing; we have corn growing; and we have, they call them gardens here, but we call them truck patches, which means they're bigger than a garden.  We grew lots of vegetables, you know, beans, peas, because we can, and potatoes.  We bank the potatoes in the, in the wintertime, you know, so.
Speaker 1: You say you did what them, ba- banked them?
Speaker 2: You know, banking?
Speaker 1: That means?
Speaker 2: Banking means that you, you build this tall thing of, of dirt, and you bury the potatoes in, into it.  And that keeps them from freezing and getting frostbite and rotting.  And when you're ready for some potatoes in the wintertime, you just, if it's not frozen, you just go and dig you up some potatoes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But they're in a mound of, big mound of dirt.
Speaker 2: Yes, it's a mound.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It keeps them from freezing up.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I always thought it was a miracle, you know (laughter).  I couldn't figure that out.  But, yeah, we called it banking.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A lot of those, lot of things done on a farm--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --a lot people are unfamiliar with now.
Speaker 2: I know, I know.
Speaker 1: But when, I guess when you're in that culture, there's a lot of things you figure out to do.
Speaker 2: You, you have to--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --or you'll starve to death in the winter because, you know, Jewel [Jewel-Osco] is not around the corner, you know.
Speaker 1: The Jewel food store here in Chicago [Illinois] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, the Jewel food store.
Story_ID: 608034
Speaker 1: Now, what did your house look like?
Speaker 2: Just a weatherworn frame house with a porch, back steps.  I'm, I was trying to count the rooms the other day.  My siblings (laughter), we, we come at this very differently--about seven rooms I guess.  You know, there were multiple people in rooms, of course, as kids, but, you know.  But I loved our house 'cause we spent most of the time on the porch, you know.  In the country, you don't live indoors except in the wintertime when it's cold.  You spend your time out.  When you, when you--after you've eaten in the evening, you spend your time on the porch talking--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --or playing or--
Speaker 1: So the porch is like the living room.
Speaker 2: The porch, yeah, absolutely.  That's really your living space--
Speaker 1: You know, I never--
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: --thought about that in that way before, but you're right.
Speaker 2: Yes, you, you know, it's really your living space.  And it's, it's used in the evening in a different way than it is any other time of the day, regardless of, of what--except maybe Sunday.  You know, the family might be there earlier.  But if you--when you come home for lunch, we, we called that dinner.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: When you come home for dinner, all you want to do is eat, be dismissed from the table so you can go lay under the tree until it's time to go back to the field.  I mean, you know, that's hard work, and I hated it.  But you, you want to do what the adults do.  You know, they lay under the tree with your hat, your straw hat over your head just to get some rest.  So people aren't talking, you know.  All that old jive talking stuff, no, no, no, no, no.  People are trying--'cause you been up since about four, you know, to get things done so you can get started.  But the evening, after you have supper, people tend to have a piece of watermelon or something, and it's on the porch, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And unless the mosquitoes run you in, you know, you stayed there until it's time to go to bed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 608035
Speaker 1: Now do you have a--an earliest memory of religion?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Do I?  I swear I'm gonna write a book called I never left the mourner's bench.  When I was about nine, I suppose--I think I was nine, eight, nine, in that category--we all got invited to go to get religion, you know, and it's called being on the mourner's  bench.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, before this time you hadn't been a churchgoer--
Speaker 2: Well, we went to church every now--
Speaker 1: --or church--
Speaker 2: --and then when my mother [Mattie Williams Pitchford]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --felt like singing.  But church was not a part of our ritual.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Okay.  But being a good person was a part of our ritual.  But church, it had--
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: --nothing to do with religion.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your moral training came from home--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --before you--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --went to church.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did, did you pray at home or that sort of thing, or did you--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But you just--
Speaker 2: We said our prayers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know how kids say their prayers?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: We were taught a prayer to say, and we were expected to do that every day, but other than that, no.  We never had group pair- prayers at all.
Speaker 1: Now, what, what was the name of your church--I mean that, that--
Speaker 2: Holly Grove--
Speaker 1: Holly Grove, okay.
Speaker 2: --Baptist Church [Holly Grove Missionary Baptist Church, Crenshaw, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is the church that you, you went to, to sit on--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the mourner's--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: --the mourner's bench.
Speaker 2: So now there's a whole slew of kids like our age, right.  They gather up all these kids, including my twin sister [Larva Pitchford Cunningham].  And relig- the mourner's bench is like two weeks, right.  And everybody has gotten religion but me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, now is, now what do you mean by that--
Speaker 2: They have ka--
Speaker 1: --that they got religion?
Speaker 2: --they have professed to accepting God, and well, they say they got religion, you know, whatever that means to them.
Speaker 1: Now this is--
Speaker 2: And that's what the people wanna hear.
Speaker 1: Is this a church that where you shout and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they do.
Speaker 1: So, so--
Speaker 2: I mean, but it's not--
Speaker 1: --did--
Speaker 2: --overly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you didn't have to demonstrate you had it by shouting or anything.
Speaker 2: But most of them did.  You know, if you shouted, that meant you really got the spirit, right.  So I'm watching all these kids, man.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And I'm going like, I don't know what they feeling, but it ain't, I ain't getting, right.  So my mother--everybody is praying for me in the town, I mean.  And I'm thinking, I mean, they, they crazy.  So, I'm going, my god, and then everybody, they pray when you go to church, you know.  And I'm up there by myself, and I'm going like, I ain't saying nothing that I don't feel.  I mean this.  And one, one night my mother said, "You really wanna do this?"  I said, "I don't."  And she said, "Fine."  And that was the end of it, period, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did your sisters go on and become members?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a minister as a matter of fact--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my twin sister, yes, yeah, married a man, moved to Arkansas.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, but it wasn't--you didn't, you didn't get a (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Well, but you know, it's, it's funny.  I just went at it a different way.  I actually have a--I don't know if I want to call it a degree, but certainly a certificate, from religious science.  But religion for me has never served a purpose.  Morality to me is about how one lives, you know, and what one's intensions are.  And I just didn't want to get bogged down with the whole religious thing.  I, I respect people who do, but I don't get into arguments about who's going to hell and who's not, you know.  I rest on my record.  I tell me people I, you know, I stand on my life.  But religion has not played a big role.  I joined the church, I really did, because I was getting married [to Warner Jolly] (laughter).  I, I wanted to get married.  I thought that was a, an American thing to do, you know.  But other than that, I mean, it really has not been, but I'm not hostile either.
Speaker 1: Well, how long ago was it when you joined the church to get married?
Speaker 2: Oh, my god, I mean, that was 1960--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, late '50s [1950s], I mean, to be honest (laughter), little before that.  But that was the purpose.  I mean, I thought that that would--was a traditional kind of thing that was okay with me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But you haven't really been a member since, since that time?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  My friends try to save me, you know.
Story_ID: 608036
Speaker 1: Can you tell me like--can you remember what your first experience is outside of the, outside of your own family, I mean, going out into the world to run errands or whatever?  Do you have a first story--I mean, a story about that?
Speaker 2: When I--our first start from leaving Mississippi after my mother [Mattie Williams Pitchford] died was in Memphis [Tennessee].  We--we're talking about me, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Are we?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is a story I need to tell--
Speaker 1: No, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm thinking as a child though.  I mean--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --as your--okay, right.
Speaker 2: But this, this is.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: After my mother--let me put it this way.  I was always asked to do things even as a little kid, because I could, you know.  My, my focus as a little bitty kid was--I figured out grown people would respect you if you knew how to do stuff, you know, and they'd, they'd call on you.  And I was also nosy.  I liked to hear what grown people were talking.  So I figured if I was good at stuff and nice to them, like bring them water and stuff like that, you know, I would hear a lot of their conversations (laughter).  So, you know, it, it was a dual purpose for me.  So I got sent to the store or--wasn't really a store.  I mean, somebody down south might sell stuff, you know, from--they might buy up stuff, and they might have just a little area in their house where you could go and get maybe baking powder or something like that.  But when, when I was in high school--I mean in, in, in elementary school [Crenshaw Elementary School, Crenshaw, Mississippi], people just, you know, teachers sent me on errands and stuff, you know.  I remember that.  And I, I never regretted it.  I always kind of liked it, you know.  Didn't show it sometimes, but (laughter) you know, it, it, it wasn't a bad--it served my purposes, I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: But I, but I was a--I, I, I roamed the woods as a, as a kid.  I mean, my mother would have to yell real loud so I'd hear her and start coming back, because I might be, you know, in the woods in a tree, you know, or snuck in a watermelon patch and busted a watermelon.  You know, I, I was that kind of kid.
Speaker 1: So, so, so what were, were the rules for you leaving?  I mean, what were--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have any except that you couldn't roam if you didn't know how to protect yourself from snakes and things like that.  Okay, so I could do--that's what I meant.  I could do--I could protect myself from snakes and stuff like that when I was a little kid.  And, and I also knew where they might be, so I didn't go.  I mean, you know, I wasn't stupid, either.  And so I didn't really have rules, except you couldn't go and stay a long--you, if you forgot time, you could be in quite a bit of trouble.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they'd kind of keep track on you.
Speaker 2: Sure, you know.  But because we would never walk the distance of our land anyway, you know, my father [Floyd Pitchford, Sr.] was probably somewhere working.  So, you know, somebody always know where somebody is.  Even though you, you, you know, you go in the woods, they say, "Well, she went up so and so," you know, and either, "Go get her," or my mother yells.  You know, you want somebody to come get you, because if you're mother's yelling, that means you could get into some trouble.
Story_ID: 608037
Speaker 1: Were you usually with your sister?
Speaker 2: No, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Just by yourself?
Speaker 2: Right.  One of the underlining factors for me in being a twin has always been the struggle for individuality.  I mean, it's a real struggle because we are girls, number one, and we look a lot alike.  So people, you, you know, people keep you in pairs.  They don't--you know, and I've always insisted, no, no, no, I'm Marva [HistoryMaker Marva Lee Pitchford-Jolly], you know.
Speaker 1: Now what's your sister's name?
Speaker 2: Larva [Larva Pitchford Cunningham].  Oh, my father [Floyd Pitchford, Sr.] was bright.  He thought Larva was just a wonderful rhyming, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So did they try to dress you alike?
Speaker 2: They didn't try; they did (laughter), you know, which annoyed me as well, I mean, not a lot, but I mean it did.  When you're struggling for your own identity, I mean, it's hard to find it when you, you're all the way at--in high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] we were still dressing alike.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, some of it was good.  You know, I can't say that.  But, I mean, it was a real struggle to wear what I want to wear and do the things I wanted to do--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 608038
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you about school.  What, what--do you have an earliest school memory?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Well, I have to tell the aggressive stuff first.  The first day I went to school, my mother [Mattie Williams Pitchford] took me to school in Crenshaw, Mississippi [Crenshaw Elementary School], right.
Speaker 1: Is this kindergarten or first grade?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, they don't have a kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They had first grade.  So we go to first grade, and this guy--we were all in this big room, right.  And this guy gets up and he kind of puts his foot in the stove.  It's not on.  It's summertime, right.  And I, I go and do the same thing.  I thought it was fun, man (laughter).  My--the woman who was the teacher is also my first cousin, and she told my mother.  You know, and my mother believed in dealing with you on the spot, so you know, I got whacked the first day of school, you know.  And then--
Speaker 1: Well, what was wrong with putting your foot on the--well, you--they, they wanted you to sit up straight.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So lounging back with your foot on the stove--
Speaker 2: And be, be, be a young lady, you know.  You know, you're, you're what, six or whatever it is.  And the other thing was--
Speaker 1: Oh, did you have dress on too--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --with your foot, with your foot on the stove?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Uh-oh.
Speaker 2: --and a new sweater, a new red sweater.  And the other thing was, when I settled down, you know, then I started missing my mother, right.  And I started crying, which just killed me, because to me crying was just a big baby.  I mean, I, I swore I'd never do such a thing.  You know, but life is like--so school was always a wonderful kind of escape for me because I didn't like farming.  I loved walking around in the, in the fields and stuff, but actually picking cotton and chopping, no, no, no, no, no.  I really did not like that.  So I knew that at sch- I didn't know at what point, but when I was in charge of myself, we didn't even have to worry about that.  So, you know, I, I always looked long range as well as some short range stuff.  But school was always, it wasn't--it as easy for me.  It wasn't difficult, so it, it also made it enjoyable.  And you learned early that if you know stuff, you know, teachers respond to you, you know, and so will other kids.  So, you know, that, the journey was always been very, very good, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is like a one-room school, a house or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, no, it wasn't.  The, there, there was one huge room where most of the like grade kids would be.  But it was enough space where somebody could be in a space like this, and someone would be in another space.  And then the big kids--I'm assuming they were still in elementary school; they just looked big to me--was in another room entirely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was there a high school in Crenshaw?
Speaker 2: Of such.  There was another building where high school kids went, not a whole lot of them.  You know, I never saw a whole bunch of them.  I mean, I really didn't, and I was gone before I ever got that--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) to that age, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you were in grade school, say your cousin was your teacher--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --initially?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So would they--was, was there a teacher for every, every grade, or did they have to gang the grades up, or--
Speaker 2: Now, I don't know whether any grades were bundled or now.  Mine wasn't.  And there always seemed to be a teacher for each grade, but I'm not--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --sure that's true, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Some of them might have been together.
Speaker 1: You're talking about a fairly large building then if--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you got at least eighth, eight grades.
Speaker 2: It's just a--you know, it's, it's, it's funny: I always thought it was built kind of like a barn, a lot of open space that they just put chairs and stuff in, well, desks.  I mean, I don't wanna--it wasn't really a chair; it was a desk, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Now what was your favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Early, was, was math.  But later on, since I like to argue, (laughter) history and that kind of stuff.  It was kind of like once I found out what's in the world, you know, things changed.  But I've always liked the, that whole political discussion.  My parents [Mattie Williams Pitchford and Floyd Pitchford, Sr.] used to listen to [President] Franklin Delano Roosevelt on the radio, you know, when he'd give one of his fireside chats, you know.  And I liked that, you know, so.  Actually, I was gonna grow up to work at the United Nations [UN] at one (laughter) point in my life, you know, and let me people talk me out of it, or as we say, I talked myself out of it, really.
Story_ID: 608039
Speaker 1: But you, you listened to the radio a lot when you, when you--
Speaker 2: Not a lot, but, and I think that's what made it so special.  We didn't listen to it a lot.  We only listened to it for special stuff.  On Sundays we listened to it because the, 'The Screaking Door' [sic. 'The Creaking Door'], that, that program came on, so we could stay up.  It must have come on like 6:30, maybe 7:00, so we could stay up and hear--but we were--we went to bed very early.
Speaker 1: Yeah, what time was bedtime normally?
Speaker 2: Before 7:00.  We got up at 4:00, you know.
Speaker 1: Even in the summertime?
Speaker 2: It didn't matter what season it was.
Speaker 1: I guess, well, we're on Daylight Savings Time now, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You, you actually, you were worked more.  There's more to do in the summer, you know, because you're either preparing crops or taking care of them, tending to them, you know, while they grow, so.
Speaker 1: That's right.  And, and the sundown would be in the summertime by 7:00 I guess in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause now with Daylight Savings Time people get kind of mixed up.  I know in Chicago [Illinois], it's 8:00.  In my hometown in Dayton [Ohio], it's 9:00 now because of Daylight Saving Time.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: The sun doesn't go down till nine--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --nine o'clock at night.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, it, it--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --wasn't--we didn't have those, those long, long sundowns where it stayed light way up into the evening.
Speaker 1: So about 7:00, 7:30 the sun--
Speaker 2: I think so, yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: --sun is moving down, yeah.
Speaker 2: --it was getting dark.  And the mosquitoes, you know, and nobody sat up in the house.  I mean, except in the wintertime during the day, you know, when there was--
Speaker 1: But the--
Speaker 2: --nowhere else to go.
Speaker 1: --but you say the sun was up by 4:00 or so.  It was come, coming up.
Speaker 2: Well, actually it starts peaking through between 4:30 and 5:00.  You know, you start seeing it a bit.  But sometimes it can be quite dark outside--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause I, I milked the cow, yuck.
Speaker 1: So you didn't like that (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, (laughter) I didn't.  But you know, again, you know, I could do it, so--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --it got done.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 608040
Speaker 1: So, well, back to school.  Did you have a favorite teacher in school [Crenshaw Elementary School, Crenshaw, Mississippi] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, oh yes.  Early on, I've--let me just preface this: I'm sure I teach because of teachers I've had.  Early, early on, I had a woman who was near the end, a Mrs. Taylor [ph.], who was near the end of, of teaching.  But she took a real interest in me, you know, because, well, she knew my family and everything.  And I would have to say, she was absolutely, at that stage in my life just, she was someone I admired greatly.  She was a very gentle woman but just took a lot of time.  She used to talk to me.  And when my mother [Mattie Williams Pitchford] would go to town, and if she took me with her, sometimes I'd ask if I could go to Mrs. Taylor's house, you know.  And she'd quit teaching by then, you know.  And we'd sit and talk, and she'd ask me, you know, what am I doing, that kind of stuff.  You know, so, they all--I always had that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, it was a real privilege and a blessing.  I'm not sure, you know, how I, you know, how I came about it.  But--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --it's like always been there.
Speaker 1: What grade did Mrs. Taylor teach?
Speaker 2: First grade.
Speaker 1: First grade.  So she was a--did she--okay.  So she was your first grade teacher?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And favorite, huh?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: See, I think you either really love your first grade teacher or you hate him.  But well, there's a third, I think, or they just don't even have any image in your head at all, you know, at this point.  But she's somebody that I--I mean, I can see her as if she's sitting right there on the couch, you know, was just a wonderful woman.
Story_ID: 608041
Speaker 1: Now did you have a chance to, to do any artwork in, in school as such?  Did they have art (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I--no, I took art classes like everybody else.  You know, everybody has to have art like you have to have math and that kind of stuff.  And people commented on the way I did things, but nobody ever said, why don't you pursue this?
Speaker 1: But you did have art classes in grade school [Crenshaw Elementary School]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in, in Crenshaw [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I came through when art was in, in all of the schools.  All of the grades that I went through, there was an art, you know.  You were basically relegated to the capacity of the teacher teaching art, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Had some good ones, and I really got some good ones when I got in high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you mainly draw and--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --and color and that sort of thing in, in--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --in grade, grade school?
Speaker 2: I played in mud and--
Speaker 1: Oh, mud?
Speaker 2: --built stuff (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: What kind of stuff would you make out of mud?  Now you, you talk like--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Everything.  I'd make a meal.  I mean, you know, like if it's Sunday.  You, you have to understand you can't play in mud every day, because it either has to be raining, or it has to be Sunday when you don't have anything to do.
Speaker 1: Now this is clay we're talking about actually (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: Actually mud.
Speaker 2: We're talking about mud--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --you know, digging it up in the ground.  I used to go under the house, and I'd dig me hole, dig me up some dirt, get me some water, okay, and I might pull me up some flowers and have a garden.  And I might pull me up some green leaves, and I'd cooked some greens, you know.  And I'll build me a little house, you know, all that little stuff.  And then you pour water on it, and it all disappears.  I mean, you know, it's--nothing permanent about it--never heard of clay, you know.
Speaker 1: So you say, so you do this under the, under the porch or under--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know.  You can do it anywhere.  I mean, I might do it when I'm fishing actually, you know, just to, just to do something, but, but, oh yeah.  'Cause houses were set up--I mean, it's not like in Africa where they're on stilts it seems in some instances because of the water.  But they were high.  They were on blocks, you know, so you could crawl underneath and sit underneath very comfortably.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Plus nobody bothered you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I told you I was forever trying to (laughter) get away from being a twin, you know.  Or not necessarily being, being a twin but just to get some space between myself and another person.
Story_ID: 608042
Speaker 1: Now who--did you have a lot of friends in school?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah, 'cause I liked to play.  I mean, you know, I liked to get--I'm more action-oriented.  But now, I go through periods where I'm almost a loner.  You know, I have to have--it's, it's, it's, it's funny: As much as I love people, sometimes I go like, okay, it's time to pull the shade down now, you know, and just take out some of this noise.  But, yeah, I do.  I--friends are important--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: Well, well, who were your friends in, in grade school?
Speaker 2: Oh, goodness.  Actually, I still--one of them I still have.  But Eddie Lee [ph.]--this is another thing: A lot of women in my neck of the woods have masculine names.  They're named after their fathers, their uncles or something.  Eddie Lee and Freddie Mae [ph.], okay, those were, those were two friends, and there's a woman named Roxie [ph.].  I have no idea where Roxie is.  But a girl was going to beat me up once.  And I was sitting there trying to figure out.  She doesn't know, you know, I mean, there's no way she can do that, you know.  So she's just talking, and Roxie said--this is how we met.  Roxie was from Arkansas, so she'd just, they'd just moved to Mississippi.  And Roxie said, "Well, you're gonna have to beat me up, too," you know.  And I hear this little name, and I look around and I'm thinking, we don't even need that.  But we became friends after that and up until I left, when I left.  Willodean [ph.] was another, another friend, and then we had Lionel [ph.].  Lionel was gay as a little kid, so he hung with us all the time, you know, so.  And I had another friend who, who died young.  And (laughter) this is awful, we called him Pee Baby.  You know, he, he was a big kid, but he still had a diaper.  He had some congenital problems, you know.  He never, never became a teenager, actually, but he was fun, you know.  We all used to hang together, walk to school 'cause, I mean, school was two and a half miles from where we lived.  And my [paternal] grandfather [Bob Pitchford], who, who used his truck as a bus because it was enclosed in the back, if we weren't out, I mean, he'd just leave us.  He was that kind of man.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then you'd have to walk?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He might even see us walking down the road.  If we weren't standing right there, he'd just leave us.  You know, sometimes we didn't care (laughter), you know, so.
Speaker 1: But two and a half miles, that's a pretty good, good walk, yeah.
Speaker 2: That is, but you know, it's something you do all the time.  You know, it's no, it's, it's, it's not a big deal.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: You know, people walk it.
Story_ID: 608043
Speaker 1: Now did, did you have--now we know this is Mississippi in the pre-desegregation and all that.  Did, did you have a--what was the relationship like between--or did you have any personal encounters with white people that weren't pleasant, you know?
Speaker 2: None, except, you know, you might run into somebody who might be talking to your mother [Mattie Williams Pitchford] or father [Floyd Pitchford, Sr.] or [paternal] grandfather [Bob Pitchford] or something, but other than that, had none--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: So you didn't have to deal with any of those issues?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And when in the town [Crenshaw, Mississippi], did they try to put up the whites-only signs and that sort of thing there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I never saw any of those signs.  But, but don't get mislead by that, because there are just unwritten laws, you know, that have been--people have faced terrible consequences for violating them.  You know, they are not written anywhere, but white side of town, black side of town.  And there are rules that go over there as well as, you know, on the black side of town.  But there is no--there's all--other than people who work for white people either on a farm or, or in their homes, that's the only interaction basically that I've ever seen in my early years.  It's quite different now.
Speaker 1: Did--oh, I had a good question, and I lost it, yeah.  Did--do you remember ever being told the, the rules of, or, or, or, or what the boundaries were, the black community and the white community--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --by anybody?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You just kind of picked it up or--
Speaker 2: Only in this instance: my mother would take turns taking us to town with her when she had to go to town to buy something.  That was always a special treat.  You know, I didn't get special treats often 'cause I was often into things.  But she had an instruction for all of us when we went to town.  You are to keep your mouth shut, you know, and you are to stay wherever my father or she put us.  So we were not active in town, you know.  Town was kind of a passive--but our deal was you might get a piece of candy, you know.  But other than that, there was no--I don't know of any interaction whatsoever--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --except to go to the store you might want some fabric or something.  You go to the store; you tell them how much fabric you want; and you leave.  Ain't no chitchatting, you know.
Story_ID: 608044
Speaker 1: Well, as you got older in school now, did you get responsibilities in school or join clubs and become--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --run for--okay.
Speaker 2: Not in elementary school [Crenshaw Elementary School, Crenshaw, Mississippi].  I don't ever remember anything being in elementary school.  But I graduated from Parkman here in the city, Parkman Elementary School [Francis Parkman Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay, so you, you, you--well, tell us--
Speaker 2: When--
Speaker 1: --about like when the--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --when the family moved and why the family moved.
Speaker 2: Goodness gracious.
Speaker 1: That's a story.
Speaker 2: My mother [Mattie Williams Pitchford] died in 1948, okay, which just absolutely disrupted our family, 'cause it was October of--
Speaker 1: So you were like ten or eleven?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I mean, you know, it just kind of devastated our world.  And so decisions had to be made.  My father [Floyd Pitchford, Sr.] made a decision that he would not split his kids up, you know, because aunts wanted to take this two and that, you know.  And he decided he was not going to do that.  He would keep us together.  So, in 1950, 1950, we, we stayed down south for two years.  In 1950, my father came here, got a job with Corn Products [Corn Products Refining Company; Ingredion, Inc.], Argo (laughter).
Speaker 1: Argo starch, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  We had much starch and syrup all of our (laughter), our young life.  And I gave them an ultimatum.  I told my [paternal] grandfather [Bob Pitchford] that--we, we were living with my grandfather.  And I told him that I had packed my little stuff in a box and they could either take me to Memphis [Tennessee] so I could go to Detroit [Michigan] to be with my aunt or I was gonna run away anyway, you know.  And I meant it.  I have no idea where I would have gotten--
Speaker 1: Now this is when you're in--
Speaker 2: I'm a little kid.  I'm, I'm in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Mississippi, okay.
Speaker 2: And, and I'm sick of it.  I don't want to stay there anymore.  I'm not going to stay there anymore.  I just decided I'm just not going to do it.  And I talked to my grandfather, you know.  We had a really good relationship.  I think it intrigued him that, that I wasn't afraid of him, you know, so we, we chatted a (laughter), a lot.  And I, I told him that I was going, gonna go.  You know, he--you know, I wish he would take me to Memphis to my aunt and then so I could get to Detroit.
Speaker 1: Now what was it that, that you made you want--was the death of your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I--my--
Speaker 1: --mother and just the whole--
Speaker 2: It wasn't my family anymore.  I mean, you know, the kids were around, but living with my grandfather, that just, it just wasn't gonna work.  I just--that wasn't, it wasn't good for me, you know, and I just knew it.  It just--I don't, I don't--I'm not sure of all of the things that was compelling me.  I just knew that I was going, you know.  I wasn't staying.  And so, he did.  He took me all the--he drove me all the way to Memphis for my aunt, 'cause he, he knew I, I was not, you know, I didn't bluff.  And where I ended up staying until my father sent for us, because my mother's side who lived in Detroit that I just truly, truly loved, her husband had a mental breakdown just as I'm having this total drama, right (laughter).  So I ended up staying in Memphis, all of us.
Story_ID: 608045
Speaker 1: As a matter of fact, that was our next stop before we came to Chicago [Illinois], was with my father's sister in Memphis [Tennessee], who was really a mean person, you know.  We were treated in ways that we just weren't accustomed to, you know.  See, my mother [Mattie Williams Pitchford] would whop you, but she was a fair woman.  You know, she didn't--you know, it wasn't nothing silly.  You knew exactly what the deal was.
Speaker 2: But his sister (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But--
Speaker 2: --was, was mean?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: The sister was mean, your, your father's sister?
Speaker 1: My--not my mother's sister.  That's my father's sister.
Speaker 2: Yeah, your father's sister, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes, yep, yes, yes, yes.  She was not a nice lady.
Speaker 2: Is there, do you have a story about something that happened there that--
Speaker 1: Oh, I mean, (laughter) number one, she didn't want any of us in her living room, you know.  Can you imagine--well, in fairness to her, she agreed, I guess, with my father [Floyd Pitchford, Sr.] that, that would be the holding place until he was ready for us to come.  But, I mean, it is a total change for her as well.  But she handled it just with--number one, we couldn't go into the living room; and number two, you would have to try to cook poorly, to cook as poorly as she did.  I mean, you know, she, she would just do stuff.  It, it was almost revengeful almost.  Like she would do stuff like cook a pot of beans, and she would fill the pot all the way up with water.  And it would never cook down so, you know, you had any kind of flavor, and there was no season.  She was a nutty lady.  I don't know if she was all right.  You know, she might not have been, because some things happened later that indicates that, you know, a screw was probably loose someplace.  But it wasn't a good experience for us, so.  We were there a couple of years, I guess--went to elementary school in, in Memphis, you know, and--
Speaker 2: Were things better at school, any better at--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.  I mean, school wasn't--school was, school was, school was always a refuge for me.  I mean, you know, it, it was--you could, you could get lost in books and stuff.
Speaker 2: Did you enjoy being in, in a, in a city at--
Speaker 1: I found it clumsy in the sense that it, that it was just so big to me.  And my, my, my underlining fear in the city always was that I would get lost and not know how to find my way, you know.  Other than that, you know, the city was just a place where I was.  I mean, I didn't really understand it or anything, you know.  Of course, as I, as I've lived in it, I've come to absolutely love it, you know.
Story_ID: 608046
Speaker 1: So when your, your father [Floyd Pitchford, Sr.] finally called for you to come to Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Right.  And then we came to Chicago officially--
Speaker 1: About--this is like, this is 1950?
Speaker 2: No, it, it wasn't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the first year.  Let's just say it must have been, let's say '51 [1951]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --even though these are not dates that are just solid in my head, but just based upon my own activity, about '51 [1951] we came.  And you know, we all got--we lived in this awful place on 54th [Street] and LaSalle [Street] in a basement.  We'd never seen a basement, much less, you know--so, the thing for us was adjusting to living in the ways that we were not accustomed to.  But school was good, went to Parkman Elementary School.  My biggest problem with living in a basement has always been I'm tall, you know, and basements are low.  So it was that and the fact that the bathroom, somehow they put it all the way out in the back of the, of the place.  So it wasn't the most conducive place, but I'm sure my father could afford it, you know.  And we stayed there a few years, but then we moved to a house on 70th [Street] and, right off Wentworth [Avenue], which was really, really, really quite nice.
Speaker 1: So that's like, should we call that Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] or West or--
Speaker 2: No.  It's--
Speaker 1: Not really Englewood.  It would be like--
Speaker 2: No, that's not Englewood.  That's--
Speaker 1: Auburn Gresham [Chicago, Illinois] or--no, I don't know.
Speaker 2: What is--
Speaker 1: Oh, I know it.
Speaker 2: What is that?  We're talking Wentworth--
Speaker 1: That's Park--Park, oh--
Speaker 2: --70th, 71st [Street].
Speaker 1: --Park, oh--
Speaker 2: Hamilton Park [Chicago, Illinois] doesn't extend that far over.  I, I just, I'm not sure I know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know the name of it.  It's, it's got a park in it, but I can't (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I used to live over there at one point.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I used to live over there at one point, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But, yeah, we, we, we lived there for a long time.  House is still there actually.  I went by there a few weeks ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, now, now you went to school--
Speaker 2: Englewood.
Speaker 1: High, Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Went to Parkman Ele- Francis Parkman Elementary School [Chicago, Illinois], and I went to Englewood High School.
Speaker 1: Now did you have more opportunities?  Were there more art programs in Parkman than, than at--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I--up through--well, you'll see this as we go with my own life.  I'm a self-taught artist, because it was just art school--I mean art classes that everybody else took.  I've always done crafts at home, you know, just piddle with stuff, you know.  And I wish that I had enough sense to keep some.  I gave it all away.  You know, people would say, "Ooh, can I have that?"  "Yep."  That's actually how I started doing ceramics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, it was all just about me, something I wanted to do, you know, never thought of it as being an artist.

Speaker 1: Okay, Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois].  Now this is nineteen fifty--
Speaker 2: Three [1953].
Speaker 1: --three [1953], okay, 1953, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: And this is where I get active, you know.  Like I said, I didn't--I never knew that there were any--I don't there were any clubs in my--other than you could be a, a monitor, a school monitor, had that, whatever that's called.  You know, I was that, where you help, a crossing guard monitor--
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: You get the tracking belt and all that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I had a little (laughter)--you know, but Englewood High School.  High school was really, really fun to me, because you had more and more freedom, number one.  They didn't tell you everything to do.  You signed up for your classes, and it was up to you whether you went or not.  And they had lots of, of, of, of activities.  So I'm a gym rat, you know, and so the GAA, that's the Girls Athletic Association, at one point I was president of that.  You have to earn--you had to do so much to earn a letter.  You know, I got one somewhere in somebody's house, you know, because I played volleyball, basketball, at--in high school as a collegiate sport.  That's about all they had for women actually.
Speaker 1: Volleyball and basketball?
Speaker 2: Yeah, maybe swimming, but I, I wasn't--couldn't interest me there, you know.  Was junior class president but got beaten (laughter) as a senior class president, you know.  Oh, I was mad, but here nor there.  High school is really about cliques, I mean, even in my day.  You know, they talk about cliques now, but it really was about--I had about--I don't know--about seven or eight girls that we kind of ran in a little group.  And we were smart girls, you know.  We were trying to keep our averages together and do positive kinds of things, you know, National Honor Society.  We just had our fiftieth graduation reunion last October, and to see people, 'cause many of us just kind of went, you know, we went to college, we just went in our own directions.  And many of them I have not seen since 1957.  And it was marvelous, it was, because most of us are positive, you know, doing very positive kinds of things.  Most people are healthy.  You know, it was a whole bunch of us there.  And you know, and folks remember stuff about you that, you know, you've forgotten totally altogether.  "Do you still do this?"  You know, I was an athlete in, in, in high school.  People want to know, "Do you still do--?" "No," (laughter).  You know, "I watch it."  You know, I do my little stuff, you know, bike riding, that kind of stuff, but you know, a lot of volleyball.  I hadn't played volleyball in years.  I can't.  You know, my hands, I do other stuff now with these hands.  You know, I can't have busted up fingers and stuff now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did they, they have like a volleyball team in, in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sure.  We played all around the city.  We used to play Catholic kids, Catholic schools I should say.
Speaker 1: Yep, yep.  They got--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what's that Catholic school, Mother McAuley [Mother McAuley Liberal Arts High School, Chicago, Illinois], that was always (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, we used to--
Speaker 1: --someone--
Speaker 2: --beat them to death.
Speaker 1: Did you?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) We loved that, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But sometimes they returned the favor, you know it wasn't--
Speaker 1: So now--
Story_ID: 608048
Speaker 1: Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois], at that time now--at one time it was like all white or part, or par- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When I went to--
Speaker 1: --partially integrated, but by, by, by the time you got there it was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --black, right?
Speaker 2: I have couple of uncles who went to hi- to Englewood in the '30s [1930s], maybe the '20s [1920s].  I'm not sure.  But when I got to Englewood there were probably in, in, in the entering class with me, there were four.  There were a handful still remaining who were, you know, matriculating out.  But by the time I became a senior, there were none.  Families had moved away, you know.  So we had two Hispanics, two Mexicans.  Everybody else was, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, now who were, were there any special teachers there at Englewood that you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, goodness, oh, oh, just a, a, a bun--as, as a matter of fact, a woman--and I don't even, I don't even--I think her name was Mrs. Douglas [ph.], but I don't really remember her name.  But of all the people I ever had for art, this is, this is a woman--she was a sub.  And she happened to sub in my class one day, and she was looking at what I was do--painting.  And she said to me, she says, "Are you gonna major in art?"  You know, and I, I mean, I was taken aback, you know.  "What are, what are you talking about?"  And she said, "You know, you really do art in a very special kind of way, and you really ought to do much more."  But, you know, when you're in high school--and my father [Floyd Pitchford, Sr.] was gonna buy me some art supplies?  Oh, he would have laughed probably, you know.  But it was just, just the classes, but it, it always stuck, because I always liked it so much, but never thought of art as even a possibility of a life choice--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: Did you ever do the art for special programs at school and that sort of thing, signs or anything like that?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).  Just the art classes that, that was offered.  And when I got to college--but back, back to high school.  We were the first black group that a lot of the, the teachers at Englewood faced.  And they made a lot of assumptions about us that was not true.  I mean, you know, we made believers out of a whole bunch of people, because we were a very bright class.  I mean, come on, you know, where the hell do they think we come from, the cotton fields?  I mean, you know, everybody's not down and out.  This is ridiculous.  So, once we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you had majority white faculty at Englewood.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: And they were holdovers for when Englewood was, was one of the--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --pre, pre, pre--
Speaker 2: See, Englewood changed--
Speaker 1: --premier high schools--
Speaker 2: --quickly.
Speaker 1: --in the city.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: It was.
Speaker 2: --you know.  And, but once we kind of helped them to understand that they really didn't have to back up any, you know, they could teach whatever way they wanted to.  I mean, we were a very receptive group.  The, particularly the older ones, older teachers, ended up to be quite, quite helpful to a lot of us, you know, kind of took us under their wing.  You know, at first they were (makes sound), but you know, they, they softened up.  And we began to get in young black teachers as well, which was--so then you're, you're trying to see who can get in whose class, you know.  But by the time you're an upperclassmen, most of the new ones coming in are teaching freshmen, you know.  But they were marvelous.  We had marvelous teaching.
Story_ID: 608049
Speaker 1: So when you were a senior [at Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois], did you have an idea of what you wanted to be--I mean what your future occupation was gonna be (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I knew that I wanted to major in political science, okay.  I mean, I hadn't thought a lot about working at the UN [United Nations] much 'cause folks just kept telling me I was nuts, you know, about that.  So I just thought I would get a degree in political science and see what happens.  You know, it's funny.  In those days, if you got a degree, didn't necessarily have to get a job in the area where you got your degree.  I mean, jobs were so plentiful then, you know.  So, you know, it's kind of like on your way to somewhere, you run into a job, you know, or somebody calls and say, "How would you like to--?"  So, you know, you just kind of start--you stumble into jobs.
Speaker 1: Now, now were you aware of, of Ralph Bunche--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in, in those, in those days, I mean?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Absolute--well, I would say that southern people probably gathered information about famous black people probably more than city people did.  I mean, we just savored people like Ralph Bunche, you know, all of those kind of--Roy Wilkins, I mean, you know, all of those kind of guys.
Speaker 1: Do you think it's because we had our own schools and, and which could confirm I guess the importance of someone?
Speaker 2: I don't know if it's so much that I think that helped, but I, I think it's, it's word of mouth, Ebony, you know, people talking about it--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --about them.
Speaker 1: I guess that what I'm saying is that the, if you're in a white school, you're teacher, chances are probably wouldn't recognize--
Speaker 2: I see.  Right, right.
Speaker 1: --Ralph Bunche or--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: --or, or even recognize the importance of a black person.
Speaker 2: Also, both in Mississippi and in Memphis [Tennessee], we celebrated certain kinds of things now.  There we had what we call May Fete.
Speaker 1: May Fete?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, what's?
Speaker 2: M-A-Y, F-E-T-E, and it was on May Day, the first of May.  And we would start with a, they call it a maypole, where everybody is going in and out with all of these long ribbons of crepe paper; people are singing; people are dancing; and people are giving speeches by famous black folks, okay.  So you learned that way as well.  There are pictures around.  I never shall forget when I was in high school Ebony did a whole thing of Sojourner Truth.  They did a whole portfolio of, of black leaders, pictures of black leaders.  I, I believe I still have them, you know.
Speaker 1: Probably something that [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett did?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --guess, yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this--was there any other--any formal black history instruction that you, you had outside of--
Speaker 2: I've always been--
Speaker 1: --Mississippi?
Speaker 2: --a, a reader, okay, so I must say that the Toni Morrisons of the world, the Ralph Ellisons of the world, that just, they nourished me in terms of, of, of my own thirst for, for information.  So I've always been looking for books about us.  I went to Africa to explore us.
Speaker 1: Okay, now I'm gonna get to that.
Speaker 2: All right (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 608050
Speaker 1: In high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois], then you were thinking about going into political science?
Speaker 2: Right, but, but, but you know, I didn't want to teach.  I, I just thought I, I just didn't want to teach at all.  It had nothing to do with people that I'd had.  I just thought it was--people were doing other things, you know.  I could work for civil service, you know.  But I took the exam and did very well on civil service.  I could stay there for life, you know.  And there were just other kinds of things opening up.
Speaker 1: Now, now, did you have good counseling, or did you apply for scholarships or anything like that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, let me put it another way.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Not--yes, to that, but we didn't really have good counselors.  But I had good teachers who made sure that those of us who were eligible got what we needed in terms of counseling and advice (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now what did the counselor actually tell you?
Speaker 2: Oh, the counselors (laughter), they (laughter), the one I had, okay, 'cause different--I was P, you know, so she had the Ps and, and whoever.  And she just kind of clumped around with her stockings rolled and, and wanted to know: "Did you fill out your forms?" you know, and, "What forms?"  She didn't tell you nothing.  She was not helpful at all.  And she would tell you, "I don't care.  I got mine."  Yeah, she would, she would, she would.  We had a lot of teachers like that, I mean, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I've heard that phrase in school too.  I was wondering what that--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, sure, oh, sure.  You know, I even heard it in college, you know.  And I thought, well, whoever came down here depending on you to get theirs, I mean, you know, is making a mistake anyway, so.  But, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We didn't have a good counseling.  I mean, you know, our group, we all got what I would say would be moderate scholarships.  But the academic background of our groups in high school, I think, would have merited much, much better situation, you know.  We weren't even introduced to ways to, to get it done.  I got one through the AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Was that--
Speaker 2: And that was simply because some--a teacher was an AKA.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was a--was that a scholarship to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Northern Illinois University [DeKalb, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Northern Illinois.
Speaker 2: Well, I could have gone to any of the state places.
Speaker 1: So did you--
Speaker 2: You just kind--
Speaker 1: --go to Northern?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Came flying out of there, man.  It was, ooh.  There were twelve blacks at--well, we aren't--am I in college yet?  I'm still in high school, am I?
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, we get--we're, we're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We can kind of bounce--
Speaker 1: --trying to make it.
Speaker 2: --back and forth.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But--
Story_ID: 608051
Speaker 1: Is there something you want to tell us about graduation from, from high school or, or anything else about high school--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --before we move you?
Speaker 2: --only--there's nothing special about our graduation.  I mean, you know, we, we were a verbal group, so I think they were also good and ready to see us go.  They couldn't just tell us anything.  You know, so we were aggressive as a group of, of graduating students.  But it was--I don't know what came after us, but we, we did Englewood [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] proud when, when we left.  I mean, you know, we'd really considered the school.  We liked the school.  We'd represented the school, at least in, in activities from, from the gym side basically where I did things.  I was not on the debate team.  I, I don't know (laughter).  Probably should have been, but wasn't my, wasn't my thing.  So, Englewood was really proud of us, but I think they were glad to see us go too, because we were--we talked back.
Speaker 1: What'd you--did you ever get in trouble for talking back?
Speaker 2: No, no.  We didn't do that kind of talking back, you know.  We just tried to challenge them on ideas.  You know, we weren't sassy in, in a disobeying adults kind of way.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: You couldn't get away with that.  They'd suspend you, man.  And in those days, you know, being suspended was an, a shame, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, nine- 1957, that's when you graduated.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The, the--and several things going on.  The Civil Rights Movement is really kicking off.
Speaker 2: Was just getting kicking off, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Montgomery Bus Boycott started in '56 [1956] I think or so, and then it was over by '57 [1957].
Speaker 2: Well, the civ--whole civil rights thing was basically still down south, you know.
Speaker 1: And rock and roll was hitting--
Speaker 2: Yeah.	Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the radios.  And you still didn't have V, VON [WVON Radio, Chicago, Illinois] here, did you?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, not then, okay.
Speaker 2: No, no.  I was trying to think of, the other day, the name of the station that we had because, you know, it was just a black station.  I couldn't think of it, but it was before VON.
Speaker 1: So did, did you like the new music.  I mean, the music--
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I loved it.  I always loved music.  But down south, you know, people don't like kids singing.  I don't know what that's about.  You know, I got in a little trouble.  I, I can't sing, but I do, you know.  And Louis Jordan is somebody I just loved him when I was a kid, man, you know.  And I'd be around there singing, and my mother [Mattie Williams Pitchford], man, oh, my god, they thought it was grown folks music.  You can't do that.
Speaker 1: Oh, the, the lyrics didn't--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't know what--
Speaker 1: And you didn't understand what he was saying?
Speaker 2: Oh no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Saturday Night Fish Fry,' the joint was dropping (laughter).  I just loved it, you know, so, always have, still do--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: So did--were you, were you recognized at graduation for, in any way, or were you--
Speaker 2: No.  We--not--well, I'm, I'm trying to see did we have anything to be--
Speaker 1: Now were you a member of the National Honor Society--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when you a, a senior?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: --that's pretty--
Speaker 2: --there was nothing to be--they didn't recognize us for anything.
Speaker 1: Did you have like a valedictorian and a--
Speaker 2: Well, yes.
Speaker 1: --and all that?
Speaker 2: We had, we had a, a salutatorian and a valedictorian, which I was neither (laughter), yeah.  But aside from that, nobody--and the treasurer presented the gift from our class to the school, and then the read our names off.
Speaker 1: Okay, they--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what, what was the gift?
Speaker 2: I don't even remember.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: I swear I don't.  I think it was a plaque of some kind, but I don't even remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  I suspect it got destroyed when the school, when they tore the school--you know, the fact that they tore Englewood down is amazing to me.
Speaker 1: Yes, now there's a--yeah, the old school has been (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, they're getting ready--
Speaker 1: --torn down.
Speaker 2: --to tear that down too.
Story_ID: 608052
Speaker 1: So you went to--that summer, you know, what did you do that summer before you went to--
Speaker 2: Worked.
Speaker 1: --Northern [Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois]?  Worked, okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  But I worked mostly through high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] as well, worked at Mercy Hospital [Mercy Hospital and Medical Center]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in the nuns.  That's when I found out they're not--they're a little mean too sometimes.  But in the nuns' dining room, it was nice.  If I would have been a Catholic, I would have gone to a Catholic college.  They wanted me--they wanted to send me to (laughter) Catholic college so bad.
Speaker 1: Now, now where is Mercy Hospital in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: 26th [Street] in, in--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --what's that?  It ain't Michigan [Avenue], but it's over, over that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: That's, that's actually near, near, near Michael Reese?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Near Michael Reese Hospital [Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois], okay.
Speaker 2: I used to get up at four o'clock in the morning, man.
Speaker 1: In high school, in, in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, to go to work on the weekends.
Speaker 1: Oh, on weekends, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, you know, in those days they monitored.  You couldn't--you had to have a work permit to work, and you could only work so many hours, you know, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you'd work Saturday and Sunday?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  And during the summer I could work in the, in the evenings.  I used to work four to seven, you know.  Nuns were good.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Most of them.
Story_ID: 608053
Speaker 1: Well, Northern Illinois [Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois], I take it you didn't like it.
Speaker 2: I didn't.  Well, number one, it, there were just twelve black students, you know, which really just kind of blew my mind.  I mean, I'd never thought about it like that.  But I found the faculty--I, I was not gonna survive there.  I mean, racism was like cornflakes--
Speaker 1: Now was--
Speaker 2: --both from the student body as well as faculty.  And you know, I was really naive, because I assumed that in a university, you wouldn't these kinds of issues.  I have no idea why I thought that.
Speaker 1: What happened?  Is there a story about--give, give us an example of what--
Speaker 2: English, let's just take English.  I'm gonna even call his name.  His name is Dr. Burton [ph.], and he walks in class saying that blacks can't speak English and probably won't pass.  I mean, he just walks in class saying that.
Speaker 1: And says this?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, you know, and I'm going, what are you talking about, you know?  But you couldn't, I mean, you really couldn't pursue this kind of line of, of, of talking.  You know, you couldn't talk back the way students do now.  You know, it wasn't (laughter), the academy ain't that free, you know.  It's freer now, but--and that--there were lots of teachers like that, lots.
Speaker 1: So would actually come in and just open up with--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely, sure, you know.  And he wasn't Catholic either.  I mean, blacks were not the only ones; he was prejudiced as well.  I mean, you know, he'd, he'd tell joke, dirty jokes and stuff.  I mean, he was awful.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: You know, but that wasn't really--I mean, it--my energy didn't fit.  There's just something about that.  I just, from the minute I got there, I just wanted to go.  And I knew that eventually I, you know, I really would.  My grades were suffering.  It, it was just not a good situation.  But you know, I knew that hook or crook, I had to finish college, but I was gonna go somewhere else.  I was gonna--
Speaker 1: So did, but did you transfer to--
Speaker 2: I came back to--I came back and I worked for a while, and then I went to Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 608054
Speaker 1: I like, basically, I really liked Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois], because, with the exception of one professor, you know, the schools--it was a lot of turmoil in the schools when I went back.  You know, folks were acting out something terrible in the colleges and stuff.
Speaker 2: So about, about, 'bout what year was it when you went back to Roosevelt?
Speaker 1: We talking about maybe '62 [1962].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Stuff was really hopping.  And the only issue I had at Roosevelt was, and, and this is worth mentioning--I had a lit [literature] class.  And at this point, I am working full time, so, I mean, come on.  You know, I'm working all day and coming to school and--
Speaker 2: So what, what, what were you doing (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was working for Head Start.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, it wasn't really Head Start yet.  I was working for a research project, but it was, it was at that level, you know, with little kids.  I never thought I'd like working with little kids, but I got to absolutely love it.  And we were asking why weren't there at least some kind of, of, of books recommended for our reading that involved black folks, you know.  So the woman said she wasn't trained to teach black lit, so she wasn't including it in her syllabus, you know.  And I said, and you know, I did say something to her.  And we just kind of ended up requesting that the dean come down and at least listen to our complaints, and he did, you know.  Whether anything ever happened about it, I don't know.  You know, you move on.  But I was at a very different place in my, in my life.  I knew I needed to finish school, and I was just much more mature, I mean, you know.  But you know, I've kind of been a--well, my friends call me a gypsy in, in some kind of ways, even though I'm not sure that, that I am.  But I, I liked to move around a lot.  I'm, I'm stable in some sense, but the world just seems to beckon.  You know, I just want to go places and do things, you know, and experience things, so.
Story_ID: 608055
Speaker 1: Were you married in between this time?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got married in 1960.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Tell us how you met your hu- your husband [Warner Jolly].
Speaker 2: I met him through a cousin some years earlier, and we were playing a little tennis.  You know, we--actually met him before I even looked at him.  You understand what I'm--you know.  And we used to play a little tennis, you know.  And because we know each other's family from down, from Memphis [Tennessee], not from Mississippi, but, but from Memphis.  And it just kind of--he seemed kind of a perfect kind of a person to me, not too aggressive, quiet enough, 'cause I don't, you know, no so much mouth running, gentle person.  We got married in '60 [1960], and I'm going ooh because I'm a roadrunner, and he's not.  And it became a real issue and, but I really--if, if I'm fair to myself and to speaking, I would say that I simply ran into a situation at a certain point in my marriage where I no longer wanted to be married, knew I wasn't going to remarry again, because I just want to do what I want to do.  And that feeling is stronger than I can do away with it, you know.  I, I just never had any intentions of, of living my life in a way where I die regretting things, you know, so, wasn't working.  And after nine years I just, I just woke up one morning--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were married 'til 1969.
Speaker 2: I was married nine years, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I--my husband was surprised.  I mean, we didn't really have a whole lot of problems, except this underlying problem was serious, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we couldn't work around it.
Speaker 1: Did you have any children?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which made it, I think, easier, even though I did tell myself at the time it wouldn't have matter if I'd had seven.  We'd have just (laughter), you know, I'd just grabbed them up.  We are still friends.  I mean, we're not, we're not enemies.  We, I think we really--he really understands that I just couldn't stay in one place, I mean, you know.

Speaker 1: Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois], 1962.  So, so you, you were just telling us off camera that you, you, you're a collector of things and--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, goodness (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you, were you collecting in those days, too?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've, I've--every--since I--my first paycheck as a person working I started collecting music.  I started collecting all of the jazz female singers and many of the male singers too, 'cause Coltrane [John Coltrane] and all those dudes, you know, I really like them.  Then it moved to African masks.  You know, I was just really--I always thought we all are multi-personality, you know, and we all wear a mask.  So I used to collect mas--African masks, you know.  And then I went to Africa, and I had more money, so I started collecting African sculptures.  But after a while, when I got into art personally and professionally, I started collecting from the American side, you know.  First I used buy--I got a lot of junk 'cause I used to buy every black piece of art that I could afford, right.  Then you learn how to begin to make your collection better, you know.  So, I just, I collect and of my own stuff as well, everything that's in the house.  When it comes upstairs, we call that the upstairs art.  When it comes upstairs out of the studio downstairs or from the university [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois], it's here to stay.  It ain't--it's, it's, it's, that's done.  It's mine.
Speaker 1: When it comes upstairs (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, this, this is upstairs art, you know, so.  But I still do a little ceramics.  I try to get one piece, you know, a year.  And I go to auctions and stuff and see what I can afford, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is a constant process of doing it, of, of collecting and--
Speaker 2: I love the process of, of collecting.  And I--there are some people who are working now that's important, you know.  I collect Joanne Scott.  There's a young woman named Rhonda Wheatley that I happen to think--I try to collect now not just what I like, but what I also deem to be--will be an important part of the art movement as it, as it goes forward.  You see students who are extraordinary, yet have no intentions (laughter) of doing art, you know.  They might be like me.  They might come back to it middle age or something, you know.  Hell, I was fort-five.
Speaker 1: Now, now when--
Speaker 2: I haven't always been an artist.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you started really when you were forty-five--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah, you entered really taking art seriously.
Speaker 2: Right.  I mean, I've been piddling around--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --with art all of my life.  But--
Story_ID: 608057
Speaker 1: Let's go back to Ro- let's go, go, go to Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois] and we catch up--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --with this.  Now, now--
Speaker 2: Well, I'm piddling around a little bit when I'm at--
Speaker 1: When you're at Roosevelt.
Speaker 2: --Roosevelt.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But just stuff at home, you know.
Speaker 1: You're taking political science?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --who are your teachers there at Roosevelt?  Roosevelt's a progressive kind of school, so.
Speaker 2: Sure, but all the big time folks was gone by, by the early '60s [1960s].  St. Clair Drake and all of them, they were gone.  You know, Harold Washington, all of them, you know, they came through there.
Speaker 1: Was Charles Hamilton [Charles V. Hamilton] there?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He, he, he--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --he was still there.
Speaker 2: I knew Charles Hamilton--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Cause actually, that first job I was telling you about at U of C [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], that, the research project.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Charles Hamilton was one of the people consulting with Paul Scott Strobeck [ph.] on that project.  They were doing something with kids and, and parents, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But yeah, but he was one of the few.  And you know, Charles was more on the quiet side.  He was quieter than Harold and you know, they're big-mouth folks (laughter), you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) [HistoryMaker] Gus Savage and Harold Washington--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --all of them.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But see, they, they--it was time for them to move on.  They'd gotten involved in some other stuff, you know, so.
Speaker 1: So, so you think that Roosevelt had kind of died down a little bit when you got there, but--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  It, it died down altogether, actually.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I happen to think Harold--if, if, if my reading is right on Roosevelt, Harold Washington and his group, when they left Roosevelt, and I'm not quite sure when it was, when Gus Savage, when all of them left Roosevelt, things were just really, really, really quieted, because also professors left, you know, and went to other places.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And keep in mind that I, I wasn't there a lot during the day, 'cause often when things happened on campus, it's daytime, you know.  Not a--the evenings are much more--much quieter.  Even if you start around three or four [o'clock], it's still much quieter.
Speaker 1: So we--you working full time on this research project at that point?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and it was, was stationed--you were headquartered at the University--versity of Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  We were--as a matter of fact, I, I always smile.  You know where they built the bowling alley [Seven Ten Lanes, Chicago, Illinois]?  Right in back of there used to be, you know, use--the University of Chicago operates in a lot of houses.  And we had this wonderful old, big hou- red house we used to, we worked in.  That's where the project was, you know.
Story_ID: 608058
Speaker 1: That period is, is a period where, you know, I'm kind of tossing a lot of stuff around: you know, what do you want to do?  What--you know, a job is one thing, but what do you want to do?  And being an artist, I don't think it's an accident, but I stumbled into it because I used to make stuff.  And you know, I told you I used to give it away?  Well, at work, I worked, was working for a health planning agency in their community organizing wing, you know.  I've, I've always kind of messed around with community organizing.  And people used to argue about who was gonna get a piece of art--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that I made, you know.  And so I thought, well, now, well, maybe I ought to just sell them to y'all.  So I started, you know--
Speaker 2: So where, where was--
Speaker 1: --ten dollars for this one.
Speaker 2: Yeah, where were you--
Speaker 1: That health--Cook County, Cook-DuPage County Health Systems Agency [Suburban Cook-DuPage County Health Systems Agency].
Speaker 2: In, in about--
Speaker 1: And it was located in Oak Park [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah. About what year is this?
Speaker 1: This is--I know specifically.  This is '75 [1975], and this around--
Speaker 2: Seventy-five [1975]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay, so you--your, your--most, well, a lot of your early adult life was spent working in--
Speaker 1: This--absolutely.
Speaker 2: --agencies, not-for-profit--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --a, agencies.
Speaker 1: Yes, not, not-for-profit agencies, with either extremely poor project-type families and small children.  You know, all the things that I said I was not going to do, I ended up doing.
Speaker 2: Okay, so let me just get some dates straight now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 2: You, you graduated from Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: For we--
Speaker 2: Did, did you graduate from Roosevelt or--
Speaker 1: Yes, I did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I was doing all of this stuff before I even got the degree.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because--so let's just take the years from '60 [1960] to '66 [1966] maybe, okay, because the degree was uneventful.  I'm mean, I shamed to say I didn't even bother to go.  Be--it was a means to an end about a job.  You know, my job wanted me to do that.  And I stayed in Head Start in one capacity or another.  I started out teaching, but I mostly spent the time as an administrator in couple of different capacities until the mid-'70s [1970s], you know.  And in the mid-'70s [1970s], we tried something.  It's still connected to community development.  And we took a project, I did--in charge of a project, we took the Harvey [Illinois], Markham [Illinois], Phoenix [Illinois], Dixmoor [Illinois]--it was about six little collar counties out there.  And what we--
Speaker 2: South suburbs, yeah, that, that have--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the south suburb--
Speaker 2: --a lot, lot, lot of black people.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what we wanted was for me to try to coordinate services.  If those groups, those little cities would work together, they could get far more done than everybody trying to do it.  It's yeoman's job.  I mean, it (laughter), it was really, really, really a tough, tough, tough sale.  And I simply got sick of it and went to the health systems agency, which was a whole 'nother ball game.  This was just organizing around health care.  And this really wasn't about black people.  This was about everybody.  We had regents everywhere: north, south, east, and west.  I had north and south.  And what I used to do is, again, coordinate community groups, hospitals, and I was the staff person for some of their committees.  And we used to present proposals to them and those kinds of things.  That's tough, too, because the big boys were playing in that, the hospital people.  And you know, you fix one thing with this hand, and they undo it with the other, because they had no intentions of really working to- working together.  But that's where the art really started kind of seeping through.
Story_ID: 608059
Speaker 1: And in 1980, Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] was elected.  He defunded everything I was associated with.  He just didn't fund them.  He didn't take the laws off the books, but he just didn't fund them.  And I made a really curious decision.  I got laid off, because they laid--the whole plant went under.  The whole planning agency [Suburban Cook-DuPage County Health Systems Agency] went under, but the community wing went first, right.  So I'm going, how could a person with a master's degree be unemployed?  I mean, how does that happen?  And so I said well, god, I guess it's time for me to do my art, and that's what I turned my attention to.  And that summer I got a call from Chicago State University [Chicago, Illinois] saying that their ceramics teacher was now the professional for the--halftime--for the union, the professional association for faculty.  And they needed someone to teach ceramics; was I available?  Well--
Speaker 2: Well, had you taught ceramics before?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: So, but you had been a student at, in, in, in ceramics?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Where did you do your ceramic work?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) At home in my kitchen.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I mean, so--
Speaker 1: You know, but I, I'd taken class.
Speaker 2: --how would you make your-
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: Did, did you have a kiln?  Did you buy a kiln?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't at that point, okay.  So, but once that happened, I knew that I need to do some whole different kinds of stuff.  I had a friend who used to fire stuff for me, okay, and if you take a class, you could use their equipment.  So basically, that's what I was doing.  So now, not only do I not know how to fire an oven, 'cause someone else is doing it, I haven't a clue about a lot of the chemistry of ceramics, like making glazes, 'cause you know, you, you, you, you work in a, a university, you're running a laboratory, you know.  It ain't the park district.  So--but I've always been one who believed that when a job walks in, you have a responsibility to meet it.  So, I took it.  And I worked as a part timer or four years.  And Dolores Cross [HistoryMaker Dolores E. Cross] became the president of Chicago State, and she sent for me and asked if I was interested in being a full time person, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, this is 19--where would--
Speaker 1: This is--
Speaker 2: Is it mid-'80s [1980s] or later?
Speaker 1: This is the mid-'80s [1980s], but I'm mean some years--we're, we're heading towards the '90s [1990s] now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I, I misspeaking.
Speaker 2: So when did you--
Speaker 1: Dolores didn't come in until, until the '90s [1990s].  But I am now being prepped to apply for full time, which I'm rejecting.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, now when did you start teaching part, part time in Chicago?
Speaker 1: Eighty, in eighty-six [1986].
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-six [1986].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You were teaching ceramics?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And learning right along with the students (laughter).
Story_ID: 608060
Speaker 1: And I worked as a part timer until '89 [1989], but a lot of different things were happening.  But that's the only thing you need to know.  And we were changing presidents, you know.  We had a couple of them during that period of time.  Ayers [George E. Ayers] was, was one, and he left, and then we had some interim folks, you know.  Chicago State was a mess.  Let's just put it like that.  And I didn't--I was debating whether or not--I have a tendency to really get hooked into things.  So I was debating whether or not I am going to get hooked into teaching at Chicago State, I mean, because tenure track, I don't know what people think tenure track is, but that's a lot of work and a lot of documentation.  So I just kept saying no.  I just kept saying no.  And in 1990, when Dolores Cross [HistoryMaker Dolores E. Cross] came, that's when the talks got really, really serious.  We didn't have a lot of--people didn't know this, but the bulk of Chicago State's faculty was also white up until the early '90s [1990s], you know.  And then it was about 60/40 [percent], maybe, black/white.  It, it made a flip-flop, but even now.  I think there are some advantages to it; I mean, I really do.  I think that students really ought to be exposed to a lot of different kind of teachers.  And the ones that--we kind of hung on to the ones that want to be there.  The ones who don't are gone, you know.  They kind of get tenure, and then they go someplace else.  But when she came and talked to me about it, you know, I began to soften a bit, you know.  And I thought, oh, man, here we go.  But, you know, I made the commitment, and it is absolutely the best decision I've ever made, even though I swore (laughter) on my mother's [Mattie Williams Pitchford] grave I would never teach.  Yet, that is--but my friends say that it is--God's punishing me by making me teach because I used to pick on them so much, you know.  They were teachers, and I just laughed at them, (laughter) you know.  So--and at Chicago State, you know, when we were going away, when were all graduating from Englewood [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] if they were going to Chicago Teachers College [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois], you know, we just thought, ah, anybody can go to Chicago Teachers College, you know.  And the fact that I end up being a professor at Chicago Teachers College, they just see it as an absolute justice, you know.  And perhaps it is, because I, I just--but I love it.  It's been a wonderful--you learn so much from students, you know.  And particularly as a, as a professional artist, they approach and do things and create art in ways that, you know, I never thought about, you know.  And I'll go like, oh, I'm taking that (laughter), you know.
Story_ID: 608061
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now you, you were a part of this overall movement in black art, basically--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --even, even when you weren't teaching--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you were, you were a part of the cultural--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure. Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --the cultural scene in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  Well, see, I was--I did two things.  Once I decided that I was going to not just be coming at it from the collector's side, I became a member of the board of, of South Side Community Art Center [Chicago, Illinois], which is the oldest WPA [Works Progress Administration] center around.  It's one of the few that survived, actually.
Speaker 1: When did you become a member of that?
Speaker 2: Whoo, whoo, whoo--
Speaker 1: I mean board member there
Speaker 2: See, I went over there in the '60s [1960s] when they didn't even open every day.  And I started--as a matter of fact, me and [HistoryMaker] Jonathan Green--I don't know if that's a name you've heard.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yes, the, the painter.
Speaker 2: Me and Jonathan Green, we were the ones basically who cleaned up the basement at the South Side Community Art Center to teach some classes, to teach students.  I get years mixed up.  That must have been in the '80s [1980s].  And I just, you know, helped around the center and taught and then became a board member.  Centers, art centers, community centers, those kinds of places just drain you.  You know, you can work and work, but getting anything accomplished is a real mark of something, I mean, you know.  'Cause meetings go on and on, and everybody wants their opinion heard, and you don't get an awful lot done.  So what I said to them was, "I'll tell you what you do: whatever you want me to do for you, just call me and let me know, 'cause I just can't come and sit up at these meetings."  So we kind of have that relationship, that if there is a project, they want me to lecture or any of those kinds of things, I will do it.  And I had a one woman show there last October, because the center is important.  It's important that it survives and it's vibrant again.  Faheem [Faheem Majeed], the young man who's there, is good for the center.  You know, a lot of people have not been good for the center, some of it 'cause they just didn't know what they were doing.  They were kind of out of place.  But--and Diane Carr [Diane Dinkins Carr], they both I think do a, a good job in keeping the arts alive.  But I still have issues with art centers that rely on artists for so much of their resources, you know.  I donate an awful lot of, of art, and it just--and I lecture about it sometimes because I think that we are taken for granted.  I think we permit it, and I think we shouldn't.  There is a growing belief that the way one makes money in art is to have an auction or something like that, you know, and ask the artists to donate their work.  And it's, it's a habit that concerns me, and I might do much more about it when I, when I retire.  One of the things being and artist and teaching full time has taught me is that I really have to monitor my time.  I try not to get involved in frivolous arguments or projects.  I, you know, if I do something I want it to, to have some meaning, you know.  But I love the center.  I'm, I'm always involved in the, in the center, other things around.
Story_ID: 608062
Speaker 1: And I'm the founder of Sapphire and Crystals.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now when was this founded?
Speaker 1: I always have to--
Speaker 2: Or roughly.
Speaker 1: Eighty-six [1986].  Let's just say around '86 [1986].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Might not be the exact year.  But I decided to do art in '82 [1982], okay.  But I'm just piddling at, at this point.  But I've really made a decision, because I've decided I'm not going to go back to work, right.  I'm going to do, going to do art.  This is all around '82 [1982].  But around '86 [1986]--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: All right, well, we were talking about South Side Community Art Center [Chicago, Illinois] and about arts organizations and how you, you formed Sapphire and--
Speaker 1: Sapphire and Crystal.
Speaker 2: --Crystals.
Speaker 1: It had to be around 1986.  And this was the deal.  I'd been, you know, kind of messing around with, with my own art, but not going in any particular--I mean was in no rush to do any--I didn't really know which way I really wanted to go.  And I ran into some people who said, you know, "We would like to have some of your art."  And I thought, well, everything I've ever done--I needed a support group.  So I just started asking all of the artists--I only knew painters, you know.  And I started asking if anybody knew any ceramic artists, females, basically, and if they do, have them call me, you know.  And a couple of people called, but more people called who were just painters and drawers, you know, just regular visual artists.  And so I decided, well, you know, I can't find any other folks like myself.  I found an older woman who did clay, but that's it, you know.  So, I formed this group.  I decided what I would do was put together a group who could--who were professional.  That was the first criterion that they had to be professional.  The second criterion was they had to be capable of underwriting our own--because what we were going getting to do is to exhibit as a group of women and document all of those exhibitions, you know, have at least one every year, have standards, and people have to pay.  We split up the amount of money and divided between the number of folks who's going to be in the exhibition.  We'd do our own catalogs.  And my purpose was to assist people who might have skills in all of these various areas, because they're really needed.  Documentation of, of art period but African American art I mean really needs--and one person can't do all of that stuff.  You know, you just have to motivate folks.
Story_ID: 608063
Speaker 1: And the greatest issue is what I thought it would be.  It's two-fold.  One is people are cheap.  They, they don't like to spend money to get their--themselves ready for something, in terms of art.  And the, the second is this whole thing about standards, you know.  Some people have an idea: if it's art, it's fine; you know, that's all it needs to be, is just art.  And I don't have that idea.  I don't believe that, you know.  And if it's true, then give it to the group who believes that.  I'm not into showing.  What I want to show is a group of women who are serious about their art.  That's the first thing, and number two, who are going to get better, you know, and what's going to learn about, and who's going to leave the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  Trying to get African American artists off the South Side to exhibit other places is extremely difficult, or was, you know.  People--rejection is a huge part of being an artist, 'cause they will tell you in a minute, "No thank you. We had a lot of wonderful entries, and you are not selected this time."  You know, you get a lot of those kind of letters, and you just keep going.  And that's what Sapphire and Crystals is about.  It's about the documentation of a visual artist.  I need--it needs to be broadened because I'd love to get someone who's majoring in art history to do their theses around African American women artists in Chicago [Illinois], go back through [HistoryMaker] Margaret Burroughs and that whole group, [HistoryMaker] Elizabeth Catlett.  All those people come from here, you know.  And, but it's not well documented who came before us.  And you know, I'd love to be able to even provide some funding for students to try to look at things like that.
Speaker 2: Now did you know Elizabeth Catlett growing up here?
Speaker 1: Yes--no, well--
Speaker 2: You--
Speaker 1: --just kind of.  But, I mean, I don't know her to walk in to say, "Hey, Elizabeth, how you doing?"  But we've been in the same company a number of times.  She's one of my absolute favorite artists, you know.
Speaker 2: And, and did you know Marion Perkins when, when he was--
Speaker 1: Not at all--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --not at all.  I know Toussaint--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know.  I know Marion.  He has a--
Speaker 2: And Marion was, was--
Speaker 1: --granddaughter.
Speaker 2: --was, was a sculptor.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Marion Perkins--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: --who--
Speaker 1: I, I know who he was, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm just saying it for the camera, for the--
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: --the, the--
Speaker 1: I see, yeah.
Speaker 2: --re- recording to make sure people know.
Speaker 1: He died quite some time ago, didn't he?
Speaker 2: He was the father of Useni [HistoryMaker Useni Eugene Perkins] and Toussaint Perkins.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  And Marian Perkins [Marian E. Perkins], who's a woman, teaches at Chicago State University.  She's the granddaughter.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's another Marion.  Oh, really, of--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah, she's in criminal justice.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.  But it's about, with me, it has always been about you can't just go through this, you know.  We are gonna have to leave some kind of track, some kind of trail of things that we, that we have done.  So most of our exhibitions have a catalog that accompany them and, and it--an invitation to artists.  And that's documentation.  I mean, you know, at least we were there.  I, you know, I, I just want--what we do is, I just wanna say we were there.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, now, how have things gone since the group was founded in 1986?
Speaker 1: Oh, it's wonderful.
Speaker 2: Do you, do, do you exhibit every year?
Speaker 1: Yes, and when--and sometimes more than one.  I'm not as in the forefront as Joyce Owens [HistoryMaker Joyce Owens Anderson].  I, I suspect that's a name you--I don't know if it's a name you know, but she's a visual artist who's a curator at Chicago State now.  But she has taken--the other thing was to develop some leadership, and she has taken tremendous amount of, of leadership on.  Not everybody wants to be a leader, you know.  I used to think they did, but (laughter) they don't, you know, (laughter).
Story_ID: 608064
Speaker 1: Now, we were talking about Sapphire and Crystal.  And, and so you've exhibited every year and the group has (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely and--
Speaker 1: --gotten young leadership now.  It's been developed to--
Speaker 2: We, we have young participation, not so much leadership.  What I find is that artists, like other groups, let whoever wants to do it, do it, you know (laughter).  So, Joyce [HistoryMaker Joyce Owens Anderson] basically is--and people will volunteer now to do--but it's exhibit by exhibit, and it's not ongoing.  I'm in it for the long haul.  If it ain't enough money, I got to come up with money.  You know, it's--I have to do all the cleanup stuff.  But there are really good people in it.  And our whole thing is, number one, if you're gonna stay, you have to be concerned about standards, you know.  And that means that you can't have raggedy frames.  You cannot--stuff must be finished appropriately, you know.  This isn't, this isn't a--I hate to pick on the park district [Chicago Park District], but, I mean, you know, it's just not--and I have to make those decisions.  You know, they are tough.  I've got folks who would love to kick my butt, you know, but I'll take a piece down the day of the show.  I mean, it, it's just, it just isn't going to be.  And we always think, well, why do you make us do this?  Because you know that this piece is not proper, kind of thing.  But it's been, it's been really good in helping people, number one, to get comfortable exhibiting.  For a lot of people exhibiting is a scary, scary thing, because you're turning your work over to someone else to make decisions about it, you know, and we basically say yay or nay, you know.  I've been involved with Black Creativity, too for, off and on for quite a while and trying to get them to be mindful.
Speaker 1: Now that's, for those who are listening, Black Creativity is the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Black Creativity is an, an annual show that is well sponsored by the Museum of Science and Industry [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And it occurs during Black History Month every year, starting late January, you know.  And it's a good show, but I would like to see them pay more attention to--I think that every venue that an artist has ought to force the artist to be the best that they can be.  And not all of them do that, you know, but--
Speaker 1: Now, were you a member of African American artist roundtable and the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yes.  But, you know--
Speaker 1: I know you're a member of the African American Arts Alliance [African American Arts Alliance of Chicago] years ago--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the, the--
Speaker 2: Right, right, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --NCA, National Conference of Artists.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes.  As, and, you know, we're not as, as active as I would like, you know.  I think it goes in spurts.  I think in the sixty--the '70s [1970s] it was very, very active.  The '80s [1980s] everybody just kind of, I guess, cooled down a bit.  And--
Speaker 1: This is with the--
Speaker 2: The Alliance.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's--
Speaker 2: Well, all of that--
Speaker 1: --all, all of those.
Speaker 2: --all of those organizations that you just named, there might be somewhere some local activities, you know.  But a lot of them don't function at, at the national level the way they did early on.  I wish they did, and maybe they will.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The other thing with me is though, I have this tendency if, if I don't think something's going right to try to run it.  And I am in no position to run nothing else.  You know, I don't want to take on anything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and trying to stay out of that dilemma is a real problem for me sometime 'cause, you know, I'm from that school, you, you want it done it right, do it.  Well, I can't always do that.
Story_ID: 608065
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your philosophy of art, now--or, or your art in specific.  What, what--your major medium is ceramics.
Speaker 2: My major medium is clay.
Speaker 1: Clay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Most of what I do is clay.  And what I do to clay is I'm into the surface, how I--I want to make a statement from the surface.  I use clay as a canvas, and I taught myself to draw on clay.  I can do things on clay that I don't think I can do on paper.  I haven't really tried them, but I don't, I'm not sure.  I don't have the confidence that I could, and this is what I wanted to do.  My first story pot is in the corner over there, and I, I had enough sense to keep it.  That hasn't been the case with a lot of other stuff.  But I wanted to write, but never did, never had the disciple or the confidence to do it.  So when I took a ceramics class in my adult life, two things happened.  One is I thought, hm, I could write.  That was my first notion.  I could write my stories on these pots 'cause it's soft, you know, when you first, when you first make it.  And--or I could draw the stories, you know.  So my second pot--my first pot is just, I just drew some things, and they're just hooked up all across this pot.  My second pot is called 'A Letter to the Future' [ph.].  And it is about Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  You know, I tried to put--I did a lot of writing on it: Dr. King is a Nobel laureate.  I just, all of kind of historical factors went on this pot, and I also have that one.  But--and some stuff is very clear.  Other stuff, in terms of the writing, 'cause I wrote with a crayon, and it acts as a, as a, a block-out, but--or--but some of it you can't see.  And I thought that that was fine, too, because history is like that, you know.  As we carry certain things forth, there are other things that are very foggy, you know, and very unclear.  But, and my philosophy is I never liked the story that white folks have told about what it was like--and some black folks too--being black in Mississippi.  And I wanted to write from my family's perspective.  I wanted to do things from the images that I saw there, 'cause I learned to love in Mississippi, you know.  I learned my sense of beauty comes out of Mississippi.  It comes out of a physical, you know, being.  It comes out of parents [Mattie Williams Pitchford and Floyd Pitchford, Sr.].
Story_ID: 608066
Speaker 1: And I felt very strongly about a lot of stuff socially.  It has always pissed me off, racism.  You have no idea, even as a little kid.  You know, I thought, this is stupid.  You know, it just never made sense to me.  And I just wasn't going to go quietly.  And I thought that a lot of the values that, the moral values that I had as a youngster, I thought they were universal, actually.  We weren't taught to do this because this is better for black people.  We were taught to do things because it was better for people period, you know, and to have a very broad thought about how the world runs, you know, not just America even, you know.  And I will take some social issues and have that as a, as subject matter.  For instance, this pot that's over to the right, I did this pot when Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] was going on.  And that's just the name of it, because I hadn't been paying attention because I was busy and hadn't been watching TV or listening to much radio.  And I get up, I ten--I get up four, five o'clock still a lot now.  And I was watching TV, and I couldn't believe it.  I mean, I just could not--you know, I'd heard them talking about there's gonna be a flood and stuff.  But what I was seeing, I just--'cause I saw water full of debris, and I didn't know what the debris was, and then I saw it, you know.  And it just, it just knocked me for a loop.  And I just ate my breakfast and went to the studio and built a pot and painted it, you know.  That's the way I just kind of purged the, the desire to absolutely kill somebody, I mean, you know, just go--I just wanted to go slap George Bush [President George Walker Bush].  That, that's what, you know--like, just shake him, you know.  Now this, this, this, this, you know, man, I know you ain't connected, but (laughter), you know, this is crazy.  This won't work, you know.  So, that's, that, and I'm okay, and--
Speaker 2: So, so you use your, your interest in, in world events and politics--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --inform your art.
Speaker 1: Yes, absolutely.
Story_ID: 608067
Speaker 1: And my interest in people, my interest in the shapes of people, you know.  I am fascinated.  I go to the Point [Promontory Point, Chicago, Illinois], and I just people watch.  You know, I people watch.  People say I stare.  The country people I, I gaze at them.  You know, they (laughter)--but I'm just, I, I--because our bodies say what the deal is, I mean really, you know.  I will do, I do spirit women where the face is the most prominent kind of thing, and, and the body in terms it might be a little lumpy or something, you know.  We just ain't all (gestures and makes sound), you know, and we come packaged all kind of ways, so that informs my art as well and my sense of friendship.  Friendship is critical to me.  They must be nurtured.  My--both of my parents [Mattie Williams Pitchford and Floyd Pitchford, Sr.] had friends, and it's always been important to me.  I have friends that I've had for a very long time, you know.  And I try my best to nurture it, nurture the, you know.  But they'd say I don't visit enough, but that's here nor there.  I'm busy (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 2: So they inspire your work too as well?
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  The way they think, you know, it's, it's sometimes different than the way I think, the way they live their lives, the things that--the obstacles that they have to overcome, the rituals that they have put in place for themselves.  All of those things are, I think they're important because I really believe that how we treat ourselves determines how the world will greet you.  I mean, I believe that.  And it kind of ends up in, in, you know, in my work.
Story_ID: 608068
Speaker 1: I know your story pots are--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --well known.  And are those your favorite works?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That, that's the real stuff.  I do a lot of stuff, and I have a, a studio sale once a year.  And I tell people well, I'm just getting my hands together when I do these kinds of--the vases and the platters and type things that you see around.  But story pots are, are, are what I do.  I'm working on a couple.  I belong to the Hyde Park Arts Center [sic. Hyde Park Art Center, Chicago, Illinois], and they have a program called Not Just a Pretty Face [sic. Not Just Another Pretty Face].  And they give packets of your art to collectors, and the collectors will choose some of the artists.  There's a group of us.  So I have three (laughter) that have chosen for me to do story pots, so I am a very busy woman, you know.  The easy part is done.  I'm making them.  But the tough part is, how do we in- in- introduce color?  My early story pots look like the country in the fall, you know.  I am--I like the barrenness of the fall, when the trees have dropped most of their leaves.  I just--there's something about that.  And the earth, you can see the earth because the grass is dry and everything.  I--and my pots look a lot like that.  In the '90s [1990s] they started to have color.  People used to ask me if I was afraid of color, used to say no, you know.  You see I got--I wear red and all that kind of stuff.  But the message I'm giving is, you know, country life is, is, is wonderful.  I just don't like farming, you know (laughter), but other stuff, I mean, I, I absolutely love it.  I don't know.  Where are we now?  I mean, I don't wanna (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I was, I was just asking you about your artwork.  And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --now you, you've had major ex- exhibitions and--
Speaker 2: I have, yes.
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: And I do two things specifically, and then everything else is kind of meat on the bones, but the meat of my art is story pots and spirit women.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I would add a third one, because there is a whole group of people who flock to this group of work, and they're called friendship bowls.  That's like in honor of my moth- my parents [Mattie Williams Pitchford and Floyd Pitchford, Sr.] really.  But I do different kinds of things with bowls, and they're always open, because friendship must be open, you know.  And sometime the bowls are almost flat.  People say, "Well, this isn't really a bowl."  I'm going, "Yeah, it is; I said it was."  I mean, you know, sometimes friendship is a little flat.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, you have to--
Speaker 1: It's not as deep at other time.
Speaker 2: --read it the way--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, you read it the way you, you, you, you're seeing it.
Story_ID: 608069
Speaker 1: Now you've traveled abroad.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: You mentioned Mexico, Africa, you know.  Did--
Speaker 2: Europe, yeah.
Speaker 1: --those trips--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in, inform your art?
Speaker 2: Some, some.  In this way: Africa was about trying to find me in black folks, you, you understand, and my own history, not specifically where I come from or any of those kinds of things.  I think I'm gonna have to go the DNA route to, to maybe do that, don't even know if I want to know it or not.  But I wanted to know what other black folks were like.  You know, what was, what were black countries like?  What was it like in Africa?  I mean, you know, would there be a different feeling?  So I, I went in '74 [1974].  That was my first trip to West Africa.  And I just remember stepping off the plane and just not, almost not being able to breathe.  And it's my own emotional sense.  It was in Dakar [Senegal].  And it was wonderful because I had a friend who lived there.  She had married someone there.  And so I got a chance to go and meet regular people, you know, and live among regular people at--don't mean to say we lived like the average African.  But at least she moved around with them, and I got a chance to, to really meet a lot.  But it was getting my own soul full, you know, nutrients for my soul.  I, I guess I would say it like that.  In and out, I--number one, I thought Africa was one huge place.  You know, I knew it was countries, but I thought they were all alike, you know.  I used to think the south was all alike.  And it's that broadening that travel will do.  And the reception, I mean, you know, I've, I've traveled in and out of Africa a lot; the reception has always been wonderful.  You know, now they will take you--they will beg you for your last dime, you know.
Speaker 1: Where did you--what's, what, what specific groups did you actually bond with, I mean, when you were there?
Speaker 2: The, well, the--who's the big Senegalese group?  Isn't that funny?  Wolof.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, Wolof.
Speaker 2: Wolof.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But, and Bambara.
Speaker 1: In Mali.
Speaker 2: Very small, very small group.  But it depends on where you are.  See, in Senegal, it is just the--the Wolof is the group.  They, they basically run everything.  That's a huge group.  The smaller groups I just, I'm, I'm not--I don't remember.  In--but the Bambara, because they, they wanted to give me a name, you know, but I'm never giving up Marva [HistoryMaker Marva Lee Pitchford-Jolly], so (laughter), you know.  You take it, but you just put it on a piece of paper and file it in your travels I guess, you know.
Story_ID: 608070
Speaker 1: Zambia is a place where I did a (clears throat), a residency, very problematic because they were at war.  And I was both in Zambia and Ethiopia, and they were both at war.  It's tough when that happens, because they are curfews.  You have to be off the street.
Speaker 2: Okay, were these trips in the sev- early '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 1: Mid--started in '74 [1974].  I went again in '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Eighty-two [1982].  Well, I've just really been in and out.  And because I have a friend living in Senegal, you know, I used to go--her mother was elderly, so she'd always give me a year's (laughter)--a head start.  But I would often go with her, to travel with her there as well, and, but other stuff I just was just me, you know.  And when I went to Zambia that was through the city [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, so that was okay, but that was, that was, that was a trip and a half.  I mean, I actually went out into the--I wouldn't call it the bush, that's a misnomer, the bush, but I actually went out into--
Speaker 2: The country.
Speaker 1: --communities and found people who dealt with clay, you know.  There's one picture I have.  I hope it's clear enough.  This is in Vula [ph.].  You know, you just want to bring them home, or you want to ship a ton of clay to them, you know, because it's such a difficult task to go and get--dig up clay, I mean, you know.  And they do it themselves regardless of their age.
Speaker 2: Okay, 'cause the ground is hard, is it?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, and not only that.  The clay has a lot of impurities, which means that if you fired it higher, it would probably explode.  So everything is very, very soft.  But the, the issue wasn't so much that.  My issue got to be the word got out that I was about, and everybody wanted me to come, because they wanted money.  You know, they wanted me to buy their pots, (laughter) you know.  And I'm going like, "I can't buy all these pots."  So, trying to maneuver that in an honorable way was difficult, you know.  And you pay families for everything, because they really don't have, you know, anything.  If I went to work with someone or to talk to them about something, I always gave them my lunch money (laughter), you know, so.
Story_ID: 608071
Speaker 1: Do you have a, is there a, an especially big project that you're, you're working on now, or, or what are you--
Speaker 2: Right now?
Speaker 1: I mean for the--do you have a big project design for the future that you're working on?
Speaker 2: No, but that I--only the--I have--I'm working on commissions now, okay.  And that means that someone is paying me to do something that they want, a story pot.  But once I finish that (clears throat)--I did a project back in '92 [1992] called 'Old People Say,' and it was sayings that I grew up with.  I've always--well, I'm lying if I say I always liked them.  But old people often tried to teach you a lesson through proverbs, you know.  If you were doing something ugly, they'd say, "Pretty is as pretty does."  You know, it used to really bug me as a kid, you know, like I don't want to hear it, 'cause you know, you think all that's old-fashioned stuff.  But, but I discovered that all that stuff stuck with me, you know.  And I'm big on wanting to document stuff.  So I thought, I'm going to go home, get a bottle of wine, and I'm going to sit down and I'm gonna have a glass of wine, and I'm going to record all of the proverbs that I heard as a child.  And I got up to fifty-four, and I stopped.  And I then--it took me, I guess, four months, five months, this project.  And I did fifty-four story boards or panels, story panels for each of the proverbs.  And I really, really, really enjoyed that project, and it would--I did it for the university [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois], you know.  And then they built a new library and absolutely destroyed the sculpture.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Contractors are, are, are people that needs to be educated.  You know, they just knocked down all that stuff, yeah, yeah, you know.  I mean, it's, it's amazing.  I don't really understand it, but it happened.  The publication people ran out and grabbed four panels.  You know, these are big--these are not small panels; you know, these are, these are big.
Speaker 1: It's like mounted on a wall in the--
Speaker 2: Yes, they're on a concrete wall, you know, that's buttressed by a hill.  And they took the hill down and the, and the whole thing, the wall, everything, just knocked it down (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is recently.  This is--
Speaker 2: Well, they started the library probably five or six years ago, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So it's finished now, so, you know, but yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We often have--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --art destroyed when workers are around for stuff.  I mean, it's, it's--they're not--
Speaker 1: Not respectful of the--
Speaker 2: --sensitive and respectful at all, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, now you are, you said you're close to retiring.
Speaker 2: I am, December the--I tell people it's, it's in writing.  December 31st is it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Story_ID: 608072
Speaker 1: Well, as an artist in the community, what are some of your hopes for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I would, the, the one thing I, I, I would love to do, love to see, is places where artists can work for those who don't have spaces to work; a continued discussion about the importance of being an artist, that this is not something one needs to shy away from, one can make a living, because there are things that you can do with your education.  I also tell people I think it's important to get an education.  I mean, I, I really, really do.  It just broadens your ability to, to, to work, number one, because it takes a while to--you know, and some people might not ever get to the fact where they make enough money to live off of their art.  But they ought to have enough training where they can do other kinds of things, you know, teach if they need to.  But I want African American artists to have a very broad view of what the possibilities are, exhibit anywhere they think they want to, start trying to do that.  Like I said, when I said I want them to come off the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], galleries on the South Side are safe, you know.  You're not gonna get bounced out of an exhibition, but you need the scrutiny of jury.  That's what they're called, juried art exhibitions.  That means that a group of people look at it and make a judgment.  They don't even see your name, you know, and they make a judgment, yay or nay.  And I like that, that kind of, that kind of thing. And my thing is, we can't complain if we don't do it.  You can't complain about not exhibiting down--people will ask me, "Well, how do you get an exhibition downtown?"  You mean, and I, and I'm like, "What are you talking about?"  You know, because I applied or something.  You know, I, I wanted it.  I also want to see African American art in all of the museums.  You know, there's a women's history museum [National Women's History Museum].  There's going to be an African American history museum in D.C. [National Museum of African American History and Culture, Washington, D.C.]  But you have the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institute, Washington, D.C.].  You have the Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York].  And it's not that blacks are not in these.  I mean, they, they are already, but the numbers needs to be increased.  And I just think anybody who's doing art, unless they just want to do what I call kitchen, you know, the household stuff, just kind of piddle around, I would love to see them have dreams of, of the sky is their limit.  I would like to see national, more national exhibitions here that involve everybody, you know, not just--I'm not--I think that African American exhibitions are fine and wonderful.  I think they are necessary.  But I also think at some point art exhibitions are necessary and important and that we ought to have a history when it's all done of having exhibited in all of those arenas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's a hard--that, that's a nut that needs to be cracked, you know, even more.  And I must say, there's a real active African American community of artists now in Chicago [Illinois], I think in, in a lot of other places 'cause we, do we need to--
Story_ID: 608073
Speaker 1: I'll tell you the story.  It was pain- it's a painful story.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is the painful story (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It is (laughter).
Speaker 2: --we have to tell here, so go ahead.  I--
Speaker 1: But it's one all artists face.
Speaker 2: Goo ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is a story.  It was the first time I accomplished a big pot, and this is what had happened.  I, you know, I, I think things are not necessarily miracles but God-directed.  I wanted a shape for a really big pot.  When you're a hand builder, you know, you have to build things in stages and put them together.  You can't do it all at once.  So I'm walking; I'm going down 55th Street, and laying in the alley--you know, in the '80s [1980s], terrariums were really big.  And someone had this huge terrarium, and they'd just thrown it in the alley.  And I thought, God sent me this shape.  I just, and I just grabbed it and went to the studio, and I built a pot.  And this lady--I used to be a part of the--
Speaker 2: So did you, you built it around the terrarium itself?
Speaker 1: I built it inside of it.
Speaker 2: Inside, oh.
Speaker 1: Right, you know, it took me a long time, but I just kept building, kept building.  And then I drew animals and people and stuff on it, 'cause I'd just come back from Africa again.  You know, so I'm trying to mend up--you know, blend all these worlds, so I do people and animals.  And this lady--this little group--we were a little group in Artisans 21 [Artisans 21 Gallery] here in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois].  This lady comes in and she said, "Oh, how much is it?"  I hadn't even put a price on it.  And I said like sixty dollars or something.  She says, "I'll take it," right.  And I'm going, oh, the first mistake.  So then she says--I said, "Well, do you want me to bring it to you?"  She said, "No, no, no, I'm taking it right now."  And it was like, perfect.  I mean, it was really--I, I just--it was my heart.  And she just--it, it's wonderful she got it, because she was just hugging it, I mean, and she took it (laughter), oh, god.  People do that sometimes, man (laughter), you know.  I'm going like, I don't get it, but.  And I've always thought, whoops, that's one I should have kept, because it, it, it's, it's--these early pots are things that where they were major accomplishments.  Think of the fact that I'm self-taught, which means that I did it the way I thought I ought to do it kind of thing, you know.  And to accomplish these kinds of things for me at that point, were real acts of, of courageous genius, I thought, you know.  And I always kind of wanted an example of what that was going to, was going to be like.  You, you outgrow that.  I mean, you know, you make so many pots that it's, it just doesn't get to be.
Story_ID: 608074
Speaker 1: You also learn that whoever owns it is it wanted it.  That's a really good feeling, to know that the people who collect your work really like your work, you know, and can relate to it, because some people will tell me, "Well, I'm scared of your stuff," you know.  And I--what can I say?
Speaker 2: Scared of it?
Speaker 1: Well, they, they say that I have a lot of voodoo or something, you know.  And I'm going, "Sure, right," (laughter), you know.  But, you know, you know people.  When you--
Speaker 2: Because of the African motif?
Speaker 1: --when you get into that whole Africanist that people don't understand and are guessing at, you get into country.  Because I grew up with voodoo and all that kind of stuff.  I mean, it, it wasn't in our house, but if my--if somebody was sick and my mother [Mattie Williams Pitchford] didn't know what to do, she went to the, to the voodoo lady and asked, you know.  And often what they told her worked.  So, I mean, those were not foreign concepts to us, at least in our household.  It's my sense that in the country, I mean, how could you be?  You know psychic, you know people who were psychic and stuff.  We call it other stuff, but you know, they have those abilities, and you know, I got some.
Speaker 2: Oh.  You have some abilities (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).  But you know, it's like anything else.  If you don't--if it's not nourished, you really don't--I mean, you know, I, I get a, a great sense about a lot of things, and I trust my intuition.  But I would not say, "Well, you come at ten tomorrow, and I'll give you a reading."  I--no.
Speaker 2: And charge you (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.  I put it into the pots, you know, so.  I think that's what people read, because energy is really alive.  I mean, you know, when I'm in, when I'm in the studio, I mean, you know, it's just, I'm visited by a lot of spirits.  And it's a huge space too, so, you know.  And with me working on one side, and Ausbra on the other, you know--
Speaker 2: This is--
Speaker 1: --we used to say--
Speaker 2: This is--
Speaker 1: --you can't get in here (laughter).
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Ausbra Ford, right?  He's a sculptor.
Speaker 1: Yes, Ausbra, Professor Ausbra Ford.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes, we worked together for years side by side, you know.  And on Saturdays we'd be in there really cooking, you know, and 'cause both of us basically come from--he, from a more Afrocentric, moral, spiritual kind of base, Afro-Cuban, Afro-Brazilian.  You know, he's, he's caught up in, in all of that.  I know country, you know.  And it's got the same elements, you know, people who know stuff, people who can tell you things, you know, people who act out.  You know, I used to like the fast people, too.  You know, those were the fast ladies, and you know, I just thought they had more personality than most of the rest of the folks, you know, so.  You know, I thought life, you ought to take a little of this, a little of this, and little of this, you know.  You can't be too good.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, never wanted to be too good.
Story_ID: 608075
Speaker 1: And we always ask this question.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would differently if you could?
Speaker 2: If I could, I really do think I would probably major in art.  It would have saved me so much catching up.  You know, whether one goes to school or not, will not remove the fact that you need to know it.  And because I ended up in a university system [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois], there is so much reading and so much stuff that I had to do.  I mean, in one sense it's good because I did it my own way, but in another sense, it's a lot of work.  It's a lot of work, and there are some things that would have made my life much simpler in the, in the studio or classroom had I known them, you know, that I had to play catch-up with.  But that's about it.  I kind of--my life has gone in a way that I like.  The one thing, if I really just had one thing to change, my mother [Mattie Williams Pitchford] would not die as a, as a--when I was a young person.  I would change that, because it is the single most profound thing that's ever happened in my life.  There is--one doesn't outgrow it.  You don't outlive it.  It is a place--it has its own pain chan- chamber, I guess I, I would say.  One lives with it, but there are just too many unfulfilled things that you would like when your mom's not around, when she's, when she's missing.  But that's, that's about it.  I'm, I'm not one who have a lot of regrets about things, you know.  I--it happened the way it happened.  If I learn from it one way or the other--I mean, you know, I've, I've had situations that, that knocks you down, you know.  And then you have situations--I've always had the attitude, just keep getting up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Regardless of what life sent, just keep getting up.

Speaker 1: Tell us now when you look back at your life again, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I would think that my legacy would--I would hope that it would be one of humanitarian first.  I have tried to live and relate to people in honorable and respectful ways.  In terms of a professional legacy, I have--what I've tried to do, both when I worked with young children and at the university level [at Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois], is to stress couple of things.  One is to take students where they are and to demand that they come forward more, that they invest in their own growth, their own education--you know, they can get the, the thing--but that they must have moral fiber; you know, they must--their word must mean something; they must have integrity.  I preach those kinds of things in my classroom as well as the, you know, the fundamentals of, of clay.  And I would hope that my legacy--and I've always worked in poverty situations almost all of my professional life intentionally.  I've always worked with poor students.  I always believed that they needed people who cared and who had some skills in teaching.  And I decided I wanted to spend my years with my people strengthening those roots, you know, and you know, my work is about the same thing, you know, both from a positive--I don't--a lot of--during the '60s [1960s], you know, a lot of people thought, thought I had a pitchfork, I mean, you know.  I was a very militant lady, but I've never dwelled on the negative side.  I mean, you know, I ain't into, "You did this to me, therefore--," kind of thing.  I just, I want to make it like I want it, you know.  There is a positive way to move forward and to be proud of not only your own accomplishments, but the accomplishments of people who went before you, you know.  The people who went before me helped me, so I have spent my life helping young people--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know.
Story_ID: 608077
Speaker 1: We ask about--you've been asked about family at this juncture now.  Who today do you consider your family?  Are, are, are you, you have, you still have brothers and sisters, right?
Speaker 2: I still have, I have two brothers living [James Pitchford and Charles Pitchford], and I have one sister living [Bobbie Pitchord Baker].  I have many people I have just simply made a family out of, okay.  I, I've never just stuck to the Pitchfords and the Williamses, as you know.  People that I like a lot, my friends, I consider a part of my family, you know.  And the ones I hang on to forever, you know, they'll be with me until I die.  The others fall by the wayside.  I, you know, I don't, I don't worry about that.  But--and I have all kinds of folks as a part of my family, black ones, white ones, Africans, I mean, you know, 'cause I have all kinds of friends.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean friends; I don't mean folks that I--I got a lot of another group that I just hang with sometimes, you know, and do the art thing.  But on my birthday, September 11th [September 11, 2001], you know, something really terrible happened.  But I do a dinner party every year on my birthday, and I have about between eight and ten friends to come.  And I cook, and we dress up, you know, and celebrate.  That's my way, that's, that's a way I look at the world, you know, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You mad, you pissed about something, go outside and just enjoy the trees (laughter), the Point [Promontory Point, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 608078
Speaker 1: Now can you tell us about--we have a story pot here, and I, I--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I'll help you get it up here, and we--maybe you can--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --tell us something about it.  Oh, you got it, okay.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, you--
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: The, the first thing you have to be to do this is strong (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: --physically strong.
Speaker 1: That's quite heavy; that's quite heavy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is.  I didn't know--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --how to thin them out in, in, in those days.  But this is, this is called 'Women of the World' [ph.], okay, and it was done in '82 [1982].  But I'd been in Africa twice, and it just seemed like the women was doing all the work (laughter).  And I don't wanna, you know, start nothing, but, but when I, when I did this point, it was, I did it on a Sunday, and I'd been kind of melancholy all day thinking about it.  And I just picked the pot up, and I thought, women of the world just need to, we just need to hold hands and just try to get stuff right, 'cause it's just not right.  So that's what this pot, you know, is really about.  And the energy, this is energy as far as I'm concerned, and this is energy.  And there was never any frills or anything about this one.  This was just straight to the point.  If you need a boat to get by, you know, you notice some have some, some bags, I mean, you know.  There is (unclear) stuff to eat.  This is a birthday cake.  This is a boat, whatever way and however you need to get there.  You know, we can, we can see it (makes sound).  What I like too, you can even see all of the things where I pulled the clay out, you know, inside of the pot.  But this is the first one.
Speaker 1: So when you make these, you, you had a huge lump, lump of clay, and then you had to kind of--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  You start--
Speaker 1: --clean it out by hand.
Speaker 2: --with a little piece of clay.
Speaker 1: Little, okay.
Speaker 2: A little piece of clay that you put in something to support it, okay.  And you can see.  See the rings?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And I started with rings.  They're called coils.  And, but up here I wanted it smooth, so I did the whole thing in rings and then smoothed it out and then painted on it.  This was the first time I ever attempted to paint on anything, you know.  So whatever happened to me on that Sunday, I made a major step, because I took paint to the surface of the pot, and shall we say the rest is history.  That's the way I started finishing my work after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 608079
Speaker 1: Is there anything we haven't asked you that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Not that I, that I, I know of.  My brothers and sisters, but you know, they're just regular folks.  They live here.  One lives in Liberia--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, West Africa.  Our young brother [Charles Pitchford] is a globetrotter.  He started out in the [U.S.] military, but he was not in [U.S.] Army clothes.  He worked for--he's educated, so he worked for stuff.  And he lived in Paris [France] for a while, you know, so he's been all over the place.  Now he's in Liberia.  He's been there about eight, nine years--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --you know.  But--
Speaker 1: What does he do in Liberia?
Speaker 2: Well, in Liberia you do whatever.  He has a contract with some company.  I just really don't know.  I was there in January, and he was waiting for, as companies come to the continent.  Liberia is really, really struggling after the war [Second Liberian Civil War].  You know, the war tore that country to pieces.  It is a sad state of affairs.  So he gets contract--he has a degree in economics.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's--
Speaker 2: But not necessi--
Speaker 1: --kind of works for--who's--
Speaker 2: He, he can get a degree because he's educated, okay.  But whether it's in any field that he know, probably not.
Speaker 1: A lot--
Speaker 2: He's a great administrator.
Speaker 1: So there are a lot things that he can do--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in those countries--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in that (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And he can hire other people when he gets these--he gets the kind of contracts where he can hire the staff that he needs.  So a lot of the folks who know him kind of depend on him too, to get little jobs and stuff, 'cause that's tough, tough, tough sledding over there.
Story_ID: 608080
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a woman who had an opinion; a woman who's pretty straitlaced; and one who did her best, both in terms of how she felt about, or how I feel about black people, you know, and the things that I tried to do to say, number one, that we're valuable.  And number two, I want to leave it better than--you know, I want to leave something.  And the art is another permanent kind of thing to leave that says, this is what I felt about black culture and how it contributed to the world.  I, I mean, you know, I would argue with anybody that so much of what I know and what I was raised with is the kind of stuff that universal concepts are made from, you know, that they'll work for anybody, just wasn't black folks.  I mean, you know, we really were raised to do unto others as you'd have them do unto--you know, and I (laughter), I get burned a lot because I still follow those kinds of things, you know, and folks are tricky (laughter).  But I just think as a, a really, a, a talented professor [at Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois], you know, 'cause that's the tail end of, of what's happening, an artist who was not just satisfied to hang out in a studio and just do her own thing, you know, very much involved in the community, again, to, to strengthen what I found, you know, and then turn it over to some other fo- people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I'll do that until I die, I mean, you know.  That's just the way I am.  And I, I, I have a real sense that I'm Jolly [HistoryMaker Marva Lee Pitchford-Jolly], but I'm also a Pitchford (coughs) much more than a Williams, I think, even though I probably am the best example of both of my parents [Mattie Williams Pitchford and Floyd Pitchford, Sr.], 'cause I think I took a lot of their good stuff.  But I'm burned, you know, I, I'm baked in the oven by the Pitchfords, and I really wanted to leave some visibility for, for them.  I've carried the name always.  People say, "Well, can I drop that long?"  No.  You know, I want that.  And so I do it as an honor to, to my parents in a varied family in a personal sense but much bigger, just in terms of really wanting to leave something stronger than, or add to it, you know.  So, that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's absolute pleasure--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --you know.
