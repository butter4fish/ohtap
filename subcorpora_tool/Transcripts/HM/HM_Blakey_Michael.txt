Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with the HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, can you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Michael, M-I-C-H-A-E-L, Louis, L-O-U-I-S, Blakey, B-L-A-K-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now, is there a story behind your name at all?
Speaker 2: Well, my father once joked that it meant "little fair-haired one."  I think it was an allusion to the Blakey plantation in Barboursville, Virginia, where the association with that name began.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In Barboursville, okay.  Alright.  And sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: February 23, 1953, Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Alright.  And what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I'm an anthropologist.  I am the National Endowment for the Humanities Professor of Anthropology, and the Professor of American Studies, and Director of the Institute for Historical Biology at the College of William and Mary.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Now, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is the 27th of February, 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are at the IHB, the Institute for Historical Biology, here in the Anthropology Department at William and Mary.
Story_ID: 25802
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, before we go into depth there are five lightweight questions that we're supposed to ask, to warm people up.  They only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  No, I--good food, I eat all kinds of good food.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's a good answer.  (laughter).  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that's the same kind of question.  I could give the same kind of answer but, you know, I'm--autumn is always a little special, the fall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, it is on my boat.  Wherever my boat happens to be for that year, that's my favorite vacation destination.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I think maybe not.
Story_ID: 25803
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Well, I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family first, then your father's side.  And then we'll try to put them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, can you give me your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Thelma, T-H-E-L-M-A, Mildred, M-I-L-D-R-E-D, Mosley was her maiden name, M-O-S-L-E-Y, Blakey, B-L-A-K-E-Y.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born January 3, 1933 in, oh, Sussex County, Delaware.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them, and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Well, it's fortunate that I can probably, I can certainly trace my mother's people back to the 18th century.  Family names probably, yeah, go back to the early 19th century.  Her people are often referred to as Moors, M-O-O-R-S, or Nanticoke.  They're a descendant from the Nanticoke Indians in Maryland and Delaware.  They are, have since the 18th century been mixed with African and European refugees, essentially, Maroons, people who one way or another were marginalized and decided to live with native people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is in Delaware or--
Speaker 2: In Delaware.
Speaker 1: Delaware.
Speaker 2: Maryland and Delaware.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Nanticoke?
Speaker 2: N-A-N-T-I-C-O-K-E.  So, they were--they were farmers.  In the mid-19th century they had acquired some land that they used collectively that was, most of which was actually owned outright by a couple of their members.  They had a little store.  They had a crab packing plant.  They worked--their work had, you know--involved a lot of coastal economy, fishing as well as farming.
Speaker 1: And they--let me--I'm just curious here, and I'm going to go back a little bit.  Now, there are different populations of people in the United States that have, like, a racial background that leaves others confused as to who they are.  There's the Melungeons, the Jackson Whites.  Is this group a similar group of people?
Speaker 2: Similar, yes.  I think that's right.  I think of them in that way, generally, although they each have very specific histories.  But they're in this society that's highly racialized, and which there are often great consequences, like whether you can be enslaved or not, as a result of how you are sorted out into that system.  But these are people who, interestingly, came about by a kind of resistance to colonialism and slavery and racism under, you know, the Indian idea that you, if you obey the rules and you participate in the culture and marry into our group, then you're a part of our group.  That would begin to change later, as Jim Crow comes into play, in which divisions were created between Indians and blacks that have left, even today, a legacy of Native American prejudice in some places in the East Coast, and some of these communities, against blacks, because the more they associated with blacks or acknowledged black ancestry, the more great a risk they were at, minimally, of losing their Indianess.
Speaker 1: Or losing the funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs as well, right?
Speaker 2: They would--right.  Or, in this case, they were not federally recognized, but they were incorporated.  And even anthropologists--Frank Speck, who was there early on in the 20th century.  You know, they were interested--they bought into these very strict divisions of, you know, of race, so that one had--you know, the rule of hypodescent, which meant if you had one drop of black blood, you were black, and real Indians, you know, made baskets.  So, they were looking, Speck was looking for real Indians.  And so they had, you could buy into and reinforce the idea that the Nanticoke, who could be therefore part of the incorporated body of legitimate Indians, were not the ones who were sharing the AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Church, were not those cousins who looked darkest, and so forth.  So there's, you know, a history of the way in which people were turned against each other, even though they began as a kind of collective resistance to colonialism and racism.
Story_ID: 25804
Speaker 1: So, this group of people is referred to as Moors in that area?
Speaker 2: Sometimes they're referred to as Moors.  I think most often those who acknowledge that they had mixed ancestry tend to be referred to in that way.  There has come to be a group of Nanticoke in the area of the most traditional land of that, Nanticoke, which was where my mother [Thelma Mildred Mosley Blakey] was actually born, who refer to themselves as Nanticoke.  They have their--they are recognized by the state.  They have their museum and, you know--but, that identity.  But, actually there's a lot of interaction between them that--as I said, my mother was born there, but went to a more northern part of the state rather than the central part of the state where folks were more associated with African Americans, though her, you know, her grandfather who took her there, has his eel traps and some basketry, and is in the book by [C. A.] Weslager on the Nanticoke.  So, I would just say that one of the things I did as an anthropologist early on was to study this group of people--and not expected--by focusing on one as the legitimate Indians, but to look at them as a whole.  And so, I refer to them as Nanticoke-hyphen-Moors.  And that--a broader unit of analysis, including sort of all of the cousins, if you will, allowed me to understand these kinds of fissures that were being created within the group, that were not obvious if you only looked at one segment of it.  But these were my mother's people, and she, as I suggested, she grew up mostly among those who were sharing African Methodist Episcopal churches, although they did see themselves as different in some ways.  She went on Delaware State College, a black school.  And many of the Nanticoke were at least customarily prohibited from doing that, because they would have to decide to be black instead of Indian, in order to go to such a school.  That's how insidious that kind of racializing was in Delaware in the, even as, you know, as late as the 1950's.
Story_ID: 25805
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did your grandparents do for a living?  I mean, on that side?
Speaker 2: Her [Thelma Mildred Mosley Blakey] parents, Charles [Benson] and Sarah [Mosley], were originally farmers.  By the time I knew them, the wage economy had spread particularly to--including the group--and so they worked--Perdue, oh, was it Perdue then?  Well, they were chicken processing workers.  So, my grandfather, we called him "Pop Pop", would catch the chickens early in the morning and crate them up.  And my grandmother, "Mommom", Sarah, was among those women who processed the chickens, who cleaned them and, you know, put them in bags for market, which was a particularly nasty job, as I've been told.  My mother--in fact, that's maybe the last straw that sent my mother to college.  She spent a summer doing that work, which was described as, you know, work that caused women to, the women who were doing it, to become nauseous and vomit.  So, then you had the sort of rancid smell of chicken waste mixed with vomit.  And that was a bad, a hard way to spend your day.
Story_ID: 25806
Speaker 1: She [Thelma Mildred Mosley Blakey] was a very, my mother was a very bright woman.  Let me just say before I--if I can go to a little story about that.  That although her aunt, Mary Mosley, was the first of her family to go to college--she went to Hampton institute and became a teacher of Moors, Moor children in Delaware.  It was, there was still a great deal of resistance to letting people go off of the land.  When she was growing up, they were still farmers.  It was expected that, you know, children stay and work.  So, there was some tension between her and her mother about going to Delaware State College.  But there was a lot of, you know, support at the college and encouragement on the other side as well.  And she was very dedicated to doing this.  And zoology was her field, zoology and chemistry.  So, and, although she did spend some few years in a classroom taught by my great-aunt, much of her early schooling was in a one-room school in which the majority of African American--well, just a split between African American and Moor children, taught by an African American man.  And at one point, some I.Q. tests were being given, performance tests, in the early days of these tests.  It could have been the Terman test.  I'm not sure exactly which one.  And there were visitors from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  I think at least one was from the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Because the test scores in that school were peculiar.  And they focused, began to focus on my mother--and gave her, they came two or three times to give her extra tests.  And she talked about her teacher sitting there.  I don't think she was more than--she was a young child, probably as early as you could get one of those exams, those tests done.  I'm not sure exactly the age, I'm thinking ten years old, something like that.  And these people are generally--seemed to be dissatisfied with her answers, and they come back.  Apparently, and I guess the--and at one point one of the men is so frustrated--I think the others kind of acquiesced to--that she is making all the answers correctly.  And he, so he, they're about to leave, but he throws in another question, which is "How would you estimate the surface area of an egg?" to this approximately ten year old child.  And she comes up with something, a displacement idea.  "You put it in a glass of water, measure the water--the difference between the height of the water before you put the egg in and after you put the egg in..." something like that.  And apparently, he becomes very frustrated and stomps out.  Her teacher then looks at her with, you know, just a big grin.  This is a period when racial inequality is being justified by these kinds of tests that are said to show the inferiority of blacks.  And actually, there was a man named Otto Klineberg, who had already done some interesting studies to show, for example, that northern blacks did better on the tests than southern whites, which kind of cooled that out a little bit.  But it was still going on, these ideas of racial superiority.  My mother said she was in college and she read somewhere that, you know--a book in psychology, I guess it was--talking about the questions that remained about I.Q. testing, and that actually the highest I.Q. score ever found was in a mixed-blood, in a rural one-room school in Delaware (laughter).  So, she guessed that helped her understand why they were so upset.
Story_ID: 25807
Speaker 1: Any other stories about your mother [Thelma Mildred Mosley Blakey] in school?  I mean, how did she--?
Speaker 2: Well, it would--she--oh, I'm having trouble remembering the name of the man who was partly blind, and an important literary figure of the literature on the Harlem Renaissance, who was there at Delaware State, who befriended her.  He and his family--she helped care for those children, his children, and that was partly how she made her way through school.  I could probably find that name later.  So, it's terrible that I'm blocking, but--
Speaker 1: But, well, what did he do?  How did he fit in?
Speaker 2: He was a writer.  So, she had, in that way, some exposure to, you know, black literature, you know, in a more intimate way.  It was a part of her culture now, you know, then.  She apparently at one point had a boyfriend in Martha's Vineyard, and visited there.  So, that was a particular kind of black community.  Oh, God, who is the painter?  He was at Howard for a long time--woman with--studied in France, something May Lou Jones--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, Lois May Lou Jones.
Speaker 2: Lois May Lou Jones--thank you--and met her at Martha's Vineyard.  So for, you know, a Delaware country girl, she was getting into a lot of culture, a lot of interesting African American culture, early on.
Story_ID: 25808
Speaker 1: My father [Katus Reginald Blakey] taught there at Delaware State [University, Dover, Delaware], and I suppose this was the time when this sort of thing was more acceptable than it is now, that she [Thelma Mildred Mosley Blakey] had been a student of his.  She was a beautiful woman.  And they married.
Story_ID: 25809
Speaker 1: Apparently, he [Katus Reginald Blakey] had an opportunity to become an administrator at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  She [Thelma Mildred Mosley Blakey] expected more of him.  And they came to Washington [D.C.] where he did work as, I think, something in admissions, a registrar's office.  Maybe it was the registrar that he was for some short period of time, before he was ultimately able to enter dental school.  And he had, you know, he had trouble getting into medical school.  He spent some time--also got to the point of becoming an ABD [All But Dissertion] in zoology at Catholic University [of America, Washington, D.C.], the kind of thing that people do to expand their options while they continue to apply to medical school.  Ultimately, he found dental school.
Speaker 2: Now, what's an ABD?
Speaker 1: "All But Dissertation."  So, he was working on a doctorate dissertation--
Speaker 2: Oh, alright, okay--
Speaker 1: --a Ph.D., that he didn't get.  You know, he was, you know, what he wanted was the dentistry.  And apparently that's more in line with what my mother wanted.  So he spent--so, when they came to Washington [D.C.] he was, you know, in this mode of trying to get into medical school while he studied for the PhD, and was an administrator, and ultimately ended up close to where--to her expectation, apparently, as a way of explaining her as a dental student.
Story_ID: 25810
Speaker 1: Now, what did she do when they, once they got married?  What did your mother [Thelma Mildred Mosley Blakey] do for a living?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, she worked at Freedmen's Hospital on Howard's [University, Washington D.C.] campus as a nurse technician, I guess.  She was running one of the machines for whatever it was, cardiovascular monitoring, that kind of thing, in the surgical room.  So, she was watching surgery, she was close to these, you know, the surgeons.  LaSalle LeFall was, became a friend.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was thinking, yeah, LaSalle LeFall--
Speaker 2: Jack White.
Speaker 1: Jack White, right.
Speaker 2: She was, in fact, much later, and after my father [Katus Reginald Blakey] passed and we were living in Jamaica, she moved back to Washington [D.C.] and did research, and had at least one publication with Jack White.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was an artist.  She painted oils.  And I believe I'm getting a little ahead of the story.  But to characterize her, she--my father came from a very patriarchal family.  And, but, he tried to be fair.  And she wanted to work, which at that time he was uncomfortable with, because to him it meant that he wasn't doing his job as well as he should.  It didn't look right.  But she would insist and she had jobs.  She was able to, she put together her, what she called The Shop, a shop on Georgia Avenue, up towards the Silver Spring line, in which she painted and sold antiques and arts and crafts--she--later in her life, I guess that was the '60s [1960s].  And also in the '60s [1960s], she became the first African American health educator at the American Cancer Society.
Speaker 1: Now, so she taught classes in--
Speaker 2: Educating the public about--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --cancer.  And, you know, prevention and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --ways of recognizing symptoms, that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And later, actually, then--and did that also in Jamaica with the Jamaican government, both planned parenthood and health education.  A lot of time she spent at home raising children, which she also enjoyed doing, apparently.
Story_ID: 25811
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, look, I'm going to go to your father's side. I'm going to try to pick up his family story.  Then we'll go back to them getting together, and then move from there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Katus, K-A-T-U-S, Reginald, R-E-G-I-N-A-L-D, Blakey, B-L-A-K-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Now, what is the story behind Katus?
Speaker 2: It's the name of the man who was--and I'm not sure.  He was a West African, either--and I think either Nigeria or Liberia, who was my grandfather's roommate at Meharry Medical School [Nashville, Tennessee].  So, that then might take us back to--let's see if I can--
Speaker 1: Well, what is your father's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.  It's, I don't remember the exact date--October, 1925.
Story_ID: 25812
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, we were talking about your father's [Katus Reginald Blakey] side of the family.  Now, how far back can you trace your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Right.  The Blakey line, well, we tend to go back to James Blakey and Ella Hinton Blakey, his wife, in Orange County, Virginia.  It is possible to go back at least one more generation with regard to Ella, that her mother had lived in Albemarle County [Virginia], which is the same county as Jefferson's Monticello.  But I don't think it was that plantation.  She was sold south, to North Carolina.  A great-aunt of mine left this story, that she had been told by her mother.  And Ella's mother had been sold south, and was brought back to the Albemarle County line at the end of the Civil War with the four year old Ella, by the, quote, "red-haired man."  And so we understood this story, understand this story, to represent the concubinage of Ella's mother, who then found the man who she had essentially been married to, prior to being sold south.  And they reunited in Albemarle County.  Orange County is next door to Albemarle.  It's the county, the family home place, where James Blakey and Ella Blakey owned land after the Civil War.  Now these were both people who were born enslaved, but obtained land in the late 19th century.  Orange County is where Montpelier, [president] James Madison's plantation is, which is just up the road maybe four or five miles, just to give a sense of, you know, where these places are.  They're in the Piedmont, Blue Ridge, of Virginia.
Speaker 1: That's quite a story.  That's the kind of story that just takes a sentence to tell, but it's the kind of story--you could make a movie about that.  I mean, that's-- What a drama.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That must have been--she comes back and--
Speaker 2: And finds that man, you know, reunites.  So, that tells us something also, I guess, about the resilience of the people.  So, the home place is in Barsbourville, Virginia, Orange County.  And, you know, I know they had, some of the land was farmland, but I, these were my great-grandparents and I don't actually remember them doing work (laughter), so I, you know, it's funny, I don't remember what they were doing.  But they--well, actually, they--I'm sorry, they were--were they, they were both dead by the time I was born, so that will explain it.  But they had twelve children and who, some of whom were still on that land.  I think there was maybe twelve acres of land, or twelve to fifteen acres, something like that.
Speaker 1: But it was their own land?
Speaker 2: It was their own land.  And I know there was a moment when they nearly lost it, and had to go to the courthouse to arrange to hold on to it.  But, so, they had some struggle for it, but...  And their children often went out to places like, you know, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]--migrated to Philadelphia or New York, you know, doing the great migration.  But that's a place where we would have family reunions, and have them still.
Story_ID: 25813
Speaker 1: My grandfather [Arthur Gilbert Blakey] was maybe the fourth or fifth child, and either the oldest or second to oldest boy.  And he, for whatever reason, I don't know, was the one--maybe it was his aptitude that was shown--who went to school, a high school, in Gloucester, Virginia.  It was a boarding school, at the turn of the 20th century, a boarding school for African Americans that had been established in 1890.
Speaker 2: Now is this one of the Episcopal colleges?
Speaker 1: It was, it wasn't that religiously--religious-based, but it was established by--well, no, the missionary society--was that the--maybe that's right, a New England missionary society.  And I'm forgetting the exact name of them.  I don't know what their denomination was, so I can't say.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But this missionary society did help raise funds and organize for the establishment of a school.  And, of course, the students all worked on the property.  They did agriculture and other things to help support the school, as they had to pay for, pay tuition.
Speaker 2: So, what was the name of the school?
Speaker 1: The official name is the Gloucester Agricultural and Industrial School.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And it has, I think, a story that's important.  The--so, it was established by a man named William Gibbons Price, who also hails from Orange County [Virginia].  His family was known to the Blakey family.  In fact, they shared Blue Run Baptist Church, in Orange County.  So, that was an important institution for them.  It brought them together.  And so, my grandfather went to this school.  At the same time that this--when the school was created, you know, there were the Bookerite ideals of an industrial education that were very popular among whites, and had some popularity among blacks as well.  And that was often juxtaposed to the Balasian--I'm sorry, the Boisian idea of an academic education and the idea that blacks could achieve anything.  And in Gloucester County, there was a man named T.C. Walker, a lawyer who had a student, Hollis Pruitt, who had just finished his dissertation on this--a lawyer who basically served as an intermediary between the white community and the black community in ways that were fairly opportunistic for him, and sometimes destructive towards blacks.  And there was competition between--of course--and then also, R.R. Moten had his home.  And he was president of Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] at that time, which is a Bookerite institution, you know, a mile away from the school in Gloucester County [Virginia].  So, it was a black community that was developing there on the York River.  So, there's this--and Hampton--Hampton University [Hampton, Virginai] is where they both had gone to school.  So, it was a Bookerite institution, very influential in the area.  So, there was just this strong tendency towards this industrial education.  But Price had gone to school in New England.  And he believed in a more Du Boisian kind of education.  And so, that school stayed open from 1890 to, I think it was 1933.  And all, and the white oligarchy of Gloucester sent--as it closed--the school closed for various financial reasons in the '30s [1930s].  When the school closed, they finally decided they'd come and take a look at the records, only to find that under the label of, you know, agriculture, there was advanced biological study.  They were taking German and Latin and calculus.  And at the same time, this--and the people in the town there of Cappahosic [Virginia]--it was barely a town--referred to the school as Cappahosic Academy.  So, it had an official Bookerite name that kept the heat down, while they provided an academic, sort of prep school education, to people from anywhere in the state who could get there and pay tuition.  And so--and that was the best education anyone had in Gloucester, which the whites did not particularly care about education, even for themselves.  They, you know, a few of the elites would go to an elite school, and the heck with the rest.  So--if they needed to do that, because they already had the land and so on, and the power.  So, this is the school that my grandfather attended and where he met my grandmother, whose name was Jessica Cobbs, C-O-B-B-S.
Story_ID: 25814
Speaker 1: Now, now, what was your grandfather's name, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Oh, Arthur Gilbert Blakey.
Speaker 1: Gilbert Blakey.  And he met your grandmother at--
Speaker 2: Which he always signed A.G.--A.G. Blakey--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because in those days you didn't want anybody to know, you know, just anybody, to know what your first name was, or they would quickly presume to call you by it.  Well, this was after he had become a physician (laughter).  I think that was, that was the issue then.
Speaker 1: And your grandmother's name again?
Speaker 2: Jessica, J-E-S-S-I-C-A, Cobbs, C-O-B-B-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, William Price was the principal of the school [Gloucester Agricultural and Technical School], and his sister Ada Price was a teacher at the school there also.  I think two nieces of Frederick Douglas were teaching at the school.  Frederick Douglas did visit the school at one point.  But, so, and my grandmother did at some point in her life teach at that school a bit, and myself.  My grandfather was smart enough to marry the principal's niece, and the rest was history.  He went on to Virginia State College [Ettrick, Virginia], and I don't know his major, which was probably biology of some sort, and then went on to Meharry Medical School [Nashville, Tennessee].  And he passed the Medical Board of Virginia in 1917, because that's when he began his practice.  He was a general practitioner, a country doctor.  They had, they built a very nice home on a hill in the country on forty-eight acres of land they owned in Goochland, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Is that G-O-O-C-H--?
Speaker 2: I think so, I think so.  I'm not sure.  It's the county--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's the county that's just north of Richmond [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Goochland County, Virginia.
Story_ID: 25815
Speaker 1: [William] Price had an association at Cappahosic [Virginia], of African Americans who were helping each other buy land.  So, this was a land association and they bought up a lot of land, and were very interested in helping African Americans obtain their own land, although I think that had already been going strong in Gloucester, that was a majority of black, and 90-something percent of them in Gloucester owned land.  They ultimately--you know, the percentage now is much less, probably around 10 percent.  There was a flight from Gloucester nonetheless.  But so, my grandfather [Arthur Gilbert Blakey], I guess, based on his parents' ownership of land and emphasis at the school, bought a lot of land, and bought, I think it was about three hundred acres of the, what had been the old Belzoro Plantation.  Don't ask me to spell that.  (laughter).  B-E-L-Z-O-R-O, I think.  So, he was an entrepreneur.  He invested, and also he gave freely to Virginia State [University, Ettrick, Virginia] and other African American concerns.  Here's a--and often accepted, you know, vegetables and chickens as pay for his services, that sort of thing.  There are two things that, for me, are very important stories about him.  One is simply that in working his way through medical school, he, one of the things he did was to work at a brick kiln.  And apparently, brick kilns are hard on the hands.  And he would, sometimes his fingers were so lacerated that he would have to go home and stitch his hands up by himself, in order to go back to work the next day.  So that was some evidence of his commitment and discipline.  And I would just say very simply that it was legend that his discipline was greater than that of his father.  His priorities were very, were the right priorities for getting ahead and being productive.

Speaker 1: The other thing, I think of as an example of the value of what [W.E.B. DuBois] called double consciousness.  So, he's [Arthur Gilbert Blakey] working in a Jim Crow society in a country where he has black and white patients.  And I remember there was a really wonderful waiting room that was also his library, that included some of the books on eugenics that I was interested in, that got me interested in the critique of scientific racism.  But a good library.  He had a little lab and an office and an examination room there.  And off the hallway, he had a very fine door at one end, with one of these little bells that you could turn, and it rings.  The other end of the hall was the kitchen.  And he was required under Jim Crow to have separate entrances for blacks and whites.  And so--
Speaker 2: Well, for the same waiting room?
Speaker 1: For the same waiting room, I believe.  Yes, there was only one waiting room, so that--
Speaker 2: I know I heard of some stories where there was actually two separate waiting rooms.  And there's a black doctor, but he has to segregate his patients in the waiting room.
Speaker 1: And I, so I don't know what he did in the waiting room.  There was one waiting room.  There was a living room on the other side.  Maybe there was some--but I don't, I don't think...  There was only one waiting room, I know that.
Speaker 2: I know all these practices are local, what it boils down to it, but--
Speaker 1: Uh huh.  And so, he chose to--
Speaker 2: But two entrances--
Speaker 1: Well, there's a kitchen at one end, and there's a fancy entrance at the other.  So, his decision was that blacks enter through the front door, and whites would have to enter through the kitchen.  And I had a friend who was from Rhode Island I think, a Euro-American guy, who shows much evidence of his, you know, anti-racism liberalism in the way he lives his life.  But I told him that story.  And he said "Well, it would have been better if he had, if they all could come through the same entrance", because I was taking some pride in that choice that my grandfather made.  And I thought about it but, you know, ultimately my conclusion is that, you know, he did not understand that this was the law, and if he was going to practice at all, he had to comply with the law.  But he did it in this way, that gave dignity to black folks.  What I find, what might have happened, is that he would have done what most, what all white people were doing, what the normal mainstream, what the intent was, and have whites enter the front door and have blacks come in through the kitchen.  But it's that, that's why I find this, you know, a testament to dualism with double consciousness, that he understands he lives in his world and there's that other world, and they have what they think about things, but he has what he thinks about things.  And they are different, and they allow him not to dehumanize himself and his people.  He doesn't buy it, but he lives in it.  He doesn't buy the inferiority of blacks, but he lives in a society that is insisting on that, which he doesn't think is true.  And so, it gets manifested in this way.

Speaker 1: So, my, my father [Katus Reginald Blakey] and his older brother, who was Arthur Gilbert Blakey, Jr., lived a life of privilege, as much as any black child should have expected at that time.  And my father went--I don't know where he went to, I think he did go to a boarding school at some point.  But he--no, well, at the age of 15 he entered Delaware State College [Dover, Delaware]--I think Delaware State--I'm sorry, not Delaware State--Virginia State College [Ettrick, Virginia].  I think was--certainly his major was in agriculture.
Speaker 2: So, this is at age 15?
Speaker 1: At age 15.  When he finished there, he went into the Army.  Just towards the end of World War II, he had obtained training in the use of radar.  So, he was among the first radar operators.  There is a story about him shipping out from Norfolk because of his training and his, whatever his--I think he was not an officer, but he had training that would put him on the bridge.  But because the Jim Crow-minded officers would not have him on the bridge, held up the launching of the ship for a couple of days as they figured out whatever it was they decided ultimately that they would do.  He ended up in Hawaii and in the Navy, and much of what he did was teaching literacy to soldiers.
Story_ID: 25818
Speaker 1: And then following from that is his--let me just say that he was an athlete.  He boxed.  In the Navy he was a boxer, and at Virginia State [College, Ettrick, Virginia] he was a football player.  And he would, you know, later then teach zoology at Delaware State [University, Dover, Delaware] and at Prairie View [A and M University],  also, in [Prairie View] Texas.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, this is before he met your mother [Thelma Mildred Mosley Blakey]--
Speaker 1: Right.  All that happened before he met my mother.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then he met her while he was at Delaware State.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's interesting that something that would be frowned on today, you know, instructors dating the students.  And I've heard lots of stories like that, you know, from that era, so--
Speaker 1: It was a different time.  But apparently, you know, there were different ways of doing that.  And my mother liked to tell stories about how the deans were involved.  And I guess these were smaller, more interactive communities.  And so, he went to Howard's [University, Washington, D.C.]  dental program, where he earned the D.D.S.  And she was talking about how, you know, often there were women who were students who were the girlfriends of, also of, not only the faculty, I guess I'm also thinking of dental students.  The deans were involved in ways to, you know, keep an eye on the propriety of those relationships.  It's a different--it's a different generation (laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, those were the days when dormitories had a dorm mother and--
Speaker 1: Uh huh--
Speaker 2: And the hours that you could see, have company, and very restricted, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  The College of William and Mary has a famous consensual amorous relations rule that prohibits any consensual even, amorous relations between faculty and students, except for graduate students who are not in one's own program, not only during the times those folks are students, but for five years after they leave (laughter).  And so, there was some interesting discussion among the faculty of someone who had married a student that's probably a little younger than I am, this faculty member.  And so, I suppose what that means is that--because you will be asked to leave, you will be forced to leave the faculty.  So, if it's so important to you, this relationship, that you are ready to become employed somewhere else, then I suppose then that you've demonstrated that it's, you know,  I always found it really valuable to segment my life anyway.  I, it's really, I guess quite segmented.  So, my professional colleagues are my professional colleagues.  Even when I'm in the field--and then it's, you know, well you could, there's a couple of ways of looking at it, but I think anybody might be an interviewee.  So, they are people I work with and not people who are, you know, that I socialize with them.  And students are, you know, in loco parentis.  They are my, they are my--my relationship to them is that of a parent, so that's all very clear.  Somebody, when we were having those discussions with the faculty about in loco parentis, somebody said, "You know, there are so many million women in the Williamsburg [Virginia] area, you know, if you, what does it mean that you have to, you know, find them here, when there are all these other opportunities.  Go out there and take care of what you have to take care of, just that part of your life."  So, I think, yeah.  But, you know, that was--so this is also a different kind of world now, and I'm not sure of all what the differences are, but I'm comfortable in it.  I have a colleague who taught at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Bennett [College, Greensboro, North Carolina] and Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] who, you know, two of those are women's schools.  And he says, "Well, you know, well, someone said, well, can you--how do you manage to do that and keep your priorities straight?"  And he says "Well, it's like working in a bank."  (laughter).
Story_ID: 25819
Speaker 1: Alright. So, now, when you think about your parents' personalities, their talents, their habits, their dispositions, the way they looked, they way they walked, talked, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, I take after both of them, and they were each very different from the other.  So, my father's [Katus Reginald Blakey] buddies that he hung with nicknamed him "Charisma."  He was very gregarious, very well-liked by all kinds of people.  He was very comfortable with, and very respectful, very naturally, with people in all walks of life, and just loved people.  My mother [Thelma Mildred Mosley Blakey] could be even reclusive.  She really, she spent time, she was a reader.  She read constantly.  She read at least one book a day.  She was, she liked her privacy.  She in some ways didn't really need people, except her family.  But then she also liked to have, she liked to be, you know, find her place in the house where she could be alone with her books.  So, I have both of those traits, to some extent.  There are times when I need people, when I reach out to people.  And when--I am surprised about how well people respond to me sometimes.  And there are other times when I really cannot be bothered with a soul, and am most happy, you know, by myself, or when I was married, with my wife.  But I don't need anyone else.  And I always enjoy when family visits, or someone visits, but I don't encourage too much of that.  So, I have kind of strong feelings on the side of both parents.
Story_ID: 25820
Speaker 1: Now, you were born in Washington, D.C.  Did you live in the Howard area, Howard University?
Speaker 2: No.  We lived in what my father [Katus Reginald Blakey] used to call the Platinum Coast.  So, you know, in the early 20th century, LeDroit Park, around Howard, used to be the--where the Howard graduates who were the educated--where the bourgeoisie often lived.  And then it shifted to other places like the Gold Coast on 16th Street near Colorado Avenue.  I guess that is, up, you know, northwest.  And then by the time my--this was, it would have been the early '60s [1960s], that same sort of general group of professionals began to move into the northern end of Rock Creek Park, just where we were, on 8231 West Beach Terrace, and in the area of East Beach Drive off Kalmia Road and 16th [Street], where I would get off the school bus on 16th Street and walk to West Beach Terrace.  So, this was a new area for well-heeled professional blacks.  So, it was nicknamed the Platinum Coast.
Speaker 1: So, that's a nice--and if I'm thinking of the same--it's over by Rock Creek, it's a nice area.
Speaker 2: Virtually, it's in Rock Creek Park.  The back of our yard entered Rock Creek Park.  But beyond the point at which most people used the park, you know, a lot of benches and things.  But there was a little, just a little bit of the creek that extends up to East-West Highway and the border with Silver Springs, Maryland.  And a little park ran around that little creek, and really nice houses on both sides.  Where we were is at the very end of that creek.  You could spit on Maryland (laughter) almost.  That's probably not the right metaphor, but, you know, you could, one could easily throw a ball across that little remaining strip of park and hit Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25821
Speaker 1: Now, do you have brothers or sisters?
Speaker 2: I have two brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, where you do fit--can you name them and tell us where you fit in the--
Speaker 2: So, I'm the oldest.  And then a year and some months younger, about a year and a half younger, is my brother Jeffry, spelled J-E-F-F-R-Y, Norman, N-O-R-M-A-N, Blakey.  Our middle names are all names of, you know, of ancestors, older relatives.  So, he and I both have middle names that are of the names of men who were among those twelve children of my great-grandparents.  Then the youngest, who is four to five years younger than I am, is Kevin, K-E-V-I-N, Charles Blakey.  And his middle name is my pop pop's first name, my mother's father.  I don't know where people come up with names these days.  Some of them are nice, sort of the creation of African American names.  It's understandable, and it reflects, you know, our continued creativity.  But you have to sometimes wonder.  You know, names can help anchor a person.  They remind them of, remind one of lineage and history of family, when you invent a name.  But I guess some of them also are combinations of parents' names, and that sort of thing.  So, that works.  Some of them don't seem possibly able to do that, (laughter) but they may be very pretty.  And so, I just wonder if that's a change.  But we were very sort of traditional in that way.
Story_ID: 25822
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well, well, at this time I must have been four or five.  We lived on Farragut Street near Georgia Avenue.  And my father was still in dental school.  And I don't know why I did this, but apparently--but I remember throwing some mud--some kids were on their way to church or something like that down the alley, and I threw something, some mud or something, on a little girl's skirt.  But I was, and I was concerned about what would, what punishment I would get.  And I probably had some other kinds of angst, I'm not sure what it was.  So, I decided to run away from home, which I did.  I crossed Farragut Street, and then I went to the next, which was a large road, and maybe it's Kansas Avenue or something like that.  And I couldn't bring myself to cross that street (laughter).  So, I turned around and I came back.  It seemed like it was forever.  I had violated every rule, and was shocked that no one knew I had left (laughter).  And so, maybe that had some effect, I don't know.
Speaker 1: So, how old were you at that time?
Speaker 2: Four.  Four, I don't think I was in school.
Speaker 1: That's pretty adventuresome for a four-year old, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 25823
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question.  Now, you lived on Farragut Street [Washington, D.C.], I guess, until your family moved over to the area by Rock Creek?
Speaker 2: Well, we actually moved to another neighborhood first, and then over there.  The neighborhood--we moved to Michigan Park, which was a sort of a quiet middle class--changing from what had been white to black at that time.  So, I was, you know, living in that era of a lot of desegregation.  Can I add just this, in having raised this era thing?  I was born in 1953.  Brown v. Board was 1954.  We actually first lived--when I was born, before my first year, we lived somewhere on Capitol Hill in a black neighborhood in an apartment building in which a chauffeur for--either it was Justice Black or Justice Blackmun, which makes a difference.  But I don't remember which one lived-- (laughter).  And while I was in utero, my mother went, was invited by this chauffeur to the Supreme Court, to hear Thurgood Marshall.  And so, apparently we entered through the judge's entrance and found, had good seats.  And so, I don't know, I, you know, whether there was any--I had--if any impression was gained from that.  But--
Speaker 1: So, Thurgood Marshall was arguing the case in the Supreme Court?
Speaker 2: Was arguing the case for the desegregation of--
Speaker 1: Brown v. Board [of Education, Topeka, Kansas]?
Speaker 2: Brown v. Board.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was a fetus at the time.  And they were happy that when I was born, the case was settled.  And it was settled favorably, if to be, you know, addressed with all deliberate speed.  But at least it was, you know, a favorable case for desegregation.
Speaker 1: Well, you can be excused for not taking notes, I guess.
Speaker 2: Thank you (laughter).  So, and so I grew up in this, you know, period of desegregation.  And it was not only in schools, but of neighborhoods and so forth.  So, this first neighborhood was, you know, rapid (unclear).  The third neighborhood in Michigan Park on 19th Place was rapidly becoming African American middle class.  And then at about the age of twelve, I think it was twelve, then we moved to the Platinum Coast.
Story_ID: 25824
Speaker 1: Well, we always ask this question in this way.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up--sights, sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't right now have a good sense of those specific, how those specific senses were used.  I know that my brothers and I played a lot together, and with others--sports like kickball in the alley and behind the house in Michigan Park.  We played a lot of war, as three, you know, big-headed boys who--and this was, you know--at that time the television had come in.  And there were many World War II movies, the Saturday morning cartoons, and war movies.  That was it, that was the big thing.  So you'd get up and you'd watch that all morning.  And then we would go out and re-enact these soldier plays.  So, we were learning to be little soldiers, though none of us actually became soldiers.  And I don't know how this--because I'm having trouble really remembering those senses in operation.  But we spent--every two, or two or three years, we'd go camping.  So, we would go, you know, spend three weeks going to the southwest Grand Canyon, Colorado background, going to Canada, you know, back around through the northeast to [Washington] D.C.
Story_ID: 25825
Speaker 1: Every summer we spent a month in a house that was our summer house at Cappahosic [Virginia].  It had been owned by Ada Price.  My parents bought it from the heirs when I was about nine years old, nine or ten.
Speaker 2: So, what's the title of this place, Cappa--?
Speaker 1: Cappahosic, C-A-P-P-A-H-O-S-I-C.  And it's where that school [Gloucester Agricultural and Industrial School] that my grandfather went to was located.  And so, one of the teachers in the school, an aunt of my grandmother, owned that property, on the river.
Speaker 2: Now, let me ask you.  I neglected to ask you before.  I assume that the Prices were white.  Now, were they--
Speaker 1: Oh, no, they were black.
Speaker 2: Black, okay.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry--no, they were--
Speaker 2: The school was established the American Missionary Society, but the Prices were--
Speaker 1: The principal and the teachers were black.
Speaker 2: So, William Price and--
Speaker 1: Uh huh, black.
Speaker 2: Black, okay.
Speaker 1: And from--and I had said, from Orange County.  They had shared a black Baptist church, or had certainly by my great-grandparents' age, a Baptist church with my grandparents, great-grandparents.  Yeah, so they were from that black community, yeah.  So--
Speaker 2: So, at least--I guess you were saying at least for a few weeks during the summer, you had a chance to, you know, get away from it all with your parents and spend some quality time, I guess--
Speaker 1: But I just said, at Cappahosic, where we, you know, could depend on being for about a month.  And this place was a black town at that time.  And there was a little beach, a little local beach next to where our house was.  It was about four acres of land.  It was our land, and it was the local beach.  That's where all the black folk came in the summer, they came to that beach.  And I only once remember seeing in this time before the 1970's, a white person ever on that beach.  And of course, I guess they were using Virginia Beach and other places that they had access to.  But it was a lively thing to--and sometimes it was too lively, and loud--boats and fishing.  And we would meet up with our friends who we hadn't seen all winter, and the young people our age, and spend all day in that river with nets, collecting crabs and oysters.  And we'd usually make a raft in the beginning of the summer and would carry a bushel basket on that.  And we'd spend all day doing that, and exploring.  And then we'd come back in the evening and shuck oysters and maybe put them in jars and give them to neighbors or roast them out there on the beach.  So, when I think about my youth, I think about, I mean I can't quite separate these senses.  But the things I saw and heard apart--you know, that I really enjoyed, you know, I don't think I, I wouldn't put school in that category, you know.  This was, it was these kinds of things that I did with my brothers and other kids.
Story_ID: 25826
Speaker 1: Now, considering what you're doing today, anthropology, I mean, did you discover anything on these expeditions in the woods and streams?  Were there any, I mean, signs of life of previous people over there?  And did you take note of that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: You know, at Cappahosic [Virginia], there were times when I looked and found nothing.  Let me say that I had really two very strong interests.  One was archeology and the other is paleontology, the study of fossils--and especially marine paleontology.  So, marine fossils and--
Speaker 1: Now, this is as a little kid, right?
Speaker 2: I think I was about ten years old when I decided I was going to go to either Oxford or the University of Pennsylvania to get a PhD. in archeology.  I didn't know about this broader anthropology thing.  I don't exactly know how that got in my head, but I know that part of it had to do with my favorite activity that took place in Delaware.  My--the folks in Delaware, my grandparents, and especially my great-uncle Kermit Mosley, my mother's uncle, Kermit, would spend Saturdays and/or Sundays walking the fields collecting arrowheads and pottery shards.  It was a quiet thing to do, a contemplative thing.  And my Uncle Kermit really was one of the biggest collectors in the state of Delaware.  He had a huge collection.  And of course, you know, when you think about it, they were connecting with what was their own ancestry.  And in those days we spent, as kids, quite a lot of time in Delaware and a lot of time in Goochland, Virginia visiting grandparents.  So, I may have gotten to Delaware every month or two.  And the first thing I wanted to do was go out on those fields and look for artifacts, and I developed over time, you know, a small collection.  So--
Speaker 1: So, were these artifacts, did you know where they came from, or did your uncle know exactly where they came from?
Speaker 2: He did.  He was quite expert on the history.  Yes, I would bring them home and then study books about those particular projectile points or arrowheads, the periods that they represented, that they were archaic, which was really very old--maybe six thousand years old--or woodland, which was more recent.  I don't think I ever found a paleo-Indian, you know, a really ten thousand year old artifact.  But I was aware of all those distinctions, and something of the way of life of the people who made those things.  Yeah, I was quite serious about it.  And science fairs--you know, I was a--I may have suggested when talking about my mother's side of me that I was really quite a shy kid.  I used to think of myself as a nature boy.  I spent a lot of time with nature, playing.  And so, I wasn't, I think I was probably--I had good friends, but I was probably socially awkward, I think is probably fair. And so, I spent, what I really enjoyed was the science fairs in junior high school.  That was the pivotal, the consummate moment of the year.  And I would prepare something.
Story_ID: 25827
Speaker 1: And I always said Jefferson Junior High School was a special, a selective desegregated, or perhaps integrated public school in Washington.  I should mention that I went to Amidon Elementary School.
Speaker 2: Okay, how do you spell Amidon?
Speaker 1: A-M-I-D-O-N, in southwest Washington [D.C.], when they had what was called the Amidon Plan.  The Amidon Plan, basically, you had to be a good student to get in.  You performed in a way that was serious, and you would go from Amidon then to Jefferson.
Speaker 2: Now, just a minute about Amidon.  What kind of name is that?  What does it mean, and where does it come from?
Speaker 1: I don't know who that was.
Speaker 2: Someone's name?
Speaker 1: Someone's name.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But it was, you'd go from Amidon then to Jefferson in junior high school.  At Jefferson, you had to wear a tie.  You carried a briefcase as a seventh, eighth, ninth grader in public school in the 1960's or early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: So, at Amidon was there a dress code at all?
Speaker 1: I don't recall, I don't recall.
Speaker 2: So, this is an integrated school--
Speaker 1: But this is an integrated school.  A lot of the, I mean, it was a lot--so, it was interesting in that it was, it was a school whose student body cut across class.  And I think that particularly occurred in the extent to which professional--I just, you know, I won't get into all of the stations or class, but what we think of as people who have some money.  Among--in the black community--were coming from all over the city--sending their children from all over the city to this school.  And there were whites also who, some of whom were at the--what was it, Fort Meade's local fort, and other liberal progressive thinking whites from upper northwest [Washington] D.C., which is this sort of--from secure income to wealthy people.  And then, Southwest was going through urban renewal.  And there was a large core of African American population, communities, in Southwest, so Southwest [Washington] D.C.  So, they were also going to that school.  We were all there.  It was a kind of, it was an experiment.  It was a school that was in a system, the Amidon Plan, that was much talked about within the educational circles in the country.
Story_ID: 25828
Speaker 1: Many of the people who I remember--Kwame Holman, McNeal Lear was also at Amidon [Elementary] and Jefferson [Junior High School].  And I, among a number of others who came out of that system, were among the leadership of those who were protesting and making a lot of noise for African American studies in our high school curricula and that sort of--student rights, you know.  So that, I think is the kind of thing that [Montague] Cobb meant when he said, you know, the quality of education that we got worked too well--they have to shut it down, which they did at some point.
Story_ID: 25829
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Amidon School--
Speaker 2: Amidon.
Speaker 1: So you were on the Amidon Plan and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, what made the Amidon Plan different?  Were there--
Speaker 2: I think it was--that it was demanding.  And at the same--it was selective, but integrated racially.  They may have had some very specific kind of pedagogical approaches that I don't know, don't remember.  But it was something that people recognized across the country.  I mean, I remember running into teachers who said, "Oh, you're at Amidon, oh."  So, you know, for a little kid that's like, "Wow I don't even know you."  And so--
Speaker 1: What--give me an idea, about what percentage of the student population was black?  Just roughly, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, as I recall, Amidon was probably more black than Jefferson.  So, maybe three-quarters of the students were black at Amidon, but it was closer to 50 percent at Jefferson.  Maybe three-quarters to two-thirds black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In both of those schools.  In other words, there was a significant number of white students, but these were primarily black schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is at a time when Washington, D.C. would have been, when you were growing up, I would guess it would be about 50 percent black, at least.
Speaker 2: Oh, it 75 percent black.
Speaker 1: Okay, because I know at some time in the mid '70s [1970s], they said it was 88 percent black or something.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.  That would be about right.
Speaker 1: I was astonished to read in the paper--the nation's capitol?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Eighty-something percent black?  You know, that's when it was 'Chocolate City' and--
Speaker 2: I think George Clinton had something to say about that.
Speaker 1: Right. (laughter).  There was a song about it.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: But, so, you think it was 75 percent when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: And so, you know, a high percentage of people involved in professions and, or working for the government and that sort of thing, right?
Speaker 2: Well, it has, D.C. statistically has the best educated African American population, and probably because of the, I guess, availability of federal work which had become more fair for, you know, black applicants, and Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and schools around there, and so on.  And I don't know, the quality of blacks.  But the level of education tends to be high.  Of course, you know, there are real class differences in D.C., so it's a lot of African American poverty as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Most of the white poverty is outside somewhere.  There are very few poor whites in D.C., but there are certainly enclaves of whites, professional whites and whites with money.
Story_ID: 25830
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now, your grades are good, I'm assuming?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, okay.  See, and I was telling the story sort of, kind of to give a context of what the science fair was like for me.
Speaker 1: Now, this is at Jefferson when you were in junior high, right?
Speaker 2: Jefferson Junior High [Washington, D.C.], where I focused on science fairs.  I'm trying to think about this time.  My grades were always uneven.  There were some things that I was very interested in, and maybe very good at, which I'd get very high grades.  And there were other things I had trouble with, or wasn't interested in, or, and wasn't good at, and I'd get lower grades.  I think my lowest grades tended to be C's, but who knows, I might have gotten a D here and there.  And I was good with science.  I wasn't much of an athlete either.  I was really pretty pitiful.  It was science that I loved, and I was consumed by that.  And really, although I had real interest in astronomy, I'm now remembering--when I was in elementary school, I made an observatory in the backyard.  I built, out of four or five pieces of plywood, basically a box with a trapdoor at the top that I could look out of.  This was my observatory.  I was interested in a variety of sciences growing up.  But paleontology and archaeology were the things I did science fair projects on.  And I think I had two that were in paleontology, because I would collect fossils from Calvert Cliffs [Maryland] and that whole area on the Chesapeake Bay, that is really one of the, maybe the best--Miocene--talking 12 million, 15 million year marine fossil collecting areas in the world.  And I was collecting with my uncle, my great-uncle [Kermit Mosley].
Story_ID: 25831
Speaker 1: Now, how did your [great]uncle [Kermit Mosley], did he teach you how to take care of your collection?  I mean, how was your collection taken care of?  I mean, how, you know--
Speaker 2: He did.  He had drawers, and he had framed material.  One of the things that I envied the most was a large frame with a variety of spearheads and arrowheads and drill points that I have today, that I inherited from him.  So, he, yeah, there was this ability to exhibit and to store.  I used to create, you know, these little boxes that you keep nails and other small tools in, and cheap boxes with little drawers.  I had them, I labeled with India ink all of my artifacts.  I remember sometimes I didn't have--I used a band aids as my label, and would write on the band aid and put a piece of a band aid, and put that on it.  And I sometimes did little catalogs.  But I always read about what I was doing.  But I should say that a part of that was certainly my uncle's influence.  But part of it was the influence of professional or sophisticated avocational work that I was exposed to early on.  There was a point at which I had, I guess I was, I know I was thirteen, when an African American physics professor--professor... teacher, at Jefferson who had been involved in the science fair, thought that I had potential, and put me in touch with the Maryland Archeological Society.  And so, from the age of thirteen to about fifteen or sixteen--thirteen to sixteen, I was a member of the Maryland Archeological Society.  I was it's youngest member and it's only black member.  And we excavated sites in Maryland, Native American sites, real excavation--careful, professional-like work.  And then on other days you'd go and label your artifacts.  So, there was a lab somewhere.  I remember there was one, a man who was a brother at a monastery, who had been president of that society at one point, had in his, someplace in the church, a little lab. So, I learned how to do that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 25832
Speaker 1: I also, through the science fairs, met a boy named Bob [Robert] Sikora.  And Bob Sikora--
Speaker 2: How do you spell that?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure...
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: ...S-I-K-O-R-A, a white guy, who was in, ahead of me by a year or two, I think, in school.  Yeah, he went to Ballou High School, I think that was, in Southeast [Washington D.C.].  And Bob was a paleontologist.  He would do science fair projects on marine fossils.  He, his family would take him to Plum Point.  And Plum Point is part of the sort of Calvert Cliffs [Maryland] area.  And so, Bob would collect fossils.  So, Bob then began to take me out there with them.  I remember one day--because this is southern Maryland, and southern Maryland is a version of Mississippi.  And so, he's, I'm with his parents in the back seat of the car.  There's this--access to this coastal area is through a farmer's, it's a farmer's land.  And they had to stop.  And the farmer comes and he looks in the car.  And then the father gets out and goes up towards the house with the farmer.  And they talk and he comes back, and they move on.  And somebody asked, said, "Well, what was that about?"  Apparently, Bob told me his father told the guy I was Puerto Rican.  So, that sufficed.  (laughter).  That got me to the cliff, where I could dig for shark teeth or whatever.  So, but I didn't know about it at the time, you know, but at that point during that day.  But that was--and then let me just say one thing about the Archeological Society of Maryland that--and I will remember the woman's name, I should hope, very soon--who was a very kind person who would take me to these meetings every month.  I had her name on my tongue until just a few years ago.  But she was very influential, in that she would take me to the meetings and to the site.  And one day we picked up a couple of students, and they were college students who were part of the diplomatic corp from then Rhodesia and South Africa.  And I was, whatever, fourteen or fifteen, and it was my job to teach them how to excavate.  And so, there we are--
Speaker 2: Is this under the auspices of the Archaeological Society of Maryland?
Speaker 1: Uh huh, yes.  And this is--so there we are in a square of maybe ten by ten feet, digging in the ground, and I'm instructing these college students.  And they get, they began talking about--somehow we were talking about black South Africans and Rhodesians.  And at some point in the--and I--Mrs. Martinak, Dorothy Martinak--I cannot tell you how she spells her last name.  But she was a wonderful person, to help get me started.  And there was some question--she kind of raised some question as we took these folks over, before we got to their house to--I don't remember how she raised it, but there was something...  She wondered if I was going to be comfortable.  And I don't think I knew what she was talking about.  So, we get there, we're excavating, and they--apparently the gist of the conversation was, "Oh, well, but you are different.  You people," referring to African Americans, "are different."  "When black South Africans are ready, you know, for democracy, you know, we'll surely, we'll give it to them", which you know, which didn't seem to have, did not impress me favorably.  And that would have been at about the age of fourteen or fifteen.
Story_ID: 25833
Speaker 1: This was also maybe the year I was working at Smithsonian, the summer I was working at the Smithsonian [Institution, Washington, D.C.], at the same time--but that I would be very much involved in the black student union in my high school that next year.  Life changed in ways that reflected an awareness that I did not previously have, or that was not--that did not previously, had not previously come together in a coherent fashion, of the importance of the struggle for equity.  Yes, so I had--right.  So, at fifteen, which was my last year in junior high school, I got around to making a science fair exhibit on archeology, as opposed to paleontology, which I had done previously.  And I won the grand prize in the city [Washington, D.C.] for whatever that category was. I guess it was science or earth science, or something like that.
Speaker 2: Now, this is still at Jefferson [Junior High School, Washington, D.C.], right?
Speaker 1: I'm still at Jefferson.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But the grand prize was for, you know, all the city and all the schools that participated.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I think it was in, you know, it was obviously in a particular category.  And so I got, was given something called 'Lincoln's Library of Essential Facts,' which was an encyclopedia.  It was a big, hefty thing.  And then I got a little membership in the Junior Academy of Sciences, and a little badge.  I think I still have that.  But that was pretty cool.  And what did I do...?  So, now, I had in the past year or two begun to get interested in music.  And I had gotten a guitar from my parents, and learned how to play guitar.  Maybe I was twelve or thirteen.  And we had a little band, and really going from the Beatles to--you know, I was really a little alienated from soul music.  I thought--I'd come to think of James Brown at the age of fifteen, as much too simplistic.  Jimi Hendrix was coming on the scene, and I was increasingly crazy about him and his work.
Speaker 2: This is now 1960--this is your first year in high school?
Speaker 1: '68 [1968]--then this will be--my first year in high school will be after this summer.  And what I'm talking about is really maybe it's the summer.
Speaker 2: So, it's summer, okay.  The summer between--
Speaker 1: The same summer that I'm working with these--maybe it's the same summer.  It might be the next one that I'm working with, working with the South--teaching the South African students.  And it's the summer that I, it's the, so it's the spring when I get this award, before that summer when I worked at the Smithsonian.
Speaker 2: So, '65 [1965]--
Speaker 1: '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: '68 [1968]?
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: '68 [1968].  So--'68 [1968] and '69 [1969] are important years, period.  Lots going on in '68 [1968] and '69 [1969].  The riots have happened in D.C.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: We're looking at that, you know.  I'm driving through that area between northwest and southwest D.C., so that's very present.
Story_ID: 25834
Speaker 1: I have a guitar, playing in the little band in junior high school.  And so, I want to buy an amplifier.  And so, my father then presents me with an opportunity at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And he's then teaching in the dental school.  He's in the department of, he chairs the department of community dentistry.  And he said, "Yeah, there's an opportunity we offer to local high school students to have a summer job doing research that relates, that involves dentistry, and you can make three hundred dollars."  So, I figured I could get a nice amp for that.  And we talked about projects, and I want to do something in what now we call bioarcheology, and the study of skeletal remains for archeological sites.  So, he hooks me up with Don [Donald] Ortner, who will become one of the great paleopathologists--one of the great--the person who writes the leading books on how one analyzes bones for evidence of differences in health and nutrition and, you know, disease.  At that time, workers at the Smithsonian--I think he is finishing a post-doctoral position.  He will go on to, so he will go on to become a curator, really, ultimately there, the most senior curator.  Don died just last year, just last year.  So, and he is willing to take me on to allow me to do the research that I want to do, though I get, I'm sure, very good guidance from him about what I might do, what I should do.  And what I do is, I take fifty skulls.  One is from the Suruke, S-U-R-U-K-E, I think, society in Florida, who subsists largely on oysters and other things, but at the center are oysters.  And the Hawiku Pueblo, H-A-W-I... is one spelling ... I-K-U.  Pueblo-- in New Mexico who are--who live mainly on maize, corn.  And I'm comparing the dentitions of these two populations for pathologies like caries activity, what we call cavities.  And cavities are much more, are associated with sugars.  And corn is full of sugar.  And sure enough, there was, there were far more cavities and more rampant cavities in the Suruke sample than in--I mean, in the Pueblo sample, than in the Suruke sample.  And I looked at where on the teeth, on the occlusive surface and where chewing, where the forces are chewing come to bear.  And there were some interesting differences between the very gritty--both had a lot of grit in their diet, but the Suruke showed more than with the Pueblo.  And then I also looked at muscle attachments.  The masseter muscle--I learned these names when I was fifteen, doing this research--and it's a muscle that's very much involved in chewing.  And it's attached at the, you know, the ascending ramus--ramus, which is at the back of the mandible, or jaw.  And I saw differences in, you know, the amount of power needed, reflected in the size of the muscles, reflected in the size of the muscle attachments, needed on a regular basis to chew foods in both of these societies.  I think--I cannot find that report.  I saw it once twenty years ago, I think, or twenty-five.  But as I recall, it was not much different from some of what my colleagues still do.  My father did look over it.  I'm sure he helped me edit it in the end.  I--
Speaker 2: These very same features would be studied in the African American projects--
Speaker 1: The same kind of, yes--
Speaker 2: Some of the same things?
Speaker 1: These are some of the many things--absolutely, some of the very same things that we would look at among many others.
Story_ID: 25835
Speaker 1: And, but, I was also there [at the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.] at a time when Lucille St. Hoyne, S-T, H-O-Y-N-E, was there, and J. Lawrence Angel, who became one of the grand old men of physical anthropology, of bioarcheology.  St. Hoyne and Angel were already curators.  They were more senior than Don Ortner at that time--taught me what a standard deviation was.  So, I had to do a statistical analysis of this.  And I remember they had in the anthropology, physical anthropology lab at Smithsonian, they had this big machine.  It was the--whatever--at least three feet high and two feet wide.  This was a computer in 1968, and it could do mean and median mode and standard deviation, and probably not much else.  (laughter).  So, and but this was also a time of learning about the Smithsonian and getting to know these very influential anthropologists.  I, there were lots of stories associated with that summer, but what I remember most was that my hero of, since I was ten, was Louis S.B. Leakey, who had discovered 'Zinjanthropus' [a hominin] and--
Speaker 2: Well, just, just for a second here--
Speaker 1: Uh huh.
Speaker 2: When did you first hear about him, and how did you hear about Louis?
Speaker 1: Leakey?
Speaker 2: Leakey, yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm not sure of all the ways, but the most prominent thing in my mind was Life, you know, Life Magazine had an encyclopedia, that we got in our home.  It was colorful, it was beautiful, and it was extensive.  Part of it was on different nations, part of it was on different fields of science.  And there was one called 'Early Man,' one volume.  And of course, Leakey was all over it, because his big finds were in the late '50s [1950s], and he was the man at that time.  And I was fascinated by the human evolution as depicted and described in that encyclopedia.
Speaker 2: This name popped into my head, and I hadn't thought about it in a long time.  But I remember one of the frequent talk host show hosts, I mean, a guest in those days on Phil Donahue show and other shows, was [Montague Francis] Ashley-Montagu.  Do you remember Dr. Ashley-Montagu?
Speaker 1: Well, and--
Speaker 2: And he discussed race and--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  Ashley Montagu was--one of the things I do is history of science and history of scientific racism, the philosophy of science.  Ashley Montagu was absolutely important.  I know his story pretty well.  In fact, and was happy that one of my science history articles that was most important to me--the one that's most important to me--was reprinted in a festschrift in honor of Ashley Montagu in his ninetieth year, that's subsequently passed away.  But yes, he fought as a scientist against race and racism, as Stephen J. Gould would do later.  And I think we miss both of them.  I don't know who that is now, who serves that, stands in that role.  But we need people to do that, to raise a mirror to science and what--its biases.
Story_ID: 25836
Speaker 1: This might have been Leakey's last international tour, it was close to it.  And so, it was great.  I--he gave a lecture.  The only thing I remember from that lecture was him saying that, "Over-specialization will be the downfall of human kind", you know.  That's an interesting idea, and it makes sense.
Speaker 2: Well, what did he mean--what did he mean by that?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, something about it leaving you vulnerable.  Montague Cobb was similarly critical of over-specialization that he saw taking place in the way in which anthropology was practiced.  It used to be that everybody would meet in the same room and learn about everything.  Now, we go off into our own separate rooms for different specialties, and don't know what, as he puts it, the other man is talking about.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So, it may relate to that--a lack of communication, a broad view of the world.
Speaker 2: Or, you can't see the forest for the trees type thing?
Speaker 1: Something like that.  Yes, exactly, exactly.  But it's normal to see the specialization go on, in recent times, at least.  Maybe it is really more associated with the enlightenment in industrial life, or it's the, you know, the renaissance that preceded it was not--was sophisticated, but not specialized at all.  In fact, quite the opposite.  So, it's a choice maybe that we're making.  I, so, I also--I think it may have resonated with me, now that you speak about it, because I did, I always--well, my mother thought this was the way it was.  And she had, you know, gave me positive feedback about, you know, the sort of renaissance spirit.  I mean I, the same year, or I think it was the same year or close to it, I had won an award for a piece of art that was actually a wood-burning of a Mayan warrior in some school city-wide festival that was on Malcolm X Park.  I did music, I did science.  I, you know, and now what I do is biohistorical and biocultural...  I think it's--that specialized biology is not enough.  You have to connect it to something to be meaningful.  So, that, those words of Leakey resonated with me at that time.  And I got his autograph.  So, today, I have my--and all I had on me was my Archeological Society of Maryland membership card.  So, I have now S.B. Leakey's autograph on the backside of my 1967 membership card that I keep in my office.  So that's the kind of--you know, I guess we'd be called, I'd be called a geek.  Well, that's the kind of geek I was, and I was really having a very good time that summer.
Story_ID: 25837
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the name of your high school, I don't think we got it, but it was--
Speaker 2: Right.  Calvin Coolidge, after the president, C-O-O-L-I-D-G-E.
Speaker 1: You're a geek in this cool high school, and end up at [Calvin] Coolidge High School [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Coolidge, yeah.   Well, I began to "de-geek" in my own peculiar way, in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what happened?  You're playing--now, do you have any gigs with this--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, not in high school so much, but we're, you know, it's like basement bands.  We spent a lot of time playing music in basements that no one hears, except the ones who are playing it, and then maybe a couple of others.  So, yeah, I am getting serious about music.  And, but more serious about the Black Consciousness Movement, more serious about Black Power.  So, and discovering girls was a good thing, too.  So, in my first year in high school, this is after the riots, and I think the riots stirred me up.
Speaker 1: That was that summer that you--
Speaker 2: That was that summer.
Speaker 1: --worked at the Smithsonian.  So, that was a traumatic--
Speaker 2: Because, really, I think in the spring--so by the summer it was kind of just lingering, you know, you could see it--
Speaker 1: Do you remember when you heard about the assassination of Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], what you were doing?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We were at home.  I was in the, you know, basement rec room watching TV, yeah, yeah.  And I don't, you know, we were--well, the progressiveness of my household becomes clearer in the high school years.  But when we went as a family to see music, was really once a year.  We'd go to Carter Barron Amphitheater, which is also in Rock Creek Park, to see the annual concert of Harry Belafonte and Miriam Makeba.  And embodied in that is a political sensibility that's very powerful.  And so, I would say that reflected some of my family's political sensibility.  It was international and progressive.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is Harry Belafonte, Miriam Makeba--a Jamaican and a South African--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: --performing.
Speaker 2: And they toured together, and the theme was about, was an anti-racial and uplifting thing--anti-racist and uplifting theme.  And Belafonte was certainly very consciously participating in the movement through his music and his incorporation of Miriam Makeba as a part of that, and of course, South Africa, the struggle there.  Hinted at--I guess I had that background when I listened to the South African college student that justified apartheid in my excavation square.  That would be part of the background.  And certainly my parents were telling us some things.  But I was also kind of, what's the word?  Cynical or flip, flippant.  I could be, and I think it was part of the manifestation of the sort of social awkwardness, and the unwillingness--and skeptical.  I was unwilling, I was not one who immediately, I didn't follow well.
Story_ID: 25838
Speaker 1: And so, I, I remember in junior high school, saying some things about Dr. King that were not entirely supportive.  I don't know where I got that from.  I wouldn't have gotten it from my household. Maybe I was just--I was also an atheist.  I had left, at about the age of ten I had left Sunday school with the idea--having made the conclusion that this stuff doesn't make any sense, I don't buy it.  And so--
Speaker 2: Were you going to an AME [African Methodist Episcopal] church, or--
Speaker 1: This, it was a Methodist, just a general Methodist church.
Speaker 2: Methodist church, okay.
Speaker 1: Although--
Speaker 2: Well, was church a big deal in the family, or--
Speaker 1: It was a regular thing.  But I don't think--we didn't go there every Sunday.  Maybe once a month or something like that.  My parents accepted that.  So, there was a kind of scientific skepticism, I think.  And so, I had not really yet embraced the Civil Rights movement as I understood it.  It didn't quite, it wasn't, you know, it was still, I didn't quite understand.
Speaker 2: So, was it the, you kind of distrusted the praying, all the praying and the--
Speaker 1: Oh, I was talking about the--it was superstition to me.  And I, you know, was kind of a, I suppose rebellious kid, who would come to these conclusions based on what I thought was logic, and be quick to say that.  And so, and maybe I was, maybe it was about, you know--I don't know.  Was I looking for attention?  I don't know.  But it was, I was occasionally in trouble because I didn't quite follow and accept what everybody, what others accepted.  And I, maybe I would put--and I don't remember what the criticism of King was, but it was rather flip, like, you know, like disrespectful.  And I don't know where I got that from, except that I could maybe kind of explain it as this general side of me.  So, but, I mean maybe his death and the riots helped me get a clearer view.  And although I certainly gained great respect for him, I might have had even greater respect in high school for, you know, people like Huey Newton and Stokely Carmichael, who also had their criticisms of King that I would also have had, that I also had, but not--but clearly with respect for what King was accomplishing.  But I sort of--walking this world, trying to figure out, you know, where I should be in it, and that's a very high school kid thing.
Story_ID: 25839
Speaker 1: There was a black student union at this high school, that only had maybe two or three white students.  Sam Greenlee wrote a, I think, a poem about this that was, in which he suggested some things that said to me that that should be counter-intuitive.  Why do you need a black student union (laughter) in a black high school?  You would need that in a white college, you know.  And those were developed in white colleges.  But we had a very strong black student union.  And the sister who was the president of it, Wendy Wilson--today's she's Wendy Wilson Fall, F-A-L-L--married a Senegalese man.
Speaker 2: And she teaches at, she's in charge of the Pan African Studies Department at Kent State [University, Kent, Ohio] now.
Speaker 1: That's correct, that's correct.  And Wendy was just smart and knowledgeable.  And she began to learn about Africa, and I began to learn about African American struggles for equality and freedom in a way that had not come home as well before.  Well, there was also much more discussion as a whole, around these things, in my home and everywhere.  And then it was kind of being brought down to a level of real impact at the black student union that I joined, through Wendy.  And I think I might have had a little crush on Wendy, but I had a big crush on her girlfriend Bernadette, her buddy who was in the BSU [black student union].  So, these things all worked together, I think.  And so, and she was also in a group called Crossroads to Africa.  And we raised money to send her to Africa, and she ultimately did actually attend some of her university in Nigeria.  And ultimately, she went on to become an anthropologist and a Ph.D., exactly as you described.  And we still, we became what's head of the West African Research Association, or Research Center.  And we have off and on kept in touch--still a wonderful, brilliant woman.  So, somehow, within a year, my junior year, I became head of the Black Student Union.  And I began to, and I was, and we read a lot.  There were study groups, many study groups.  I was also a member of the Black Panther Party by that time in D.C., which was a small but very active one, a lot of reading.  A lot of Marxist and Marxist influenced work, and Pan Africanish work and, you know, I read, you know, Fanon, Mao and Kruma.  So, in that high school, our black student union worked to get black studies.  And we also worked with other high schools, very actively pursuing an African American and African curriculum.  So, there were the guys at Eastern High School [Washington, D.C.].  They had been very effective.  They had a church that was, space, that was donated to them for some of their cultural work.  The Amidon Plan that took, in which students would generally go to Jefferson Junior High School, also tended to place students in Western High School, in upper northwest, above Georgetown.  So, that high school was desegregating rapidly on behalf of these well-prepared African American students, one of whom was Kwame Holman.  And Kwame and another guy named Mumumba were at--directing that, their black student organization.  Now, I had taken the name Rasulee, as 'a' messenger, not 'the' messenger, but a messenger.  And I, you know, sometimes attached, you know, the 'Son of Katus' to that.
Story_ID: 25840
Speaker 1: But we were very effective, and working together, we at one point protested against--we had worked with the white anti-war organizations at times, and had at one point a very focal protest that I led to the White House from, we went from school to school picking up students, a larger and larger group, ending up at Pennsylvania Avenue at the gates of the White House with a coffin full of letters protesting the recruitment of African Americans to fight in Vietnam.  And at which point, I think we stepped up onto the, into the gate, just the gate area, to the gatehouse, and said we had something for [president] Richard Nixon.  And they said, just a moment.  And within a minute or two, there were loads of buses lining Pennsylvania Avenue with what we call rental cops, you know, both the Secret Service and what various guards that they recruited for these kinds of purposes.  And they, you know, they beat us up, and that sort of thing.  And ended up, I ended up in Central Cell Block.  So, this is a story, too, in which they, so they...  And I had signed my note (laughter) in the coffin, right?   So, this is what I'm saying, this can be a problem.  So the Secret Service called my--and my note was really very, very critical of Nixon.  And they called my home and reached my mother.  And the Secret Service asked her if she knew what I had done.  And they were threatening me, that I would never get a government job, while I'm in the Central Cell Block.  But I'm sixteen, and I'm in the Central Cell Block.  And she basically says, you know, "You better send him home right away, because you could have, well, basically you will see some lawyers at your door very shortly, and you know, how dare you."  So, I was released.  Oh, yeah, there was another protest in town, I guess an anti-war protest at that time, because across from me was an adult who I knew, who--a pro-Cuban anti-war activist, a Euro-American named Bill [William] Trainer.  So, this was a, it was a time when there was a lot going on.  And so she--that was progressive.  And they did--ultimately, I think they were going to, they threatened to accuse me of, they tried to accuse me of taking a policeman's gun.  There was absolutely no evidence for that.  (laughter).  They showed me being beaten with my hair being pulled through the White House fence, but--and talked about trying to get me, to have me, that they might try to charge me with attempts on the life of the president because I was apparently illegally on the White House grounds by stepping up to the gate house.  At any rate, I think they may have ended up with a ten dollar disorderly conduct charge, after much ado.
Speaker 2: Now this is 1971?
Speaker 1: 1970.
Speaker 2: '70 [1970]?
Speaker 1: '70 [1970], uh huh.
Story_ID: 25841
Speaker 1: We were working, protesting at the school board meetings.  We were able to work with the superintendent of secondary schools who, Dr. Rhodes, who we were at sometimes I think somewhat--you know, I think we did a caricature of him in a flyer in the newspaper, that you know--we were to some extent children.  And, but he was--as an African American, he also seemed to understand some of this problem.  And we were also well-organized.  So we had problems with police harassment, and yet we had this--and there were some folks on the school board who thought we were really, you know, disrespecting the great privileges that we had received.  And there were people who also understood that there was no African American history or culture in our curriculum.  And we wanted some basic rights.  So, George Rhodes, the superintendent then of secondary schools, organized a conference on student rights, and students from all over--he had me chair this conference.  It took place at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] in the Ira Aldridge Auditorium, and we drafted something.  But we were also at my school.  At [Calvin] Coolidge [High School, Washington, D.C.] we were able to, in, by 1970 or '71 [1971], maybe it was '71 [1971], we had a class in African American black literature.  We had a class in African music.  We had, I know I took two semesters of Kiswahili.  And there was, more was needed.  But this was, we were effective, as high school students.  Now, this is happening also just in the wake of the black power movement, SNCC [Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee] work at Howard university, and other universities.  So, we were, sort of the junior end of that process.  And so I had, and then finally, I think I should say, there was an article in 1970 in the 'Washington Post' on me.  And I remember, I think it was the front page of the Metro section, something like that.  And there I am standing in front of my parents' fine stoned fireplace with a beret, a leather jacket and a spear (laughter).  But making the point, really, that--and the point made for whatever reasons--but the journalist--that the black middle-class was also in this.  We were in this, and I at some point talked about, you know, my previous summer at the Smithsonian [Institution, Washington, D.C.].  And that I, you know, could see that there are, you know, there are relationships between what we understand when it comes to understanding the science of man, that this is something that we should all take advantage of, just try to understand our social problems and where we might, you know, in a deliberative way, proceed from here, something like that.  But also it was mainly an article about all of these kinds of protests we had, and having, and the effects.  And I think the thing that the press was most interested in, or what was most curious to them, was that these blacks who apparently were, I think the perspective was that they were privileged.  They gave us everything, and now look what they do. (laughter).  You know, well, you know, it wasn't enough.  And what we did was learn that it wasn't enough.  And learned that, how to begin to understand what more we needed to know, and to have as rights.  And so, that was another take on it.
Story_ID: 25842
Speaker 1: So, during all this though, did you still see yourself as becoming an anthropologist, or--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --scientist?
Speaker 2: Right.  So, no, not really.  Well, I, you know, in the sense that--right.  I always had this anthropologist identity in me, that was sort of in a sense, part, not a birthright--part of my, of who I was, how I had developed.  So, I always continued to have an appreciation of it.  I always continued to think of myself partly in those terms.  I was really moving away from anthropology, very substantially.  So, what I saw myself, as more, was an activist.  And I was increasingly emphasizing my music and musical composition, and playing with more interesting bands and doing...  So that by the time I graduated from college [sic, high school], I was playing a new, relatively new, kind of music called fusion.  And that was a combination of jazz and rock, in a band that included a couple of people I had been in junior high school with, and some other folks.  So, I had, have always had this ability to become focused and very serious about whatever it was that I was doing.  So, I was very focused on music and moving away from anthropology.  And when I graduated from college [sic, high school], I began to move away from activism as well.  I think I began to, while I learned a lot--
Speaker 1: You mean when you graduated from high school?
Speaker 2: High school, high school, okay.  Yeah, so I'd just--three years of very intense activism, and then I began to focus on music.
Story_ID: 25843
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about graduation on some level.  Now, did you graduate with any honors or anything in high school?
Speaker 2: No, I barely graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I spent much of my time--I mean, I would visit the classroom, you know.  But I spent most of my time doing this, the activism, and hanging out with the music, and you know.
Speaker 1: So that was a consuming kind of an activity.  And now, did you have, do you think you were prepared scientifically--I mean academically, when you came out of high school?  Did you take like stuff like calculus and that sort of thing in high school?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't take calculus.  But I, you know, I had algebra.  Did I take calculus?  I think I had some introductory calculus, but that was it.  And I wasn't very good at math.  Much better at stat, at stat-at statistics, which has more meaning to me than math.  But, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: Thank goodness.  I did--I came out thinking, thank goodness for my junior high school education, because I already, I was already ahead.  I already--adding to that, the study groups and African Diasporic information, and some of the classroom material that I did get and did do well with, I think I was fine, because my junior high school education put me well ahead.  But my grades weren't even.  I just, you know, just barely slipped through.
Speaker 1: Did you have decent counseling about college?
Speaker 2: When I thought of college, I thought of Howard. Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and college were the same thing.  If I was going to go to college, I would be going to Howard.  Although as I said early on, I had other, I had thought about places like, I'd thought about [University of] Oxford [Oxford, England] and U[niversity of] Penn[sylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] specifically, because of their association with archeology.  And I had decided when I got out of high school that I was not going to go to college.  I was not going to spend any time in the ivory tower.  I was going--and so what I did, I think, I thought I was finding out about the world.  And so, I'll back up just a moment on this.  But when I left home, I got an apartment in Adams Morgan [Washington, D.C.].  I shared it with another buddy who had just left home.  We thought, we both thought we were doing music.  And I worked at a bookstore, I worked at fast foods.  I, you know, got through.   I met all kinds of people.  I think to some extent I felt that I was--I did not understand, I did not participate--well, part of it was a kind of adventurousness.  I wanted to find out and be part of how people lived more broadly, on the street.  And I was also part of a black poet's--collective, you know.  So, it was partly about arts and life.  And I had this sense that the college route would not allow me a more authentic experience.  So, I think I was looking for something, maybe call it an authentic experience.
Story_ID: 25844
Speaker 1: But where I need, where I need to back up to for a moment, is that year of 1971 when I graduated from high school.  My parents [Katus Reginald Blakey and Thelma Mildred Mosley Blakey], who had been planning this for over a year, maybe two years, had decided to expatriate from the United States to Jamaica.  They had considered Mexico, but then decided Jamaica.  They had friends there with some land they wanted to sell.  So, I think they were kind of--my father during, when I was in high school, had an organization called Blacks for the American Dream, BAD, and it involved a lot of his professional class people in things like the, you know, the Tent City--I'm forgetting the other name for it--
Speaker 2: Oh, the, yeah, the War on Poverty--
Speaker 1: The Poor Peoples March--
Speaker 2: The Poor People's Campaign--
Speaker 1: --campaign.  So, it was a very, a very ostensible attempt to get the so-called black middle class involved, really.  Or, what we thought of as an elite, you know, a sort of black money, which is not--you know, what the woman said, "You just have doctor money, you know.  You're just doctor rich." (laughter).  But that was, that was that they had to get brought into the movement more.  So, that's what he was trying to do.  He also had an organization through Howard University [Washington, D.C.] that worked in Marks, Mississippi to elevate health care there.  That was a very intensive project.  And my mother also did some work in poor sections of Washington [D.C.], delivered services.  I forget exactly.  So, they were very much in that, in the struggle, in that sense.  I think, you know, [president Richard] Nixon shot some IRS [Internal Revenue Service] at him.  That was how they liked to undermine people's stability and progress, to take him over the coals of tax questions, which he survived well, and had the resources and had the documentation to work themselves through it.  They were fine but, it was, you know, we later found there was a lot of, there was phone tapping and all that kind of thing.   So, I think there was this, just they were tired of this, of--and although they were, we were in [Washington] D.C. which was a majority black place, I think they wanted a more majority black place.  They wanted to go, and where they might succeed not only individually, but in terms of their, you know, interest in the uplift of people more comfortably with greater optimism.  I think there was a little pessimism on their part, that was growing.
Speaker 2: Well, the death of King and Kennedy, and then the kind of a failure of the Poor Peoples Campaign, and then the election of Richard Nixon and--
Speaker 1: Uh huh.
Speaker 2: --you know, all of--the escalation of the Vietnam War.  I mean all those things probably--
Speaker 1: A lot wasn't working so well.  You only have one life to live.  Maybe this was another solution for them at that time.  So they went to Jamaica.  He worked--and then the Manley administration was exciting.  He went to work for the Manley administration in public health, as did my mother.  He built a very fine home on the coast, and really loved that community.  My father died in '75 [1975], so he was there for, you know, less than five years.  But they created a--in the town of Port Antonio [Jamaica], which is a beautiful part of the Jamaica in the northeast corner.  And even to this day, there's a clinic in a town nearby with his name.  So, again, he was--but he was "Charisma" throughout, and so he attracted a lot of good attention.
Story_ID: 25845
Speaker 1: After that, in '75 [1975] my--well, both of my brothers married women from the town of Port Antonio [Jamaica].  And so, after '75, 1975, people started moving back towards [Washington] D.C.  I, so, I spent a good deal of time in Jamaica a couple of times a year, a couple of months a year.  But I was mainly--well, maybe, you know, when I was not employed, it was a couple months a year.  But I was mainly in Washington [D.C.].  To me, Jamaica just seemed too slow.  It was too slow for me.  And they had this Reggae music, and it was too much like James Brown (laughter).  What do you do with that, which I learned to love.  But to, you know, I mean, no one in the U.S. had seen a Rastafarian before, and this was, you know, it was new and interesting, but I wasn't quite like ready to adopt it.  I was on to, you know, Herbie Hancock and Tony Williams and Miles and John McLaughlin, and these kinds of combinations of sounds.  And also, just kind of acting out as I was exploring.  You know, I did not mention that I had gone to Woodstock, hitchhiked there also in 1969.  So, I was participating in that world as fully as I could.  This is how I, how I, this was what, these were my inclinations.  And some of it, I learned a lot from.  Some of it was foolish, and some of it moved me on the next step.  So, I went to music school halfway and half-hearted in '72 [1972].  In '73 [1973], I worked at A.L. Nellum, which was a leading black consulting firm, one of the few over a million-dollar-a-year consulting firms, down on K Street in '73 [1973]--well, '74 [1974], '75 [1975].  And so, just before my father died I told him I was going to go back to school, I was going to do anthropology.  I had read an article by [Montague Francis] Ashley-Montagu that one of the consultants had brought me, some cultural anthropology.  Really, it was about how managers tend to choose people like themselves, you know, for positions around them and so forth.  So, it was sort of business anthropology.  It kind of popped back up in this context.  What I did was Xerox copies.  So, it sort of popped back up in this context.  And I'd been told that if I, you know, that if I wore a tie--this one guy was kind of trying to help me.  If I wore a tie and try to be very diligent, I might get somewhere.  And after also a very short period of time, I realized, that's ridiculous (laughter).  I'm not going to get anywhere unless I go back to school on something that I really love.  And there was music.  I wasn't good enough at it.  I was also not--it was very unpredictable in terms of the relationship between work and reward, and a stable life.  I had spent enough time with that.  I have this other love for anthropology.  I was reminded of that, and I told my father, you know, that that's what I was going to return to school to do, even though I'd done very poorly with music.
Story_ID: 25846
Speaker 1: I needed my parents help, I think.  Well, and I think it was my father's reputation that helped get me accepted, because my grades had been so bad--and let them give me another chance.  I'll tell you really how this worked.  I had been so sloppy about and unserious about the little bit of music.  I think it was half of a semester or half time for maybe a year's period of time.  I ended up with a .51 GPA.  And you can only do that at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and stay there for a couple years (laughter).  I had a .51 GPA.  So, when I decided I needed to, wanted to come back, there was a Mrs. Howard, who was a very important person in the advising center, who knew my father [Katus Reginald Blakey], as she put it, as a BMOC [Big Man on Campus]--
Speaker 2: Mrs. Howard at Howard?
Speaker 1: Mrs. Howard at Howard.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: A very nice woman, very able, who could choose to let me come back.  If I did well, I could stay.  And it was the case that my father was still on leave after so many years, in such a way that I and my brothers could receive tuition remission.  But, yeah, in anthropology I could do, but I couldn't do that in music school.  That was excluded from tuition remission.  So, now my father's died.  I have a sense of, my own responsibility is very heightened, you know.  If you don't do this, nobody's going to do this for you.  You have to make your own life.  And you know, your brothers are struggling, your mother's struggling, you're struggling.  Everybody needs to get out there and get, I need to get serious.  And I was ready for it.  So, I took more hours than I was really allowed to take.  I think I took always somewhere between eighteen and twenty-two hours per semester.  And the first semester I did, you know, close to straight A's with those hours.  And I continued to do that, although occasionally I would get a C here and there in areas that I really didn't care that much about, because I was also determined that I was going to take, I needed to take a lot of hours because I had, needed to get out of there in three years because I had been, I'd been slow.  And so I did.  I succeeded with that.  In my major, I had very, a very high GPA.  And my minor, which was geology, so I still had this interest in paleontology and geology more broadly.  And there were lots of African and Caribbean people in geology.  Howard's geology program was also taught by some very dynamic professors, who recognized that, you know, these Nigerians are going to go back to Daddy's well.  They're going to go back to, you know, the goldmines and all these resources from--throughout Africa--and parts of the Caribbean are there.  And these are students coming out to learn how to have access to them.  So, it was a very good program, fortunately, with a very interesting group of students.  And I was very close to that program that I minored in.  But also, anthropology was exciting at that time.  Some interesting things were happening with regard to the faculty in the department that helped set me on a mission.
Story_ID: 25847
Speaker 1: Now, was W. Montague Cobb there when you--
Speaker 2: Cobb was there.  I did not, he was not part of my environment then.  He was not--because he was in the medical school[at Howard University, Washington, D.C.], and the anthropology department was up in--well, sociology and anthropology department--on the Hill, as we say at Howard.  The Hill is where the arts and humanities and social sciences are located.  And then as you begin to go down the Hill towards the Valley, there are biological sciences.  And deep in the Valley is the hospital, the medical school and the dental school, nursing.  So at Howard, there's this language of the Hill and the Valley, and they often don't communicate with each other very much.  So--
Speaker 1: Those on the Hill call the deepest part of the valley, Death Valley (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Death Valley--
Speaker 1: Raids, that's what they-
Speaker 2: Do they?
Speaker 1: Yes, they do--(laughter)
Speaker 2: Okay, well, I've heard reference to the term pre-dead for pre-med, you know, so maybe that relates.  But my father [Katus Reginald Blakey] had taken his, Cobbs', anatomy course, that he had dissected in Cobbs' laboratory as a dental student.  He'd gotten an A which he was very proud of, which is not as common among dental students as medical students to receive an A.  So I'd heard of him, coming up.
Story_ID: 25848
Speaker 1: So, my parents also were very supportive of my choice to be an anthropologist, should I, you know. And at all points and time, you know, you can, I can understand that there are, you know, there are many people who say that their parents dissuaded them from it, who say, "Well, what do you do with that?  At least you want to make a good living."  But I was fortunate, in that I had parents who knew a Cobb, who knew something about anthropology, and knew that you could do that.  And as, I guess--Warren Barber was talking about his parents, when he chose to become an archeologist.  His father was a psychologist, and his grandfather, a lawyer I think.  And his father was complaining a little bit.  And then his grandfather stepped in.  He said, "Well, the reason that, you know, I became a lawyer is that I can have a son who's a psychologist, and who can have a son who can choose to be whoever the heck he wants to be."  And so, that was--so that was what I was going to be.  I was going to be an anthropologist.  And I was in a program that was, had a chance to come into it's own, the department of sociology and anthropology, in which anthropology had been much neglected.  Occasionally, they'd hire one.  But now, with the new Ford Foundation grant, the idea was to have a Ph.D. program, both in sociology and in anthropology.  And they hired many black anthropologists, who were also just coming into being, in considerable numbers.  And Ford Foundation had also provided fellowships to help that along.  So, I think this was in the spirit of a kind of affirmative action, the spirit of the--the new, the great society.  There were efforts to provide resources for African Americans to participate in a more integrative way in academia as well.  So, there was support for, some support for anthropologists--and so, new African American anthropologists, more of them.  And here they were.  There were nine faculty members and nine anthropologists at Howard.  About a half, or maybe a slight majority, were African American.  So, there I was as one of the seven anthropology majors, and we usually stayed something like that for many years.
Speaker 2: So, you had like seven students and nine faculty members?
Speaker 1: Something like that, yeah, yeah.  I think so.
Speaker 2: Awesome.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Maybe there were a few more, but I know for the time when I taught there throughout the '80s [1980s] and '90s [1990s], until the--
Speaker 2: Seven majors?
Speaker 1: --until the African Burial Grounds, seven majors was about the average.
Story_ID: 25849
Speaker 1: So, and so these were hopeful times, exciting times, and yet one could see conflicts with some of the--and some of them had to do--between black anthropologists and white anthropologists with different visions; conflicts between anthropologists and sociologists who were intent on controlling all the resources that-- Although there were some very good anthropologists, it was a very special time--a lot of them--
Speaker 2: Was there--
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, go ahead.  I--
Speaker 1: I would just say--so I began as an anthropology major when I returned to Howard in '75 [1975].  I graduated in 1978.  And over that time I saw the department go from--well, I also, while I was in music school, did take an archeology course.  And that would have been back in '73 [1973].  So, I saw that program go from excitement to a deepening disappointment and an increasing migration of the best people out of the department, because sociology blocked the establishment even of a master's program for anthropology.  There was at least one very, one hiring, of a poorly trained Euro-American anthropologist, who even the students protested, because we were clear that she didn't have the training, but who was brought in by a somehow empowered--also unproductive--Euro-American anthropologist. But she was an older woman.  So, it was the sense that maybe she looks like Margaret Meade.  I mean the sociologists supported her.  But maybe they supported her because she was not going to threaten them and also--and which means she also was not going to help things develop.  So, here was someone she liked.  She got that person in.  But the anthropologists, those anthropologists were real excited about this, and these were--mainly it did break down by race.  These were, some of these new African American anthropologists had an idea of where they wanted to take the program, and so they objected.  And--
Speaker 2: So, who were some of these anthropologists?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Jerry Wright, who is a named professor at Savannah State [University, Savannah, Georgia] now.  He's a Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] grad, done interesting work.  He taught ethics and theory, which was an interesting, good for me to have.  Laura Henley, Laura Henley Dean, an archeologist.  She had her master's.  She had to leave and then come back.  She had to leave to get her Ph.D. and then when--she had to leave at one point--and when I was on faculty--because she had not gotten her Ph.D. at that point.  Then got her Ph.D. and became an important archeologist with the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation.  But she had studied with the leading figures in what was then the new scientific archeology at Michigan.  She got her master's at [University of] Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] under [Kent] Flannery and others, doing MIA work, in this, what we call still the new archeology, which is very scientific archeology that emerged.  So, she was coming out of the center of that work.  Larry Brooks, who had his, a degree from Oxford [University, Oxford, England] in biological anthropology, was also interesting.  He had some sort of, he was also a musician, I mean a classical pianist and singer.  And so, he had this interesting, the voice.  And whether there were there any biological differences between African American and others, vocal structure and so forth, I don't--you know.  I think he could have come up with some better questions.  But he was a very nice, a very interesting guy, very good guy--
Speaker 2: So, this is an Englishman, or--
Speaker 1: Oh, he's an African American from Atlanta, a brother from--all three of these people are black, right.  And then there are Jane Phillips, who was an elder Columbia [University, New York, New York] grad, white woman, who I described earlier as having an amazing pull on sociology.  And I'm leaving out a very important woman who's--another Euro-American woman--who is, I think as a Quaker, sort of sat in the middle of these kinds of debates, but in not taking any position really allowed things to devolve.
Story_ID: 25850
Speaker 1: Now, when you mention the debates between black and white anthropologists, it raises a question that has been raised in a lot of different areas in those days.  Is it, you know, in art--they were telling me is there such a thing as black art, you know?  We discussed the black aesthetic and that sort of thing.  Was there such a thing as a black anthropologist?
Speaker 2: Well, so, well, there was the development of an association of black anthropologists.  So, there was a new structure that was defined at least by the participation of black anthropologists.  There was a newsletter called 'Notes from the Natives' that Jerry Wright was very much involved in that newsletter, newsletter of the Association of Black Anthropologists.  And if you--I think that black anthropologists have generally, but not exclusively, been defined by their participation in the broader African Diasporic intellectual tradition of, let's call it activist's scholarship.  That they see no, that they think their scholarship should contribute to the critique of race and racism, that it should contribute to the uplift of colonialized and racialized people; that the information they create is political and has to do with power.  And it tends to be a matter of correcting the already political information of Euro-America, that is, to stand as neutral and objective mainstream information.  But since Frederick Douglass in 1854 began the nature nurture debate by arguing with the first physical anthropologists in this country-not, Morton--Samuel Morton and Lee Argosy and Nodding Glidden--began to debate with these racial determinants, you know.  Douglass said in his article, 'Claims of the Negro, Anthropologically Considered', that this science was simply created to make the Negro out to be less than a man, not a man.  So, and in order to justify slavery in 1854 when they published types of that kind--and Douglass turns around and says, "You know, in fact, it's not these, you know, even a dog comes when a Negro calls him, you know.  That means he's a man."  The dog--you know, it's obvious that he's a human being.  And that these differences you see in skulls and so forth--on the conditions of people--on the, even the physiology of people, are created by their conditions, their circumstances.  So that's the nurture argument.   That nature nurture debate begins with that--with Frederick Douglass, with this African American critique of a Euro-American, a particular political bent on the use of science.  And so, Douglass also says that, you know, sort of, "Why do you think you're neutral?  Other writers don't imagine they're neutral."  So, and, so this is an understanding that people of the Diaspora have tended to have because of the position from which they are watching and experiencing science.  It is not what whites are claiming as neutral methods by which they come to have the authority to explain human society and nature.  It's not that.  That is not true.  What is true is that it is a particular position on these things.  Particularly, respect that may or may not be--it is valid in some way--but it's not, it's not, doesn't come from God or nature.  It comes from human beings who are thinking about these things, and they're doing it in ways that suit their interests, at least to some extent, that influences the information.  So, what I think is distinctive about African American scholarships, and including anthropology, is that it assumes that this--they're operating in a political field that they--you know, Douglass says, you know, but tell us what is true and what is, you know, of virtue.  Tell us the, give us the best truth you can, the most balanced, you know, but don't believe that you have 'the' truth.  And so, I think African Americans have been aware that they are, they are struggling against one of the, a set of truths, with another set of truths, for the purpose of equality and uplift and all those kinds of things.
Story_ID: 25851
Speaker 1: We were just, during the break, just talking about the antiquity of this kind of struggle against pseudo scientific so-called facts coming from white scientists about the characteristics of race, and that sort of thing.  And you were saying that [Olaudah] Equiano might--you might go all the way back to him as someone who's black, defending--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, he's an activist scholar.  He's writing about Africa.  He's giving some of the best information that exists, still, from that time about African society, about Ibo society or--and Nigerian societies, and slave trade.  But he's doing it in an attempt to end the slave trade, to inform us of the problems of the slave trade, to end it.  So, he's an activist in that sense.  And you can understand that there's some, maybe there's some subjectivity.  Certainly, there's some subjectivity to what is saying.  And so, if you try to understand what he--what the truth is based on the understanding what his intentions are.  But he also gives a truth that would, that is meant, and that should be helpful in pursuing those goals.  And that's a lot for a person to contribute.  And it may be all that one can contribute, versus some absolute neutral knowledge coming through human minds that have a particular social background in relationship to the subject, a particular interest.  How can that be?  What method has--no method has been proven to circumvent the human mind.  That is a cultural thing.

Speaker 1: Now, I mentioned during the break, [president Thomas] Jefferson, too.  'Notes on the State of Virginia,' where he characterizes, these are the scientific qualities of the Negro, where they come from, and--
Speaker 2: Well, Jefferson had--well, the society, you know, American colonial society of Virginia or Massachusetts had used religious justifications for slavery.  Blacks were dehumanized, by either not being Christian and not having their soul saved--or there was Cotton Mather in Boston, who had a particular kind of Christianity for Africans, for enslaved people, so that he--that basically made Christianity, made slavery a kind of Christian charity.  And this was the confusion.  They were trying to make slavery moral.  And, but it's not.  But they needed to believe that it was.  And so, there were all these sorts of machinations about whether they can have souls or not--that they're not real humans--so, they can't really participate as human beings and they deserve, they're served by being enslaved.  And then there was always the problem that the Spanish also found when they had this dilemma during the Inquisition, that this meant that if an enslaved person converted to Christianity, then presumably they would obtain a soul and be freed.  And there was an interesting case in--you know, there are always these caveats.  In Virginia though, what they said was that well, you would have to have become a Christian in Africa before you come over here in order to be freed, which cut out, you know, a vast number of people.  In New York, it was interesting.  A man named John Jea, who was brought over from Old Calabar [Nigeria] with his family as a child and was enslaved, and there's a very interesting story.  He was punished by his quote "mean master," a master who was furious at Jea for accusing Christians of hypocrisy--makes him convert, sends him to a minister's family to convert.  Jea, with great difficulty, does convert, and then finds that well having converted, he can petition the magistrates of New York for his freedom, because now he's a Christian.  But in order to demonstrate that you're a Christian as an African in New York, you have to show that you can read the Bible and understand it, and it is illegal to teach Africans to read.  So, these are these ways in which this is this kind of wrestling match with--that they can still hold on--these Europeans--the idea that, you know, these things make sense.  These distinctions are distinctions that make slavery moral.  But Jea outsmarts them.  He's really brilliant.  And what he says is--look, he shows he can read the Bible.  But what he says is, to the magistrates, who were like the founding fathers of New York, that he can only read the Bible, that it is a kind of miracle.  Therefore, no one taught him how to read, but he can read the Bible.  For whatever reasons, they freed him.  But it also proves that it would take a miracle (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Someone a lot smarter than the magistrates.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Story_ID: 25853
Speaker 1: So, but, then--so, with [president Thomas] Jefferson.  And so, Jefferson's in an era when, you know, that's still going on.  More clearly in the 19th century when Jefferson was also living, but I think 'Notes on the state of Virginia' is 1785 or '87 [1787], or something like that.  It was before this period when the slave, the Transatlantic Slave Trade ends, 1807, 1808.  And after it ends, more Africans are born here.  The Baptists really get to work.  There are a lot of conversions.  And then you run out of the justification that they have no souls, because now they are en masse--African Americans are Christians.  And that's when Samuel Morton in the 1830's, '40s [1840s] and '50s [1850s], and Nodding Glidden, that's when my science comes in to naturalize these relationships among people who say that naturally Africans are, the Negro, is inferior, is not, or of the same species as human whites are, and justify slavery.  And that's when, of course, as I mentioned, [Frederick] Douglass responds in a beautifully modern way.  But Jefferson, of course, was a fan of the enlightenment ideas, and so he's beginning to, beginning to think them through, beginning to use them, as you say, in...   But it's in a very nascent way, in his 'Notes on the State of Virginia.'  What I love about Notes, something I love about 'Notes on the State of Virginia,' it shows Jefferson's dilemma, and Jefferson's dilemma I think is really a great example of the national dilemma.  In his chapter called 'Manners,' it's just two pages.  And it's, he fears what will happen to this country, because he can see the children, the little Euro-American children--he says they learn from their parents, and they play out what they learn.  And they treat the little enslaved people, you know, in a beastly way, without any inhibitions or civility.  So, that which they've seen their parents do.  And really, these two pages are all about slavery.  And he shows how it is destroying the civility, the morality of whites and destroying, you know, blacks as well, who are under this, you know--destroying them psychologically and socially, because they're under this thing.  And he says, you know, if God is just, he will strike us down.  He says it is wrong, very clearly.  And he says things like, you know, in Virginia, it's hot.  And anybody who can get someone else to do their work, will.  And I don't know a plantation owner who does any work.  But these, you know, hard working Americans are the enslaved people.  I think it would be important for anyone to read this.  It's just two pages.  And he was more honest about this society, living it, than we have been in our historical portrayal of it.
Story_ID: 25854
Speaker 1: So, now at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] in those three years, who would you consider to be your major mentor, I guess, if there was such a person?
Speaker 2: I think, well, the, I worked closely with them all.  I was the, since there were no graduate students--there was one--there was money for one undergraduate assistant.  And that was me, for two and a half years or something like that.  And maybe it was two years, maybe it was two years.  Someone else had been--so they must have been there the first year, or something.  So, I showed the films for them, and I was close to what was going on among the faculty.  So, I worked with all of them.  I took courses from all of them.  Mark Hannah Watkins was there.  He was a [University of] Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] grad, one of the grand old--a linguist, one of the grand old men of the field.  But by the time I was ready to take linguistics, he was, he had retired.  He was a very old gentleman.  So, I didn't take anything from him.  But the people I worked most closely with were, I think principally, Laura Henley Dean, an archeologist.  This was what I wanted to do.  And though I was--I thought Jerry Wright was also very, had very interesting ideas that I attended to.  Larry Brooks was a physical--now, when Larry Brooks left, we were joined by Remi Ojikutu, who was an Oxford trained-Dphil [Ph.D.]--you know, a doctorate from the department of biological anthropology at Oxford, and had done interesting work.  And he taught me, and of course, that was initially--and still, I guess the title--Race Biology, he taught it in a more modern way, and it was very interesting.  I teach a course now that's sort of my signature course, called the Idea of Race.  And I know that it is evolved in some ways from that course that I took with Ojikutu.  Ojikutu was very influential.  I assisted him a good deal.  And he left, I guess it was my senior year, to become essentially, as I understood it, the head of Environmental Protection in Nigeria.  I would later get to know Ojikutu and Larry Brooks as a teacher at Oxford.  James Wood Harrison, you know--in a later life that I had.  But so, Laura Henley had, there was some field school opportunities.  She was working on the Thunderbird site.  She was working on her Ph.D. at Catholic University [of America, Washington, D.C.].  And so, that was Catholic University's site.  And I would go out there and do some excavation, that kind of thing.  We talked a lot.  She was good with ideas.
Story_ID: 25855
Speaker 1: Okay. So, after your undergraduate efforts here [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], what happened next?
Speaker 2: So, I went to U Mass Amherst [University of Massachusetts at Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts].  I thought, well maybe, maybe Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I really was not clear on where I should go to graduate school.
Speaker 1: So, this is '78 [1978], right?
Speaker 2: '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I went to them to talk with Don [Donald] Ortner at the Smithsonian [Institute, Washington, D.C], who had been to the University of Tennessee [Knoxville, Tennessee] which was a, and still is, one of the important hubs of physical anthropology and education of physical anthropology.  But they are very forensic, and they're very racial, and basically they are, for me, an example of the most backward elements of physical anthropology.  Although they have students and influence all over the place--but you know, physical anthropology has always had significant backward elements with regard to race.  They believe in race, you know, it's race biology in a way that is very antiquated, and they're training people to, I think that they're not bio-cultural.  They don't understand, appreciate, how culture or even in my sense--its political economy--aspects of differences in power and resource distribution are important in determining biology, in affecting human biology differences in health and work stresses, and all these things.  I understand them as the result of say, take the African Burial Grounds, of the conditions that people are in that relate to their empowerment or lack thereof, the resources they get as enslaved or, there's other--these are the things that interest me in understanding their biology.  [University of] Tennessee is, "We'll just do something descriptive and define them, in defining their race."  And then looking at maybe some of these pathologies, but they will not make, take the step of looking upstream to where all that is coming from.  So, and, Ortner gave me a kind of heads up on that.  He said something about--because I was also looking at U Mass [University of Massachusetts at Amherst]--he said something about, well, you could go to [University of] Tennessee, but you might not be very comfortable there.  And this was his school.  And he hired people from [University of] Tennessee at the Smithsonian.  And Ortner had always been, he was not perfect on these issues, but he was always a decent human being towards me.  So, I think, you know, he really sensed that this was not a comfortable place for a person like me.  Whereas, he said, "At U Mass"--and he's referring to also working with George Armelados, which I did--"they have a more Socratic, they also have a Socratic method.  You find your own, have to be able to find your own truth through seminars and so forth."  You know, and I had been at U Mass, I guess by that time.  And there was something very--well, and I liked George Armelados.  He seemed a very interesting and decent human and scholar.  And also, Jeannetta Cole was there.  She was just coming over from African American Studies permanently to the anthropology department.  This was a leading African American cultural anthropologist.
Story_ID: 25856
Speaker 1: I was working in Cuba.  I had affinities for the Cuban Revolution.  I would ultimately study Cuban health care and health with Jeannetta [Cole].  And I also recognized the need for what I think of as the reality check that black faculty can give, you know.  Sometimes like, the idea--you can't quite trust the white faculty, to the extent that they have, at best, to struggle with racist ideas.  You know, maybe like criticizing you, or applying their stereotypical assumptions on your work in such a work as to downgrade it.  Or, it might be applying stereotypical assumptions to your work, that were like low expectations, so that if you do anything--you get an A--because that's pretty good for one of those, you know.  They may not think that out loud, but that's the kind of thing that sometimes happens.  They may not understand this kind of--what do you mean, activism and science?  They may simply not get that, because they haven't, it may not be in their interests or they may not have the exposure. So, it was important to me, not only to have, to have not only someone who understood political economy in a critical sort of left-wing way that was an interest to me, but also an African American senior scholar who I could check my work against and get a reality check, to make sure of what the quality really, really was.
Story_ID: 25857
Speaker 1: So, and then finally--and the whole atmosphere at U Mass was very Socratic and intending to be progressive and to find new theory, new theory.  And I fashioned myself as someone who, I wanted theory.  I wanted to become a theorist.  One of the geology students at Howard, a good friend of mine, a guy from Eritrea, I was having dinner at his house.  His brother came over, his older brother and said, "Well, did you do?"  He says, "Well, physics."  And somebody said, "Well, I am a theorist."  He said, "Oh, that sounds really good, I really like that."  And I think the main thing about theory was that it's high on what I think of as the information pyramid.  One can be an elementary school teacher and provide information based on the text that you've read, and the guidelines you have.  Or, you can be a college teacher and train a lot of elementary school teachers, or be involved in, maybe be involved in writing those texts.  You can do a project that's important, and influence a lot of college discussion.  Or, you can define, define the theory that guides how projects are conceptualized and how the data are interpreted, among lots of people that ultimately trickles down in a broad range of things.  So, participating in theory building is important for me because I'm not, I'm not as industrious as a Montague Cobb who writes eleven hundred publications.  I'm only going to end up with somewhere between I guess eighty and a hundred publications.  So they have really have to count. (laughter).  So, to make my, get the biggest bang for the buck, I'm trying to get up high on this information pyramid.  And I thought of it in that way. So, U Mass was good.  It gave me an opportunity to develop that.
Story_ID: 25858
Speaker 1: And then finally, there's something about, you know, a New England collegiate environment that just smells like serious work.  I went up there [University of Massachusetts at Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts] in the fall, you know, [George J] Armelagos' house in Deerfield, I guess it was.  You know, they were making apple cider, you know.  It felt like graduate school.  So, that's where I went.  And it was a good choice.  I didn't apply anywhere else.  I applied to that one school, I got in.  I got one semester of affirmative action money, which was important.  And then I was able to be accepted by the DuBois African American Studies Department there at U Mass, a very important department, who interviewed me and gave me a job as a teaching assistant in the Malcolm X Center, which was a black student center where I also would teach one course, and help the undergraduates, you know, not hurt themselves.  And the one course I taught was called Race Biology in Society, and I got started with that.  Then, so that carried me through my first year.  And in my, the last two and a half years that I was there, I had a minority graduate student fellowship from the National Science Foundation, which was a very prestigious fellowship.  And though I didn't have to teach, I did then also teach a course that I organized with another student named Denise Miles under a course, an independent study course, under Jeannetta Cole and Alan Swedlund--a demographer who was on my committee--a course called Issues in Race and Gender: Racism and Sexism that was cross listed in Women's Studies in Anthropology.  And they continued to teach that, apparently, for some few years after I left.
Story_ID: 25859
Speaker 1: I was really getting into understanding race.  I also, I pursued my skeletal biology there [at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts], working on taking many courses in skeletal biology, or in aspects of physical anthropology--one course in skeletal biology, or two, I don't know.  But doing the work on the Dixon Mounds population, which was a large population from Illinois that was at U Mass, a thousand skeletons.  I worked with dental defects that show disrupted growth in childhood.  So, our teeth grow in childhood and we keep them as adults, but disruptions in their growth in childhood remain visible in the adult teeth.  So, you can kind of read a childhood medical record in adult teeth.  And I developed a method of measuring the duration and the period of months during which that disruption took place, while at U Mass in grad school.  There is actually no other method available for, in which you can say developmental destruction began at this age and lasted for this period of time, and ended at that age.  So, it's a unique method.  I've worked in, my work in Italy at La Sapienza [University of Rome, Rome, Italy], probably a result of that methodological work.  But interesting--so I worked with really deciduous teeth in children, baby teeth, that told also about intra-uterine life and health, quality of life.  But, I, of course, learned other methods.  But that was, that was a specialty I was developing.
Story_ID: 25860
Speaker 1: So, I also took an internship, a fellowship, at Smithsonian [Institute, Washington, D.C.] in 1981 working with the Hrdlicka papers that were just being made available, papers of this founding father of American anthropology who had been characterized as very liberal and anti-racist.  And then I found that all of his work was very conservative and racist.  So I had to, had to have an article that was difficult to get published.  But once it was, you know, it was published a couple of times.
Speaker 2: Now this is who, this is--
Speaker 1: On the work of Ales Hrdlicka.   It's spelled A-L-E-S, H-R-D-L-I-C-K-A, who founded Professional Physical Anthropology.  So, he created the association in the 1930's, the American Association of Physical Anthropologists.  He creates the journal, the 'American Journal of Physical Anthropology' that we still use, in 1918.  He found, in 1904, he comes through the Smithsonian. So he's, that's the center of the development of the physical anthropology.
Speaker 2: So, there's a certain amount of power and assumptions made that, you know, in the early days of the founding of the science of anthropology that even a giant like--what's his name again?
Speaker 1: Hrdlicka.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Hrdlicka, you know, can be subject to the same, you know, similar problems even though he was considered to be a liberal, you were saying, or someone who was a reformer in the field.
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is that his papers had just become available.  No one had talked much about him for decades.  His name appears on each journal cover, "founded in 1918, by Ales Hrdlicka."  So, his papers become available.  And Frank Spencer who was an anthropologist, a historian of anthropology, writes a twelve hundred page dissertation on Ales Hrdlicka and his life.  But he characterizes him as, for example, opposing racism because he opposes Aryan supremacy.  Well, Hrdlicka was born in Bohemia.  He was known, he did not like Germans.  He was absolutely a white supremacist in every aspect of, in the core of his work.  But no, he did not believe the Aryans were superior.  That's not anti-racism.  So, and then there's a lot of other kind of stuff like that that's in there, whereas I'm finding that he is founding the field of physical anthropology on notions of racial hierarchy, racial determinism, and claims eugenics to be simply applied physical anthropology.  And of course--and this in the teens--'20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s].
Story_ID: 25861
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, now you were at the Smithsonian [Institute, Washington, D.C.] around the same time you say that you went to Oxford [University]?
Speaker 2: You know--can I maybe finish this Hrdlicka story a little bit?
Speaker 1: Oh, sure.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Because I think there may be something instructive in--I wrote an article called 'Skull Doctors: Intrinsic Social and Political Bias in the History of American Physical Anthropology: With Special Reference to [the Work of] Ales Hrdlicka.'  And it took, it was very little changed after, you know, very little additional editing after maybe 1981 or '82 [1982].  But it took me until 1987 to get it published.  And I was getting feedback from leading--George Stocking, for example, who was considered the leading science historian of anthropology--that it was very poorly written.  I was getting feedback from the reviewers of the journal, 'Current Anthropology,' that it was just a political propaganda, this sort of thing.  But the manuscript was being used a lot in an underground kind of, you know, among scholars who knew me or were interested in it, and liked the work.  And ultimately it was published by a new progressive, mainly European based journal, called the 'Critique of Anthropology'--picked up and published so quickly that there are two or three little typos in it that I never got to go back over.  So, they never asked, they didn't ask me to revise or edit or--so there's two quite different worlds.  And now, a version that changes only to the extent that I began to use the term African American instead of black.  And in 19--I guess '94 [1994] or '96 [1996], re-writing of it, a re-publication of it, that I call, it's called 'Doctors Revisited.'  And this was a festhrift for [Montague Francis] Ashley-Montagu, in a book with work by Steven Gould and other people I respect.  And I think the moral in this is, stick with it.  People take different perspectives.  Maybe they even lie to silence certain voices.  Frank Spencer said he couldn't see anything in my work that was not true, even though his work was completely--an opposite interpretation of Hrdlicka.  So, if it's true, then it should be published, and one should stick with it.  And it's been the influential work in some circles.  Race, you know, debate in others.  But that's a good thing.  But I think it's important for students--you know, you don't want to keep banging on something that, you know, is not coherent or substantive.  Sometimes it's hard to know what that is, because people will tell you almost--important reviewers will mislead you.  And there's an extent to which you do have to rely on--be self-critical, but ultimately you have to rely on what you feel you know.  And if you can get that and hang--stick with it long enough to give it a chance to go through, it may take longer than not.  But that's something, something, something that I learned.  It was, so there's a kind of commitment to your own vision that I had--to my own vision--that was really important there.  Otherwise--one of the things they said was, Stocking said, "Well, maybe you can cut it into two pieces", because this was something on history of the field, and then it related to how that history is lingering on in less obvious ways, in the present.  Hrdlicka had an article in the present and an article on the history.  And what he is really saying, is talking about the history is normally related to the present.  I could have done that, and I could have ended up with something very different than I was able to create with the time I put into it.  And so, it's a tricky thing.
Story_ID: 25862
Speaker 1: The year before I did that research at the Smithsonian [Institute, Washington, D.C.] I participated in the U Mass [University of Massachusetts at Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts] European Field School, to go to London [England] and do some work there, and have, and also study at Oxford [University, Oxford, England].  And there may be a little story in that, in that I had decided by the time I was working on my doctoral dissertation that I didn't want to work with bones, that I was interested in making a contribution to a better understanding of human inequity in living populations.  And what I had begun to develop, and with also the particular help of a very--of a graduate student who was one year ahead of me, but he and I worked on very similar things.  And he was quite a reader, and often shared his literature with me.  Now that is really important, if a graduate student, you know, who's got more literature under his control, his little head will share it with another student.  And, you know, he could be competitive.  And, you know there's this idea, you know, look to your left and your right, and you know, some of these people will be gone by the end of the earth--matriculation.  But if you mask the idea that we will all be here, we'll all, all the students will be here to the end, so share.  You have nothing to lose by sharing.  And some people actually did.  And this, so it was very important, that Alan Goodman who recently was president of the American Anthropological Association--that Alan Goodman, who's continued to be a good colleague--helped me get hold of the literature I needed, to understand how I might look at the class and racism.  Well, he really helped me understand how to, how cycle physiological stress is being understood.  So, cycle physiological stress was what I was interested in, and he helped me understand.  And then what I also brought to this was an understanding of the political economy of class and equity, and the social and psychological interactions of racism that would affect the extent to which people with different incomes and of different races would likely be affected by cycle physiological stress.  And the hypertension, in mood responses, all those physiological things that result from high stress.  This is an area of great complexity, and I really enjoyed working through some new aspects of theory on that.  And it was a wonderful challenge, and a wonderfully direct way of looking at the relationship between society and biology.  There it was, happening in your head.  There are those things that happen out there that are--if you're exposed to a greater or lesser extent of likelihood based on your class status or racial status, they will create degrees of different kinds of fear, anxiety, insecurity, that--and degrees of insecurity that will be manifested in those neurotransmitters that tell you insecurity, and manifested in other physiological responses to these anxieties, like the elevated blood pressure and these sorts of things that are chronic diseases with which we deal in our society.  In fact, by things like obesity, that are also impacted by the stresses of the society, and not by everyone equally, but differentially, according to the stressfulness of their environment and how it's relating class and race to the degrees of stressfulness.
Story_ID: 25863
Speaker 1: London--I wanted to work in London in a, I was principally interested in the black British.  But I was also interested in ethnic differences and class income, at least, more really as a single class society, really a working class society.  But they differed, people differed by their income, and there were a lot of black British.  But there were also people of Indian descent, from Asia and Irish and English descent there, in the community in northwest London.  And I wanted to, Oxford had developed in its biological anthropology program, an emphasis on stress.  They were beginning to see that psycho-physiological stress was this very interesting interface between biology and culture, and had a whole laboratory working on it.  They were doing studies in the Otmoors, which is this sort of very quiet suburban rural looking community outside of Oxford.  But they were taking urine from people and generating catecholamine, or adrenal levels from that--cortical steroid levels, and other stress hormones.  And this was work being done mainly by Vernon Reynolds.  And I'm forgetting--Kim, a recent graduate from an Australian university who was working there in the lab also, taught me how to, you know, take a vial of urine, and by passing light through it in complicated ways, determine how much stress hormone was in there.  So, I did that kind of laboratory, I had that kind of laboratory training.  And then Reynolds had, and there was a course also on ethnic conflicts--that was about as close to a course on racism as they had--that Reynolds co-taught with a Rhodesian man whose name I am not remembering...  Kenneth Kirkwood is his name.  So, all this was happening in 1982 when Rhodesia became Zimbabwe.  Kirk went home and came back, which was quite an interesting experience.  He was shaken.  And that was, so it was a--and this discussion--well, some of the older scholars who had taken that course refer to it as Kenneth Kirkwood's colonial course on race and ethnic conflict.  But it was interesting to see how that view was constructed at Oxford, a view of understanding ethnic conflict.  It was useful to get lab methods there at Oxford.  Every Thursday they had a seminar, where another lecturer would come.  A lecturer would come to talk about something involving physical anthropology.  And we'd go off to the pub and talk more and drink more.  I participated in that regularly.  That was also good.  I got to meet and become close in a way, to James Worth Harrison--Jeff Harrison--who had been the teacher of my teachers at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], a very nice man who--and we would see each other a couple more times over my lifetime, and in interesting and sort of important moments.  But--and, but my research was sort of door to door survey in northwest London.  Mostly it was really collecting self-report data.  So, I didn't, we did not use that laboratory method, although I can say while I was at the Smithsonian [Institute, Washington, D.C.], the next year Harrison asked me if I wanted to come back and do more biological measurement.  He had in mind a grant.  He would submit this for me.  And this was really very simple stuff.  I mean those--this was like between old boys, they just write a letter and you're supposed to get the grant.  And I should say that I was really in some way shaken by my experience in London, going from door to door asking ultimately in a very cooperative sixty-five or so people, telling me about the things that most stressed them in their lives.  And also spending time with and living with black British youth and adults and reading about them, and just feeling this heavy ceiling that had been placed over their lives.  They were bright, creative people, absolutely frustrated and underfoot because of racism there.
Story_ID: 25864
Speaker 1: I kind of think of, you know, where we could go to black colleges and at least have some movement out of those ranks.  Although that's only affecting certain people, I'd love to see the whole society rise.  But at least there was, their colleges were, you know, on the other side of the Atlantic.  They didn't have that access.  They were brought there with promises in the '50s [1950s], of jobs that were meaningful.  But what they ended up doing was, you know, sweeping the train platforms.  And all these wonderful, though horrible stories about, you know, the guy who comes home from work everyday with a briefcase, but everybody knows he's really just sweeping train platforms.
Speaker 2: Now there's a song I think by Mutabaruka, "It's Not Good to Live in A White Man's Country Too Long."
Speaker 1: (laughter).
Speaker 2: Have you ever heard that?
Speaker 1: No, but, that's--yeah, I like moving around.
Speaker 2: --the disturbances in Cottenham [England], you know.
Speaker 1: Uh huh.
Speaker 2: So, I don't know.  That was about, was that about the time you were there?
Speaker 1: I think, well, yeah, that was a little after that particular disturbance.  But, you know, Linton Kwesi Johnson--I don't know if you know his poetry and song.  That's exactly, and that was coming out at the time that I was there.  That's exactly it.  So, I, when I was asked about coming back I was like, you know, I was just glad to get out of there in one piece.  But I was willing to do it.  And then interestingly he had, he wrote back, you know, a very conciliatory letter that, you know, clearly he was, he couldn't the money to bring me to study stress in the black British, you know.  He could get plenty of money to look at people in the Otmoors, but the idea of studying stress in the early '80s [1980s] in the black British community, I--he said--it was something to the effect that was politically sensitive, and it was threatening.  But this is--so, this is like, this is a big Oxford professor with the three piece suit that rides a bicycle to work everyday, you know.  Older, gentleman, you know, very--one of the maybe three most powerful anthropologists in Europe, or physical anthropologist, certainly in Europe.  So, that told me something.  And finally with respect to, well, I also got great methodology in rating life events, these events that you want to, you want to be able to estimate how much stress should derive from an event.  And it is really, it's somewhat simple in its conceptualization, but in the actual practice it's very complex.  If you think about your life, what is it that makes you stressed?  And then think what's different about someone else's stresses? But there's something that they have in common.  There's some dimensions that are, that make them more threatening than other kinds of events that you will, that these events will have in common.  And so, there was a wonderful protocol for that in the work of George Brown and Terrell Harris, who studied the high stress in working class London women.  And it's in a way which precipitated, created, high frequencies of depression.  So, they had a pro, a sort of a special course.  And if you were lucky you could take it.  And through someone I had met at Oxford--said, "Let's get in."  And that was just a very stimulating course with a small group of people internationally who had come to take it.  And so, I was able to take advantage of that.

Speaker 1: I came back, I think I came to--I went to, I taught at--I came back, I went to Smithsonian [Institute, Washington, D.C.].  I got out of Amherst [Massachusetts] at the time, I think of it--I was there for three and a half years.  It was a wonderful college town, but it became stifling.  I had to get back to [Washington] D.C. really, or someplace with real life.  And so, I found that--I made a halfway, which was a semester at Delaware State [University, Dover, Delaware].  There was a research project in psycho-physiological stress in the psychology department.  My mother had a home there.  She was head of their Alumni Affairs office at that time.  And so, that was an easy transition, that I found a job at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] after that semester at Delaware State.  And I was at Howard from then on.

Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, you're, the official title of your dissertation, which would be, is--
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: But it had to do with stress, right, is that--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it has to do with psycho-physiological stress in London and in Britain and the U.S., and the issues of race.  And, I have to find where I've cited it somewhere.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because it's now, it's become a long time ago, 1985, and I haven't gone back to doing much of that research.  I keep being drawn into the bones.
Speaker 1: And you told us, you told us about, you know, I guess the methodology and the, how you chose the topic and all of that, and what your findings were on some--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: I guess--
Speaker 2: The findings--
Speaker 1: What are the findings?
Speaker 2: The findings were that by income, the poorer one is, even within the working class, the greater the frequency of feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, about what one can do with their lives.  That there are more of the kind of separation events that are also predictable--predicts anxiety, divorce, loss of job, these kinds of things.  But it's really this feeling that's created by those realities, of the kind of helplessness or hopelessness, a kind of insecurity of a kind that is very important for effects of stress.  And with that, there were--correlated with these were high rates of anxiety, sleep latency--taking longer to get to sleep at night, lower self-esteem, and a number of organic illnesses were associated as well, their frequencies.  And race, as it's used, was also correlated with income.  So, poor blacks, more blacks were poor and therefore had more of these events.  There was some--I think most of this was in the discussion, because I did interviews, I did participate observation, and incorporated a number of different sources, to kind of describe how racism created a high level of unpredictability for African Americans, for the black British.  So, and the gist of that is that, you know, one works in whatever context to build relationships in which other people, maybe people with access to resources--maybe it's your boss or your teacher--know what you can do, and therefore they will--that you're productive and they will reward you for these things.  They will at least acknowledge you for being productive.  But when stereotypes are being opposed, racist stereotypes are being opposed, those stereotypes overtake what it is you're actually doing.  And they come to control how you're perceived, which means that essentially, under these kinds of racist conditions, you lose control of who you are socially.  And that is a very insecure place to be.  And that sort of would stand apart from income and these other things.  There is something about the relations of racism that, according to all stress theory, should elevate the level of anxiety and stress that people are subjected to that have.  So, those of the kinds of things I was looking at.

Speaker 1: I published something on this [how income and racism affects stress level] in a volume on disorders, on disorders of the industrial society, a volume called 'Diagnosing America,' that's put together by the American Anthropological Association and the Wintergreen Foundation.  I don't think that book went as far as it should have, in terms of being published, produced and read a lot.  But it was, you know, it was pretty hot for a minute there.  And that, it came out of a series of discussions that we had as a panel of people organized by the president of the American Anthropological Association at that time, in the late '80s [1980s].  Skip Rappaport, Roy Rappaport, at [University of] Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]--in which we were trying to figure out how anthropologists could address the problems of the disorders of our society now.  In that volume, there is a white paper on public engagement.  And these people, most of the people on the panel--there were maybe eight or nine people on the panel--I was the only physical anthropologist.  The one archeologist got frustrated and left.  These were mostly cultural anthropologists.  And maybe that was good.  People had been talking with living people and feeling that there needed to be greater engagement.  Along, we decided, or sort of operationally, that in the West we should use the values of the society.  And the values of the society were, had to do with pluralism and democratic participation.  So that these things, and respect for that kind of diversity, of view, and democratic principles should be applied to our work so that communities should be served and related to in ways that, you know, offer them that kind of respect and democratic voice.  So, this was one of the early, in 1994, I think, was the publication dates--one of the early discussions of public engagement, that would be so useful for the African Burial Ground.  There are some other ways that I came to public engagement.  They all kind of, everything kind of coalesced in a powerful way on the African Burial Ground.  So, that's, that's one of them.

Speaker 1: Did the paper wrote about, I mean published paper[s], how did it affect the field of, I mean anthropology?
Speaker 2: I don't think it did.  I don't think it did.  There was recently a blog, maybe three or four years ago that a graduate student at Emory [University, Atlanta, Georgia] had put out to challenge some other psychologists with my work.  I said, oh, that's interesting.  I don't, I know that some of this kind of work is, had some influence on a certain group of anthropologists that I will call the "U Mass Mafia".  There is a group of physical anthropologists who are very bio-cultural in their thinking, who are working towards a political economy in human biology, and who had another Wintergreen Conference in Kabul [Afghanistan].  San Lucas put, developed a book on the biocultural synthesis and the political economy in human biology.  And there's a good deal of my work that's influential in that mix.  And so, we'll have to see, still, how that, how influential that group is.  It's a hard nut to crack.  There's a very strong tendency to, in physical anthropology, to explain everything in terms of Darwinian theory, or some aspect of nature.  So, to shift to this--which I think I've convinced also this mafia, this which really begins with Frederick Douglass--this idea that it is the conditions that affect even the biology.  An idea that also comes up with Franz Boas, an influential, very influential Jewish American anthropologist who also gets this aspect of environment, but fifty years late, relative to Douglass.  So I can't say it begins with him, though most will say it begins with him.  But these are ideas that people who are somehow oppressed, can begin to see, and so--the value of.  And but, but it--they are hard, it's a hard idea to make mainstream.  It is, this biocultural work, is going on.  And there are sometimes--as Alan Goodman recently wrote something that's going to come out shortly, in which he acknowledges that there are some advertisements for jobs that call for biocultural anthropologists.  These are still very few.  So, I don't think, I don't think we know what's going to happen.
