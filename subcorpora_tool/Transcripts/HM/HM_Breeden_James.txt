Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe, I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers, our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Sure, it's James Pleasant Breeden [HistoryMaker James Breeden], P-L-E-A-S-A-N-T and B-R-E-E-D-E-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there a story behind the middle name?
Speaker 2: Well, the middle name is the same as my father's middle name [sic. first name, Pleasant Breeden], and he was born in 1894 at a time when I think people gave those sorts of names hoping that the kid would turn out (laughter) the way the name was.  And it worked with him.  The James came from his father, I'm pretty sure, but there's a little murkiness in his father's relationship to the family.  The story he told was that one of his friends took him to church one day and, after the service, introduced him to the minister and when the minister heard his name, he pulled his hand back as if he'd been burned.  And (laughter) my father figured that, that was probably his father that he was being introduced to.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, that's a different story, these stories are in families.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, now what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Okay, it's October 14th, 1934, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  No, I'm sorry, speed.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm currently retired.  The last ten--more than that, twenty years I've been in--a teacher, and administrator ranging all the way from public schools to private higher education.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I think last couple positions were at--one was at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and one at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], right?  I think.
Speaker 2: Right.  I was at, at Howard at--for a couple of years getting an M.A. in administration graduate program.  Administration started, I left before it actually got started and I retired from there.  Harvard, I was a, a visiting scholar for a couple of years and just did research after I'd left.  The longest job I'd held was at Dartmouth College where I was dean of the Tucker Foundation [William Jewett Tucker Foundation, Hanover, New Hampshire].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you, do you consider yourself primarily an educator?
Speaker 2: That's what I would--yeah, I describe myself (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because I know you have a degree in divinity, too, but (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --as an educator and if the way I think of myself because of the way I grew up in the Civil Rights Movement in the '60s [1960s] was--that's where I learned administration, is on the streets.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now, what, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is the 12th of October?
Speaker 1: September, yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, I'm ahead, little bit ahead.  Twelfth of September, 2007.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in the African Meeting House in Boston [Massachusetts].
Story_ID: 531918
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that I'm compelled to ask everyone that require only a short answer.
Speaker 2: To make sure I'm (laughter), I've got my bearings.
Speaker 1: I don't know why they make me do this but this is--the first one is, do you have a favorite food and what is it?
Speaker 2: A favorite food.  I'm really--I really eat a variety of things that I enjoy.  Let me try, what would be favorite? I guess curry would be my favorite food.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Color.  I really love the colors in the fall when the colors are kinds of various blends of browns and grays.  So that's--those are the colors scale that I like to see.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Time of the year.  Actually, this fall time of the year.  I, I do enjoy the Caribbean and the hot weather but I also like the, the cool weather in the--as it's heading towards winter.  I don't like winter.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Destination.  Well, again, the Caribbean is, is a kind of nice place to be.  The only thing that deters me from that are the hurricanes that--so I like to wanna miss the hurricane season when I get into that territory.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last question is: do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Phrase or saying. Yeah, my favorite phrase is actually, if you do anything significant in history, it's because many people have been working on it before you; or, if anything comes out of it, it's because many people will work on it after you.
Story_ID: 531919
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history, I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Pleasant Breeden] side, but we'll ask about your mother's side first.  Can, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Sure, it's Florence Beatrice Thomas [Florence Thomas Smith], B-E-A-T-R-I-C-E and Thomas is just ordinary T-H-O-M-A-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is October 28th, 1900 and it was Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see.  Her, her mother [Johanna Johanson Thomas] came from Malmo, Sweden, so in the like roughly like 1880.  And she had come following--she was fourteen when she came, she came following her sister who had come.  And I think probably gone directly to a farm in Wisconsin, but my grandmother thought that she was mostly a servant to her sister so she left that and went to the big city, to Minneapolis and worked in a hotel there.  Her--the--my great-grandmother was Swedish and German, and her husband was Swedish and I don't know how that happened but, at any rate.  No, she was, she was--I'm sorry, the great-grandmother was German, the great-grandfather was Swedish and I'm not quite sure how that link occurred.  My mother's father was Frederick Gustolvus Thomas [Frederick Thomas] and he got his Thomas name from someone who--a Welshman who adopted him in New Bedford [Massachusetts], and he worked on a ferryboat between New Bedford and New York for a while.  And was like I guess a member of the family.  His, his parents were a African American, who was probably an escaped slave, and a Cherokee woman and they moved from one of the Carolinas up to the cape to New Bedford.
Speaker 1: Okay, but his middle name was Gustolvus?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that I think he got from his Welsh adoptive father, but he joked about it apparently.  He died two years before I was born but he joked about the Frederick Gustolvus was 'War and Peace' [Leo Tolstoy], was his (laughter), was his, his name.
Story_ID: 531920
Speaker 1: Is there, there a story about how they met, your [maternal] grandfather [Frederick Thomas] and grandmother [Johanna Johanson Thomas] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah they met--yes, they, the, the, they met in the hotel where she was working as a--as she described it, as a scrubwoman.  And he was working as some kind of bellhop or something like that.  And they met there, got married, she later got him a job from some friend of hers as a elevator operator in a lumber company in downtown Minneapolis [Minnesota].  And then they, they bought property in north Minneapolis which was a former chicken coop, but it had been made over into a house and then built on to that house, which is the house I was raised in.  The--they were really the first--it was very sparsely settled, so I always joked that I lived in an integrated community but I was there first (laughter) (unclear) and it was, it was largely a first and second generation immigrant community.  It was Finns, Swedes, Italians, Poles, lot of different folks from lot of different European places were my, my playmates and so on.  I was usually the only black kid in the bunch that I played with.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, did your mother [Florence Thomas Smith] talk about how it was for her to grow up in Minneapolis?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was--Minneapolis was a fairly--well, I guess I ought to back.  She had two siblings, my mother was light skinned and blue eyed and she could, they said or still say, I guess, she could have passed, but she never did.  She never hid the fact that she was African American.  She went to--graduated from high school as did her sister [Lillian Thomas] and her brother [John Thomas].  She became a secretary and had a secretarial job until she was married, or several secretarial jobs.  She never advertised the fact that her, her father was African American so sometimes people were a little shocked when her sister came and they had lunch together, but she never got fired or anything out of that.
Speaker 1: So her sister looked different from her?
Speaker 2: Her sister was much darker; her sister would have been I suppose you'd call her dark Indian [Native American] features.  And my uncle, her brother, was light skinned Indian features probably would be the way to describe him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, the, the girls graduated from high school, which put them in a--it was about 19--well, what?  Nineteen twenties [1920s] or so.  So that would be rare, relatively rare for girls to be graduating from high school then.  My uncle who was born in 1907, graduated from the University of Minnesota [University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota] and with a master's degree so that was--put him in a fairly rare category.  He was, his degree was in social work, he taught a couple of years in the--in a university or college in the South, then went into the, into the [U.S.] Army infantry.  And most of his career after the Second World War [World War II, WWII] was in refugee work, or all of his career was in refugee work, international career.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, now, did your mother--now she, so yeah, she graduated from high school and, and became a, did secretarial work?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 531921
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your father.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Wh- can, can you, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yep, my father was Pleasant George Breeden [Pleasant Breeden] and all those ordinary spellings.  He was born in Des Moines, Iowa.  His--had a--his mother raised him herself. I think--I'm certain there was the mother's mother was also in that household. I've only seen one, one or two pictures of his mother and it looked to me like they grew up in a kind of rural Des Moines, outskirts of Des Moines.  Apparently, at his--for his age group the thing to do was to leave home around ten or eleven years old.  And he went to school in Des Moines to the fourth grade and then left Des Moines and went to Minneapolis [Minnesota].  And, eventually, got a job as a railroad waiter, various railroads, Great Northern [Great Northern Railway] is the one he was on for twenty-five years or so.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: He didn't have any siblings, as I do not have any siblings.  And the, the friends that I--we would go visiting, I don't know if that was a custom in your family but our family would pile in the car and go visiting on a Sunday or something.  And we'd go visiting and stop at his friends, and his friends were usually people he had grown up with as a kid in Detroit [Michigan] and who had come--I mean in Des Moines, and who had come to Minneapolis about the same time my, my--it sounds like they were a kind of support group gang of kids who got jobs and stuck together in, in Minneapolis.  And called each other cousins and so on, although I don't think any of them were actually related to each other.
Speaker 1: Okay, so a substantial number of them in Minneapolis then?
Speaker 2: Apparently, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, did they, they talk about why it was so attractive to leave--I mean it was, you know, or what the attraction of Minneapolis was or why they didn't feel like they wanted to stay in Des Moines?
Speaker 2: No, they never did, I never, I never was old enough to quiz them on what that, (laughter) what that was about.  I remember my father said that his first job in Minneapolis was cleaning hearses and, since the undertaker was so sure that a black kid would be scared to stay in the hearse, he could go in there and sleep anytime he wanted to 'cause the--his, his employer would never look in the hearse to find him, 'cause he was (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's the last place he would look.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so the story you told I guess in the beginning is about your, your, your father's father.  There was some confusion about who he was (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, exactly, exactly.  So that would have been in Des Moines and before he was ten years old.
Speaker 1: So, he suspected his father was the preacher in the local church?
Speaker 2: He did, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and he never got any clarification I guess?
Speaker 2: I never did, I never really asked anything.  He seemed to be fairly certain, I mean, it didn't seem to be a speculation on his part.
Story_ID: 531922
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Florence Thomas Smith and Pleasant Breeden] met, and got together?
Speaker 2: Not that I've ever heard.  They were part of the black community in Minneapolis [Minnesota].  My mother was an Episcopalian in a black congregation there, but not--he was not particularly religious.  My impression was that the social life--there weren't--first of all, you have to start with there were not many black people in Minneapolis.  It was like 2 percent or something, you know, pretty small number.  Two, two areas of the city had most of them in.  So the social life for the people of a similar age was a pretty limited range, so they would probably know everybody would know everybody else.  And my father was about six years older than my mother, but they married late, so that wouldn't have made any difference particularly.  So that's all I know.
Speaker 1: About how old was your father when he married your mother?
Speaker 2: When, when they married he was forty.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  For both of them it was a second marriage.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, I noticed on the information that you had a stepfather [Noah Smith] so did they, they didn't stay married, now?
Speaker 2: Oh well, they stayed 'til my father died and then, and then my stepfather, and mother married some years after that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. About how old were you when your father died?
Speaker 2: When he died?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Let's see, '61 [1961], I was probably twenty-five.  Yeah, twenty-five.  I think it was around 1961.
Story_ID: 531923
Speaker 1: When you consider your parents' [Florence Thomas Smith and Pleasant Breeden] personalities and reflect on, you know, the things that they did and what they were like, who do you think you take after the most your mother or your father?
Speaker 2: Well, the part I remember most about my father was that he, he was always, he was always seeing the humorous side of things, so that he was always laughing about things.  You'd sort of say this terrible thing happened and he would see that it was the funny side of it.  And people say that they can always tell when I'm nearby because of my laughter (laughter) and so I guess that comes out of my father.  My mother was very pious, very quiet, very sort of, yeah, those would be two strong characteristics.  Very--and so that I probably don't take after her a lot.  The piety, I went into the ministry and we--and that probably we were on our knees every night before I went to bed so, you know, that probably had an effect on me.  But, at a certain degree of quietness, I mean I tend to stay quiet when I don't know something and people think that's because I know something and I don't wanna say it. But (laughter) it's usually I'm just ignorant (laughter).
Speaker 1: That seems like a good practice to me as opposed to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think so, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: --you know, talking when you don't know what you're talking about, yeah.
Story_ID: 531924
Speaker 1: Do you have an, an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Earliest?  Well, this--the earliest one I can remember I think I could remember is when my mother [Florence Thomas Smith] was in the hospital for an operation around Eastertime.  And I was given a chocolate rabbit for, you know, compensation for her being away from me at that time.  And I was really very young so I don't know if I invented that memory or (laughter) if, if it was real.  There's another one I remember going out the--growing up in Minnesota [Minneapolis, Minnesota] was, you know, winters were snowy.  And I can remember going out the backdoor to the garage and in a snow path that was like up over my head and the thing that makes me doubt whether that's a real memory is there is actually a photograph of that. (Laughter) So I may have just incorporated it into my, into my mind.  I can remember another one a little later that I know is a real memory, when I was about four getting stung by a bee, and so that was certain.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you really, yeah, you didn't have to, didn't have to pinch yourself 'cause you got stung (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) There was no doubt about it. Right.
Story_ID: 531925
Speaker 1: What was the name, name of the neighborhood you grew up in, in Minneapolis [Minnesota], was it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was north Minneapolis.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There's a black community there?
Speaker 2: It wasn't really, it was--the black community was about a mile east of us, 'cause as I said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, oh. Right, you were in an isolated (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --our house was built before there was a black community around that area.
Speaker 1: That's right, you did say that.  That's right.  Yeah, I'm getting that mixed up with the size of the black--the very small number of black folks in Minneapolis especially in those days (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very small, yeah. Yep.
Speaker 1: So, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Let's see. Sights, well one of the things that's Minneapolis is a city of parks and lakes and there was a park name Glenwood Park [Minneapolis, Minnesota] that was near us going to our house.  And so, my mother [Florence Thomas Smith] and I was usually the two of us would walk to the Glenwood Park and Glenwood lake [Birch Pond] and walk around there and see that, that part of the, of the city.  The other sights that I'm reminded of are--is the state fair [Minnesota State Fair], that was a big deal in Minnesota so the family, the three of us would always go to the state fair, sometimes my grandmother [Johanna Johanson Thomas].  And that, the big event for my father [Pleasant Breeden] there was the auto racing that was--we'd always go watch that.  Oh, fishing, my dad got--had an outboard motor and we would rent a boat and fish.  But I would go fishing with my peers and we'd go--we never caught anything much as I recall but we, we'd go a lot of times out fishing.  Those are the main ones I think.
Speaker 1: Any smells?
Speaker 2: Smells.
Speaker 1: People always forget smells.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, the one, one smell that comes to mind is a--what's the name--but there was a mill near our house just I think on the way to Glenwood Park, and when you got near the mill, you would smell the flour being in the air that was being, was being milled.  So that was a--that's one that I remember quite well.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, Minnesota is a--I mean, well, Minneapolis is the home of a couple of the big grain companies and cereal companies, right.  Was it General Mills [General Mills Inc.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, General Mills.
Speaker 1: Betty Crocker and--
Speaker 2: And there're quite a few actually.  I mean at least there were, I think they're not there necessarily any longer.  But, yeah, I don't remember their names anymore.
Story_ID: 531926
Speaker 1: We were talking about the strand of progressivism in, in the, in Minne- in Minneapolis [Minnesota] and Minnesota in general.  Did you find that to be true growing up that people tended to be more liberal maybe than in some other states, I mean in their attitude towards black people and other minorities (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I, I always had a pretty easy time growing up.  I mean, I was, you know, sort of an attractive smart black kid and people were generally very positive towards me.  There'd be, you know, the occasional incident, I remember I used to go every night skating at a local pond and one, one night I got, got there and a stranger took out a knife and said, you know--pocket knife and said, you know, "You don't belong here you should be at such and such a some other place."  And all of my friends, all whom were white, sort of surrounded him and explained to him that I did belong here and maybe he didn't belong here (laughter) and so, that was the kind of atmosphere that I grew up in.  And, I always had a good experience in school with teachers and principals and that kind of thing.  My [maternal] uncle [John Thomas] had been a classmate I think of Hubert Humphrey and, and that was, you know, that he had been very active in the Democratic Party.  And I think in Minnesota it was the Democratic Farmer Labor [Democratic Farmer Labor Party] which was a more left-ish wing of the Democratic Party.  At some point, my uncle got in--was being investigated by McCarthy, Joe McCarthy [Joseph McCarthy], because he had been involved in some left wing stuff when he was in, in college [University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota].  And he just called and Hubert Humphrey, who protected him from that kind of, you know, anti-Communist craziness that Joe McCarthy was, was into.
Speaker 1: Now, he's a Minnesota senator himself, Joseph McCarthy, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, he's Wisconsin.
Speaker 1: Wisconsin, oh, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yep, he was Wisconsin.  Yeah, that's the other side of Wisconsin politics (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know there were a lot of--there still is a lot of tension in, in Wisconsin and I think in Minnesota with the, the Indians and their fishing rights, that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's, that's a sort of later than my time but I picked up some of it when I was in--much later when I was at Dartmouth  College [Hanover, New Hampshire] of course where there was a Native American program and there was a lot of issue about the Indian symbol for the, for the Dartmouth sports and that kind of stuff.  But there were several Native Americans who were in Dartmouth's programs who were from Minnesota.  It was the Chippewa or Ojibwe tribes that would be connected with that.  Yeah, Minnesota by and large at least in my experience was a, was a very liberal, open state.  And, as I said, most of my experience was as the, the only black kid in a white environment.  Most of the class schools I went to there might be one other black kid in the class, maybe two or three in the school.  I, I was very--I was often, you know, the president of the class or the--some kind of main officer in the, in the class activities.  I remember it almost got funny at the high school graduation [from North High School; North Community High School, Minneapolis, Minnesota] 'cause I had so many awards that the audience was kind of laughing.  (Laughter) By the time I'd gotten called to the podium the fifth or sixth time for some kind of award.  But, so, I, you know that, I, I had a good, a good background in, in that.
Story_ID: 531927
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, what do you account for the success in academics, your, your father [Pleasant Breeden] didn't--he dropped out of high school, became a porter, I mean, a, a waiter.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Your, your mother [Florence Thomas Smith], she did finish and was in a secretarial job (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She did finish high school, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but nobody had really gone to college in the family so--
Speaker 2: Right, my uncle [John Thomas], my uncle was my role model and I used to read the box of books that he had from his college experience [at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota] that were in the basement.  And I, I never, I never doubted but that I would go to college right from the start.  I was always--it was always a, you know, was it gonna be doctor, lawyer or whatever but there was certainly gonna be a college education.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you're, and you're the only child in the family, right?
Speaker 2: That's correct, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, who was in your household, just your mother and father and you or
Speaker 2: Well, my mother, father and grandmother [Johanna Johanson Thomas].  It was actually my grandmother's house from my grandfather's [Frederick Thomas] time.  And then my aunt, my mother's sister [Lillian Thomas] lived there until she died, which was fairly early, in 1944.  And before he went into the [U.S.] Army, my uncle lived there, you know, off and on.  So, so I was the only kid in the, in the environment and I spent most of my time either reading in the house or out in the street playing.
Story_ID: 531928
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Church was, because my mother [Florence Thomas Smith] was a very devout Episcopalian and there was a one African American Episcopal church on the south side, the other side of town.
Speaker 1: What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: St. Thomas Episcopal Church [Minneapolis, Minnesota].  And it was a long trip we had to go, you know, a couple of different streetcars it was then.  So it was like an hour's trip from our home to the church, but we went almost every Sunday.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was an altar boy, and it was too far away to be part of any, you know, social group or anything because I couldn't, couldn't get to that but, but definitely the altar boy part of it.
Story_ID: 531929
Speaker 1: I know they had--there's several of the people we interviewed in Minnesota talked about that there was a settlement house there.  I don't know if it was named after Hallie Q. Brown [Hallie Quinn Brown] or was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There was one [Phyllis Wheatley Settlement House; Phyllis Wheatley Community Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota], yeah.  Yeah, my [maternal] uncle [John Thomas] actually worked that settlement house when he was growing up.  I never did either the Y [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)] or the, or the settlement house thing.  My big thing actually was Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America].  I got recruited into the Boy Scouts when I was twelve or thirteen and we went to a summer camp, Many Point Scout Camp [Ponsford, Minnesota], which was run in a kind of old traditional scout style where it wasn't like the big Y camp thing.  It was each troop got its location and they ran their own operations pretty much on their own.  And that's the way my troop operated, so that you--there was a lot of opportunity for leadership among the kids.  And I was recruited from that to be a counselor in training at the camp, which I was for seven or eight years.  And went up through the ranks from counselor in training to director of the conservation lodge which was the nature piece of the camp.  Also, while I was in, in that I got invited to go to the World Scout, World Jamboree [World Scout Jamboree] in Austria so that was my first trip outside the United States.
Speaker 1: How, how old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was--see junior in high school [North High School; North Community High School, Minneapolis, Minnesota], so I would have been sixteen.
Speaker 1: That's exciting.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: World Scout Jamboree in Austria.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you remember what--where in Austria?  What city in Austria?
Speaker 2: Bad Ischl [Austria], I-S-C-H-L.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And, and you're about sixteen?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: About sixteen, okay.
Story_ID: 531930
Speaker 1: Was radio or television a big factor in growing up or the movies or those kind of things?
Speaker 2: Movies certainly, there were double features every Saturday that I think went every (laughter) week to those.  Radio, I mean, I--the main--what were they, 'The Shadow,' those kinds of radio programs.  TV was just barely appearing when I was--I remember my next door neighbor got a little tiny TV set when I was--I think my first year in college [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] and it would be a big thing to go up there and watch TV.  We weren't much into records, there were just a couple of records I enjoyed were mostly Spike Jones [Spike Jones and His City Slickers] type of (laughter) you know, funny records.
Story_ID: 531931
Speaker 1: What was your first grade school?
Speaker 2: First grade school was Harrison [William H. Harrison Elementary School, Minneapolis, Minnesota].
Speaker 1: Okay, and so you say you were a good student throughout pretty much, huh (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was--I graduated from--I was president of the graduating class in Harrison, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, and are there any particular teachers in grade school that stand out that, that paid special attention to you or recognized?
Speaker 2: I'm sure there were, but I don't really remember.  There was the, the principal I think of the grade school was Beth Rude [ph.] and she was very good and very solicitous of me I think.  And my father [Pleasant Breeden] mentioned her more than once as being his--he being very grateful for her attention, attentiveness to me.
Speaker 1: Now were, were you the only African American student in the class?
Speaker 2: I think there may have been--there were probably three in the school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can only remember there was one boy and one girl that I was sometimes in class with.
Story_ID: 531932
Speaker 1: Did they have middle school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was called junior high in Minneapolis [Minnesota].
Speaker 1: Okay, what was the name of your junior high school?
Speaker 2: Junior high was Lincoln [Abraham Lincoln Junior High School, Minneapolis, Minnesota].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so any, any special teachers there, or?
Speaker 2: Again, names fail me.  There was a teacher who was the coach of the debate team, debate was my sport.  I used to--since most people thought, since I was African American, that I must be good at sports.  I would, I would often say, well, "The only sport I'm good at is debate but I'm pretty good at chess." (Laughter) But that would be--that would usually end that conversation. (Laughter) But, now I was in the second tennis team in, in junior high, which meant just about as bad as you can get (laughter).
Story_ID: 531933
Speaker 1: Now where'd you go to high school?
Speaker 2: High school was North High [North High School; North Community High School, Minneapolis, Minnesota].
Speaker 1: North High, okay.  Still were there like only about three black students at North High?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's different now.  Now North High I think is mostly black, but at that time it was, it was at least in our mythology it was mostly Jewish.  I'm, not really sure that was true.
Speaker 1: Okay, but the Jewish community had a real solid presence there I guess in terms of--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.  And it was a--again, my impression was it was a economically higher class community.  The kids like in grade school [William H. Harrison Elementary School, Minneapolis, Minnesota] were pretty much other side of the tracks kids.  We were, we were a solid poor class, I mean, my father [Pleasant Breeden] was steadily employed and so on, but some of my classmates were not.  They were in--were poorer really, you know, unstable poor kinds of economic situations.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did, did you, have any mentors in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my, my big interest in high school was science and so the particularly the chemistry teacher, Park [ph.] I think his name was, he had been in the [U.S.] Navy and was, was always trying to encourage me to go to the Naval Academy [United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland] and, and I didn't have a great interest in that.  But, but he would let me go into the laboratory and fool around with my own experiments while he was teaching the class.  And so, the English professor, who was also the football coach, I enjoyed--we had a good time together.
Story_ID: 531934
Speaker 1: During high school [North High School; North Community High School, Minneapolis, Minnesota] you went on the, the jamboree [World Scout Jamboree], you know, in Austria [Bad Ischl, Austria] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, yes.
Speaker 1: Now what was that, you know, that had to be really a tremendous experience, are there any stories from that experience that you could tell us?
Speaker 2: Well, the interesting--it was two different things.  There was a big encampment with kids from all over the world and, you know, and whatever units they created.  So, we had one unit from the United States, which was I think six hundred kids from all over the states, so we, we, learned a lot of things about language and customs and all that.  Not that they formally did anything, it was just kind of, of the immersion and things that we'd run into and the, the, the--a lot of it was sort of superficial but kind of interesting that, for instance, every day a truck would come around loaded with loaves of bread and they'd just throw loaves of bread off.  That would be our bread supply for the day (laughter).
Speaker 1: Without any wrappers or anything?
Speaker 2: Not any wrappers, no, just (laughter) the bread.  We had one kid in from Montana who, who had very carefully learned one sentence in every language he could think of so that when we were out, when we were in Austria, he would go up to people and say, (speaking German) "Sprechen sie Deutsch," and they'd, oh, you know, and they'd go on, and he would look blankly at them because he (laughter) couldn't understand a word after that.  And so that was his, his, his thing.  No, I think we--I mean, one of the things we learned a lot about in a way and experienced was the, the United States and variety and size of the United States that was, that was quite, quite a new thing for most of us who hadn't had that much exposure outside our local areas.  And my group was particularly from--well, it was the North, Northwest, which meant it went from roughly Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, west to Montana.  I remember one of the kids from Bozeman, Montana that was--so that was a kind of interesting span.  That was one the set that was closest to us.
Speaker 1: I would guess there weren't many black kids in your group at all.
Speaker 2: No, I think I was the only one.  And my sponsor there was from Minneapolis [Minnesota] and was a prominent white Republican lawyer, who was very active in the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America], and so he was the one essentially who, who spotted me and, you know, got me into it.  Then, interestingly enough, that segued into Dartmouth College [Hanover, New Hampshire] 'cause he was a trustee at Dartmouth College.  And while I had never thought of going anywhere but the University of Minnesota [University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota] to that point, he called me into his office and talked to me about Dartmouth and why didn't I think of Dartmouth?  He actually, you know, they give you the financial aid forms to fill out what you need, and of course I thought what you do is you put the least possible you think you could get along on.  So I brought it into his office and he looked at it and frowned and erased things and doubled those figures (laughter) and he couldn't figure out how to--he says, "This is not enough, you can't possibly get along on this."  So, but he was a very--John, John Faegre, Jr. [John B. Faegre, Jr.]--
Speaker 1: How do you spell his last name?
Speaker 2: F-A-E-G-R-E. And he was, he was usually--he was a hockey player when he was in college and was very well-known for recruiting hockey players from the, from the iron mine ar- areas.  So I was kind of a, a new, new kind of project for him.
Story_ID: 531935
Speaker 1: When you were in high school [North High School; North Community High School, Minneapolis, Minnesota] now, you, you're there like until '52 [1952], you graduate in what '52 [1952]?
Speaker 2: Right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, how is your social life in high school? Did--as one of the few black kids in the school (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All-male.
Speaker 1: --did, did, did you date and stuff?
Speaker 2: No, it was all-male.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, all-male, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that somebody for the high school prom, somebody found a black girl to be my date for the prom, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What do you mean when you say, somebody found one, I mean, did--okay.
Speaker 2: One of the teachers who (laughter) kind of knew, knew one of the--I think she had graduated a year ahead of me or two years ahead of me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, yes, it was totally, totally celibate and male (laughter).
Story_ID: 531936
Speaker 1: So when you graduated [from North High School; North Community High School, Minneapolis, Minnesota] you had all these activities and awards and you said it was even, almost ridiculous to the audience how many things that you were doing and how many things that you were excelling in--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at that time. Did, were, were you the valedictorian, or?
Speaker 2: I was the salutatorian, that was another characteristic I guess that I, I didn't--studies were not difficult for me so I never really worked for grades and I didn't particularly care about them.  So where I probably could have gotten a couple more A's if I had worked for them, I didn't (laughter) so someone else was valedictorian and I, I was salutatorian without any effort.  There's a kind of funny story about that because, when I graduated from, from college [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire], you're supposed to put in a list of courses that constitute your major and it's that set of courses that tells you whether you're magna cum laude or and Phi Beta Kappa [Phi Beta Kappa Society].  And so, being uncalculating as I was, I didn't really think about that and I just put the courses I liked whereas, if I had calculated it, I could have gotten both of (laughter) those.  So, some of my professors were outraged and they said, you know, they tried to get in the meeting where all these decisions are made, they tried to get them to, to change the listing on my, my thing and--but the, the more rigid ones won so, so I cum laude and not quite, not quite Phi Beta--
Story_ID: 531937
Speaker 1: So you told us how you got set up to go to Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] and so you went to Dart- Dartmouth in '52 [1952] I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Class of 19--starting in 1952.  How did you like Dartmouth?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I liked it, I mean, I think what--I enjoyed it 'cause it was one that was out in the woods, which I had come to enjoy from my time in northern Minnesota.  I was the--entering class was about roughly seven hundred students and about six hundred had come from private schools, and about one hundred from public schools.  So, and of that a number of those from kind of elite public schools.  Well, I was not from an elite public school.  I was from a very ordinary public school [North High School; North Community High School, Minneapolis, Minnesota].  So the first, the first part of freshman year was kind of a shock because I didn't, you know, I didn't know a lot of stuff that private school kids knew about how to turn in papers late and (laughter) do all these kinds of things, drinking parties, all that stuff was new to me.  Eventually, not too long I sort of figured all that out and I got a group of us, who were I think with one exception public school scholarship kids, found each other and we ate together every night in the dining hall.  And we're all very bright and, you know, so on, so that actually I learned several years later that the college had kind of spotted us as the potentially (laughter) trouble groups.  So they kind of monitored our behavior 'cause there (laughter). And it was true, I mean, there was some, some difficult ones among us.  But--
Speaker 1: In, in what sense, I mean, were they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, one of them, for instance, who came to--he came to college having the manuscript of a novel with him.  And he claimed that this novel had seven different levels of meaning in it, and, and we would--he was in the group and we would do things like read poetry aloud and the other group members liked my voice so I was usually the poetry reader.  But, any rate, he went off, left a suicide note at one point and went off into the woods and we're never sure if he was found later.  But we were never sure whether he really was intending to commit suicide or not, but any rate he was, he was thrown out of college because of that.  And he went to a, to a local college and then got his Ph.D. and became a professor of comparative literature.  So he had quite an academic career after that.
Story_ID: 531938
Speaker 1: Nowadays Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] has a--has this conservative kind of image I guess to the general public because of The Dartmouth Review, is what--is, how, how would you characterize Dartmouth when you were there, and?
Speaker 2: It was still sort of conservative but not organized conservative.  I mean it was, it was the typical thing with the students thought the faculty were too liberal and the student polls would turn out to be Republican for the most part.  They weren't--when I was there, you have to remember it was the Joseph McCarthy period and students weren't in the Joseph McCarthy camp.  There was a TV set in the student area and there'd be maybe twenty, thirty students would come in there to watch the hearings.  But, but it wasn't--I mean I wouldn't characterize it as a particularly right wing in any kind of vigorous right wing way.  The--I actually got my sort of leftish leanings at Dartmouth.  I would say that through my high school years [at North High School; North Community High School, Minneapolis, Minnesota], I was kind of politically unconscious I didn't really think much of anything.  I know my father [Pleasant Breeden] had more political consciousness, I can remember him coming in one day laughing about Gandhi [Mahatma Gandhi] and he said this little old, little man in the, in the white sheet has brought the British empire to its knees.  And he used to tell stories of A. Philip Randolph and Franklin Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] and those kinds of things.  But that's about it, nothing, no, no really serious long term political stuff at home.  When I got to Dartmouth there was an organization called the Dartmouth Christian Union, which was the student--world student movement.  It was a part of the Christian student movement.  And the chaplain [George H. Kalbfleisch] to the Dartmouth Christian Union was really a left wing-ish kind of person, and so both radical Christian theology of the Karl Barth, Reinhold Niebuhr, that kind of theology and more radical American politics is what I learned and got, you know, involved in and at Dartmouth.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that, that's a philosophy that you should, you should confront things that are wrong and try to change them.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right. And that you should be--you should focus on the rights of poor people and, and social justice issues and that sort of, that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 531939
Speaker 1: That's really where I also started to become race conscious in a way.  Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] like everything before in my life was mostly white, and there were three black students in my class, and not improbably, the three of us turned up in a top floor room triple.  And I had, I hadn't really thought about it 'cause I had been, been accepting of the hype in Dartmouth's literature about how it was this world, you know, introducing you to a broad world and all this stuff.  And so, although I, I later had many occasions to tell this story, I said, well, you know, it was in fact for me an introduction to something new, because I had never roomed with two black peers before.  So even at my household I was not (laughter) with, within a totally black community [in Minneapolis, Minnesota], so that was new.  But Dartmouth didn't know it, and, and none of the three of us roomed with black roommates after that so, you know, that was, that was just--
Speaker 2: So did you room together throughout college, I mean, throughout the college experience, same people or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No.  No, no, no.
Speaker 2: Okay. That's when you were a freshman? Okay.
Speaker 1: Freshman, yeah, that's before we had any choice.  I mean I, I think--I don't know how they did it, whether they said, do you know, do you have any choices or they just assumed that, you know, black kids would be--choose black kids or that white kids wouldn't or whatever, but--
Speaker 2: And you were on a top floor of the dormitory?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Were you the only students up there?
Speaker 1: Right, that was the, that was the least desirable (laughter) place to be in a way, least exposed.  And then the kids under us would do things like, you know, the black hand symbol for the mafia?  They would put those things up by our--in our hallway, stuff like that.
Speaker 2: I had mentioned that I was--that debate was my major sport and so I was in the debate, freshman debate team [at Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire].  And when the national freshman debate time came up, I was--the coach came up to me and said, "We're gonna be at Johns Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland] and, you know, they're pro- they're uncomfortable with having black people in the, in their competition and so, would you mind not going?"  And so--
Speaker 1: This Johns Hopkins of Baltimore [Maryland], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Same school, now, now we know that one of the principle heart surgeons there was one of the guys that worked in the--well, you know the story about the doctor [Vivien Thomas] there that, that did the heart surgery--the pioneer heart--he, he wasn't a doctor but cleaned up the lab.  There, there's a TV movie ['Something the Lord Made'] about him now.  They've given him awards in retrospect and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.  So, anyway, that was, you know, he just sort of quietly spoke to me and I quietly said, you know, "Sure."  But this is 1952, so, you know, this is not--this would almost certainly not be the reaction of either party (laughter) in, in 2007. So, that was one experience like that.
Story_ID: 531940
Speaker 1: The other one was the totally opposite experience at the Dartmouth Christian Union, when there was a conference in Ohio.  And the chaplain [George H. Kalbfleisch] got a letter saying, if you have any black students in your delegation, you should tell them--I forget the name of the town that you would come into--Athens, Ohio?
Speaker 2: Oh, Ohio University [Athens, Ohio], yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Athens, Ohio, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's in the foothills of the Appalachian [Appalachian Mountains] on the northeastern [sic. southeastern] part of Ohio (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The--yeah, and they said that, if they get off the train in Athens, they should come right to the university because Athens is not necessarily hospitable to, to black people.  And, you know, don't try to get a haircut or do anything like that in Athens.  Well, he was outraged.  He said, you know, what--, "Why are they holding your conference there if--and why would they be sending a letter telling us that after, you know, they've chosen the conference place and to, you know," to cover their asses about what might happen, some incident that might occur. "We will under no circumstances go to this conference."  And I was like, "Whoa," (laughter), you know, that's a way to go.  So, you know, it was, it was very much an eye opener to me and very different than a lot of responses to things that were happening in '56 [1956].  Well, this would have been '55 [1955], so it's after the [U.S.] Supreme Court decision of Brown versus Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], it's before Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and--
Speaker 2: Montgomery Bus Boycott.
Speaker 1: Montgomery Bus Boycott, but it's in, you know, it's in that spirit.  And, and he was very much--he's white, he's not, you know, he comes from Missouri some, you know, sort of not particularly well known for its militancy on race matters (laughter), but he was, he was, he was very clear that this was not, not an acceptable thing.  So that was my first kind of exposure to that kind of sharp reaction to race issues.
Speaker 2: So you all didn't go to that conference in Athens (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We didn't, definitely did not go.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 531941
Speaker 1: Who were some of the professors at, at Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] that, that influenced you the most?
Speaker 2: Let's see, there were--I was a philosophy, comparative literature major.  The--although my actual--I started as a chemistry major and then got more interested in philosophy and comparative literature.  The chemistry professor, who I knew very well or who knew me very well, was upset that I was making this change, and he said, you know, "You can read philosophy and literature and still do chemistry you don't need to--."  So, any rate, the philosophy professor was probably my most--my mentor was a guy named Francis Gramlich, G-R-A-M-L-I-C-H, and he was a neo-Freudian trained, Jesuit trained--ran his classes in a very, what I've considered, very wonderful way.  He'd have his students write papers and read them to the classes and then discuss, so it was a very kind of advanced style of, of teaching.  There was a professor named Wilson [Arthur McCandless Wilson] who taught in the biography department, and he was, he was very influential.  But certainly this--the fellow I was mentioning earlier, the chaplain, he was actually called the executive secretary of the, of the Dartmouth Christian Union.  This one you'll have to have spelled out, it's George and his last name was Kalbfleisch [George H. Kalbfleisch], K-A-L-B-F-L-E-I-S-C-H, which translated, if you know German, is veal (laughter) so the joke was that some German people would say, "Every time we hear your name, George, our mouths water," (laughter). Those were the major ones.
Story_ID: 531942
Speaker 1: I mean, I did well at Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] and I got their--the top scholarship for my senior year, and I was in the thing called Palaeopitus [Palaeopitus Senior Society], which is their kind of elite group that's student government of the college.  And, again, so I was--it was not--it was a, for the most part with minor exceptions, a very positive experience for me.
Speaker 2: Are any--okay.  Once again, there were very few black students on campus right, I imagine?
Speaker 1: We once figured out that, since 1900, there had never been more than a dozen black students except once in a while the number would go up above a dozen.  And then, mysteriously, it would fall back to a dozen by the next (laughter), the next year.  So that was it.  I got into some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As if it was being--yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Some trouble later on when I was on the staff of Dartmouth because then you were supposed to say the party line was, that in affirmative action, well, we don't have quotas.  And I used to always say that, well, you know, for as far as I can tell for at least fifty years you did have quotas.  And they would, no, no, no, we didn't have quotas, they'd say.  Well, twelve students a year for fifty years (laughter) seems a pretty hard number to get to without quotas.
Story_ID: 531943
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduation [from Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire], what, what were your prospects?  Where were you--what were you gonna do?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a, a--it was a way that, that got delayed 'cause I got a, a grant from the so-called Rockefeller [Rockefeller Foundation] grant that gave you a no-strings attached year at a theological seminary.  And so my chaplain [George H. Kalbfleisch] had always said that any serious Christian should take a year at a seminary just to get theologically educated.  So, here I was with this scholarship and so I had, I had wanted to go into teaching probably philosophy or possibly theology.  And, but I had this grant for a year so I decided to go to Union Theological Seminary in New York [New York], which I did do, and got hooked on it and stayed for four years actually, it took me to get my degree.  And went to the Episcopal--I was a, a--in the Diocese of Massachusetts [Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts] so--I'm sorry, in the Diocese of Minnesota [Episcopal Church in Minnesota]. So I went to my bishop in Minnesota, Hamilton Kellogg [Hamilton Hyde Kellogg], and told him that I was at Union Seminary and asked--you have to get permission from your bishop to go to a seminary other than Episcopal--and asked him and he said, you know, he didn't really care because, any rate, there were only two Negro parishes in Minnesota and both of them had priests who weren't likely to die soon.  And so, you know, it'd be hard for me to have--find a place in Minnesota.  He knew that I wanted to work in the inner city and he said that was a church called Gethsemane [Gethsemane Episcopal Church, Minneapolis, Minnesota] in the inner city but that it was fully staffed, and I could possibly get a part-time, part-time appointment there.  There were some places in the Indian [Native American] reservations in the north where I might--he might find a place for me.  And later his, his associate wrote me and gave me a couple of northern Minnesota places that he'd suggested.  So, basically, I was, you know, it was fine that I finished seminary but I had to find my own place to go after that.
Story_ID: 531944
Speaker 1: What else did you do in New York City [New York, New York]? When--so you were like there like four years working on your master's [degree].
Speaker 2: I was working--well, actually I took one year to go on the first Crosswords Africa [sic. Operation Crossroads Africa] trip.  Went to Nigeria and then went to the Graduate School of Ecumenical Studies in Geneva, Switzerland, where I also was married in Geneva.  And we studied Roman Catholic, Protestant relations, Christianity and revolution, and--
Speaker 1: When did you--well, let's go back a little bit to the Crossroads (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: Not this is, is a historic program, still exists, Crossroads to Africa.  I know people that have gone over--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So this is the first program?
Speaker 2: It was the first one (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) First one.
Speaker 2: Yeah, James Robinson [James H. Robinson] had been--actually, he'd, he had spoken at Middlebury [Middlebury College, Middlebury, Vermont] about Africa and it's, you know, coming of age.  And my wife [Jeanne Savoye Breeden], whom I'd then, you know, was before I knew her, and some of the other women who heard him went and talked to him and said, "Well, could we put together some kind of program to go to Africa?"  And he said he was intrigued by the idea and said that he would think about it and they--that's basically the, the genesis of Crossroads to Africa.
Speaker 1: Did it have any link at all to the activities of Hansberry [William Leo Hansberry] at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], who was at Howard, the African studies?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I wondered if it did.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it could have but I, I don't know that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause I know he had the African institute in Washington [sic. Africa-American Institute; The Africa-America Institute, New York, New York], helping African students on this side and strong associated with--association with Nnamdi Azikiwe, the president [of Nigeria].  I don't know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, this was--well, that could be, because I think it basically stemmed out of whatever relationships James Robinson had in, you know, his connections I know with, with the Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] administration was a part of it.  And, and it was a, a precursor in part of the Peace Corps, you know, segued over into Kennedy's [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] ideas with the Peace Corps.  We went to--our group (background noise).
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION).
Speaker 2: Okay, now so, we were talking about Crossroads and James Robinson and it being a precursor of the Peace Corps, which I think Peace Corps started in what '65 [1965], '64 [1964] I think.
Speaker 1: Was it that late?
Speaker 2: I think so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it could have been.
Speaker 2: Wait, no, maybe not.  That's right, I'm thinking about VISTA [Volunteers in Service to America; AmeriCorps VISTA], but Peace Corps started before VISTA.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Right, it sure did.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think Peace Corps was probably '60 [1960] or '61 [1961].
Speaker 2: Maybe.
Speaker 1: But I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we interviewed Sam Yette [HistoryMaker Samuel Yette], who worked with, with--he was in charge of the Peace Corps only on but I'm not, yeah.  Okay, well, any rate, yeah, I know it, it, yeah, it probably started in '60 [1960] or '61 [1961].  Peace Corps right after Crossroads I guess started I guess, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause we were on Crossroads in '58 [1958] I think that was the first year.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then they didn't have enough money to do it in '59 [1959], and then they did it again in '60 [1960] and then I think the Peace Corps came in.  I think that was one of Kennedy's first, you know, initiatives in his administration.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was Sargent Shriver [R. Sargent Shriver] I think was in charge.
Speaker 1: Shriver was one of the directors, first directors (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now this is--
Story_ID: 531945
Speaker 1: Now this--1958, this is prior to Nigerian independence isn't it, with a?
Speaker 2: It was, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: We, we were talking with various potential rulers of Nigeria.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was the agenda?  What all did you see and do [during the Operation Crossroads Africa trip]?
Speaker 2: Well, we basically--first of all it was a, you know, a people to people kind of--that was the kind of slogan under which it went.  And to go and--the idea, the initial idea, and was true in four of the five countries, was to have a work camp with the students from the country that we were with.  Nigeria had three very strong districts so we couldn't work out of a work camp that stayed in one of the districts.  There was too much competition among the districts, so we went on a--around, between a four and five thousand mile trip by bus through the three districts.  So, we went--we started in the, in the Yoruba district in the west and we went to the Ibo [Igbo] district and then we went to the--what's the northern one?
Speaker 1: Hausa?
Speaker 2: Hausa, right.  And, you know, and roughly spent roughly maybe three weeks in each district going from village to village and meeting with various prominent people in there, and talking with schools.  We spent most of our time in schools and in village councils, sometimes religious organizations.

Speaker 1: Was Africa what you had imagined it to be, and, and I don't know what you had imagined it be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Right, Larry [Larry Crowe].
Speaker 1: --at that point but, but what, what was it what you--were you surprised at what you found?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess I was surprised at one level.  The main level at which I was surprised is I had sort of romantic notions about how I could go to Africa and be helpful there.  And so that got pretty well shattered because Africa was a very complex place that I wasn't really ready to go to, and certainly couldn't be very helpful. (Laughter) And so that was, that was one of the things.  And then the second thing which I actually didn't learn then but I learned after I got back to the United States, my impression of Africa was that a lot of stuff was kind of not together like, you know, we'd go to a town council and it would be sort of chaotic and various, you know, sort of things.  Well, I had never been to things like Boston City Council or, you know, bureaucracies in Boston [Massachusetts] or whatever, so I didn't really know what they were like in the United States.  I had this picture of what things were like in the United States, which were dead wrong, and actually United States was much more like Africa than (laughter) I had imagined. (Laughter) You know, so.
Speaker 1: Boston City Council can get--
Speaker 2: Right, absolutely, absolutely, or you know, you go to a bureaucracy and find that its records are in shoeboxes, it's in the basement (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's interesting, you know, point of comparison 'cause people often do imagine they put this, this strong image of what the U.S. is supposed to be and what everything is supposed to be and go to another place and expect it not to be that.
Speaker 2: Exactly, so, yeah.  So, so then it was also after we left Africa, Nigeria, we went to Switzerland and there we were, as I say, we were married.
Speaker 1: So you met your, your, your wife [Jeanne Savoye Breeden] on the, on the Crossroads [Operation Crossroads Africa] tour or before this (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, actually we had, we had met at--well, actually when we were seniors in college [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] and that relationship had grown when we were in seminary where she is also a graduate of Union Seminary [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we had, we had decided to get married and she's white and her parents were not enthusiastic about this marriage.  So we thought, if we did it in Geneva [Switzerland], they would have a little more opportunity to absorb it, (laughter) which was true.
Story_ID: 531947
Speaker 1: Now, I, I don't wanna put this ahead, but what was the next leg?  After Nigeria, you went to--
Speaker 2: Oh, we went to Geneva, Switzerland.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's where my wife [Jeanne Savoye Breeden] and I were married.  We had, we had first met when we were seniors in college [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] and, as I think I mentioned, she was, she was one of the people who got the idea of Crosswords Africa [sic. Operation Crossroads Africa] going, and with Jim Robinson [James H. Robinson].  She's white and we knew that her parents were not enthusiastic, actually, that's a minor statement.  But we had been counseled that to not sort of talk about it, just do it, and Geneva would give them the best opportunity not to do something they would be ashamed of.  And they could work their way into it.
Speaker 1: Now, where were her parents from?
Speaker 2: East Coast, where is it, near New Haven, Connecticut although they moved around a lot 'cause her mother had--was ill and they were trying to find a place for her asthma would not be, you know, would be better but it never--they never worked that out.
Story_ID: 531948
Speaker 1: Off camera during the break we talked about Ghana, was this on the same trip? Did you go (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On the same trip, our first--
Speaker 1: So, so you went back to Africa after going--you went to Nigeria to Ghana, I mean, to, Switzerland and back to--okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.  We were on our way to Nigeria.  We stopped in Ghana, and in Accra [Ghana], the Accra airport [Kotoka International Airport, Accra, Ghana], we went to the Accra airport to see Kwame Nkrumah come back from his eight independent nation trip, eight African independent nations trip and so we, we saw him get off the plane and then saw his, his limousine procession, which went quite close to us, but it was all blackened windows and, you know, you couldn't see anything.  So the best shot of him was waiving his handkerchief as it came down the, the ramp of the plane, and somebody said that the worst decision they ever made, was to try to take a picture of the limousine (laughter) 'cause they saw nothing.  They have no impression of anything (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, but that was a kind of big event for, for that trip.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Ghana was one of the few independent nations at that point, right? But they soon would all be (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right, and he had gone to like Egypt and I mean, all of the African--independent African nations.  Ethiopia.
Speaker 1: Now, now this is prior--I guess this is during the formation of the Organization of African Unity or--
Speaker 2: I think that's right, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, 'cause he and Nasser [Gamal Abdel Nasser] I know had a lot to do with that.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  So, after Switzerland you flew back to the U.S.?
Speaker 2: Came back to the U.S., did a, a summer to get rid of our debts and then went back to Union Seminary [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York] where I finished up.  By then, Jeanne [Jeanne Savoye Breeden] was pregnant so she was needing more sleep than she (laughter)--so she finished up a year later.
Story_ID: 531949
Speaker 1: Now at Union [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York]--I'm--you had mentioned the works of Reinhold Niebuhr and some other people.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Who, what, what professors there influenced you the most?
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting Reinhold Niebuhr was essentially retired.  He had taught but he was, he was much--he had, had a stroke and he was much--a much different man than he was when, when he made his, you know, main contributions to American politics and theology.  We only--the stories were told that when he lectured he was very animated, you know, energetic person.  And he'd be on his chair or on his desk or (laughter) constantly in motion, but now he was just, you know, seated and was very--didn't have much physical control.  So, very bright, I mean, still, still witty and bright.
Speaker 1: Now, were you aware at that time that, you know, people say now--they write that he was one of the major influences on Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and is that--was that well known then or--
Speaker 2: Not really, I mean, there're two things.  Niebuhr was also from Missouri, same actually the same denomination that my college chaplain [George H. Kalbfleisch] was from.  And Niebuhr was not enthusiastic about the Civil Rights Movement.  He thought that, you know, this kind of--I don't know if it's, if it's--well, it sort of like, they're going too far, too fast.  That was his attitude.  And--
Speaker 1: I think most of white America would say that even then (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right, yeah, yeah.  So, 'cause one of my most influential mentors at Union was Bob Brown, Robert Brown [Robert McAfee Brown] and, and he was the one from whom I heard this, this story that he was kind of shocked at Niebuhr's failing to, to, to connect with the, with the movement.
Story_ID: 531950
Speaker 1: I guess there had to be a lot of discussion about what Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was doing in, in Montgomery [Alabama] and the subsequent--I mean, that you know, that was making a lot--this is 1959, '60 [1960]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, so the Montgomery Bus Boycott is over but there're other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. There're actually sit-ins. It was, the main--
Speaker 1: --sit, sit-ins.
Speaker 2: Well, the Freedom Riders were going strong then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, not the Freedom Riders yet.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The sit-ins were, were going on and so there were picket lines from the seminary [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York] going to the local Woolworths [F.W. Woolworth Company], for instance, to support the, the boycott, trying to get boycotts going to the Woolworths.
Speaker 2: And this is in, in, in New York [New York]?
Speaker 1: In New York, yeah, yeah.  And, interestingly enough, that was not a big thing.  I was not terribly much involved in that, I knew my friends were and I knew they were and so--but for whatever reason I wasn't particularly.  I had during my senior year in college [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] taken a big article from The New Yorker to one of the Christian--New England Christian Movement [New England Student Christian Movement] gatherings in--I can't remember which town, but to try to get a resolution supporting the, the Montgomery Improvement [Montgomery Improvement Association] movement in Montgomery, and it didn't, didn't pass.  It was a, you know, pray for both sides, kind of response.  But, anyway.
Speaker 2: Pray for both sides, huh (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Right.  Which I suppose Dr. King would accept. (Laughter) So, no, it was the Freedom Rides--
Story_ID: 531951
Speaker 1: Well, let me untangle the, the job situation.  Minnesota was not--my bishop [Hamilton Hyde Kellogg] was not offering me anything that I was interested in.  His associate bishop was telling me about northern Indian [Native American] things, which I was not interested in.  Someone in Boston [Massachusetts] had, had given an inner city parish enough money to have an additional staff person, that was St. James Episcopal Church [St. John and St. James' Episcopal Church] in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], and so through a variety of, of personal connections I got tied into that and ended up coming to St. James in Roxbury.  Mainly in the position of curate and mainly working with the youth ministry, things like after school programs were kind of study programs which, where we used the brighter kids to be teachers and tutors for the kids who were having trouble in school, and parishioners to run them.  That actually became, fed into later, into Head Start.  That was pre-Head Start when it started.  It was then that I started seeing, as everybody did, that the pictures of the Freedom Rides and, you know, the kids being pulled off the buses and burning the buses and all that stuff.  And I, at the same time got a fellowship from Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire], that would have allowed me to study theology in Edinburgh, Scotland, and so what this--when this Freedom Rides started I called Dartmouth and I said, you know, "I can't leave the United States now.  This is something I have to be involved in."  The--I was part of an organization called the Episcopal Society for Cultural and Racial Unity, ESCRU, and the mission of ESCRU was to call attention to racist, segregationist behaviors of the church on the one hand.  And on the other hand to connect with and support--in support of activities in the Civil Rights Movement.  It was princ- well, not principally, it was both lay people and clergy, and bishops and the Episcopal church were members.  And one of ESCRU colleagues phoned me and said, "Would you be interested in going on a Freedom Ride?"  And, you know, it took me about thirty seconds; of course I would. And so what was that plan, was to go from New Orleans [Louisiana] to the General Convention of the Episcopal church in Detroit [Michigan], to make stops at significant Episcopal places, to--as part of, the first part of its concern, to show where the Episcopal church was colluding with segregationist policies and practices, and to identify with the Civil Rights Movement by going into the Jackson, Mississippi bus terminal.  So we went to--let's see--we started in New Orleans.  I guess we went directly--we must have gone directly to Jackson.  We had, we had already arranged ourselves so that an integrated group would go into the terminal and an integrated group would observe what happened.  Terminal's empty except for a police wagon, we went in, the integrated group went into the Negroes only part of the cafeteria.
Story_ID: 531952
Speaker 1: We were immediately arrested and taken to Jackson city jail [Jackson, Mississippi]. We stayed there six days 'til the trial occurred.  One of the guys from Washington, D.C. was a very dark with short cut hair and when they asked him his race, he said, "Human." And so they interrogated him for about an hour to try to figure out which cell to put him in (laughter) and they finally figured out, correctly, that he was white (unclear) so they got him into the right cell unit.  We were put on trial; the judge was an Episcopalian. He read to us from the prayer book about how we were supposed to obey the civil authorities.  And found us guilty of, in some kind of weird thing, like behavior that was--that might cause civil disturbance or something like that, very vague kind of thing.  And, anyway, there wasn't anybody there to disturb the civil (laughter) whatever, so we got bailed out, two stayed in.  We got bailed--the rest got bailed out, several went to Detroit [Michigan] to the General Convention [General Convention of the Episcopal Church LX] to try to get some energy around some motions in the Episcopal--for the Episcopal church to take some positions, which was successful.  They stopped off at a suburb of Detroit, which was a no blacks, probably no Jews, quota suburb, and probably significant number of Episcopalians to illustrate northern, you know, behavior of the Episcopal church.  We stopped--I can't remember if it was that trip or not, but there had been a big controversy at Sewanee University [The University of the South], the Episcopal school in Tennessee [Sewanee, Tennessee] that had a theological unit to it.  And all the theological faculty had resigned because the, the university wouldn't change its policies on race.  We went there and visited with the, with the whatever rector or president of that, but at any rate, that was part of the, of the, of a kind of continuum.
Story_ID: 531953
Speaker 1: When I got back to Boston [Massachusetts], you know, there was a lot of kind of speaking and various public attention to this and that's what really put me into the leadership and prominent activities in the civil rights activities in Boston.  So, this would have been '61 [1961] to '65 [1965] I guess.  No, '61 [1961] to '63 [1963].  But that's when, when I was--I had resigned my position at St. James Episcopal Church [St. John and St. James' Episcopal Church, Boston, Massachusetts]. I had been given a position as canon of the cathedral at St. Paul's [Cathedral Church of St. Paul, Boston, Massachusetts] and in with the portfolio of working in the cause of civil rights, I was canon of the cathedral, advisor to the bishop, consultant to the bishop, variety of things.  The bishop was the--at that time, was Anson Phelps Stokes, Jr. [sic. Anson Phelps Stokes III] and he was superb.  He was--you can tell from his name that he's from the kind of upper--the upper world (laughter) of things.
Speaker 2: Right, and also Phelps Stokes is that same Phelps Stokes that's Phelps Stokes Fund and all that?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that's Phelps Stokes Fund, explain what that, that is?
Speaker 1: Well, I'm--there was one of our leaders in the, in the Crossroads Africa [Operation Crossroads Africa] was from Phelps Stokes Fund.  I can't remember her name [Caroline Phelps Stokes], but it's, it's a fund that's been--it's where--I haven't followed it that closely but it's particularly attentive to African things and then also black American things.  It's--I'm trying to remember though, isn't--doesn't that have an earlier history of being involved with getting money out of slavery?
Speaker 2: You know you might be right.  I associate it with just offhand I know what it is and I can't, I can't really pin it down right now, but it has to do with the black colleges [HBCUs] and I think scholarships and things (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, right, yeah, yep, okay, that's, that's the--
Speaker 2: Yeah. But is he--he's a--so his ancestors I guess had something to do with--or his predecessors and his family I guess had something to do with that, 'cause I think it started before (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right. Before--
Speaker 2: --him, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 531954
Speaker 1: Bishop Anson Phelps Stokes [Anson Phelps Stokes III].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he was, he was wonderfully naive.  He wou- he had, he was a very powerful bishop in the Episcopal church and he was, he was--he had spent, before he became bishop in Massachusetts, he had, had a ministry in Hawaii.  So he had a certain kind of breadth of view from that was clear.  But part of what was interesting was that he was, he was very unselfconscious about--he was not a political person at all, and very unselfconscious about his own political power in the church.  So he would do things or support things, you know, just because from his point of view they were right.  And if they--if something happened fine, if it didn't fine.  So it was wonderful to work with him 'cause he also had this quite wonderful relationship with me because he said that first, that I shouldn't ask him permission to do anything in what I was doing, 'cause then he would have to say that, you know, he gave me permission to do it. (Laughter) And he said he would, he would like it if I would--if before I did something, I would, you know, have lunch with him or something and tell him what I was doing and why so that when people phoned him (laughter) he would have some explanation.  And, first I was canon and the bishop's--and vicar that was it vicar in civil rights, which meant the, the bishop's representative.  So then I did something and he called me in and he said, "Well, you're not exactly representing me so why don't we call you my consultant--no, my advisor in civil rights."  So then I did something else, I think this time I had called a press conference in the cathedral [Cathedral Church of St. Paul, Boston, Massachusetts] opposing Goldwater's [Barry Goldwater] candidacy for president or something.  And the (laughter) chairman of the Goldwater committee was head of whatever the diocese and, you know, steering committee is, so he was clearly upset.  So the bishop called me and said, "Well, it's not exactly that you advise me, because I don't always accept your advice, so why don't we call you my consultant on civil rights." (Laughter) So I said, "Fine," you know, so it was just--what was so nice was that he wasn't worried, it never changed our relationship.  He was only trying to figure out a way that he (laughter) could talk about whatever I was doing.  But that was quite, quite good and it meant that, in fact, for those, for those two to three years I was supported by the diocese [Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts].  I mean that's where I got my daily bread and except for the executive director of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], Tommy Atkins [Thomas I. Atkins], I was the only full-time civil rights person in Boston [Massachusetts].  So, and, and Tommy had a board of directors so I didn't, I didn't even have a board of directors.  So I was pretty much, as some people either humorously or otherwise said, a loose canon (laughter).
Speaker 1: Loose canon. With one end, right?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  Okay, so you were able to just throw your weight wherever you wanted or throw the power of the church or whatever resources you had (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 531955
Speaker 1: Well, what were some of the issues here in Boston [Massachusetts] that you--
Speaker 2: Well, the, the biggest one was school desegregation.  And twice I was to serve at the center of a a--an--a effort successful effort to get kids from the Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] schools, these would be the segregated schools, to stay out of school and go to alternative schools and churches, and social centers to call attention to the quality and lack of integration of schools in Boston Public Schools.  So that was a big one.  In housing, I paid most attention--my, I should say is a more general thing.  My--I saw myself as primarily trying to figure out how to make things public and nonviolent and big so that I, I was always trying to figure how to make something larger enough so that it could be seen.  So, for instance, when, when there was started to show up that there was trouble with landlords not taking care of their houses, and there were the housing that they were renting to people and so that housing was not meeting code.  It was--there were, you know, vermin infesting it.  People, women, who I knew from our parish [St. James Episcopal Church; St. John and St. James' Episcopal Church, Boston, Massachusetts], would be telling me stories of staying up all night with a, with a cast iron pan to hit a rat before it would bite one of their children something like that.  And so, I learned that, you know, that these codes are just were not being, were not being enforced either out of laziness or bribery or whatever.  So, what we did was adopt a--I think it actually started in New Jersey, rent strike.  And the money would--for the rent would come to me and I would deposit it somewhere and then and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you'd hold it in escrow for them--
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly right.  And then that way we'd get leverage on the landlords to get them into court.  And eventually that, that resulted in a state law that was much easier to enforce and made it legal.  It was illegal to hold rent in escrow when we started it, that made it legal to do that so you could come into court and say the reason I haven't paid rent in X number of months is that there's this, you know, electricity cord is frayed or there're vermin in the apartment or whatever.  And gave quite a considerable lev- leverage to, to people and, you know, to, to renters.
Story_ID: 531956
Speaker 1: Addressing continuity, you know, that after there was a state law, you had to still organize?
Speaker 2: Right, once there was a state law that made it legal to, to put your money in escrow, you still had to organize so that people knew they could do that, so that the information about which kinds of problems in apartments or houses could be addressed, try to sometimes organize the properties of one landlord so you would escalate the pressure on that particular landlord and then, you know, make an example and get, get it all together on that.  Then hope that, that would affect other landlords who wouldn't want that to happen to them, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, now did you have any--I wonder 'cause I know in organizing world in Chicago [Illinois]--I mean, that, that was largely influenced by Saul Alinsky style organizing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, did people go to class and sit down and try to learn how to do this?  Did you train organizers to do the rent strikes and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, we didn't.  Some, some people did to some degree.  We did some training around nonviolence.  We did some--it wouldn't be the same as training, we, we did some teaching of black history.  And, but we never taught organizers in the Alinsky style.  I mean, he was--he actually I think came out of labor organizing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: He did, yeah, he did and [HistoryMaker] John Lewis--he was with John Lewis for a while.
Speaker 2: --and so the kind of organizing Alinsky did was, was essentially based on an, on a labor model.  We were more--to the degree that we did any organizing, it was more on a church or nonviolence model.  If I remember, if you noticed the Freedom Rides came out of Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And Jim Lawson [James Lawson] who was a long time, nonviolent follower of King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], started with training Fisk students in nonviolence before they actually went into the Freedom Ride activities.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And we were never quite that organized in Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay, I remember the Highlander Folk School [Highlander Research and Education Center, New Market, Tennessee] and it was his training conducted in Tennessee (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, that was Tennessee?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in Tennessee.  There was training of, of people.  Everybody from Rosa Parks to Dr. King attended there at one point or another.
Speaker 2: Right. Yeah.
Story_ID: 531957
Speaker 1: Yeah, I visited there when I was--for one, one period I was on the board of the New World Foundation [New York, New York] and I was the program chairman.  And my, my perk for being program chairman was to be able to visit some of the programs around the country that the, that the New World Foundation funded.  So, at that time, Highlander [Highlander Folk School; Highlander Research and Education Center, New Market, Tennessee] was, was training mountain people to work on ecological issues particularly coal mining and trash disposal and that kind of thing.  So, so that's why I went to visit one of the local communities and a woman who was in charge of that, she, she took me out to the, the hollers, is what they talk about in Tennessee, the places where people live and their hollers.  And she took me out with a couple of local people to a trash disposal, really, a mountain almost of some local corporation and warned me not to go out where--out in the open because the guards would sometimes shoot at them, and so, I said (laughter), "Yeah, okay, I'll be happy to stay behind."  And one of the guys--one of them was a retired IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] executive and he was a, a white guy but what you'd call a mountain radical type.  You could tell from the kind of language that he was, he was, you know, from, from that populace, kind of background.  And he said that God had told him to go build a church, so that's what he did, and he meant a physical building.  He didn't mean, you know, a congregation and--but eventually he had a congregation and which he did now.  And the woman who was in charge of this group said that they called him, the preacher, and they said that he was very active with their group and the preacher had been in the delegation that went to this corporation to try to negotiate them doing something reasonable with their trash.  And while they were waiting for the executives, the preacher marched around the room and said, you know, "I'm claiming this room for Jesus Christ."  And they're sort of like, you know, "Okay," (laughter) "that's fine," and the executives came in and they had a terrible meeting.  The executives were rude and, you know, wouldn't respond positively to any of their--any of their demands.  So they were terribly discouraged and they went out and the preacher, who was also discouraged, said, "I think maybe we ought to hire a hitman," (laughter), so.
Speaker 2: Somebody closer to the action there.
Speaker 1: Right. But, yeah, there's a long tradition of, of you know, various organizing schools and efforts and so on, and I don't--
Story_ID: 531958
Speaker 1: I was asking a class of mine a couple of years or so ago, are any places still around producing community organizers, 'cause when I was, you know, active in the movement, community organizers were falling out of the trees.  Everybody was a community organizer (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's still--in Chicago [Illinois] still very much an Alinsky [Saul Alinsky] school type organizing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: The IAF [Industrial Areas Foundation] is officially back in Chicago after many years in New York [New York], I think and in the East, you know.  Now officially back and doing things supported by the Catholic church and other big denominations (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, good.
Speaker 2: --Lutheran and others, you know, yeah.  So, so you didn't have that kind of training in those days, and I'm surprised at all the people that say they didn't 'cause I think now a days, when you go to the organizing training, they--the implication is that everything that's ever done was done through formal organized training, you know.  That's the impression they give you, and it's, you know, I've found out many times that it was not, you know.  People just did--got in there and had to do something and did what they had to do.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it was, it was--I had a very close friend, now dead, Noel Day, and we had been in college [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] together.  And he became a--well, he first--he was a school teacher in New York and then social worker, and he had never been trained in, in community organization but he, he was just very inventive and creative.  And so, we worked together very closely and, you know, kept throwing, "Why don't we try this, why don't we try that, yeah, let's do this."  And, you know, (laughter) it was kind of very much the seat of your pants kind of stuff.  And, you know, nothing formal about it, and, and he--I can't even remember if someone sort of intervening and saying that they had been trained some other way.  And, you know, this, this should be done this way because that's the way I've been trained.
Story_ID: 531959
Speaker 1: Did the people in power ever try to meet with you to settle some community issue by offering you something or, or, or trying, you know, they, they--of course they wouldn't state that upfront but was that--did that ever happen?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, we tried--if I can get the year right--probably '65 [1965].  Anyway, there was a gubernatorial election and the big--the issue for the civil rights groups particularly the chairman of CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] and myself was to get a, a person in state government who was in charge of civil rights, human rights and, you know, and an undersecretary or something like that and a platform that would make it clear what this person would do.  And so, we, we wrote this out and the proceeded to try to get an appointment with the one we thought was the most likely candidate to be supportive which was a guy named Francis Bellotti [Francis X. Bellotti], who was a Democrat who was then the attorney general, I believe, before.  And we kept calling him innumerable times and he, he refused to meet with us.  Well, it turned out we later learned that he refused to meet with us on the advice of the, of the black representative, who was also a Democrat who was close to him in his campaign and who was telling him that it really wasn't important for him to meet with us and he could, you know, ignore our calls.
Speaker 1: This is like--politicians often don't like organizers and (unclear) because they can get things done without electing somebody, without voting for 'em.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.  So we, we John Volpe [John A. Volpe] the Republican who was the other candidate, and he was not a, you know, not a terribly attractive candidate but we said, "Well hell, we can't get anywhere with Bellotti let's make a call to Volpe."  Well, Volpe was, you know, shaky in his situation and so we immediately got a response, you know, "Sure, I'll meet with you."  So, not only did he meet with us, he met with us alone in a hotel room, you know, he'd set up so (laughter) like Allan [ph.] and I looking at each other, "This is strange, I've never quite had a--this kind of meeting."
Speaker 1: (Cough) Okay I'm sorry, go ahead.
Speaker 2: So, so, you know, we told him what we wanted and he said, "That seems reasonable."  He said, "Let's see what you've written."  We handed it to him and he read it, and changed one thing and made it stronger (laughter) and he said, and he said, "Well, do I have your endorsement?"  And we said, "Yeah, you do."  He said, "We can, we can deliver--."  I forget what we said, ten thousand or maybe--it was more than ten thousand leaflets across the state in the next day, "So can you pay for the leaflets out of your campaign funds?"  He says, "Oh yeah, no problem (laughter)."  So, Allan and I wrote that, you know, "Vote for Volpe, he's got the strong civil rights platform (laughter)," and we did that.  And from that he did appoint a civil rights secretary, we had--it was very strange because we had, you know, immediate access to the government for the rest of his term.  We'd just phone his office and he'd be on the other end (laughter) of the line.
Speaker 1: So, he won, no problem (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He won and we had a wonderful guy in our, in our group, William Ryan [William J. Ryan, Jr.], who was a social scientist.  And Bill was a very left wing and very committed to Civil Rights Movement, and so he did and op-ed piece in The Boston Globe demonstrating that it was our support that had won Volpe the governorship. (Laughter) And so, so.

Speaker 1: How was your relationship with that black representative that tried to block--
Speaker 2: Well, he, you know, he was in his, in another world.  I mean, he wasn't into civil rights particularly and he had his own wired-in things and this wasn't one of them.  Yeah, I can remember--I don't know if the fame of Louise Day Hicks got out but she was one of the people Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] once--and I were--Andy said, "Can't we ever do anything without making these white racists heroes like Louise Day Hicks?"
Speaker 1: Oh, she was the school--
Speaker 2: She was the school board chair and she later went to [U.S.] Congress and became this darling head of this neighborhood school movement and--but, at any rate, she, she--we were--the mayor during the time when we were struggling with the schools was Mayor John Hynes [John B. Hynes].  And I remember we went to the mayor once and asked for his help with Louise Day Hicks and with the schools, and he said, "Well--."  This was just after an election where she had gotten more votes for school board than he had gotten for mayor.  And he said something like, "Well, you have to understand that some politicians seem to get a great deal more response from being in opposition to you than they do for supporting you." Like, "No, I'm not going near that," (laughter).

Speaker 1: Now the school crisis here was really heated up in the '70s [1970s].  What were you doing, what were you still--
Speaker 2: Well, there was two years, there were two years when the case got decided I was and my family were in Tanzania and I was teaching and setting up a master's [degree] program in their education department [at University of Dar es Salaam, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania].  So, when the actual court order got written and enforced initially, enforced in Boston [Massachusetts] I was not in the country.
Speaker 1: Now, what year is this?
Speaker 2: Seventy-three [1973].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I came back to the states in '75 [1975], I was teaching at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] then.  I had taken a leave of absence so I was back at Harvard Graduate School of Education [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Then my--I didn't go for tenure, so my seven years was up at Harvard and I worked in the, in the desegregation case with the part of it that had Roxbury High School [Boston, Massachusetts] and South Boston High School [Boston, Massachusetts] linked together.  That was the most troubled piece of the, of the desegregation.  Then I became he director of the, of the thing called the Citywide Coordinating Council, which was the CCC, which was the body that the court had created to both interpret its orders to the public and to monitor the compliance with the orders by the school department.  So, I did that for a couple of years.  And one of--in the second of those years, the, the chairman of the school committee decided that his political future was in--on the side of complying with the court orders and getting them, getting the courts--getting on the court's side.  So that was, you know, that was in general at least a, a more positive stance that the earlier, earlier school committee persons had become--had decided that their political future lay better in resisting the court.  And they wouldn't--the court works, it--we'll say in, you know, "Do X," and then the school committee supposed to come back with a, "Here's how we propose to do it," and then there's a negotiation about it.  Well, the school committee in this case, there'd be a court, "Do X," and then the school committee would essentially say, you know, "No, we aren't gonna do it," (laughter). You know so, then the court would be put in the position of having to figure out how to do it.  And the school committee would say, "That's a stupid way to do it."  And, you know, that was the tendency of the, of the dialogue.  But with Finnegan, John Finnegan [John J. Finnegan] was the school committee head who decided that he was not gonna take that route.  And the guy who had been chairman of the Citywide Coordinating Council when I was the director of the staff, Robert Wood [Robert C. Wood], at that point became superintendent of the Boston Public Schools.  And I went with him into the Boston Public Schools and directed the planning and policy department in the schools, so I had moved from boycotting the schools in '64 [1964] to being a member of the school department in '80 [1980], no, '78 [1978] or so.
Story_ID: 531962
Speaker 1: I was asking off camera about the--all the actors in, in this, from the black community here in Boston [Massachusetts] and you were giving me a good answer (laughter).  So--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, well, first of all if you think about it, it's a, it's a relatively small community both in numbers and in geography.  So, practically everybody knows everybody else or, you know, the six degrees of separation isn't very far to get people together.  The, the one division would be age division, for instance, I was at--well, let's, let me start with the young ones.  Byron, Sarah, [HistoryMaker] Sarah-Ann Shaw, Chuck Turner [HistoryMaker Charles "Chuck" Turner].
Speaker 1: That's [HistoryMaker] Byron Rushing, right?
Speaker 2: Byron Rushing.  They were pretty much the youngest group, they were roughly college age people and they had their associations were with groups like some degree CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], but Boston Action Group was a group that was--had an office on Blue Hill Avenue and--
Speaker 1: That's BAG, right?
Speaker 2: BAG, exactly, right.  BAG was associated somehow loosely associated with Students for a Democratic Society [SDS], but I'm not quite sure how and also with SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].  They had some kind of--but they were basically generationally the same, in the same generation.  I was in I guess a generation beyond that like graduate school or post-graduate, and so you'd have people--and it would also--it's important to note that in Boston, this was black and white.  It wasn't--it's not as much as in some large black communities, it's sort of very closed black community.  It was, it was--so that, for instance, when I was curate at St. James [St. James Episcopal Church; St. John and St. James' Episcopal Church, Boston, Massachusetts], the rector was Neal Hastie [Cornelius Hastie], was white.  Ed Blackman [Edward B. Blackman], who was at Eliot Congressional Church [sic. Eliot Congregational Church of Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts] was white, and people moved around pretty freely, white and black in those, in those things pretty much within their, that geography.  Then there was the older, more established black community, the Snowdens [Muriel Snowden and Otto Snowden] of Freedom House [Boston, Massachusetts], Walter Davis [Walter C. Davis] at the--what is it, the big church in Grove Hall [Boston, Massachusetts]--out of Grove Hall--what's that, African Methodist church [Charles Street A.M.E. Church, Boston, Massachusetts] where Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] preached was--some of these names are slipping, but there's, there was, there were--those were generally older clergy who were another, you know, another layer.  Then, as I'm talking this out, I think there's another part of the community that, which I was not part of but had links into state politics and city politics.  What happened during the, during the time I was active was that, that tended to expand and more, more connections were there.  But they were often party connections, Paul Parks I mentioned.  Again, some of these names don't, don't come back to me.
Speaker 1: That's all right, you know.
Speaker 2: But, at any rate, there's a--it's a, it's a sort of complicated grouping but it's almost, I mean, almost anybody could in the leadership, quote, leadership, could call almost anybody else and they would know who they were at least.  They might not be working with them, but they would say, oh, you know, "Jim Breeden [HistoryMaker James Breeden].  Hi, how are you?"
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a black newspaper in town that was active then?
Speaker 2: The--who was it--Mel Miller [HistoryMaker Melvin Miller] is another name, Mel is a contemporary of mine.  The Banner, the Boston Banner and Roxbury Banner, but it's the same newspaper [Bay State Banner].
Story_ID: 531963
Speaker 1: What was the ultimate result of, of the school desegregation fight?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the big issues was whether the Boston case would be resolved within the political borders of Boston [Massachusetts] or would it involve the metropolitan Boston.  Many people thought that it wouldn't work in, in the--well, that neither would work, that politically it was impossible to get out into a metropolitan solution.  And that, demographically, there were gonna be too many black students in the Boston area to actually maintain a desegregated school system for very long.  The latter won out really.  I think that it's still something like only 55 percent black population.  It's much larger Hispanic population than it was when it first in the '70s [1970s].  They've loosened the requirements for desegregating school by school.  And, and the magnet school district has been--which has about twenty-five schools in it, has been the major success that has more resources, higher standards of integration, more, more innovative curriculum.  The other would be the charter schools, the charter school have been--which weren't part of--really part of the desegregation but they've been a major, a major success in the, in the schools.
Story_ID: 531964
Speaker 1: When you look back on, on what happened here in, in Boston [Massachusetts] in terms of school desegregation I guess things are still happening, what, what, what are some of your reflections on it?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that I think at least that it would have been worth the try to do a metropolitan frame of reference, because clearly, demographically, you've got in the metropolitan area enough kids to, to actually integrate.  I think that, although the other piece of it is, you've got to devote the resources and have the teacher dedication that you need to, to make it.  One of the things that's, that's being brought up more and more now, and wasn't paid attention to then, is that there's also a very serious problem between poor and richer kids in the schools.  And you can't just try to solve that one with a, with a desegregation as such, it's got to be--or at least it's not racial desegregation, it's desegregation of the, of the resources, the access to resources.  So it's, it's, it's a multi, multilayered problem and part of the problem is that the Civil Rights Movement itself never really addressed economics.  There was a big fight, for instance, with--in the March on Washington in 1963 with A. Philip Randolph, who was in the labor unions, and the initial call was for a march on Washington for freedom.  And Philip Randolph said, "No, no, no, it's gotta be jobs and freedom."  And that's what it eventually--although a lot of people have forgotten that, it was jobs and freedom.  And the, the issue of jobs, you know, remains a major issue.  The jobs, the unemployment for black community and one also has to add Hispanic is double that of the, of the white community.  And no serious policies really attend to that.  I think, I mean, I don't think, I don't think unemployment should be the level it is for any community but it's--but there's clearly a color related dimension to it that, that has no business being there.
Story_ID: 531965
Speaker 1: I think we got you to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and then we, we've like kind of drifted around a little bit but we got you to Harvard.  And what was, what was your position at Harvard again?
Speaker 2: Harvard, I was a--I went through several positions but I ended up as a associate professor in the Graduate School of Education [Harvard Graduate School of Education, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is prior to going to Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire], right?
Speaker 2: That's correct.  And I was doing during that period I earned my doctorate in administration (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  What was that experience like or, you know, is there a highlight to that?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: What's the highlight to the experience at Harvard I guess or some of the highlights (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, two I guess.  The highlight--one was since I'd come out of civil rights activity, I tended to draw--both draw on from my teaching and draw into my classes activist oriented people.  They wanted, you know, they wanted to be in touch with someone who had been in--out in the Civil Rights Movement.  So that was always--that was fun for me and I got quite a broad spectrum of students because of that.  Many of the students at Harvard were returning for second careers, they had been out of school for some years and they were coming back in for second careers, which I liked a lot.
Story_ID: 531966
Speaker 1: A second part of the, of the Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] experience that I liked was the--well, I, I took, as I mentioned there, a two year leave of absence from Harvard to teach in Tanzania.  Whole family went to Tanzania with me and, and I set up a program for a master's degree in, in the university, university ad been typically sending people--University of Dar es Salaam [Dar es Salaam, Tanzania] had been typically sending people to other countries to do their graduate work and they were trying to get graduate programs into the university.  And education was my--when I was working on master's in administration.  So that was, that was very challenging to, to work in Swahili and to, to work with some of the older students who were doing graduate work.  Then following Tanzania because of the way they allow you to, or schedule your flights, you can go either direction.  So we had come from the United States through Europe to Tanzania, we could leave by going out and continuing east and go to China, so I thought that was a cool thing.  And so we did, we went to China for three weeks.
Speaker 2: Now this is--what year is this?
Speaker 1: This was 1975, so this was just before the death of Mao [Mao Tse-tung] and in the, the slogans of the time it was the Gang of Four was in charge (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The big news then, okay.
Speaker 1: --of China.  The Gang of Four actually was based in the ministry of education, so we were right in the heart of that.
Speaker 2: So did you meet him?  Did you meet any of the gang? Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, we didn't, we didn't.  We had, we had interpreters and so on, but, now we didn't meet Mao.  He was very ill at the time and there was even speculations as to whether he was still alive.
Speaker 2: Right, did you meet any of the Gang of Four?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, we were, we were, we were fairly well plugged in.  Tanzania was one of the countries that China was eager to have connected and we were, we were regarded more as Tanzanian representatives than American.
Speaker 2: I think the Chinese were building the Tanzam Railway [Tanzania Zambia Railway Authority] then?
Speaker 1: They were, yep.  And they stayed pretty much to themselves in Tanzania.  The, the Americans were building a highway and the Chinese were building the railroad, but the Chinese pretty much had self, self-contained communities so you never saw Chinese on the street or anything.
Speaker 2: Did you see any of the--there was a large--well, fairly large group of American expatriates in Tanzania in those days.  Did you come across--I mean, I think Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses] was living there then (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Bob was there, yeah we saw Bob.  Yeah, there, there had been several who had, as in a way I had, been influenced by what we had read of Nyerere [Julius Nyerere] and what the, you know, what was the--what the goals were in Tanzania and Bob was actually just at--during the--towards the end of the time that we were there, he and his wife and family were getting ready to come back to the United States.  He was--he had thought about taking out citizenship in Tanzania but I think he felt a little bit as I did that you'd never quite get fully integrated into that society.  But, yeah, there were, there were Bill Sutherland, who'd spent some time there as the American Friends Service Committee representative, he was there and we saw him a lot.  So, yeah, there were--that was a, a, a attractive place for Americans.
Story_ID: 531967
Speaker 1: I have a note here to ask you at, at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] to ask you about [HistoryMaker] Charles Willie.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Charles I know.  Charles was very important in doing the plans for the desegregation of the Boston [Massachusetts] schools.  He was one of the key people.  He's told me at one point that he had actually tried to convince the court that they should include one school that was predominantly or totally black precisely for the point of showing that there could be an excellent black school, that you didn't have to integrate a school to have an excellent school.  But the court wouldn't buy that.  Chuck has also been very active in, in work with historically black colleges [HBCUs] and I think he--and Ron Edmonds [Ronald R. Edmonds] have written a book on that.  And they've had I think more than one conference on that.
Story_ID: 531968
Speaker 1: In '84 [1984] you became the dean of the William Jewett Tucker Foundation at Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct, yeah.
Speaker 1: --okay, tell us about that now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, the Tucker Foundation, when I became dean, was about forty years old and it had as its sort of slogan mission to support and further the moral and spiritual work and influence of Dartmouth College.  And what that meant was primarily to organize and oversee the social service activities of Dartmouth students and to oversee the religious activities.  There were quite a few religious staff at Dartmouth, I think it was up like twenty or so, Muslim, Jewish, variety of Protestants, Roman Catholic, who were supported not by the college but supported from somewhere to work with students.  And we tried to, to keep them meeting together and organizing to see that they, you know, stayed off of each other's toes and (unclear) which they occasionally got onto.  My own take on the, on the work of the Tucker Foundation was not principally its work with students, I obviously did that work and I had staff members who did that work.  But I was a, a senior officer of the college and I saw my role as being more importantly in my meeting with my, my peers and senior officer, and the president pointing out issues of moral and spiritual issues that the college itself as an institution should be addressing.  So, one of the first things I did was, when I got there in 1984--that was the beginning of pressure on the U.S. government and colleges and universities around the country to divest from South African investments.  So I became very active in that both at Dartmouth and nationally.  And was--went to Washington [D.C.] and joined the picketing of the South African embassy, which led me to spend the night in the Washington jail.  And that wasn't exactly what the president thought of me doing with them (laughter) when he invited me to be the dean.  But, at any rate, I looked at issues for instance, of low income housing in the Hanover [New Hampshire] area 'cause one of the things that was happening was that the--with the Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital [Hanover, New Hampshire] and the college being in the area, they were essentially driving up real estate prices so not only junior faculty but obviously civil servants and teachers and, you know, most--a lot of people with a modest means simply couldn't live there.  And, so the college did start to make some provisions for lower income people.  I have, since undergraduate days [at Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire], not been enthusiastic about fraternities and sororities, and closed societies like that both from moral and educational grounds.  And so I pressured the president to, to pay some attention to that, and he declined, said that, that would give him to two years as a president if he started to, to make much of a fuss about that.  So eventually I think I probably extended my stay about as long as I could, being as much of a gadfly as I was.
Story_ID: 531969
Speaker 1: Now, the early '90s [1990s] was the, weren't those the days when The Dartmouth Review started making national news?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) '60 Minutes' show, and '20/20' and all the rest of that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah it was actually, it was actually--see, I went there in '84 [1984] and they were actually pretty well established by then.  Yeah, The Dartmouth Review was part of a right wing political effort to make a strong presence at prominent educational institutions.  There was an accidental connection with Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] in that some internal struggle in the daily Dartmouth [The Dartmouth], the normal newspaper, had led to a, a number of the upper staff of the daily Dartmouth resigning.  So they were out there, you know, free agents.  And the foundations that support this strategy of establishing newspapers, conservative newspapers brought some of them into their orbit.  And there's one guy who writes now, Dinesh D'Souza, who's become a prominent writer and he's, he was one of the first editors of The Dartmouth Review.  The--can't remember who--there was a woman who was the editor when I was there and she wanted to interview me and I said, "That's fine as long as I can bring my tape recorder," which she agreed to (laughter).  And she wrote a very straightforward interview.  But, my, my response to The Review was that it, you know--I mean, they wrote nasty stuff and sometimes naive stuff and, you know, they were usually picking at black students and affirmative action, and the administration and all kinds of--but--and the review of the administration in general was, you know, don't pay any attention to them, just leave them alone.  My view was more like engage them, you know, let's see what--go to them, don't let them just say what they have to say and leave it alone.  So, so I would go by their offices and talk with them and collect their newspapers, and take their newspapers to places where I was going to conferences to show what the actual newspaper looked like.  And that kind of baffled some of my liberal colleagues, they thought that was--they thought of their offices as some kind of outer ring of hell or something that you wouldn't--or you certainly wouldn't be seen talking to a Dartmouth Review staff member on the street.  And, I don't know what, you know, whether that did any good whatever doing good would mean, but it just didn't seem to me that it was, it was good policy to be intimidated or to ignore them.
Story_ID: 531970
Speaker 1: Ninety-four [1994], you left Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire], now, now what happened in '94 [1994] that you went to Harvard [Harvard Graduate School of Education, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: To, to, well, to Harvard, so I say when I left, when I left Dartmouth in--it was '94 [1994], '95 [1995] was that process.  It was largely because the president [James O. Freedman] and I were no longer in communication.  He was suggesting that I take a leave of absence and I was asking, why should I take a leave of absence, since I don't want one, and he would say, well, "That's a good question," and, you know, it was just kind of nasty interaction.  So, one of the ways that it seemed to me to be a kind of way to transition out of Dartmouth was to, was to move to Harvard and so I asked the dean of Harvard if I could get an appointment as a visiting scholar, which is a kind of courtesy appointment.  And, and I did that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was when I spent the next two years in that position.  And then a friend of mine was--I forget what she was, she was leaving her position for a short term at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and suggested that I take her position there.  So I applied for that and they were also looking to set up a master's degree program in administration, so that looked like a nice, a nice package to do, to teach in undergraduate education and also to, to begin this graduate program.  So I did that and that was my--it looked like when I got to that there that it was--it had been--that graduate program had been under construction for many years, and it never quite made it into, into actuality. And so by the end of a year, I had figured out that I was, I wasn't gonna devote the rest of my life to trying to get that program to happen.  So it seemed like a good time to retire.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you retired in, in--what year was it in?
Speaker 2: It would have been '98 [1998] I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, and okay, so since that time you've been--you still function as faculty on--in some of the colleges.
Speaker 2: Right, at, at a school called School for International Training [School for International Training Graduate Institute] in Brattleboro, Vermont.  That was a school that actually started as a Peace Corps training site and then evolved, evolved over the years to a, a master's, an accredited master's degree institution.  So I teach in there, and what I do now principally is advise students who are doing their internships. And then they have a final master's paper called a, a capstone paper, and I advise students who are doing those papers.
Story_ID: 531971
Speaker 1: Any stories from that experience?  Do you have any I guess favorite students or, or experiences from teaching all those many years?
Speaker 2: Well, there're always great stories from teaching.  I think I have one, this is just, just happens that I heard from him the other day.  He's a, a recent convert to Baha'i and has been doing a program in the Baltimore [Maryland] area kind of developing a, a program with, with either recent converts or young students.  It's a very broad, broad recruitment, recruitment and education program.  And I had--I've never really totally understood the relationship of Baha'i to Islam.  I think it's thought of as a, as a heretical form of Islam (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It is.
Speaker 2: --and I know that some of my friends who were from Iran were Baha'i.  Their families were in great jeopardy because they were not, you know, well regarded and had to flee from one place or another.  So, so he is, is now working on getting into a Ph.D. program in sociology.  And I was just thinking as I was getting ready to write back that he's in an interesting pivotal point at this moment because of the kinds of ferment in Islam and so on, that, that I hadn't--that I had been kidding him a lot, not kidding him exactly but pushing him a lot when he was in classes about the, the romantic, the romantic views of a recent convert. (Laughter) You know, but he's quite serious and he's, you know, and he's, he took my pushing with, with a grain of salt and continues to be, to be in it and active.
Story_ID: 531972
Speaker 1: This is a question we always ask, what are some of your hopes and concerns today for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess my certainly my concern is the--I guess what you'd call the split in the African American community that's basically along income lines.  That there's an increasing division between the upper class or upper African American class and lower African American class that's a mirror of what's a split that's in the United States more generally and in the world really.  But it's--it has its sharp differences in the effects in the African American community, and I think that's certainly one of my great concerns.  I think one of the, one of the problems or one of the, the issues in its solution is that there isn't probably, as far as I can see, there isn't an African American solution to that, that's a problem that has--requires a kind of collaboration across the population for any kind of a solution.  You can't--I can't, at least, see that getting much better for African Americans unless it gets better for a lot of other people as well.  So that's certainly one of, one of my concerns.  I think one of my hopes is that, that part of the African American community that makes--that sees itself as part of what, if one remembers the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People [NAACP], paid attention to the fact that there was an issue about colored people not just African American people.  And although it hasn't followed that line all through its history, it's still with W.E.B. Du Bois and the Pan-African union and some of the attentions of others in the African American community, has recognized that there is a strange but, but traceable division between people of color and people of no color in the world.  And that the, that the people of color actually turn out to be the majority of the people of the world, so that if, if there is any kind of democratic future, it's gonna be a future that has a lot more say in it from people of color and presumably that will have an effect, on--an important effect on people of color in the United States.

Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, I think every once in a while I, I think, gee, I wish I had studied to be a symphony orchestra conductor or a--to play a jazz saxophone or something like that.  But that would be a different me, and what I've tried to do is, is go the places and do the things where I thought I could make a contribution, where I thought I was--I don't like to use the term being called but I tend to think of it more as seeing, finding opportunities.  In a funny way, being opportunistic.  Though that word is usually negative (laughter), it's not negative in my mind.  It's not, it's not passing by the opportunities that show themselves to be available.  And at least that style is a style that I think I would like to maintain.  The opportunities may be--may have been--how do I--what do I use for a word here for the--had the opportunities been different, I might have done different things.  But given what they were, I think I did what I was happy to have done.
Story_ID: 531974
Speaker 1: In that regard, when you look back on everything you've done today, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the largest one is--and it's the vaguest one in a way.  I keep running into people who were brought to political life during the school stay outs in Boston [Massachusetts] in the 1963, '64 [1964].  And probably there were fifteen thousand kids and maybe a thousand adults involved in the, in the teaching and training of kids, and a lot of different things happened there, most of them were things that I couldn't obviously, specifically control.  But a lot of them were things that I hoped for that people would change their consciousness and begin to see potentials for doing things that they hadn't seen before.  And so, that was the--in a way, the biggest educational event that I've had some responsibility for and I, I'm kind of proud that it happened and I think it had a good effect.

Speaker 1: Tell us about your family, you have children (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My current--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: My, my family. I have four children.  The oldest here Margaret [Margaret Breeden].  Second, Margaret is mostly a mother although she's spent most of her time since she graduated from high school as a model.  And so, she has that kind of model, who in between modeling, does other things like waitressing (laughter) and waits for the big breakthrough.  Johanna [Johanna Breeden], who is an accountant, and has worked for several companies.  She's a graduate of Rutgers University [The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey], Frederick [Frederick Breeden] is a--what do you call it--I think you call it crafts, craftsman soap maker.  He does organic soaps and distributes them around the country actually; they're all over the place.  And Paul [Paul Breeden], who is difficult to pin down, but Paul is the--his card says he's the CEO of several different companies, a foundation that tries to raise money to put more music in the Boston Public Schools, a company that tries to do web design, and for a while, he was doing tourist arrangements for a, a place in Jamaica.  So Paul is a, is a nomad (laughter) and it's often--he's always coming up with new things to do and new places to go, though.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I read in the information we had that you were married, divorced and remarried your wife [Jeanne Savoye Breeden] again (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not exactly remarried, we actually divorced, were separated, separate for about a decade and then came together again and lived together since--now for eight years.
Story_ID: 531976
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I have not asked you that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, you've covered pretty much, pretty much--the thing that we talked about in the early part of my, of my life I think what one of the ironies is that I've probably been mostly identified with black activities, black community activities and yet, as one of my Marcus Garveyite friends in Boston [Massachusetts]--her father was a very strong Garveyite, and she said to me once, she said, you're not really black (laughter), and I said, well, you're probably right.  I said, if you look at my history although I think my great--my [maternal] grandfather [Frederick Thomas] had the, the paraphernalia in the attic from one of these nationalist fraternities or something.  I used to play with them when I was a kid.
Speaker 1: Which one was he in?  UNIA [Universal Negro Improvement Association] or African Blood Brotherhood or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm not sure, he had, he had died by then and I don't know that anybody in the family knew which one but it was a lodge of some sort with a sword and, you know, all this stuff.  So there--I may--and he was very active actually in his--he was a kind of black Readers' Digest for his friends in the neighborhood [in Minneapolis, Minnesota].  But, but anyway, I guess the thing that I would--that I think needs to be conversed about more is the difference between--black is a stereotype that is a very confusing stereotype.  And black is the actual lived experience of people.  As one of my friends said when she was--when the black experience in quotes was everybody was talking about the black experience.  And she said, there are millions of black experiences of the stereotype of the black experience is really takes you down a side street where you shouldn't be.  But, at any rate, I think there's some--a richer conversation that needs to take place about being black in America and being, more I think about being black in the minds of white Americans.

Speaker 1: The last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  Somebody else asked me that and I asked them not to ask me that question (laughter).  I think as someone who tried to use my talents for, for the benefit such as I saw it of those around me.  So that's, yeah, I guess that's it.  And that, that the, the places where I would have been criticized correctly is where I had talents that I didn't make available when I should have.
Speaker 1: All right. Well thank you for making yourself available today.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.

And this was just bedtime.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay, I think this is high school graduation [from North High School; North Community High School, Minneapolis, Minnesota].  Although maybe I look too mature for high school, maybe, maybe it's college [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire].  I can't tell from the--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is a picket line in Boston [Massachusetts], picketing the Boston School Committee.  And my older daughter, Margaret, is on my shoulder.  She is one who confuses picnicking with picketing at that stage of her life.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's me before I can remember and I would think I might be about a year old.

Speaker 2: This is on the left Governor Volpe [John A. Volpe], my older son, Frederick, my older daughter, Margaret, somebody who's hiding her head that's probably my younger daughter, Johanna, and my wife, Jeanne.  And that is, since we were presumably instrumental in making Governor Volpe be governor, we had a lot of contact with him during that period.
Speaker 1: Is he related to the police department Volpe [Robert Volpe], that got--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is my father on the left and my mother on the right.  And they would have been probably in their fifties, late fifties maybe in that picture.
Speaker 2: Can you give me the names of them?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, my father was Pleasant George Breeden [Pleasant Breeden], my mother was Florence Beatrice Thomas Breeden [Florence Thomas Smith].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, I'm ready.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is me addressing some kind of group, I'm not sure if it's a church or a rally it could have been either in those days.  And it was the 1960s, probably 1961 or '2 [1962].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, going left to right is a friend of my uncle named Mr. Bernay [ph.], my wife Jeanne, me--is that me?  Yes, and my uncle, John Thomas and--we were getting--that was the day of our marriage and Mr. Bernay was along because we didn't speak French, and he did (laughter) so he had to translate what the justice of the peace was saying.  He summarized at one point saying, "Jeanne, that means that you should do what Jim [HistoryMaker James Breeden] tells you to do," (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right.
Speaker 1: Okay, that is my wife Jeanne on the left and me on the right on our wedding day.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Ready.
Speaker 1: Okay, that is me in the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America] in 19--what is that '52 [1952].  Okay, that was--I think that was the year I was a camper but I became a counselor in training and worked at Many Point Scout Camp [Ponsford, Minnesota] for a number of years actually until I was in graduate school [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York].  I worked summers there and so that was, that was a big influence in my life being--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right, ready.
Speaker 1: Okay, that is me playing a harmonica, which I've played ever since I was a little kid, and it's the only musical instrument that I'm really reasonably competent on.  Although I'm not really very good at it.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Ready.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is my mother, Florence Beatrice Thomas.
Speaker 2: And this is my father, Pleasant George Breeden.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, okay ready for this one.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's on the left my mother Florence Beatrice Thomas and my father Pleasant George Breeden and me.  And this would be when I was twelve years old, and we'd go up to a resort near Fox Lake, that was my first experience of camping.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, ready.  Tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Well, that's me and one of my favorite toys when I was about four years old.  I think--I can't remember, it was about that time that I got my fist haircut at the insistence of my uncle and over the tears of my mother.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that was me again roughly the same age, maybe a little younger, in my backyard [in Minneapolis, Minnesota].
