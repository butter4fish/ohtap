Speaker 2: Well, I was trying to move further north, but I was never able to get enough money to move up there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I just played around and picked up engagements wherever I could within the community where I was living at.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  You moved to Birmingham [Alabama] in 1962.
Speaker 2: I moved--you're said I moved there in 1962 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  (Simultaneous) You were part of 16th Street Baptist Church [Birmingham, Alabama] in 1962.  That's why you left Virginia, June of '62 [1962].
Speaker 2: You said you couldn't get enough money to move north.  Why couldn't you get enough money to move north?
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  They didn't pay preachers like they do today, tell them.
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I was being a little hypocritical when I made that statement because I was treated well by all of the ministers in the area where I worked.  And wherever I could find a place to speak, I went for it.  And I know it was gon' be a short offering, but I said, five dollars is better than anything--
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  You pastored at Gravel Hill (unclear).
Speaker 2: And I finally got me a church, church there after being a seminary graduate.  And I pastored several churches in the area where I was living and near where I was living.

Speaker 2: (BARBARA CROSS):  I listened to you.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: And Gravel Hill, what type of church, what denomination church was it that you--
Speaker 1: Baptist.
Speaker 2: Baptist.  Were all the churches Baptist, church that you pastored?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 402148
Speaker 1: What size congregation?  Tell me about Gravel Hill [Gravel Hill Baptist Church, Richmond, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Gravel Hill was a medium-sized church, and I was looking for a church and landed up with them, and became their pastor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't remember how many years I was there, about five or six years before I moved on and became a missionary, which gave me an involvement of churches.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  That was after Birmingham [Alabama].
Speaker 2: Before we get to you coming to Birmingham, and Gravel Hill, what were some of the things that you did with the church there?
Speaker 1: Well, we worked hard there trying to get the membership involved in the ministry that the churches should be involved in?
Speaker 2: Such as?
Speaker 1: Seeking to bring about the Lord's work in a variety of cases.  Sometimes you wonder how you can it for a long time, you know, the preachers have a hard time getting along with some of the churches 'cause they want to plan how he should preach rather than how the Lord would have him to preach.  And --
Speaker 2: (BARBARA CROSS):  You had Vacation Bible School, Sunday school, revivals (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: (BARBARA CROSS):  Church outreach.
Speaker 1: I tried to move the church in an area where they feel they could be ministries in the community.
Story_ID: 402149
Speaker 1: Where was the next place that you moved to, the next place you were called to pastor?
Speaker 2: Well, the next place I was called to pastor was in a rural church--

Speaker 2: Oh, in Birmingham, that's right, 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what year did you go to 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham?
Speaker 2: I guess it was in the early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  Nineteen sixty-two [1962], June, 1962.
Speaker 2: Sixty-two [1962].  You know, you really, you got a head on your body, girl (laughter).
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  Got it from you.
Story_ID: 402150
Speaker 1: Before we go straight--I just wanna go back just a little bit to get a little more feel for you growing up.  Do you remember anything about holidays at home with your family?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about Christmas or Thanksgiving, whichever is your--whatever you wanna tell me was your best time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, we, we were--my family, by my mother's [Margie Cross] care, helped my father [John H. Cross, Sr.] to get involved in ministries that would be helping the community, not always trying to put things on them to do, but getting them involved in the community around them to improve conditions and activities that church should minister in.
Speaker 1: Did your family do anything special for the community for Christmas, at Christmastime?
Speaker 2: No, we just had different plays--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and procedures.  And they got used to that, and they just kept moving, moving, moving, moving.
Speaker 1: Did you live on a street or a farm?  What was the neighborhood like where you lived when you were growing up?  We're talking about in Haynes, Arkansas (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I grew up on a farm in Haynes, Arkansas.  And during the holidays, we planned things for the church, to get the church involved in ministries.  And it became a really good thing, having the church members to get involved in the community.
Story_ID: 402151
Speaker 1: Did you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me their names?
Speaker 2: Elma [Elma Cross], my oldest brother, Jessie Cross, Emmett [Emmett Cross] and Elma-
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  Edward [Edward Cross].
Speaker 2: Edward.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  And two sisters.
Speaker 2: They, they got involved in most of the things I was involved in 'cause they never joined my church (laughter).   That, that hurt me.  They would attend sometimes, but they never became a member of my church.  But I ministered to them just the same.  And I had a lovely mother [Margie Cross].  She would, she would guide 'em and try to get them involved in the things I was doing, and get them out of the invitation of things, other direction.
Story_ID: 402152
Speaker 1: Tell me, as a little boy, what do you remember about where you grew up?  Do you remember any, seeing anything that you--when you think of home, you think of, maybe a smell or a sound or something that surrounded you as a child that you remember as a child?
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember growing up was a difficult time there [Haynes, Arkansas].  And boys would get involved in baseball, and I don't know what--whether it was helpful to them or not, but we tried to make it helpful and get them involved in the churches.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the names of the schools that you attended?
Speaker 2: Virginia Union University [Richmond, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember your high school?
Speaker 2: No, that was before my--high school [Lincoln High School, Forrest City, Arkansas] was--
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember any of the teachers that you had coming up?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  I had a teacher in college.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  Was it Dr. Ellison [John Malcus Ellison]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did Dr. Ellison influence you in any way?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me how?
Speaker 2: He was involved in ministries, and any time he had an opportunity, he would try to grab somebody he was involved--in that particular ministry he was involved in.  And at the time, not having a church, I followed him as a minister and participated in the activities he had.
Speaker 1: What were some of the activities?
Speaker 2: Well, they were baseball and activities to involve the members of that church, to get them active in seeking out members of that community.
Speaker 1: Were you--what kind of student were you?  Were you good, A, B, C, D student?
Speaker 2: I guess I'd be in that middle class.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So a B, C student, you would say?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 402153
Speaker 1: Were you a good child?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What did--what were some of the rules in your house, your mother [Margie Cross] and father [John H. Cross, Sr.] set down, the rules?
Speaker 2: We had a certain to get up in the morning and do certain activities in cleaning up the outdoors and the indoor.
Speaker 1: What was your chore?
Speaker 2: Well, I got involved in, and right now when I see an area, driving through an area and see how, how they don't keep it up, it just discourages me.
Speaker 1: So you made sure--
Speaker 2: That never happened in my family.  We didn't only keep the outside clean, but we cleaned the inside and the outside and played, played ball.  I became a minister early in my life.
Story_ID: 402154
Speaker 1: So, Reverend Cross [Reverend John H. Cross, Jr.], when did you know that you were called to be a minister?
Speaker 2: Well, I would be involved in activities some time and I would make it from a ministerial position.  And so some of the older preachers would guide me.  "Boy, you got, I believe you could become a preacher."  And that just boosted me up, you know, until I was wondering why they couldn't be a preacher.  Well, some of 'em were preachers.  But they weren't carrying out the activities that normally is expected of a preacher.  And so I got involved in that type of situation, teaching 'em, ministers how to become involved in activities that preachers should be involved in rather than waiting to preach on Sunday morning and not caring about what goes that afternoon and the rest of the week.  So a lot of that is very important in a church.  And it's not just a Sunday gathering.  It's a week-time gathering too.  And you plan activities to kind of involve yourself in different areas of the community.  It's, it's a little hard in the beginning, but when you get into it, it's interesting.  See, I became a preacher in my late teens, and several people had almost influenced me because they knew I was involved in an activity which I didn't knew anything about.  And I was pleading for help with ministers for years, trying to get, get their position on different activities to make the church more active in those areas.
Story_ID: 402155
Speaker 1: So now you have finished seminary [Virginia Union University Graduate School of Religion; Samuel DeWitt Proctor School of Theology of Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia], and you're called to pastor in Birmingham [Alabama]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --at the 16th Street Baptist Church [Birmingham, Alabama].  What did you expect when you went to Birmingham?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a lot that I expected which I didn't get all that I expected.  But I got the membership of the church involved in activities that would go on, not just from our point of view, working the line out, to get them involved and get their activities within the range that I wanted.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  Which was the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Were you involved in the Civil Rights Movement before you came to Birmingham?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: So when you got Birmingham, what was the first thing that you did as a pastor in the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: Well, I was, I was involved in a lot of things, and I couldn't get them to see the beginning of it.  And I would try to break through and get involved and be agitated.  It was hard doing it.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  Tell Denise [Denise Gines] about your meeting with the Shuttlesworth [HistoryMaker Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth] organization [Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights], how you got the church involved.
Speaker 2: (Pause).
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  They asked you because you were a new minister in town, could the church be a part of the meetings?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  And what was your answer?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 402156
Speaker 1: So what did you do to get the church involved?
Speaker 2: Well, planning meetings that were dedicated to that arena and let them see how things should be done and how they can get involved in it.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  Tell her about when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was gonna come to town.  That was what, how that opened the doors to Dr. King.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of, a lot of churches had really overlooked Dr. King in many activities because they couldn't, they couldn't see the position to take.  But I didn't give up.  I got them involved in it, and we'd make that an activity that we have the church to sponsor to involve more people in the activities that should go on in the community.  And that the church wasn't just a ballgame, but activities to involve everyone.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  So it became a headquarters--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  --16th Street [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama].  So when Dr. King would come to Birmingham [Albama] to help desegregate, that's where Alabama Christian Human Rights Movement [sic. Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights], Reverend Shuttlesworth [HistoryMaker Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth], used your church as the headquarters.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  So you gave the okay for that.
Speaker 2: You gave the okay.  Do you know why they moved to our church from Bethel [Bethel Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama]?  Bethel used to be the headquarters where Reverend Shuttlesworth was the pastor, and they asked you to make the headquarters at 16th Street.  Do you remember the reason why they wanted to move?
Speaker 1: Well, yes, they wanted to get involved, church members in areas throughout the community.
Speaker 2: (BARBARA CROSS):  It was a larger church--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: (BARBARA CROSS):  --centrally located to the downtown area in Kelly Ingram Park [Birmingham, Alabama], for them to march.
Story_ID: 402157
Speaker 1: So the leadership of the Civil Rights Movement would come and meet at your church.  Can you tell me some of the activities that came out of those meetings in Birmingham [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I can.  It was an area where they trying to involve more people, group, groups that they organized and bring it into the church area at that time, see how the church reacted and how we could be involved in it.
Speaker 1: Were any of the members concerned because Reverend Shuttlesworth's [HistoryMaker Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth] church and his home was bombed?  Were any of the members of 16th Street [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama] worried about anything happening there?
Speaker 2: Well, that was something that I expected to happen that never happened.  I would talk to the membership maybe on a day-to-day area.  And nobody ever told me they were afraid.  They jumped to catch the ministry that I was involved in, and that was it, having meetings from one, one o'clock at night to two o'clock in the afternoon and getting that church involved in the ministry.  It was hard getting the churches involved in it.  They would listen to it, but getting them to reach out, and eliminate some of the outgoing so it could be involved in the community activities.
Story_ID: 402158
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  Tell Denise [Denise Gines] about Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] urgency about the nonviolence and what he told the demonstrators?  If they couldn't be nonviolent, they couldn't be what?
Speaker 2: (Pause).
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  Do you remember about his approach to the nonviolent strategy, what you said he would tell the people who would sign up to be a part of the demonstrations?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  Tell Denise about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was, that was the area that not only did he want the person to attend the meeting, he wanted them active, being active in the outgoing of that ministry.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  Did he put them out if they couldn't be nonviolent?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 402159
Speaker 1: Right before the bombing at the 16th Street, excuse me, Baptist Church [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama], I understand that there were maybe some warnings each time.  Did you get warnings?  Tell me about anything that might have occurred before that?
Speaker 2: Well, I got several warnings.  But each time we'd get a warning, we would tighten up, keep things going better than it had been going, you know.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  For security?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you had people watching the church?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it got, it got that way once.  We had to have volunteers to be watching the church and some of 'em would spend nights around the church to see that it was protected.
Story_ID: 402160
Speaker 1: So we're gonna move to the actual day of the bombing, and you were preaching. Where were you and who were you preaching to?
Speaker 2: On that day, it was, my preaching was more or less what a church should do instead of just being a yes man, get involved in the activities that that area need to be involved in.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  That was your first Youth Sunday.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  You didn't have a service.  It didn't happen.
Speaker 2: The women, you were preaching to the women about love forgives?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: (BARBARA CROSS):  That was the Sunday school lesson.  They didn't have the worship service.  The bomb went off before the Sunday worship service.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (BARBARA CROSS):  The Sunday school lesson was: a love that forgives.
Speaker 1: And that's what you were talking about, the love that forgives?  Do you remember anything about that sermon?
Speaker 2: No, I really don't.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  You talked about agape love, the type of love that Christ has, that you forgive people, no matter what they do to you.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  That, forgive them seventy times seven, but it was considered more like a, not a sermon, a Sunday school lesson.  That was the Sunday school hour that the children were involved with.  And Sunday school happened before church service.  The church service would start at 11:00.  The dynamite went off at 10:15 or 10:22 when the clock stopped.  So they never did have the worship service.  That was during the Sunday school hour that the church [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama] was bombed.  And they talked about the lesson of: love that forgives.
Speaker 2: So can you tell me from that point what happened once you were doing the Sunday school lesson?  What happened?  Tell me what happened?
Speaker 1: Well, we assigned some of the officers with the help of getting those people who had been involved to see if any injuries had occurred.  And so they, they would--got, bring them out of the area where they were and put 'em on the outside of the church, rather than on the inside.  That was a Sunday I'll never forget.
Story_ID: 402161
Speaker 1: Tell me what you did during that time?  What were you physically doing?
Speaker 2: I was physically involved in the membership to get involved, the children's area and the youth area and taken the example of what the church is about.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  No, she wants to know what you did after you heard the noise.  Tell her when you went downstairs and what you found when you saw the side of the church [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I had--it wasn't that we hadn't, didn't expect.  But we were living to see that time come about and when we walked through the church, we could see what was happening and how many of the children had been bombed and how much damage was done to them, to get them to see this is not a play game.  This is a reality to involve yourself in.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  Do you remember hearing anything when you start going through the rubble, before you got to the girls?  Did you hear somebody calling somebody's name?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  And who was that calling somebody's name?  It was Sarah [Sarah Collins Rudolph].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  Addie's [Addie Mae Collins] sister.  She was calling out for Addie.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  And she was entrapped in a bathroom stall.
Speaker 2: Oh, that was the day I wish I could forget.
Speaker 1: So did you help take the children out?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, and no.  I had the deacons of the church help go around and see where injuries had occurred, and to see that those persons were moved out of area and put in another area where they could be carried to the hospital and whether they need to be, to be improved.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  You remember digging through the rubble and what did you find?
Speaker 2: I don't know about that?
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  You might wanna block that out, but you found--remember you said you found all four of the little girls lying on top of each other?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, they were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  (Simultaneous) Yeah, he found them.  They dug underneath that rubble.
Speaker 2: Just like they had planned to be together, and they were together.
Story_ID: 402162
Speaker 1: So after they took the little girls out, I understand you went outside and how were you trying to console the congregation?  What was going on outside?
Speaker 2: Well, people, I guess from other areas had come over to the church [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama], and we were trying to get them, those who had been injured to go to the doctor.  And that was, about four little girls injured.
Speaker 1: Well, four of 'em were killed.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Some others were injured.  Were any of your daughters injured?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: You don't remember?
Speaker 2: (BARBARA CROSS):  Lynn [Lynn Cross].
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: (BARBARA CROSS):  Lynn was cut on the forehead.  You didn't see her, but she went to the doctor.  You didn't see her at first.  Remember the megaphone they gave you to quiet the crowd?  Do you remember what--
Speaker 1: What you said?
Speaker 2: (BARBARA CROSS):  What scripture you read or said, repeated?
Speaker 1: I don't have an idea.
Speaker 2: (BARBARA CROSS):  The 23rd Psalm is what?
Speaker 1: (Crying) The Lord is my shepherd [Psalm 23].
Speaker 2: (BARBARA CROSS):  Yeah, that's what you said.  Okay, okay, okay. That's all right, you did good.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: I know it's very difficult to remember something as tragic as this, and we do appreciate you taking the time to try to give us this history, to really appreciate it.  Do you think that you can go on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah
Speaker 2: --and talk about--okay.  So what happened after the bombings?  They had to plan the funeral for the little girls.
Speaker 1: Yes, the funeral was planned and the church had an area that they had picked to have areas where they were expecting the bomb to occur and had guardians and angels to take care of that area.
Speaker 2: (BARBARA CROSS):  The church--the funeral was held at two different churches.  You had two different funerals.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: (BARBARA CROSS):  One of the funerals was held separately.  That was Carole [Carole Robertson] and three of the funerals together, and that's when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] helped to come and plan the funeral.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Did you utilize, (laughter) utilize--
Speaker 1: Did I do what?
Speaker 2: Did you do the eulogy for any of the young ladies that died?
Speaker 1: I'm sure I did some of it.  But we had so much help.  That was a day that I'll never forget.  It was surprising to me to see these girls who were injured, how they got injured.  I had tried to get them to take another area, and they chose an area just the opposite to where I had planned for them.
Story_ID: 402163
Speaker 1: So what did they tell you about the bombings [of the 16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama]?  Who, how did it happen?  Do you remember what was told to you, how the bomb was planted and who planted the bomb?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  Well, you learned from the first trial and then the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] investigations.  Talk about that, the first one in 1977?  First case, Ku Klux Klan [KKK]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  'Cause you testified at all three funerals--
Speaker 2: At all three trials.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  I mean all three trials, yeah.
Speaker 2: Were you surprised that it took a long time before they arrested someone for the crime?
Speaker 1: Was it, what?
Speaker 2: It took a long time before someone was arrested for the crimes, of killing the young ladies.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Tell me how you felt about that, that it took so long before someone was arrested?
Speaker 1: Well, it didn't surprise me.  I knew it would, they weren't just gonna come forward and identify themselves.  But finally they, they did.
Speaker 2: What are some of the things you think hindered the investigation?
Speaker 1: I don't know whether it was the fear on their part that they may get slashed out in a bomb or whether they were afraid that the membership would garnish them, catching them coming around in the area like that.
Speaker 2: (BARBARA CROSS):  Do you think the FBI was crooked and the police department in Birmingham [Alabama], in the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: I won't say they're perfect.
Speaker 2: (BARBARA CROSS):  Okay, but we know that's what happened.
Story_ID: 402164
Speaker 1: Well, after, after the girls were killed [at the 16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama], it was a lot of riots because people were just really angry about what had happened, and those weren't the only four girls that were killed.  Can you tell me about other children that were killed after the bombings?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I was really pleased to know that more injuries didn't occur, and--
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  There were twenty-three injuries and two young men that were killed the same day, two boys, young boys, in separate, isolated incidents.  So that's what she's referring to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  --which most people overlook their deaths.
Story_ID: 402165
Speaker 1: We left off, you know, on a sad note.  So I wanna ask you about the time after the bombings and now, your church [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama] is being rebuilt.  Tell me about the rebuilding of your church and how the bombings have made a difference in Birmingham [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: (Pause).
Speaker 1: Who helped plan to build the church, to rebuild the church?
Speaker 2: (Pause) We didn't have any trouble getting help to get the church rebuilt.  So after that happened, there were more people wanting to get involved than we cared to involve 'em in it.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  Do you remember receiving donations from people all around the world?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Who sent you donations?
Speaker 2: (Pause).
Speaker 1: How about telling me about the stained glass window?
Speaker 2: (BARBARA CROSS):  The Wales Window [Wales Window for Alabama]?
Speaker 1: (Pause).
Speaker 2: So it took about a year for the church to be rebuilt?
Speaker 1: (Pause).
Speaker 2: (BARBARA CROSS):  You hear the question?
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: (BARBARA CROSS):  You hear the question?  It took a year, about--did you hear?
Speaker 1: I guess so, about a year, at the time.
Story_ID: 402166
Speaker 1: Reverend Cross [HistoryMaker Reverend John H. Cross, Jr.], tell me what you're most proud of?
Speaker 2: In my lifetime?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: (Pause) One thing I'm proud of, that the membership involved themselves greater than I've ever known them during, at my lifetime.  They, they were getting offers from, from the membership and I guess we had to tell 'em, said now, everybody can't get involved in this.  You can help, but don't try to get in and take over, how to involve them.  So that was an area that we had to carefully govern ourselves.
Speaker 1: Tell me how you want people to remember you?
Speaker 2: (Crying) It's a day that I won't ever forget.  And I didn't realize I had that kind of strength.  The Lord looked out for me.
Speaker 1: How do you want people to remember you?
Speaker 2: How do I want them to remember me?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't, I don't like to put any burden on a person but see how they would take me.  But one thing I do know, the whites became involved more than I expected.  They wanted to do it themselves in rebuilding the church [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama].
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  Is that why you became involved in race reconciliation?
Speaker 2: Partially.
Speaker 1: (BARBARA CROSS):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, Reverend Cross, we will remember you as a man of honor and integrity, and tell you that we love you and we thank you for your contribution to our history.  And we thank you for being a part of this interview.
Speaker 1: I thank you for coming (crying).
Speaker 2: You're so very welcome.
Story_ID: 402167
Speaker 1: We're still at the home of Reverend John H. Cross [HistoryMaker Reverend John H. Cross, Jr.] (pause).  We're going to continue the interview with Ms. Barbara Cross.  Can you tell me your--I just said your name, but can you say your name and spell it for me for slating purposes?
Speaker 2: Yes, Barbara Ann Cross [Barbara Cross], B-A-R-B-A-R-A, A-N-N, C-R-O-S-S.
Speaker 1: And we're--as I say, we're at the same location.  It's the same date, and the same people are in attendance.  We're going to attempt to fill in the gaps for your dad [HistoryMaker Reverend John H. Cross, Jr.].  Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, let's take a deep breath then.  We're gonna start the day of the bombings in Birmingham [Alabama].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I understand that you were there.  Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Yes, I'll never forget that day as long as I live.  That was Sunday, September the 15th, 1963.  I was thirteen years old, and that was the first Sunday that my father had instituted since his pastorate, as Youth Sunday.  And I was gonna sing in the choir at the worship hour, which would take place at eleven o'clock.  But Sunday school started at 9:30.  I remember my mom [Julia Ball Cross] didn't go to church that Sunday.  So as a daughter of a minister, we almost went to church every Sunday.  You had to be sick and have a good reason not to be in church.  But I'm the oldest daughter, and I have two sisters.  I was thirteen.  My younger sister [Lynn Cross] was four.  My brother [Michael Cross] was five, and my other sister, Alma [Alma Cross Barber], she was eleven.  And the youth Sunday school classes were in the basement of the church [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama].  And I'll never forget the lesson that we studied was: a love that forgives.  And in my Sunday school class, my teacher was Mrs. Ella Demand [Ella C. Demand].  And I said later that she spared my life, and I'll share that a little bit later with you.  But we talked about in class when people do something to you in school, like maybe hit you or steal something from you, rather than hit 'em back or have hatred or anything, resentment against them that you--we studied about the Greek word, agape, love that means to have the type of love that Christ, that you forgive your enemies, seventy times seven, no matter what they did to you.  But little did we realize that that lesson, that the events that would happen some, a hour or so later, would need to call upon that lesson for the rest of our lives about forgiving your enemies.  After the lesson ended, which was almost about ten o'clock, the bell went off for reassembly.  So I had planned to go to the bathroom.  And my friend, who for years I had said was in my Sunday school class, but her sister later corrected me when I was on trial, which was even more interesting because she said, "I didn't see Addie [Addie Mae Collins] that Sunday."  I know I did see Addie.  So in my mind later, I think I remember that Addie came to my Sunday school class and wanted me to go to the bathroom with her.  But my teachers asked me would I fill out the promotion slip.  And that--my duty was to write down the names of the children in our class who would advance to the next class for the next Sunday.  Just like you move up in grade school, we move up and advance in Sunday school.  So I gave Addie my wallet and say, "I'll see you in a little while."  Probably less than ten or fifteen minutes after I had given her that wallet, I was in my Sunday school class, and I was doing my assignment, writing the names of the students that would be advanced to the next Sunday school class.  There was a horrific noise.
Story_ID: 402168
Speaker 1: All I know is that everything got real black, and it seemed like the church [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama] shook from off its foundation.  I knew it wasn't a earthquake.  In my mind, I just thought Russia had bombed Alabama.  It was that type of noise 'cause I remember about, reading about nuclear weapons in the newspaper.  And I remembered everything getting dark and I remember something hit me in my head.  And I realized later that it was a piece of the light fixture.  I remember just running out of class and shaking and screaming and hearing children screaming.  And then I ran to the top of the steps from the basement area.  And I remember seeing one of my neighbors.  He was asking me where my sister was.  I saw my sister, Alma [Alma Cross Barber].  I saw my brother, Michael [Michael Cross], but I couldn't find my younger sister, Lynn [Lynn Cross].  So he took us home.  And I just remembered seeing a lot of policemen in the street and children running out and adults, people crying and just trying to figure out what happened.  But we didn't get a chance to go to the side of the church where most of the damage was 'cause he took us to the safety of our home.  And I remember my mom [Julia Ball Cross] opening up the door.  She had heard it on the radio.  I didn't realize 'til some hours later when my dad [HistoryMaker John H. Cross, Jr.] got home with a city program, that my friend, Addie Mae Collins' name was on there.  That she had died.  Because of the events of that day, I had forgotten that I had given her my wallet.  I remember the phone constantly ringing.  It was reporters and some of our family members trying to find out if all of us were okay.  And I remember my mom said my youngest sister, we can't--we couldn't find Lynn.  And then I remember some hours later, she came home.  She had been in the hospital.  I remember we didn't spend the night at home that night.  My mother had us to spend the night at a neighbor because of so much chaos that day, and they probably wanted to take care of--they just didn't want us to be traumatized by what else we had been through.  I remember the next day--I think I went to school that Monday.  But that afternoon, I'll never forget when the doorbell rang, I went to the doorbell to answer the door, and there was Dr. King, Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], Ralph David Abernathy [Ralph Abernathy], Dr. King's brother, A.D. Williams King [Alfred Daniel Williams King] and Reverend Dick Gregory [HistoryMaker Dick Gregory].  And I went to get my dad, and I realized they were going to help plan the funerals.
Story_ID: 402169
Speaker 1: Did you attend the funerals?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went to both funerals.
Speaker 1: And they were in separate places?
Speaker 2: Right.  Carole Robertson was the first funeral.  And hers was at the church right down the street from us.  Her mother attended 16th Street [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama], but her dad attended the St. Paul A.M.E. Church [sic. St. John African Methodist Episcopal Church, Birmingham, Alabama].  And I remember there were a lot of people.  But it wasn't as crowded as the one, the next day, which was the one that was the three together, which was Cynthia Wesley, Carole--Denise McNair and Addie Mae Collins, my friend.  And that was held at Sixth Avenue [Sixth Avenue Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama].  And I remember all the throngs of reporters and people and I remember the--I was on the second level of the church because the main floor was so packed.  And I rode with my dad [HistoryMaker Reverend John H. Cross, Jr.].  And I was just like, just there and just not really listening, but just knowing I was at my friend's funeral.  And I remember going to the cemetery, and I remember Mrs. McNair [Maxine McNair] passed out.  I remember that, and her picture was in the Jet magazine 'cause Denise was her only daughter.  And she had fainted from grief.  And it was just, it was just a very difficult time, very sad.
Story_ID: 402170
Speaker 1: You said that you went to school the next day.  What--wasn't there a lot of unrest in Birmingham [Alabama] right after the, the bombings?
Speaker 2: I guess in my own little world, I was not involved with the distress of what was going on in Birmingham.  I just was distraught from just being caught up in the--being there at the church [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama].  And to me, I became very nervous, so I was nervous, I was jittery.  I don't even remember looking at the news the next day.  I just know that we were in a church, a place that was supposed to be safe and realized that, how evil and became more aware of how dangerous and how the purpose, why Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came to Birmingham, how much hatred was there.  So that kind of just realized, sparked an awareness of my surroundings and how people can take the life of innocent people because of the color of your skin.
Story_ID: 402171
Speaker 1: Do you remember people in Birmingham [Alabama] blaming Wallace [George Wallace] because he had made a statement just a week before that to stop segregation, they would have to have first-class funerals there?
Speaker 2: I don't remember that statement, but I do remember he talked about, "Segregation today."  He stood in the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] door and said, "Segregation today, now and forever," and to me, that type of attitude did spark that type of climate to give people who were hatreds, that they could continue to do what they were doing.  They wouldn't be stopped.
Story_ID: 402172
Speaker 1: So following the bombing, the church [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama] was rebuilt.  You wanna tell me something about that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I remember we met Dr. A.G. Gaston, who was a prominent black millionaire who owned a funeral home and business college [Booker T. Washington Business College, Birmingham, Alabama].  He opened up his doors at no charge to this business college auditorium so we went there for a little over a year while the church was being rebuilt.  And I remember my father [HistoryMaker Reverend John H. Cross, Jr.] saying, when the architect were, you know, going over what they were gonna do to change and rebuild the church, they would not put the lady's bathroom back where it was because they felt that the children would not want to go back in that area.  They would remember that their friends died in the bathroom.  So they did a little lift or some type of whatever they do in terms of architecture.  They made that the kitchen area, but still made it a little different.  And the lady's bathroom was put on another level.  And after we went--the church, when we went back into the church, it was rededicated.  And in 1965, the people of Wales, England, the architect, John Petts wanted to send a message to Birmingham [Alabama].  So I remember my father said, one summer when we were away--I think the summer of '64 [1964], he came and visited.  And what they did, they had a picture of like a black man dying on the cross, and he had one hand stretched out like to stop, stop the violence, stop the killing, stop the murders, and one reaching out in love and reconciliation, the type of love that we talked about that Sunday, a love that forgives.  And at the bottom of the beautiful stained-glass window [Wales Window for Alabama] are the words from the scripture, "When you do it to the least of these, you do it unto me" [Matthew 25:40].  And there's a plaque dedicated to the names of the four girls that were killed.  So that's a beautiful window, and people now still come to the church to, to revisit the church, to look at it and to remember that four little girls, little precious girls lost their lives.  And you might know now, that it's a part of the National Historic Landmark as of February 20th of this year, 2006.
Story_ID: 402173
Speaker 1: So the climate of Birmingham [Alabama], how did it change in 1964?
Speaker 2: I remember my dad [HistoryMaker Reverend John H. Cross, Jr.] said that there were a lot of people, and he said there were a lot of whites that got involved, that everybody there--that because of the color of their skin, whether different from ours, doesn't mean that they were racists.  Sometimes they might have been afraid to speak out, those who didn't like what the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] or those who would mean it for evil, but there was a change.  Not only was Birmingham desegregated--well, really Birmingham was desegregated before the church [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama] was bombed in May of '63 [1963], which was successful.  But I would like to think that my friends didn't die in vain, that in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], signed the civil rights bill for public accommodations [Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title II].  So I remember when my dad, when we would travel back from Alabama to go back to our home state of Virginia, that, we would go to the Holiday Inn.  And I remember when we first went, I think it was North Carolina or South Carolina, but we would--everybody looked at us like we were some Martians from out of town, but they were real nice to us.  But it was so good that we didn't have to sleep in our car because before the civil rights bill was passed, you either had to drive far or knew of a place that, was a boarding home that you could spend the night in.  So we could tell the difference.  So that was a welcome change to know that you could go to any Holiday Inn.  You could go to the restaurant of your choice, and you would not be judged, like Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] said, by the color of your skin.  But that was a turning point.  So I like to think that, the four little girls, those four little angels, did not die in vain, that through their deaths and other people passing during the civil rights era, made a difference for the next generation and for those who come along.
Story_ID: 402174
Speaker 1: How would you sum up everything that has happened during that time, and in your time?
Speaker 2: In 2004, I was presented a pin by the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] and it says--it's a round circle and it says, "Justice for the Four Girls" and inside is an emblem of the 16th Street Baptist Church [Birmingham, Alabama].  And what happened, it took the last two years in 2000--three years, 2002, 2001 and 2002 and in 1977, justice was finally done for the four little girls.  All three of the men have been rendered a verdict of guilty.  And so I'm glad during my lifetime and my dad [HistoryMaker Reverend John H. Cross, Jr.] and my mom's [Julia Ball Cross] lifetime, we saw justice for the four little girls in the court.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Barbara [Barbara Cross].
Story_ID: 402175
Speaker 1: Okay, this is a family portrait.  Our church does a family directory.  So that was done probably in 1987 'cause my nephew was a year old, and he has another picture separate.  The bottom row is my mom [Julia Ball Cross] and my dad [HistoryMaker Reverend John H. Cross, Jr.], and the top row is my younger sister, Lynn [Lynn Cross], to the left.  My middle, Alma [Alma Cross Barber], Barbara [Barbara Cross]--and then that's me to the right.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Very good, next photo?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: We had just left the Drum Major for Justice Award dinner, and my father was a recipient.  And it was honoring the four little girls.  So I took a picture of my mom and dad at home.  He had received the Drum Major for Justice Award by the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] women.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Very good, year?
Speaker 1: That was taken in I think about 1998.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Very good, next?
Speaker 1: That's a picture of my dad and I at Birmingham [Alabama], when we went to the 2001 trial, Thomas Blanton [Thomas E. Blanton, Jr.] for the bombing of the church, and he was later convicted.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, and tell us about this one.
Speaker 2: That's my dad and I, and we took that probably in 2001.  That was at Providence Church in Marietta [Providence Community Baptist Church, Marietta, Georgia], and I spoke at a black history program, talking about the church bombing.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  And the year?
Speaker 2: That was probably 2000.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Very good, next?
Speaker 2: That was taken in May of 1968, and that was a reception for my dad after he left the 16th Street Baptist Church [Birmingham, Alabama].  And there are some of the members, and I see my younger, one of my sisters to the far left and my dad in the center.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, great, next?
Speaker 2: That is my father's brother who is a, was a doctor, Dr. Edward Cross and his wife on the far end, and their three daughters.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Good.
Speaker 2: That was taken I know after the church bombing, and there was a fundraiser in, by the WCLC, which was Western Conference--Western Christian Leadership Conference, and that is Mrs. McNair [Maxine McNair], holding the Bible, who lost her daughter, Denise McNair, and my mom and dad and her husband were on the trip as well.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That was my dad, and he was working at the Atlanta Baptist Association, so that was somewhere between '77 [1977] and '79 [1979].  Well, somewhere in the '70s [1970s] or '80s [1980s].  And that's holding a picture with parts of the Wales Window [Wales Window for Alabama] picture of Christ in the background of a scripture reference.  Read on the back.  I think my dad was graduating.
Speaker 1: That's a picture of my mother and father--and I'm not sure what year, but I'm sure it was in the '70s [1970s].  He would go to Ridgecrest [Ridgecrest Conference Center, Ridgecrest, North Carolina], which is a Baptist convention center, and they usually go for some type of missions conference.  My mother and dad were home missionaries.

Speaker 2: This is one of my favorite photos.  I got a chance to go to Phoenix, Arizona to a convention, but the happiest moment in my life when I saw my sculpture of my four friends, which is called, 'That Which Might Have Been,' and I laid 'em at the sculpture of John Waddell [John Henry Waddell], and I'll never forget, I touched each child and each girl like I had been reunited with my friends.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, go ahead, please.
