Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My name is Calvin Rudolph Howell.  That's C-A-L-V-I-N R-U-D-O-L-P-H H-O-W-E-L-L.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story behind your name at all?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Now what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My date of birth is December 7, 1955.  I was born in Warrenton, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: W-A-R-R-E-N-T-O-N, Warrenton, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now where is Warrenton in terms of--?
Speaker 2: Warrenton, from Durham, North Carolina, it's about forty five minutes drive north of here on I-85.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  And sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am a professor of physics at Duke University.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what's today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is February 21st, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Were in the physics building at Duke University.
Story_ID: 20849
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now before we go into depth there are five lightweight questions that we ask as kind of a warm up.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Boy, do I have a favorite food?  I like most foods.  Foods are not--yes, I guess--yes and no.  I have a favorite type of food.  I like Mexican food.  I like spicy foods.  I have a kind of category of foods I like.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: And I like my wife's cooking.
Speaker 1: There you go.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  [Laughter].
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Favorite time of the year.
Speaker 2: Spring and autumn.
Speaker 1: Okay. And do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I'm not a real vacationer.  But what I like to do when I'm not at work is to tinker with things and so probably my garage is my favorite vacation destination but not for my wife.  And so we typically go somewhere where there are family members and share time with families.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So wherever my family lives I guess is my favorite vacation places.
Speaker 1: Alright.  The last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I guess not.  I don't have too many sayings or phrases.  But if I had to say what I always like to hear is that success is measured by how many people you help.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: So I like that concept.  Whether there's a phrase to go with it or not I don't know.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Story_ID: 20850
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mother's full name is Virginia Howell, V-I-R-G-I-N-I-A, and her maiden name--I'm not sure if you want her maiden name as well.  Her maiden name is Talley, T-A-L-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is June 6, 1927.  Place of birth as far as I know is Palmer Springs, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Is that near Warrenton?
Speaker 2: That's about fifteen miles north of Warrenton.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, now what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing in history?
Speaker 2: So on my mother's side, on her paternal side, I can go back only to my grandfather.  And I know of his mother but I can go back to my grandfather.  His name was James Talley and boy, am I allowed to do some mathematics here?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: He died when I just finished college in 19, about 19, 8--1978 so I think he died in about 1978 and he was eighty seven years old.  So that would mean that he must have been born in the 1890s, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I think his mother was the first in his family to be born a free person.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that would be your great grandmother?
Speaker 2: That would be my great grandmother, yes.
Speaker 1: And what was her name?
Speaker 2: I don't remember her name, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: But it was a Grandmother Talley I guess.
Speaker 2: Grandmother Talley, yes.
Speaker 1: And okay, so are there any stories--now she was the first born in freedom--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --after the civil war.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So about what year do you think she was born?
Speaker 2: When she had my grandfather, my understanding she was on the order of about twenty years old.  So if he was born in the 1890s then she must have been born in about 1870 some time.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Are there any stories about her or what her parents were doing during slavery and reconstruction?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.
Speaker 1: Did they pass down where they were when slavery was over?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: There are other family members who know a lot more than I do.  I'm sorry to say I don't know the details.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is--okay.  Did--well what did James Talley do for a living?
Speaker 2: So James Talley was a farmer.  He started out--it's a pretty interesting story.  So he started out as a share cropper as many African Americans did at that time.  So he was an adult in the early part of the 20th century.  In fact he fought in World War I so he was a young man at the time of that which is what, 1913ish?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Around that time period.  So, but as many African Americans who decided to stay in the rural south, their main industry was farming at the time.  And in the main financial arrangement was to do share cropping.  Share cropping many of you probably know, was when a person and his family stayed on another person's land and farmed the land and they shared the expenses of raising crops and the profits produced by them.  My grandfather evidently always had the ambition of becoming a landowner himself.  And according to stories that my mother told me, he sharecropped for a man by the last name of Keys, I think they said his name was.  And he evidently was a fair minded person that he made a deal with my grandfather that if my grandfather saved so much money he would sell him the land that he had been farming for a certain price.  And so my grandfather according to my mother, became you know a miser almost to save up enough money to buy his own land.  And in some ways I think that was buying his own dignity in his family's future in doing that.  And so he was a very proud man and quite organized and an excellent manager of resources to do that.  So he saved up enough money and bought their first farm and let me--I'm trying to count the number of children that helped him farm it.  I think they had about five children that were--you mind if I name them cause I--
Speaker 1: No, yeah go ahead.
Speaker 2: --have to count them.  So it was my Uncle Ralph, Uncle William, Uncle Calvin and Arnold.  So there were four boys and Aunt Geri, Mom, Aunt Rebecca, Aunt--oh, so it was eight children all together.  And so--and you can imagine at that time being in the rural southern Virginia making a living farming, you needed a lot of children because they basically were the work force of your industry which was farming.  So one of the things that always amazed me now looking back was that having probably about twenty five acres of open land, maybe seventy five acres were force and other types of land, so maybe on the order of 100 acres total is what he had in the end.  He was able to support his entire family.  And a lot of that was because they were self-sufficient.  They raised most of their food.  They raised animals, they raised big gardens.  And the men would harvest the big gardens and the women would preserve it and can it.  So they would have canned vegetables all year round.  You know even not during the growing season.  So very little did they have to buy from the so-called free market.  They were in many ways self-sufficient.  And many of the things that they didn't raise themselves there was a kind of a community bartering that people did.  I'll give you an example.  So for instance if there was one farmer who needed some barn space for curing his tobacco, that was the main crop at the time, then he would talk to his neighbors and they would say oh, look I'm harvesting my tobacco next week.  I don't think I'll use the entire barn.  You can have this row but to get that row your sons have to help us harvest our tobacco.  So he never paid for the barn space or the fuel needed to cure the tobacco.  What they did was they exchanged one of the resources they had most of and that was time and labor.  So that's how farmers, at least black farmers, were able to turn a profit by basically community organization among each other.  So that's the kind of environment that I grew up with.  I grew up in my parents' house but was raised on my grandfather's farm.  And so that's why I know quite a bit about the history of that.  And one of the things that in looking back, that impressed me was that off the farmer's income, he was able to offer all of his daughters a college education.  So the thing that struck me was that he didn't offer his sons a college education, just his daughters.
Story_ID: 20851
Speaker 1: Now do you know the reason why?
Speaker 2: So I talked to my mom [Virginia Howell] a little bit about that and his thinking was that he could not afford to send all seven children to college.  My--one of my uncles, Uncle Arnold was born with Downs Syndrome so college was not an issue with him.  But he couldn't afford to send all seven to college so he had to make tough choices and his priority was to make sure that his daughters got a college education because during that time if you remember, his sons were grown men in the 40s [1940s] and 50s [1950s] and so his feeling was that a man could always make a living with their hands, either a craft or just general labor or whatever.  They can make a living with--physically, but a woman can't.  A woman has to use, his thinking, a woman has to use her brain to make a living.  So that's why he gave priority to sending his daughters to college.  And I suspect that's not too atypical of the men of his generation or families of his generation and that might explain a bit though I'm not a sociologist of why African American women of that generation tended to be more highly education than their male counterparts.  Certainly that is the case in my family.  My father I believe only went to the seventh grade and he dropped out and worked on his father's farm whereas my mother finished two years of college before getting married and starting her family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when I look at the men and women in my family, that--of that generation, that's not atypical.
Story_ID: 20852
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Virginia Howell]--what did your mother say about growing up and going to school?
Speaker 2: So in her family, education was extremely important.  Her grand--her mother, her mother's mother, her grandmother, was a college educated woman and I think had some graduate education.  I'm not sure at the Ph.D. level or the Masters level but certainly up to the Masters level.  And she had served as the dean of women at several historically black colleges.  And the one that I'm most familiar with is that she was Dean of Women of--at St. Paul's College in Lawrenceville, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Now what's your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name is Alberta Talley.
Speaker 1: Alberta.
Speaker 2: A-L-B-E-R-T-A, Alberta.  Her maiden name was Wright.
Speaker 1: Okay and--
Speaker 2: But she married my grandfather and was a Talley.
Speaker 1: Alright, and now she--what college did she graduate from?
Speaker 2: I don't know if my grandmother went to college.  I just know her mother was college educated.  She was educated at least--
Speaker 1: Oh your grandmother's mother was college educated?
Speaker 2: Yes, my grandmother's mother was college--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my grandmother I don't think was college educated though she--
Speaker 1: So this is your great-grandmother you're talking about?
Speaker 2: That was my great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Who was the--
Speaker 2: Ms. Peoples was her last name.  Amenta I think is her first name.
Speaker 1: Armentha Peoples.
Speaker 2: Amenta.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so she was a--she worked at St. Paul's?
Speaker 2: St. Paul's College in Lawrenceville, Virginia.
Speaker 1: So she's--that's an Episcopal school.
Speaker 2: That's an Episcopal--it's a private Episcopal historically black school and that's the college that my mother and her oldest sister went to.  So that was in some sense the family college.  The younger girls, Aunt Eunice and Aunt Rebecca decided that they didn't want to go to a four year college so they went to, I guess a business training school I think it was called at that time.  They came to Durham to I think it was called the Durham Business College or something.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was a two year, I think they--I think it was a two year's associate degree school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they go into business or did they do something that was a--?
Speaker 2: They did basically clerical work is my understanding.  My Aunt Rebecca worked for a telephone company in New York for many years until she retired.
Story_ID: 20853
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name is William, W-I-L-L-I-A-M Howell.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is March 13, 1927.
Speaker 1: '27 [1927] okay, and where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Palmer Springs, Virginia as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: So his father's name was McKinley Howell.  He was a sharecropper as well.  They had, boy--am I allowed to be uncertain about one?  They had fifteen, sixteen children in their family.
Speaker 1: Okay, sure.
Speaker 2: Big family, very loving family people.  But education wasn't as highly emphasized in their family as it was on my mother's side.  What was the thing--if asked the personal attribute that was most emphasized in their family was a strong work ethic.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They believed in being proud of the quality of the work that you produce independent of what you were paid to do.  And so I remember as a young person working with my father and one of the things he would always say is that if you work for a person and they pay you, make sure that you are proud enough and confident enough in the work that you do that when you hand--they hand you to the pay you don't have to look at the ground.  That you can look them square in the eye and they might look at the ground cause they know they underpaid you.  And so that was the thing that one of the things that I always took away from his philosophy in life and his family's side that hard work was something that was--and willingness to work hard was a positive attribute.  It was an attribute as a person.  It wasn't circumstantial.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hard people--people who have a strong work ethic work hard when they're not watched.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.  Okay.  Now are there any stories that go back you know past that--grand--your grandfather's generation to what they were doing during slavery or reconstruction or--?
Speaker 2: No.  And like I say we kind of hit a barrier when it came to that generation that was born just after slavery or just at the end of slavery.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now did your father have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: No.  My father, as far as I could tell, didn't go any further than about the seventh grade which I find quite incredible that he was able to support a family with a seventh grade education.  But I think the country was a different type country at that time.  But he--one of the things watching my father taught me was that you can compensate for a lot of things through hard work.  You can't compensate for everything but you can compensate for a lot of things.  For instance, I think him marrying a high, more highly educated wife was him having a partner to help with certain things that required education.  And what I found out from him by growing up with him and watching him and observing him that his lack of education was not a measure of his innate intelligence.  That he was in many ways brilliant.  To be able to function with a seventh grade education, to be able to acquire a job that could pay him enough to provide for a family of six children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so what he relied on was his ability to learn skills.  So he became a cement finisher.  I'm not sure if you know what that profession is.  But--and the jobs that he did mainly was to pour infrastructure for buildings, shopping centers and highways, pour concrete that is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that is as much a skill as it is say, a craft or an art, I think.  In fact I worked with him one summer when I was in high school and it's hard work.  But it's also rewarding.  I think anybody who builds something, finds a certain sense of satisfaction when it's done and you look back, something physically exists that did not exist before your effort.  So he always took a sense of pride in looking back at his work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Seeing it.  And sometimes we'd travel and he'd say, we poured a portion of this highway that you're riding on now and he took pride in that.
Story_ID: 20854
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I read that you would help him take things apart and put them back together like a lawn mower, power tools, things.
Speaker 2: So another thing my father I think instilled in all of his children was a sense of confidence.  I remember that--actually and let me just back up and say it was necessary that we were able to fix things because we didn't have enough money to hire people to repair everything.  So out of necessity he had the attitude that if something is broken and it's broken past a certain point, I probably can't do any--make it any worse than it is.  So he would take things apart and he would do it around his children so that we could, if we were interested in, see.  And as we got older as a child, at least as I got older as a child, I became a helper.  And I remember sometimes we'd have something apart like a power saw, a lawn mower, whatever it was we were working on and some of the other men in the communities would stop by and look at us and we'd have the thing all apart and they'd shake their head and say, I think you should have taken it to the shop and walk away.  And my father would always say under his breath, well if a man built it, I think I can figure out how to repair it.  So that was that level of confidence in himself that even when skeptics came by it would like bring out--some may call it arrogance, but it would bring out that part of him that he would mumble under his breath that it cannot be so tough because it wasn't anything made by God, it was something made by a man, a man like himself.  And so he must be capable of analyzing it and understanding how it was built and then repairing it.  And with about a 90, 80 to 90 percent track record, he was right.  He could do that.  He had a natural ability for mechanical things.
Story_ID: 20855
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: All I know is that they were in the same community.  They were born in the same little town.  It's what--it's not that many families there so I think their selection pool was not that great.  So--
Speaker 1: So they met there in Palmer Springs?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Now did they go to the same church or--?
Speaker 2: No.  My mother was raised Episcopal and my father's family is Baptist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I was raised and my brothers and sisters were raised in the Episcopal Church as well.  In fact it used to be a school, an elementary school that was associated with the Episcopal Church that my mother was raised in and so she was educated in the Episcopal Church as well.  And what I tell people is--and they--people my age don't know what this term means, an old field school.  I'm not sure if you know what that means.
Speaker 1: Well I haven't heard it expressed quite like that but--
Speaker 2: So my understanding that an old field school is a field that some farmer had dedicated to the black community and they could build a school there, a school house.  Typically these school houses were like three room buildings.  There were two classrooms and a kitchen to prepare lunch for the children.  And so there were a few old field schools that were built to--for the education of the black community.  My mother started elementary school in one, so did her children.  So I went to an old field school until I was in the fourth grade.  And so we'd catch the bus there and in the winter the children who arrived in the first bus load would make up the fire.  We had a wood heater in each of the big classrooms and so if you were on the early bus you had to get the kindle in and make the fire up for the rest of the students so some may think that that was a disadvantage.  It was in some ways, in other ways it was an advantage.  Because what I remember is that is that in the first through the third grade, we're all in the same room.  And then the fourth through the seventh grade we're in the other room.  And by being in the room with the older children when I was in the first grade, if I finished my work early, I could look and see what the students in the upper grades were doing, and so I did.  And so I think I was always, at least in math, ahead of my class because I would finish early and watch what the second and third graders were doing and so forth.  And the teachers were outstanding.  Imagine teaching three grades in the same room.  They were just phenomenal.  And the students who wanted to learn felt that the teachers loved them, they were an extension of their family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the teacher was almost like an extended mother.  At that time you could be disciplined by the teacher.
Story_ID: 20856
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm going to get back to school but I wanted to go back to your--when your parents met.  Now do they--they didn't have any story about how they met or how they fell in love or noticed each other?
Speaker 2: No.  All I know is that my mother dropped out of college to marry my father and the only thing I could understand was that they were in love with each other when she went off to college.  And they had the yearnings of young lovers and rumor has it that they went off and got married secretly.  And they were married for some time before my grandparents found out.  And they found out because my mother evidently was high spirited, she had a strong will.  Both of my parents had a strong will.  And that my father evidently was there at my grandfather's house visiting with my mother and they were married at the time but no--my grandparents evidently didn't know it.  And they were sitting talking and it was getting a little bit late and my grandfather came into the room and said your company has to leave.  This is the way it was at the time.  And my mother in her strong spirit said, he can't leave, that's my husband.  And so I think their plan was that she would finish college before revealing that they had gotten married.  And after that point there was a big debate whether they send her back to college and I think the debate we know which--history tells us which way it went, that she didn't finish college. She had two years and started living as man and wife with my father.
Story_ID: 20857
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So when you think about your parents' characteristics their talents their dispositions their looks who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well I would think I'm a blend of both my mom and my dad.  But I think the older I get the more when I look in the mirror, I see my father starting to look back at me and my father's people you know.  But I can also see some of my uncles on my mother's side as well.  So it's a--we'll see as time goes by.  But I see both.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I was named after my mother's brother, Calvin Talley and so I have his first name.
Story_ID: 20858
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a--do you--how many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: It's six of us total.  Two girls, they're twins, and then four boys and I am next to the youngest.  I was actually the baby for seven years before my younger brother was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you name them all in the order that they come?
Speaker 2: From oldest to youngest?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.  The oldest is William, next one is Lawrence, Gwendolyn and Guinevere, they're the twins, myself and then my brother Franklin.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I have a lot of child--the earliest one I don't know.  I remember counting bottle tops in the school as part of learning addition and subtracting so I think going back to the first grade is far as I can remember back.  But we learned math actually counting things and with physical objects (unclear).  And I guess I remember general things about me being a tinker always too and taking things apart and not being able to get them back.  I was I think mimicking my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were these things inoperable already or--?
Speaker 2: Most of the time.  [Laughter].  Not all of the time but most of the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now can you--
Speaker 2: I can tell you one experience I remember.  It wasn't early childhood.  It was maybe eleven, twelve years old.  And it's a reason why I don't drink coffee is that my parents used to drink coffee and in the morning it was--you would smell coffee brewing in the house.  It smelled very good for me as a child.  And, but children weren't allowed to touch it.  And so things that were taboo for children tend to I guess build our curiosity at that time.  And so one day they had gone somewhere shopping and had a left over half a pot of coffee on the stove.  So I warmed that up and thought I'd test it myself and I think I must have been ten, eleven, something like that.  And I--it tasted so bitter so I added some sugar and I added some milk and it still didn't taste sweet.  So I kept --and by the time I finished with it, I had a molasses of coffee and I drank it and it made me so sick, so nauseous that I've never touched a cup of coffee from that day till now.
Speaker 1: Wow, okay.
Speaker 2: And for a while the smell of coffee made me nauseous.  So they didn't have to police the coffee anymore with me around.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20859
Speaker 1: Can you describe the house you grew up in and tell us what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.  The sounds and sights were all seasonable because it was on a farm.  The house was pretty open most of the time except in winter.  We had windows up and whatever fragrance was in the air was what we smelled.  What I liked to smell in the morning was the sound of--smell of some bacon or sausage or something cooking.  Because on the farm we had real heavy breakfasts because we needed the calories to work.  And so those were the types of things I remember the most in the mornings.  But I guess I never thought about it that way of what were some of the sights, perhaps because the beauty of the countryside, because we had become so accustomed to it, we took it for granted.  But when I go back now the thing that impresses me most is the night sky.  And I had forgotten how much in the evening I would look up in the sky and see all the starts and how magnificent they are and I just had taken it for granted.  And when I left home and went to Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia] to work during the summers between my years in college and just being around buildings with lights not being able to see the stars, I had forgotten how just being able to see the night sky puts you closer in touch with nature.  And so I would say the night sky is the thing I remember was brilliant and the moon, the phases of the moon.  And the phases of the moon stood out because the farmers talked about the moon a lot because they did things on the farm with raising the animals and raising the crops they were associated with the phases of the moon which I today don't fully understand.
Story_ID: 20860
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were coming up during the civil rights years but you were fairly young though being born in '57 [1957].  So I think '57 [1957] must--
Speaker 2: '55 [1955] yeah.
Speaker 1: You were born in '55 [1955]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so we got--I got to correct that on the outline.  But yeah, '55 [1955], okay.  But yeah, so you--Montgomery Bus Boycott occurs in '56 [1956] and you're pretty young then and all these things are going--did your family see any changes in Virginia during the time that you grew up?
Speaker 2: The changes were gradual.  So I'm trying to remember, I think it was in the fourth grade that the school--when I was in the fourth grade, let's see how old would that have made me?  That would have made me--
Speaker 1: Nine I think.
Speaker 2: --about nine or so, so add ten years.  So about '65 [1965] or so, integration started between the races in school and so that's the first step that I remember.  I think the children as far as I can remember seemed to have accepted it more than their parents you know because there was quite a bit of social unrest about integrating the races in the public school system.  But the children that I went to school with, they just came to learn and so it just, it didn't seem--I didn't see anything unnatural about it to be honest.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now let me get--I'm a little con--I looked at the paper and I'm kind of confused here a little bit.
Speaker 2: I think keeping people separate was unnatural.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Integration was not unnatural.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20861
Speaker 1: But you were born in Warrenton, North Carolina but were you raised in Warrenton?
Speaker 2: No, I was raised in--
Speaker 1: In Palmer Springs?
Speaker 2: --Palmer Springs, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I grew up in the Virginia school system.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did it come that you were in Warren--
Speaker 2: But that's only three miles away from the North Carolina border.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was there a hospital in Warrenton or something?
Speaker 2: That's right.  There's a hospital in Warrenton and I, I don't remember why Warrenton was the hospital of choice.  I can imagine that was where the black people went because the hospitals as you know at that time were segregated as well.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Okay, so you were raised in Palmer Springs.  Okay, I just wanted to clear that up cause I, you know I don't think that we knew when we put the outline together where you were raised.  So--
Speaker 2: Which was really a, in some ways what people would call now a farming village.  There is a few general stores, no stop lights, just roads.  And a lot of space between houses which I appreciate more the older I get.
Speaker 1: So did you--I mean so if you went into town into Palmer Springs--
Speaker 2: It's like a, it was like a ten, twelve mile--ten to fifteen mile drive to go into the nearest town to shop.
Speaker 1: And it would be the store, basically the general store, I mean a--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: Well what kind of store was it?  Or what kind of store--?
Speaker 2: Well the general stores were in the community you know like a mile away from your house at the most.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So there are general stores were you could go and buy things locally like bread and you know kind of daily things that you need.  But for kind of more important shopping like clothes and things like that, you'd have to drive into South Hill or Norlina or Warrenton or Henderson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One of those places.
Story_ID: 20862
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So all right, okay.  Well tell us about where you started school?  What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: I started school in a little school called Roanoke Elementary School.  It's named after the Roanoke River and the school itself was named after the church that my father's family went to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It was called Roanoke--?
Speaker 2: Roanoke and I--what I don't know because I just started talking to somebody.  I always called it Roanoke Baptist Church but someone told me that that's not really a Baptist church, it's another type of church.  But let's call it Roanoke Baptist Church now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Their practice of worship is very similar to the Baptist style of worship.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so--
Speaker 2: So there--so that school was the old field school associated with that church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were two old field schools in my community that black students went to.  Roanoke was one and the other one was a place called Cotton Creek.  And I think that was also associated with a church as well.  Though there was no church right beside it, it was a church just down the street from it and I think there was a connection.  Those were the two churches in our community that both my parents in generation and my siblings' generation attended until integration.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Both were the same style two room classrooms.  What made the school was not the facilities but the quality of the teachers.  Teachers were phenomenal.
Speaker 1: Now I--
Speaker 2: I still remember Ms. Jones.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Best teachers I had and Ms. Beckley was teacher and principal of a school.
Speaker 1: B-E-C-K-L-E-Y?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now is this a--in the mountains, the mountainous part of Virginia?
Speaker 2: No, this is--no.  This is in central, South Central Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So this is probably about three and a half to four hour drive from Virginia Beach and about the same distance from the Appalachians.
Speaker 1: Okay, so right in the middle.
Speaker 2: Kind of in the middle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20863
Speaker 1: All right, so all right.  Did you, what did you gravitate towards in school, any particular subject matter at that early age?
Speaker 2: So I've thought, went back and kind of rethought how I ended up where I am.  And I think--and I don't know if this is true for everybody, it was just true for me.  There were certain subjects, certain topics that seemed to--I'd be more interested in and I'm not sure if I was more interested in them or because they were easier for me to learn.  So mathematics was something that I always gravitated toward.  I in fact, enjoyed doing mathematics, you know those type of problems you have early in the first and second grade where someone sends you shopping and they give you so much money and they give you a list of things and the items cost, how much change should they get back.  So I kind of liked those things and I remember that another thing I liked about growing up on the farm is that there was opportunity for young people to make extra money.  You know by all standards we were literally poor but we--I never felt poor.  I never felt economically poor and it's because I think I had always a chance to make a little extra money.  And so one of the things I would do was to go to the store for the ladies after I got off school and did my chores.  Every kid that grew up on a farm have chores afterschool.  Some even have chores before school because for instance I had to get up early enough to feed our farm animals before catching the school bus.  So we had chores, you know some light chores before school and chores after school.  But then after the chores was over, my family, my parents gave me the freedom to kind of do what I wanted to do.  And so one of the things I would do is I would go by the houses of the older ladies and see if they needed anything from the general store.  And I, in the beginning I'd just walk to the store for them and take a shopping list and so I had to learn kind of organ--organizational skills to be able to shop for two or three ladies in the afternoon and they'd all give me a little tip for coming by and asking and going shopping for them.  And so what I learned to do early on was to do mental math because I'd go pick up the items and I'd add them up to make sure that the people had given me enough money.  And so often times, not often but from time to time I would catch an error in the person with the adding machine at the general store because I had done it all in my head and they'd redo it and so one of these store clerks nicknamed me the adding machine because of that.  [Laughter].  That after he'd ring it up he'd look at me and ask me what the answer was before he called out the number because I caught a few mistakes in the past.  And so I learned how to do mental math by the time, pretty quickly by the time I was in the third, fourth grade.  And so I was running these errands I guess when I was nine, ten years old for these ladies. And then I got my first bike and that made everything easier.  My Uncle Ralph gave me my first bike and it was fantastic.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how old were you then about?
Speaker 2: Probably about twelve, eleven or, you know when I first got my first bike, probably about eleven years old.  And I kept running errands for the ladies up until I left high school, left for college.  Because after my bike I got a car and then I would run errands for the ladies and they appreciated it because you know most of them didn't have transportation to go to the store routine themselves cause they were of the generation that I guess the older ladies just never learned to drive.
Story_ID: 20864
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did you do for recreation?  Did you play sports or go to the movies or--?
Speaker 2: Worked.
Speaker 1: You worked?
Speaker 2: It's a lot of work.  No, we played pick up football and basketball like every other community of boys.  So just a matter of whose lawn that we would play football on or whose field that nobody was using at the moment where we'd play football.  So the boys would get together and one of the things that was great in our community and I never played it cause I was--I kind of tried but I was no good at it was--I--the community really loved baseball so there was a lot of--every community, every black community would form a baseball team and we'd play against different communities.  We played the communities from South Hill, community from Norlina, from Littleton, North Carolina, you know all the kind of small little towns and we'd go from town to town and they'd play us and they'd come to us and play us.  And so that was what boys did on the weekend.  For instance, my older uncles they were quite fantastic at it.  My--especially on my father's side, they were fantastic.  And my brothers liked it, especially my oldest brother, he liked to pitch and so that's what they did for recreation.  And by the time I was a teenager it was seven years difference between myself and my oldest brother.  And so by the time I was in high school he had already graduated from college, so by the time I was age to play baseball and all.  So my father decided that he would be the kind of coach of the team and so by natural elimination, I think I couldn't quite play good enough to be on the team so I became the team driver.  I would drive the bus and keep the stats for the players.  So that was--and I played a little basketball but I was never very athletic.  The boys that grew up with me were phenomenal athletes though, basically because all the work they did on the farm they were--they just, you know looked like they spent all their time on weight room equivalent.  I remember that my--families would buy 200 pound bags of fertilizer and the young boys would have to carry this fertilizer from the storage place to the field and you know have to load it on a trailer.  And typically what you would think with a 200 pound bag, you'd have one person on one end and another person on an end, each youth lifting about a hundred pounds.  But I had a cousin that he would come and he would just pick up 200 pounds from the ground and put it on his shoulder and it was the way I would carry about twenty five pounds now.  He was just a phenomenal athlete.  And so those are the type of people that I had to compete against and I just didn't have the athletic ability to compete against those guys.  They were just big and strong.
Story_ID: 20865
Speaker 1: Okay.  But how did you do in school?  Were you a good student?
Speaker 2: I think I was an excellent student in school.  I--from high school I finished second in my class.  And one of the things I liked about high school too was that there was an emphasis on mathematics and an emphasis on science, but in particular mathematics.  And so--
Speaker 1: What was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: My high school was Park View High School.
Speaker 1: And that's in Palmer Springs or--?
Speaker 2: No, that's in South Hill, Virginia.
Speaker 1: In where?
Speaker 2: South Hill, Virginia--
Speaker 1: South Hill, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --which is about ten miles north of Palmer Springs.
Speaker 1: South Hill, Virginia, and the name of the school again was--?
Speaker 2: Was Park View.
Speaker 1: Park View.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Two words or one?
Speaker 2: Two words.
Speaker 1: Okay, Park View High School.  And that was like the regional school for that area?
Speaker 2: So in--South Hill and Palmer Springs and all that, it's in a county called Mecklenburg County in Virginia.
Speaker 1: Mecklenburg?
Speaker 2: Mecklenburg.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There are two high schools in Mecklenburg County, one in the eastern part of the county and one in the western part.  And so this is the one that was in, served the west--I mean the eastern part of the county.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I forget how many students were there.  But I was relatively active in high school.  I was also the president of the student body when I was a senior and had served in different capacities in student government when I was in high school.  I liked high school.  I mean high school was great.  I liked school in general.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now were there any special teachers in high school that you remember, especially in the sciences or math?
Speaker 2: So there was a chemist by the name of Mr. Best, he was fantastic, I loved him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did he--now I've heard that you know a school like yours might not have had the kind of equipment another school might have had in those days especially.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Did you find that, was that true?  I mean were they pretty well equipped or were they lacking in--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you asked about--so the other teachers I liked were the Hicks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were a husband and wife pair.  Ms. Hicks taught math and Mr. Hicks taught general science.  They were fantastic, very encouraging.  And I think in general, all the math teachers at that school were exceptional but maybe I just liked math.  But all the teachers that I taught--that I took math courses from at Park View I truly enjoyed them.  They loved teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you were asking about equipment?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I've never reflected back on what we had in, for instance chemistry lab or biology in reference to what my children had for instance when they were in school.  I just never reflected back on it.  It seemed adequate for what we were doing at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But I thought maybe over time you might have seen a difference, I mean--I don't know.
Speaker 2: Well at the time, remember we were integrated in--the only thing I could compare it to when I went off to college were other types of students who were in college with me.  And there were certainly students who went to prep schools and they seemed to have had, I want to almost say a first--equivalent of their first semester of college.  They in some sense had access to more advanced courses, in particular, in math.
Story_ID: 20866
Speaker 1: When you were a high school student, did you envision yourself becoming a mathematician or was that on the, on your radar then?
Speaker 2: Oh no, I knew that I would do some technical.  I didn't know if it would be in mathematics or sciences but I just knew it would be something technical.  Maybe I subconsciously I thought to myself maybe as an engineer type person, but I knew it would be something technical because I gravitated towards technical things and I liked mechanical systems.  I liked working on automobiles.  Wasn't just a necessity, I really enjoyed it.  It was a time when time, the passage of time didn't mean anything if I was working on an automobile.  I remember when I was sixteen, one of my friends--and we had quite a few brilliant people mechanically--and I repaired one of--my father's car had blown a head gasket and he and I took the car apart and took the engine apart, pulled the head, cleaned the head and replaced the head gasket.  Took the head to the shop and got the valves ground down and repaired and put it back together and ran like new and we were just sixteen years old.  And we had no manual for the engine.  What we had to do is keep good notes as we dissembled it to put it back in reverse order and make sure we didn't have any bolts and screws left over.
Speaker 1: So that's remarkable.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so we--
Speaker 1: I've heard about kids doing that (unclear).
Speaker 2: We had a lot of experiences like that, anything that had an internal combustion engine we pretty much--and so you know I don't--so one of the things--but in that--I mean what else do you do?  I mean there's not a whole lot of things you do in a rural area.  And so kind of hotrodding was one of the things that country boys did or repairing cars.  And so in fact one of the most famous people that grew up in our community was Rick Hendricks.  He grew up down the street from us.
Speaker 1: What was his name, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Rick Hendricks, he's the--
Speaker 1: Rick Hendricks, okay.
Speaker 2: He's the car owner of Jeff Gordon and now Kasey Kahne [NASCAR drivers] I guess and which five time name--why am I drawing a blank?  Five time championship now why am I drawing a blank.
Speaker 1: In NASCAR you mean or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  That's a white guy right, he's--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So okay--
Speaker 2: But he was kind of the king of the hill when it came to hot rod, he and his brother Johnny Hendricks, yeah.
Speaker 1: So did you, you know repaint cars too, work on bodies and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't do any bodywork.  That came, I guess that came, that type of skill came later from people in my brother's generation who actually now runs his own body shop.  But, no I didn't, we didn't do much with body, it was all engine drive train work, transmission and differentials.
Story_ID: 20867
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, well when you were then in high school then you're taking the science courses, chemistry, did you have physics in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Physics was an interesting course.  So we didn't have a full time physics teacher.  There seemed to always be somebody that the school would hire, I would almost call them a transient type person.  And the person that was there when I took physics in high school, I'm trying to remember if it was my junior or senior year, I forget.  But he was a retired civil engineer who had, I'm trying to remember it was the Korean conflict or World War II had been a bomber (unclear) and either Korean conflict or World War II, I forget which one.  And he--and so I remember doing some kind of optics experiments with him in that class with lenses and things like that but what I remember most were the problems that were on projectile motion.  And so the thing I left that class remembering was how to work projectile motion problems the best.  If I had to go back and say what did you really learn in that physics course?  It was projectile motion.  We could calculate hitting a target in a plane that was level when we got a certain velocity with either a stationary target or a moving target or with the plane at a climb or a dive we could hit the target.  And he taught us the mathematics of course assuming perfect conditions like no air resistance and things like that on the projectile.  But the first order, that's fine.  So he taught what he knew I think.
Story_ID: 20868
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now when you start thinking about college, now you end up going to Davidson.
Speaker 2: I went to Davidson College, yes.
Speaker 1: Now this is a--was--Davidson is a pretty prestigious school.  Now how did you--and as I recall, Davidson has just integrated I guess in those days.
Speaker 2: Davidson was just integrated.  In some ways, Davidson chose me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm starting to believe this thing that we call luck is being prepared and being at the right place at the right time.  So my brothers and sisters prior to that time had gone to college.  So both of my sisters went to college and one of my older of the two brothers went to college.  The next to the oldest brother James went to the Army and this of course was a kind of a period of anxiety for our family because this is during the Vietnam conflict.  And so--but he never went to Vietnam.  The closest I think he went to Vietnam was he was stationed in Okinawa repairing tanks.  My whole family has mechanical--I have mechanical aptitude so the army recognized that and put him in some division, support division where he repaired heavy equipment like tanks.  So anyway, so prior to that, all of my siblings who had gone to college had gone to Virginia State College which is now Virginia State University.  It's a historically black university in Petersburg, Virginia.  So it was kind of naturally assumed that I would go there as well.
Story_ID: 20869
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So Davidson chose you and so how did this take place?  Did they--?
Speaker 2: So I forget but at some point in high school you start taking achievement tests or something, standardized tests and I would normally score reasonably well on the standardized tests I think, particularly in the math.  I'd almost get, I think I'd get most of those things perfect.  And I started getting literature from Davidson, either in the 10th or 11th grade.  I think it was part of their recruitment campaign.  So, but what I was looking at in a serious way was Virginia State [Virginia State University] because I kind of wanted to be--I'm trying to remember.  When I was a freshman, my sisters are three year older than me so they would have still been in college.  And so I was kind of looking forward to being in the same college with them.  In some ways it made me feel more comfortable about leaving home.  So--and I think everybody kind of assumed it.  So, by the time I was a senior and applying to college, I said okay, I think I'll apply to college at Davidson and my sister looked at the tuition and she said, boy, is this a dream or is this real that you're applying to this school?  I said well, I talked to my guidance counselor.  My guidance counselor advised me to apply to lots of schools and so I could raise the money to pay for the application and so I decided to apply to a few schools and Davidson was one of them.  And I got admitted and they started sending me financial aid material and it looked affordable.  So I decided to break the family tradition and to follow a different path and I don't know what was the turning point decision that made me do it.  Maybe it was the opportunity to do something different from my siblings.  I honestly cannot say what really drove that decision but it wasn't a light decision.  I remember thinking about it and mulling over it and over it and over it and finally it looked like it was doable and it looked like an interesting thing to try.  And of course the brochures made Davidson look like it was a resort, not a school.  But that wasn't the reason.  By that time, I knew the quality of education you could get at Davidson.
Story_ID: 20870
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was Davidson--how did you feel about it when you got there?  Did you like it when--?
Speaker 2: So at that time I didn't know what culture shock was.  I, I'd grown up in--though the schools had been integrated you know half of my life was in an integrated environment at school and the other half one was in a real, in some ways closed community that the--for the most part the Caucasian students at my school went back to their Caucasian neighborhoods and the Black kids went back to their Black neighborhoods and so after hours we were in some sense as segregated as we ever were as a people.  So the music I listened to, my philosophy of life and outlook on life was I would say typical people in my community and it was so different when I went to Davidson is that not only were people from different communities there that--and now you don't get the--you don't have the opportunity to go back to your house, right.  You're in a living environment and so in some sense you can say that there's no escape from the culture.
Speaker 1: Now did you have white roommates?
Speaker 2: My first year I had a Caucasian roommate, fantastic person.  And so that was one of the things that helped me over this what I now know as "culture shock", was the kindness of the people that I interacted with.  And so yeah, he was phenomenal.  He was--his father was in the--was I guess a career navy person and so he had traveled around different places.  And so we got along fantastic and got along fantastic with his family when they visited.  And so all of that helped get over that, but I have to admit when my family took me to college, we unpacked the car and I moved into the room and I watched the car pull away that night when they left, the lights got dimmer and dimmer and closer together.  I don't remember an emotion of feeling as sad as that ever in my life before.  I really felt sad.  I felt for the first time truly alone.  It wasn't because people weren't friendly or welcoming, it was that the music was different, their interests were different from my interests.  It was just a, it was like being dropped off in--on the moon and there were Martians and we were all humans, but it was so different, but you grow.  And so maybe internally I wanted that challenge.  I wanted to be able to grow that way.  Maybe that's why I chose Davidson and why Davidson chose me.
Speaker 1: Now did the difference, that cultural difference make any difference academically with your--
Speaker 2: Oh it has to because--
Speaker 1: --in terms of learning style and that sort of--
Speaker 2: It has to in some sense first of all because humans are emotional.  And so I was lonely even around people, I was lonely for some reason.  And it made--so what I found to do when I'm lonely or emotionally distraught, I found to compensate by working.  So what I did was I, instead of socializing like many of the freshmen would be doing, I would hide off and study.  And I think it was two reasons I would hide off and study.  One was because what I found out after being in some of the classes that many of the students who first of all, that almost all the students who were at Davidson seemed to have graduated in the top 10 percent of their class, right.  And so you know coming from a high school where I'd stand out you know kind of number two in my class to going to a class of everybody in the top 10 percent and not only that, a lot of them came from really great high schools, you know prep schools and many of them had, seemed to have read the literature that we were reading, studying the math that we were studying, had a physics course that was if not college level, close to it.  And so it, you know it almost seemed like I was, even with my academic record, playing catch up.  And it kind of didn't bother me because I was used to working hard.  And remember what I told you that my father was an example that you can compensate for a lot of things if you roll up your sleeve and work hard.  And so working hard did two things for me, it helped me cope with my loneliness and it also kept me academically solid.  And solid enough that after the first year I was offered a scholarship, an achievement scholarship at Davidson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, but that first year was probably one of the toughest years of my life.  But again, I hid in, I kind of hid away in my work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now had you decided to become a--?
Speaker 2: Physicist at that time?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No.  Actually I went to Davidson thinking of majoring in math.  And Davidson you know relative to other schools of kind of equal caliber was quite small at that time.  It was 1,200 students total.  Most--many high schools are larger than that, right?  So there was like only about 300 people in my freshman class.  So you know you got to know a lot of people personally.  And the faculty was you know what it had to be to teach about 1,200 students.  So the person who taught me my first calculus course in college happened to be a physicist by the name of Alan Wolf.
Speaker 1: Alma Wolf?
Speaker 2: Alan Wolf.
Speaker 1: Alan, Alan okay.
Speaker 2: He was probably one of the best professors I--as far as teaching I've had in my entire life.  You know he's one of those people that if you ever want to become a teacher, you think I'll take some of the things he did and emulate them.  But it wasn't just his strategy for teaching, his tactic for teaching, it was a combination of both that and his style and his personality all wound together.  So you can't really copy him because his personality was much of his teaching style as anything else.  But if you didn't enjoy learning from him then you must have been a block of wood or something.  He was fantastic.  So I took my first calculus course from him and so that made it very enjoyable.  It wasn't--and he made it so that it wasn't just abstract.  You know he could tie it to real world problems too.  So then I talked to my brother and my sister when I was a freshman and they said look, rather than putting off taking physics cause I know you're going to take physics anyway because you're going to be a math major.  You got to take some physical science being a math major.  So why don't you take physics next semester just to get a feel for it to see how you like it?  So, I enrolled in--Davidson at the time was on a, what I call a trimester system.  They had three semesters.  So right after thanksgiving was the beginning of the next term.  So I enrolled in a physics course and guess who taught that course?  Alan Wolf, the same person that taught me calculus.  And so--
Speaker 1: So this is your sophomore year?
Speaker 2: This is my freshman year.
Speaker 1: Your freshman year.
Speaker 2: The end of my freshman year.
Speaker 1: So this is '74 [1974] right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is '74 [1974], second term--
Speaker 1: Second term.
Speaker 2: --out of three.  So once I took that first course and Alan Wolf, I just fell in love with physics.  And I'm not going to say he sold physics on me, I think what he did was help me find my own way of looking at the topic and thinking about the topic and analyzing nature.  But I can't argue that he made it enjoyable.  And he's the type of guy that when we studied electricity and magnetism, he would run in the room and slide across the desk and draw a spark just to entertain us, you know build up static friction doing it.  And so he was fantastic and very encouraging.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: I mean all the professors there were, I have to admit.  I remember by the time I was a sophomore--remember I said I like tinkering?  So at the time discos were in and every college student wanted to have a stereo so I decided I'd build a color organ.  Color organ, I don't know if you know what that is, it's just a row of lights of different colors and different colors will become energized depending on the frequency range of the music.  And so you'd see the light changing colors by the tone of the music.  And so all that means is you have to build a bunch of band pass filters.  You take the audio, build a band pass filters and then make some switches to switch on the lights and off.  And so, you know and so I designed a circuit to do that and people, you know Alan--not Alan Wolf, Professor Lark (ph.) White was his name, used to let me into the electronic shop on Saturday so I could tinker with my circuits.  So there was a lot of kind of things that people would do to kind of--even though it wasn't a course I was taking.  I eventually took electronics from him but they just encouraged me to do whatever--if you had a hobby that they could see the educational value in it, they would do what they could to encourage it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was a fantastic time.

Speaker 1: Now one thing you did that's very remarkable--that's remarkable as I look at this outline is that you had a, what they call it, a year abroad, right your junior year?
Speaker 2: It wasn't a year abroad.  It was a year away from Davidson.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so one of the things Davidson did, they recognize so I think you mentioned earlier that Davidson had done two things in the early 70s [1970s].  They had started to integrate racially but also they had started to integrate by gender.  So when I came--Davidson used to be an all boy school, all men school and evidently they had enough dormitory space for about a thousand guys.  And when I came in this is '74 [1974], they had evidently enough dormitory room and they had 200 women at that time.  Since now--since then, they've of course grown and built more dormitories and I think it's equal parity between the genders I think.  They're probably up to about two thousand students, about a thousand women and a thousand men there.  But in--at the same time, they were starting to expand in terms of integrating racially so they were working on two fronts at the same time.  And being an academic, I now appreciate the challenges of both that they were doing more fully than I did then.  So one of the things they recognized I believe, or somebody recognized, is that just by opening the doors and bringing in students of color, might not meet all of their educational needs at the collegiate level.
Speaker 1: The students themselves?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And one of the needs that I think they recognized was to learn at the college level about the history of your people in this country and in the world in general.  And so there was no faculty on campus that would for instance, teach African American History, right?  And there was very little talk in the political science classes about the perspective of the minority view in the politics of this country or the world, even the sociology of the minority community.  In fact, I remember taking a sociology course at Davidson and the focus seemed to be when it came to black people, not on what we bring to the country but the burden that we bring to the country, our social problems, not so much our social attributes, you know, contributions.  So, one of the things that the administration evidently did was partner with historically black colleges and to make exchange programs.  And so one of the things I did and I'm so happy I did it was my junior year I spent at Howard University.  And my siblings were very delighted that I decided to do that because they had of course gone their entire college career at a historically black college and they thought that it would be a valuable experience for me to at least sample and see how--what the experience was like complete--cause college is a complete experience. And so--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So why did you choose Howard instead of one of the others, Hampton or another one of the other schools?
Speaker 2: Howard, because I had a family connection in Howard.  I'd been spending my--well first of all there was an older student who had gone to Howard and came back and said how great it was so never minimize the importance of you know peer telling you, reporting.  So that weighed quite heavily.  The other thing was that I had a lot of relatives in the Washington, D.C. [Washington, District of Columbia] area and so for that one year would put me closer to my family as well.  And remember, I had been kind of struggling that first year with kind of loneliness and longing for my family.  By the time my sophomore year I kind of matured out of that but I still had a longing to be with my family more.  And so I went to Washington to Howard and again it was fantastic.
Speaker 1: And who were some of your teachers at Howard and African American History or--well what did you take first of all?
Speaker 2: Well so I took a course in African American History and it was the first time I, and I'm embarrassed to say that I hadn't heard the name of John Hope Franklin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had never read anything by him up until that point.  And so it wasn't so much any particular teacher, it was the topics, it was the whole experience.  It was being in a classroom for instance in political science where the perspective was not from the majority.  The perspective was from my community's view on for instance issues of communism when we discussed socialism and communism.  Those were discussed from a community's perspective that I could identify with and I--yeah and so I truly enjoyed that.
Speaker 1: '77 [1977], were they still--
Speaker 2: Let me, let me--I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let me just say another thing.  I remember one of the distinct differences was I felt comfortable in political science classes and I'm emphasizing those and history classes because when I went, the agreement was that I would not take any major courses while I was away.  So I took very limited science courses.  I took I think one math course while I was there so it was all humanities and history and that type of thing.  But what I remember distinctly is that when I was in a course like sociology at Davidson, that when I spoke, I was always felt guarded in what I said because everybody would look at me and I would provide the black opinion.  And nobody would ever consciously say that to me and maybe I--it was just my feeling but I felt that, that when I spoke it was the black opinion on some social issue.  And I felt almost like I represented my whole race in some circumstances.  And also if there was another African American in the class and they said something that I didn't agree with, I would be silent.  There was some type of internal feeling that I didn't want to publicly disagree on a social issue with a fellow black student.  Don't know why, nobody taught me that.  Nobody told me that was the rule of code of behavior but it was just something I felt conscious of.  At Howard, man we had almost knock down drag out arguments in the class.  There was so much you know differences of opinions on any one topic, it was fantastic.  I felt free to debate other folks.
Story_ID: 20872
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, no '77 [1977] was the year that Jeff Donaldson Howard took a delegation to Festac, Nigeria.  Did you hear any of the repercussions of that when you were there [Howard University] or--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was the year, that's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Were they still having African Liberation Day there when you were there?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, of course.  And these are things that you, you know, you might even get a--might not get these at another black college, you know?
Speaker 2: Well the other thing was culture too.  For instance, you know to have people who are in, who are famous people come across campus that I think the students at Howard took for granted.  For instance they'd have, I guess we called him Stokely Carmichael [civil rights activist].  That's what we--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Kwame Ture in '77 [1977] is what he went by.
Speaker 2: Yeah, changed the name.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But we'd have people like that come and talk and it was, they just--the students just took it for granted.  Oh yeah we're going to see--and there was, it was always something to do.  And I remember for entertainment, we'd have--they'd have people like Stephanie Mills and just famous people come through like BB King [Riley B. King, American songwriter, vocalist and blues guitarist] and they just take, the students there just took it for granted.  You know at Davidson we'd have one thing that was for the African American students a year and it was kind of like that's the thing for the black students.  And I'm not criticizing them right, it was just a cultural difference.  And so I don't want it to sound like I'm criticizing the school, the institution, did what it could with the resources it had.  But it was clear that you know there were cultural preferences and differences.  And I actually applaud Davidson for having the insight to make these partnerships with historically black colleges and I hope they continue to do it.
Speaker 1: Would Howard students go to Davidson for a year?
Speaker 2: I think we only had about one or two do the reverse, yeah.  I'm not sure why.  I was thinking if I was a Howard student would I go to Davidson?  I think I would have tried it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were there a year and then went back to Davidson.
Speaker 2: And finished my senior year at Davidson.
Speaker 1: Okay
Story_ID: 20873
Speaker 1: Now you were working on an important project your senior year from what I read, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that's how I became connected to Duke [Duke University].  So I was--to do an honor's thesis you had to do a, an experiment.  So I was doing an experiment in low temperature physics measuring I guess the magnetic field strength that--or demonstrating the magnetic field strength that a super conductor would quench.  And a very famous physicist came to Davidson, gave a talk by the name of Professor Hors Meyer (ph.) who is now a colleague of mine here at Duke and he talked on Helium 3 phase transitions.  That was his--one of the areas that he worked on, one of the topics of his research exploration.  And while there he visited with undergraduates.  He was a phenomenal individual that he really encouraged young people to do science and research in particular.  And so he came down to the lab where I was working, I showed him what I was trying to do and told him what the technical challenges were and he of course understood them.  And went back, came back to Duke and remembered my project and sent me some super conducting wire to make myself a super conducting solenoid for my experiment.  And it--that experience, I never forgot it because when he came down, I knew he was pleasant.  He was pleasant to everybody.  I mean he was a gentleman.  I kind of thought that once he came back and got busy with his research he wouldn't remember.  But he remembered and he sent the roll of wire back and told us to use what we needed and keep the rest for future projects and I never forgot that.  So when I started applying to graduate schools, I applied to Duke, Georgetown, American University and the University of Maryland.  And so you can see probably a lot of them were in the Washington, D.C. [Washington, District of Columbia] area and that was kind of a personal choice for a number of reasons.  But when I visited Duke, one of the things that stuck out was that first of all Professor Meyer was here and he took a lot of time to talk with me when I visited and encouraged me to choose Duke.  And then a lot of other professors stopped what they were doing and met with me and you know this is somebody passing through on their spring break from college to visit graduate schools.  I forget what time of year it was but it was about that time when you did that.  And so I came with the idea after accepting and coming to Duke with the idea that I'd work with Professor Meyer but I changed my mind after being here and he was understanding and supportive of even that and has been a great support all of my professional career as quite a few of my colleagues here when I--that know me in making a transition from being a student to a researcher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well were you--you earned your BS in 70--
Speaker 2: '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: Eight, okay.  So you go into a program like many people do which is a combined Ph.--Masters-Ph.D. program right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Here at Duke?  Okay.  So what did you focus on--?
Speaker 2: So after coming here I decided to do research in experimental nuclear physics and that was for a variety of reasons I was attracted to that field.
Story_ID: 20874
Speaker 1: All right.  So you decide to go with a specialty in experimental nuclear physics, all right.
Speaker 2: So doing--there's a combination of reasons for that.  First, I liked the subatomic quantum nature of the field and at that time it used a lot of the electronic and computer skills and knowledge I had acquired during the summers while I was in college. So during the summers while I was in college, one of the things I had done was to work with a group of engineers and a naval research laboratory.  That group of engineers I think worked with a division called Off Board Countermeasures.  Their job was to develop technologies to protect ships against different types of threats so naively I divide them into kind of two board categories:  those who protect ships against radar guided missiles and those who protect ships against infrared guided missiles.  I worked with a group that developed technology to protect ships against radar seeking missiles.  And so these were mainly electrical engineers that I worked with.  And so during my summers with them I acquired quite a bit of engineering expertise.  In fact, by the time I was a junior in college I started debating if I went to graduate school would it be graduate school in electrical engineering or physics.  Eventually the physics one won over because I liked the--I shouldn't say I like.  The way of thinking about nature like a scientist or physicist matches my personality of asking questions about, fundamental questions about nature.  There is a side of me that also like--that's practical because I grew up on a farm that likes to also do something, build something.  And so the combination of wanting to ask fundamental questions about nature and also to be able to do something, build something has the right mix of becoming an experimentalist because what we do in the end is that we ask fundamental questions but we have to build equipment and instruments and systems of instruments to measure something, to--in the confusion, in the mix of all the types of information you can imagine measuring, to pull a piece of information out of nature that perhaps nobody else has done or to do it better than anybody's ever done, I find rewarding.  And so that was one of the reasons I was attracted to experimental nuclear physics is that at that time nuclear particle physics, and I think this is probably still true was probably not just using the most advanced technologies and electronics but also developing new types of electronics and computer systems.  You know one would argue that the ability for computers to share information across a network was developed in particle and nuclear physics.  So anyway, that was one of the reasons I was drawn to that field.
Story_ID: 20875
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you taught as well as doing a regular TA duties, teacher's assistant duties, you actually taught courses too from what I understand.  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I had an advisor who--I think I've been fortunate in my entire life to have people who had authority over me to give me freedoms and so my advisor Richard Walter, who eventually became my colleague and fried, gave me the flexibility that when I was in research--when I was a graduate student in his group that I could teach.  I could do what I may generally call now, outreach.  And so, yeah I taught general physics in a couple of summer programs in the area, in particular one that was in Chapel Hill that was operated by a lady by the name of Ivonia Allison (ph.).  She--I remember her because I tried to remember people who give me first opportunities.  So she gave me a first opportunity to not teach, I had been teaching as a teaching assistant here at Duke [Duke University] is a requirement for the Ph.D., but to design my own course and to lead my own course and so she gave me that first opportunity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I've read that there's a, there is a philosophy of teaching that you have that comes out of the black experience or the experiences you had growing up in school where repetition is more value than it is normally in college teaching.
Speaker 2: It could be.  So I'm a firm believer--I wouldn't call it repetition but I would call it multiple exposure to the same concepts.  And so one of the things I tried to do in every course I'm involved in is to give our students an opportunity to see the same concepts multiple times in different contexts because I think in doing that is where kind of a deeper understanding of what the concept really means comes from.  And so I'm also a believer that you know you used the word repetition but I think giving people enough exercises and work that they become internally familiar with the concepts that they can absorb it and it becomes a part of themselves eventually, I believe in that too.  And so I wouldn't--I don't, I won't call it repetition but I do believe in those two basic concepts.  And I think they come not just from the black community but that's certainly the way I was taught by my teachers but also the way I personally learned too, that I make sure that if I learn a concept I try to find different contexts where I can apply it.
Story_ID: 20876
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was the name of your dissertation for your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Oh boy.  Boy, now you're asking me archeology. [Laughter].
Speaker 1: Well what was it about?  If you can't think of it exactly.
Speaker 2: It was about neutron--so one of the things my professor did, Professor Walter was to understand the strong interaction in quite a complex system of particles that interact by the strong nuclear force and so one of the ways of probing that system is to scatter neutrons from it.  And so one piece of information that neutrons possibly give you cleanly is that it gives you the, what we call the strong interaction, completely the strong interaction.  So the other options you have for instance is to do things like study--scatter electrons from nucleus systems or scatter protons.  And in both cases they probe nuclear systems in a different way.  I think Jake Walter knows people who did neutron physics like that because they knew in a relatively clean way that the interactions they were looking at was only the strong interaction between the probe and the nucleus.  And so I scattered neutrons from silicon.  And why silicon, one of the reasons silicon was because it was called the self-conjugate nucleus which means that it has equal numbers of neutrons and protons and so it had a certain symmetry that we call isospin symmetry.  And so that was one of the reasons we chose that particular nucleus for my thesis.
Story_ID: 20877
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you did post-doctorate work at Triangle University National Laboratories.  Now--
Speaker 2: Nuclear Laboratory.
Speaker 1: Yes, right Nuclear should be here yeah.  There's a mistake here.  Okay, so tell us about Triangle University.  What is that concept?
Speaker 2: So that's a consortium that was started back in the late 60s [1960s] between Duke University, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University.  It was I guess one of the founding people was it was a Duke Professor by the name of Henry Newson [Henry Winston Newson].  And Henry Newson was one of those scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project [American atomic bomb program].  He was kind of a product of that project, you know working with people like Fermi [Enrico Fermi, scientist] and Oppenheimer [Julius R. Oppenheimer, scientist].  So he came to Duke and started nuclear physics and in some sense grew nuclear physics in the Triangle area.  And so it--he--this collaboration between the three institutions became I think the first multi-university consortium to do nuclear physics in that way and it just grew over the years.  And it's now one of five DOE [Department of Energy] Centers of Excellence at the Office of Nuclear Physics and Department of Energy.  Some of the other ones are MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], there's a center of excellence at Yale [Yale University], Texas A&M, University of Washington, at Seattle and I apologize if I leave somebody else out but those are the ones that come to mind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is it proper to call it TUNL [pronounced tunnel, TUNL, Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, TUNL is fine.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So--
Speaker 2: And so one of the things that make it--there are many things that make it different from national laboratories.  But one of the principal things that make it different from national laboratories is the emphasis on education and gradual education.  That consortium has educated more than seven percent of all of the experimental nuclear physicists in the country so it has a tremendous and strong reputation for educating.  And so one of the things that I think should be appreciated is that conducting research at the graduate level for the Ph.D. is an apprenticeship and we know about apprenticeships.  You know, for instance, when I told you my father was a cement finisher and to become a cement finisher he did an apprenticeship.  He followed a person who has mastered the skills.  That's how Ph.D. education works in general.  One of the things that TUNL provides is such a tremendously rich environment for graduate students in this apprenticeship environment.  They have not only access to their own advisor but they have access to all the other advisors from the other--all three universities.  And they get to mingle with you know in excess to about forty graduate students from all three universities.  Once they become a graduate student in that environment then the institutional boundaries are lowered and they really benefit in many senses from having peer colleagues from a bigger program than just in their own research group.
Story_ID: 20878
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so in '85 [1985] you joined the faculty at Duke [Duke University]  as the assistant professor of physics, right?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you were already pretty much familiar with the--you taught like introductory courses primarily?  Is that what--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, I've taught mostly introductory courses.
Speaker 1: And I was reading that you like those, you like to be, you like--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So when I started teaching maybe about five years afterwards, we were as a department going through a transitional phase where we were reorganizing how we teach what some departments call the big service courses.  So these are the courses that we teach to non-physics majors, people who are interested in the light sciences and in engineering.  That's our highest volume teaching load.  So one of the things, and I think at the time Professor Richard Walter was the Director of Undergraduate Studies.  One of the things that the department decided to do as a test case was to go to a large lecture format.  Prior to that, what we had done as a faculty would be to divide classes into about fifty to sixty students per professor and to teach let's say 360 students, we would have six professors, each with about sixty students.  What we decided to do was to go to a lecture format, large lecture format where these 360 or 300 students, whatever it is, would hear the same lecture from the same faculty member.  So I had an opportunity to be on the ground floor as one of the lead instructors when we first went to that format and there are many reasons I liked it.  I liked teaching intro physics course first of all, but also I think it gave me broader exposure to the broader deep community of students and I liked that as well because in addition to having a desire to mentor students of color, but mentor students in general of course, but to mentor students of color in particular, I also thought it was important that students in general be educated by people of color.  And so being associated with these large lecture courses gave me a pretty broad exposure to the students and let students see a minority person or African American teaching a science course.  And for many of my--I suspect I may have been the first, hopefully not their only black teacher of science, mathematics or engineering.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is--well I guess I'm forced to ask this cause after having been a part of those colleges, it seem like it's a lot of--well you have graduate assistants too but it's a lot of work grading all those papers isn't it when they all come in at once like that?  It's a, seems like the work load on somebody teaching a big--classes.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, but I guess I failed to give you the details that--so we had I think the appropriate number of graduate students assigned to help us with things like grading but we've made a commitment as a department that direct teaching of the students would be done by faculty members.  So in addition to having a lecturer, there would be faculty members what we taught what we called the recitation sections.  And that's where the students what I would say did the heavy lifting of learning the concepts and applying the concepts.  And so right now for instance I teach three recitation sections on intro physics for the life science students and that's where the students get the personal contact with their professors.  That's where you bring back the intimacy of teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because--and I'm sorry--I'm glad you asked that question because otherwise you would think that what we've done as a department is depersonalize teaching the intro courses just to serve the numbers.  No, we understand that teaching is a very intimate and personal thing.  It's--that happens in the smaller sections where we break out into about thirty students per professor and we meet with them once for a couple of hours every week.
Story_ID: 20879
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in '87 [1987]--stop me if I'm going too fast but in '87 [1987] you served as a visit scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And what was that experience like and what was your mission there?
Speaker 2: So it was still experimental nuclear physics.  So at that time they had just brought online what they call a white neutron source, WNR I guess, and what that was, was a beam of neutrons.  From my perspective it was a beam of neutrons that had a continuous energy distribution from about I don't know twenty maybe up to a couple of hundred immediately useful.  And so I did experiments at that facility mainly reactions to study the strong interactions in nuclei so it was still fundamental physics though Los Alamos has a strong applied component as well.  I stayed with the fundamental physics questions.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think I spent a couple of visits there but again working on fundamental strong interaction physics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In '89 [1989], you, you're a faculty fellow at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, SLAC, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So yeah, so that--boy I'm trying to remember.  So that was an experiment to do deep inelastic scattering, basically to look at the substructure of nucleons using the high energy electron beam at SLAC.  It was--so it was a project called Pegasus that was--had leadership coming from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and so they invited me to collaborate on that experiment and so I went out for a year and we did design studies.  But unfortunately, Pegasus was a horse that never flew in this case but it was a great experience.
Story_ID: 20880
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you were promoted in 1992 to associate professor here at Duke and during this year you also were a visiting scientist at the Jefferson Laboratory in Newport News, Virginia.  That's the Jefferson National Accelerator Facility?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: That's high energy physics, right?
Speaker 2: That's, well you--I guess it depends on your perspective whether you call it high energy.  High energy is probably like Fermi Lab and the Large Hadron Collider.  It's high energy for studying nuclear systems and the strong interaction and what we call I guess the structure of nucleons, neutrons and protons.  So it's yeah, it's the highest energy machine in the U.S. for that type of science.  So one of my interests in going to J-Lab was to--it almost seems like a lot of the things that I do come back to my love for using the neutron as a laboratory to study fundamental properties of nuclear matter but also to use the neutron as a probe of nuclear matter.  So in this case one of the things that attracted me to Jefferson Lab was to use the neutron as a laboratory for studying more fundamental nuclear physics.  And so one of the experiments that my group participated in and I think one of my students got a Ph.D. associated with, was to measure the electric and magnetic distributions inside the neutron and that was a combination of using a beam of polarized electrons and measuring the polarization of the neutrons that came out of the system.  And so that made good use of my understanding of an experience in neutron physics.
Story_ID: 20881
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in 1993 you became an adjunct professor of North Carolina State University.  That's--
Speaker 2: North Carolina State?
Speaker 1: Was that--that's what it says.
Speaker 2: North Carolina Central I hope.
Speaker 1: North Carolina Central, okay, here we go.
Speaker 2: University.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So North Carolina Central University, that's the--my wife is an alumni of that institution.  It's a historically black university that's here in Durham, North Carolina.  And over the years we formed research collaborations with faculty from NCCU and so in doing that I have had the pleasure of working with some of their students.  And so one of the things I wanted to do is to be able to mentor some of their students in a formal way.  And so I asked if they would consider me joining their faculty as an adjunct capacity and they agreed to do that.  And so I've had the nice relationship with them to be able to mentor their students.  In fact, one of my students that I'm mentoring now here at Duke [Duke University] in the medical physics program is a graduate from the undergraduate program at NCCU.  And I think in large part, part of the reason he chose me as a mentor is because he worked with me when he was an undergraduate.  Worked with me--he chose me as a mentor for his Ph.D. research.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I think--and we're having over the years much closer relationship with the department there in the experimental nuclear physics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is it really--how important is it for a school like North Carolina Central to have that kind of partnership with a place like Duke in terms of facility and that sort of thing?  Is it essential or is it, does it really enhance the--?
Speaker 2: It's important.  I mean I, they have a faculty of ambitious people there, talented and so I, you know probably independent of their collaboration with anybody they're going to be successful.  But what I hope is that we make the path forward for them easier and faster.  They're aspiring to be a lead research institution.  As you probably know historically black universities started off with the priority in teaching and have realized the importance of having some research by their faculty and their students be involved in research, both at the undergraduate and graduate level.  And so for them at the stage they're at in developing a research department, we look for opportunities that are advantageous to their growth and for our research mission and our teaching mission and so we're finding quite a few.  There's collaborations in both fundamental experimental nuclear physics and applied nuclear physics in their department.
Story_ID: 20882
Speaker 1: Okay.  In '94 [1994], it says here you go back to the Jefferson, to the J-Lab [Jefferson National Laboratory]  for the second time I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So that's probably to do the--so I think the first visit was developing the experiment and the second visit as I remember it was to carry it out.  So these are long term commitments on these experiments.  They're not quite as long as for instance some neutrino experiments or some rare counting experiments that you may have been exposed to where it takes ten years before you get your first data point.  They're a little bit faster than that but they're on the order of five years from the time you conceive them to the time you're taking data.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How accessible is the accelerator?  I mean I've interviewed astrophysicists who have to sign up for the keg telescope or something some time ahead of time so they can get in line to use it.  I mean is it, do you have to really reserve a spot well ahead of time to use the--?
Speaker 2: So it depends on the facility.  A national user facility like the Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory, there's a formal process where you have to make a proposal of what you want to do with the beam time.  And there's a committee of experts that will review that proposal along with other proposals and say yes or no.  It merits use of accelerator time or not.  We have at TUNL, one of the things that make us unique of many of the centers of excellence, I think now there are only two centers of excellence in the country that--at universities that operate accelerators, that's TUNL and Texas A&M, is that we have particle accelerators.  And so we have small accelerators where we basically as a faculty, run it like you would a big microscope, we sign up for it in principle.  We also have another accelerator that's a 1GUV light source, 1GUV electron beam that's a gamma ray light source.  That has a more formal procedure similar to J-Lab.  We solicit proposals, have a committee of experts review those and we make a decision on which experiments merit beam time, which ones don't.

Speaker 1: Okay.  So we were talking about the J-Lab [Jefferson National Laboratory].  Did you--I was asking you off camera did you know Dr. Gaye who was at Hampton [Hampton University] you know, he's associated with J-Lab.  Did you all work together on any projects?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember.  So the way J-Lab was organized at that time is that there were three experimental halls, A, B and C.  And the experiment that I was associated with at my first visit was in Hall A.  And I think Paul since he was associated with Hampton was in Hall C.  And so I, during the first visit we knew each other and there was also a gentleman from Hampton in Hall C also, Keith Baker who's now at Yale.  And so yeah, so I knew both of them and associated with them but I worked in a different hall at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right '94 [1994], now the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation Nuclear Science Advisory Committee.  Now what--so you're appointed to this--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So our community has a tradition I think in the last twenty, twenty five years of doing what we call grassroots strategic planning.  It's a--every so often we get together as a community of scientists and reflect on our accomplishments as a community and look forward to the--how we might invest the limited resources we have in exploring and understanding the nucleus better.  And so the primary two funding agencies that support fundamental research in nuclear physics are the National Science Foundation  (NSF) and the Office of Nuclear Physics at the Department of Energy (DOE).  They put together an advisory committee and that's what you just said, the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee that's made up of experts around the nation.  These are termed appointments, I forget, maybe five years or something you're on the committee that from time to time the agency will call this committee together to address issues of how to allocate resources for different types of scientific questions.  I'll give you an example, in the last year they called together the committee to address progress that had been made on fundamental symmetry measurements using neutrons.  And about every seven years the committee gets together and lead the entire nuclear physics community in the U.S. in developing a long range plan for the nation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think at the time when I served on it that was one of those periods where we put together a long range plan for the nation.
Speaker 1: How long does that take basically?  I mean do you try to do it in one weekend or--?
Speaker 2: It's about--we do it in a year.
Speaker 1: In a year, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So what we do is, as a community we do it in about a year.  We get the charge from the agencies, NSF and the--not we, the committee gets the charge from the NSF and DOE and then once a charge is issued to that committee, the committee then energizes the entire nuclear physics community.  And one of the ways we do--the committee does that is they organize a series of town meetings around scientific questions and so that naturally brings together different communities of people who are doing nuclear physics.
Story_ID: 20884
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now in '98 [1998], not long after that, you serve as a nuclear physics program director at the National Science Foundation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That was a--I'm really glad I did that.  It gave--it allowed me for a moment to lift my head from my so-called microscope of looking at the narrowness of what I do.  All of what you do is to answer some bigger question of course but in the day to day practice of accomplishing things you typically break it up into smaller parts and do really focused things to make progress on bigger questions and bigger problems.  So going to the National Science Foundation gave me a chance to kind of pull my head away from my microscope and look more broadly at nuclear physics as an intellectual enterprise.  And so that year I looked broadly at the questions that everybody was asking and not just looking at the questions that everybody was asking but also understanding how you can make progress on some of those questions with limited resources, how to set priorities on where you wanted to invest taxpayers' dollars.  And since then I've been even asking broader questions about the appropriateness of using taxpayer dollars to do research.  There's been some discussion and I'm glad this discussion is fleeing discussion about should taxpayers actually pay for fundamental research or should there be something like an endowment from the private sector to do that, right?   Because in some sense the things that we discover in the laboratories, we put in the books, eventually perhaps some private entrepreneur will use it to build something, to make a profit off it.  So should there be some endowment from some private foundations and that's how we do science, fundamental research in particular.  I have my own opinion on that.  I would hope that we don't move in that direction.  I think that's the wrong way to look at basic research.  I think one way to look at basic research I think that is more healthy is that it ties back to our species survival and prosperity, that humans are born and most mammals are born with a certain level of curiosity.  And curiosity is no more than our questioning something about our existence, about the world we live in.  To ask questions that we perhaps don't need to know the answer at the moment.  So, and so I think the issue is that we don't know what we need to know to prosper and history shows that.  I can give you lots of examples where--and by the way, it's a very few people who do what I call curiosity driven research or basic or fundamental research in the whole population of the world, there's only a handful of people to do it.  And so those are the people who have to discover most of the new knowledge of the entire species.  And I believe it is in the best interest of the entire community, the entire country, entire world that everybody in some way who is productive in society contribute to that enterprise because it helps secure up the knowledge base for future generations.  I think we have to avoid the risk--and maybe I'm getting a little bit too far off in this direction, but I think we have to avoid the risk of looking at science as a mechanism for developing gadgetry.  That if you're going to ask this question what good is it, what good is knowing the age of the universe, what good is knowing where high energy gamma rays come from, what good is knowing you know why if I ping a nucleus with a certain electromagnetic wave it resonates in a certain way, what good is knowing all of that, I don't think that's the right way to pose the question.  I think what we're doing is building up libraries of knowledge that it takes a complete library to do something with. And so I'll give you the example for instance, one of the most esoteric piece of knowledge that I can imagine, particle and physicists did in the 1930s was discover anti-matter.  And at first glimpse someone might say yeah, that's neat.  That's neat, particle physics you can make science fiction from it.  In Star Trek the energy, their space ship is powered by matter, anti-matter reactor.  That's all nice.  What do you do with anti-matter?  Why should we spend millions of dollars to understand it, you know why?  Well it was discovered by I think his first name was Carl Anderson at Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology] in 1939 if I'm remembering right and I don't think Anderson ever questioned that it would be useful for something.  Now if you walk into any modern medical center like Duke [Duke University] or anywhere else, the one at Hampton, what you find is the use of anti-matter.  It's called positron emission tomography.  We take that technology for granted that we use anti-matter in that technology and it was discovered in the 1930s.  Whoever would have thought that you'd use it that way?  And so there's lots of examples that way that came out of basic research that nobody ever thought or even cared about that it would be of any practical use.  And so I think as humans what we have to do is continue to collect information about our world and build libraries of it and eventually those libraries are the grounds that we search.  Those are our banks that we search for new inventions in.  And so I don't think we should be trying to make a tit for tat type relationship between funding a project or not when it's asking a fundamental question.
Story_ID: 20885
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know being here at Duke [Duke University] I was, I don't know what, to an extent--what extent Duke participated in the investigation of cigarettes.  Remember the, they had the--I know tobacco companies at one time were funding scientists to come up with conclusions about cigarettes.  Is that the kind of danger you run into when the only funding for research is from private industry or--?
Speaker 2: So you do have to be a little careful because--well the--so I started the course called physics and the economy and some of the issues we talk about is precisely this.  Why--we explore, why should taxpayers pay for basic research?  And what is the role of private industry in both basic research and development research?  And you know after a semester of conversation and discussion, I think it's fair to conclude that what students and I probably agree on, it's a seminar so I let the students draw their own conclusion is that the roles of private sector and government are very different when it comes to research.  That to build a database of knowledge, libraries of knowledge requires sustained, continuous investment in a very slow process.  When I read the literature on companies investing in research what I hear is a language from a business perspective that talks about managing risk, right, that they see investing research even at the development level and I'm not talking about fundamental research, I'm talking about product development, gadgetry development, they see that as managing risk.  Now they know to hit the big breakthroughs they have to have some risk and so it's striking that balance between how much money do you risk on something that could be the next big thing versus putting that money into making more of what you know what you can make and getting a product out and selling more gadgetry, right?  And so there's a natural tendency to go in that lateral way.  For instance, one of the questions I ask my students when they first walk into class on the first day, I say look I'm going to give each one of you $10 million hypothetical play money.  And behind this door over here there's a group of scientists from leading institutions in the world, Princeton [Princeton University], Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology] you know in the U.S., Cal Tech, MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], you know all the leading institutions.  They are all in there and they claim that they're very close to making a breakthrough on the next new energy source that will power industrialized nations.  Over here is a company who says that they need money, they've already made the gadget, they got a market but they would like to retool their factory to do an upgrade on this gadget and to produce more of it and the market is already there.  What are you going to do with your money?  Are you going to go with this, the next new, big energy source with all the brainiacs behind the door or that one?  And you know ninety percent of the students said I'm putting most of my money over there.  I might put a million over there but I'm putting most of it over here.  Even young people understand that you know even for the smartest people that are behind that door you're taking a risk cause something brilliant could come from it or just some accumulated knowledge that ends up in a book can come from it, who knows.  And I think business sees exactly that.  They will put less emphasis on the accumulated knowledge that will come from the experience in that room and I think that's where governments have to make the investment.  And in the long term we know it pays off because we are technologically where we are because of those investments.
Story_ID: 20886
Speaker 1: Oh, your third visit to the Jefferson Lab in '99 [1999].  What were you trying to do at that point?
Speaker 2: Oh boy, I'm trying to remember the third one now.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) yeah.
Speaker 2: That was '99 [1999].
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: I hope that wasn't--what was that?  Oh, that was actually a follow-up of an experiment to measure the proton electromagnetic form factor using a very similar technique that was used for the neutron.  So that was a follow-up of that experiment, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was all internal structure of the nucleon.
Speaker 1: All right.  So this is a project that's taken a span of years to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah taken a decade basically to complete.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because when I went there the first time, there was nothing.  When was the first visit to Jefferson Lab?
Speaker 1: It had to be in the 80s [1980s] wasn't it (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Was it the 80s [1980s], late 80s [1980s] or early 90s [1990s]?  I believe--I've lost track of time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, early 90s [1990s], yeah '92 [1992].
Speaker 2: Okay, '92 [1992].  So in '92 [1992], was that really the first time there?
Speaker 1: That's what it says here.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So if that was really the first time there, there was nothing there.  The halls had not been completed so that first year we were writing code and developing equipment to do experiments that first time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, that was kind of a, what I call a green--building a Greenfield Laboratory.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were there in '92 [1992], '94 [1994] and then in '99 [1999]?
Speaker 2: Yeah. So the last two visits were associated with the neutron form factor measurement.  The first one was really just basically building the equipment to do the experiments.
Story_ID: 20887
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in 2000, you become a member of the Mellon Minority Dissertation Grant Committee and Academic Coordinator for the Summer Medical and Dental Education Program at Duke University Medical Center.  Is that true?
Speaker 2: I thought it was, not the Mellon.  The Medical Summer Education Program was funded by the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation.
Speaker 1: Oh, Robert Woods Johnson, okay.
Speaker 2: But there was--I am also involved in the Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship Program.  It's been renamed but it was the Mellon Minority Undergraduate Research Program.  But the one associated with the medical--so I was the first academic coordinator for that program.  Great program, it still runs.  I think the name has changed.  I think it's now the Summer Medical Dental Educational Program.
Speaker 1: So this is a program by which--this is a program for college students or--?
Speaker 2: So this is a program that was proposed by a surgeon by the name of Brenda Armstrong in the Duke Medical Center.  I think she's now the Dean of the Medical School.  I have to look that up but I think that's right.  Anyway, this is a program that several in the medical school conceived of with her at the lead, was to bring in minority students and to give them an educational experience during the summer.  And that experience would consist of a number of things.  And we had at that point I won't say a free hand to develop the experience, but we had a lot of freedom to do it.  So in working with them what we decided to do was to have a component where it was highly academic and a component that was, had a clinical component as well.  And what we decided we wanted to come out of this was not just a summer where the students came and they kind of followed the doctor around and saw what a doctor does and find out what it's like being in the month of a doctor's life, but rather to take a moment and to review some of the science courses that are required to become a doctor at the undergraduate level.  And so we started what we call a preview portion to the program where we taught introductory physics at the college level because to some students in the life sciences, even though they've had high school physics or high school chemistry or high school calculus, when they come to college it's taught in a little bit different level of required understanding.  And so we wanted to take away the classroom shock of being exposed to the course at the college level.  So we taught kind of Duke level physics, Duke level organic chemistry and I think calculus was another course we taught and maybe cell biology.  Not the course but what we did was gave them a, kind of a third of a semester preview of what they can expect when they go back to their home institutions and take those courses because what you don't--what we didn't want was the performance in some of these courses to be the thing to stop them from being a doctor.  We wanted them to be strong in those courses because I'm a firm believer that medicine is a science and that students should think like scientists and be strong in the basic sciences.  One could argue that it's an applied science but I think it's still a science.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now 2001, you became the academic coordinator for the Minority Medical Education Program of Duke [Duke University].
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is the program.
Speaker 1: And that's the one, okay.  And became full professor that year?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now that was a great experience and I enjoyed the people I worked with.  And the students, I think it has a track record of the students who participate in that program of having high admissions to medical schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know they're starting now, I think there are enough years that they can start collecting statistical with significant feedback from the students.  But when I was there mostly anecdotal, but the students who wrote back said that it really made a big difference when they took their first physics course and they took their first organic chemistry course back at their home institution.  You know it was great to have that kind of jump start here in the summer.  And what we didn't want to have and I had been a part of a number of programs, what I didn't want to have was a program that exposed students to the right kinds of stuff like seeing what it really is like to be a doctor to go follow them on their rounds and stuff and really be excited about it and then go back and have not the type of performance in their basic science courses that are required because I always felt that academic performance and my colleagues who helped form this program agree with that, that academic performance is as encouraging as anything else.
Story_ID: 20888
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now 2001, you are also hired as deputy director of the Triangle University's Nuclear Laboratory and you eventually in 2006 would become a director.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: So this is--well tell us about what happened in this period of time I guess.
Speaker 2: So at the time, I think Vernon Tornow was the director.  He's--we're all colleagues that work at the laboratory.  It's about twenty faculty members at the three universities doing research and about forty to forty five graduate students at any one time.  So it's a sizeable community of people and it's a good community to work with.  I was honored when they asked me if I would be willing to consider being director of that consortium.  So it gave me an opportunity to serve them.  It is a community of people that I professional have benefitted from and grown through over the years and so it gave me a chance to give back in some sense.  I see most leadership positions as first of all positions of service and so I'm delighted to serve this community of people and I hope I can continue to do a job that they're happy with.
Story_ID: 20889
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you describe the high intensity gamma ray source?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was one of our inventions here at Duke.  So it has a long story behind it but it is a one of a kind facility presently in the universe, in the world.  But there are countries now looking at the technology and will probably duplicate it in a different way for their applications.  But it's a technology that grew out of I guess kind of the 1990s when Professor John Madi (ph.) was here with another Professor Vladimir Litvinenko.  And they came up with the idea that in this storage ring free electron laser accelerator, they could get, they could produce gamma rays in some sense almost for free.  That if you have photons from the free electron laser bouncing back and forth between two mirrors in the optical cavity like each laser, every laser has to have and an electron circulating in a ring at the same time, you can time them so that they electron bunch collides head on with the photon bunch reflecting between the two mirrors.  And then when a 1GUV electron bunch collides with a 2EV photon bunch then you can get a boost of tens to hundreds of MEV in the back scattered photon.  And so that then becomes a gamma ray and it's at the right wavelength that you can use to probe nuclear matter.  So we use now this high intensity gamma ray source which reduces the most intense beam of polarized gamma rays in the world to do both basic fundamental nuclear physics research and applied research.  Several groups have found a use for it in studying nuclear physics that is relevant to the mission of Department of Homeland Security.  One of the goals of the Department of Homeland Security is to be able to safeguard the nation from threats of a nuclear nature.  And so one of the things that they're working on is developing technologies that will help them look inside cargo and containers for I guess special nuclear materials.  And so we use that facility to do the nuclear science that's relevant to developing those technologies and I won't go into the details of that but in general a fluorescence of a nucleus and the other one is using fission induced by gamma rays.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20890
Speaker 1: Okay, how--can you discuss maybe how the gamma ray technology is actually used by homeland security?  How would they use that to determine (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so one of the promises is to develop the technology that will aid our law enforcement agents at ports of entry to remotely scan for special nuclear materials.  This is not replacement of law enforcement agents on the floor but it's a way of augmenting what they can do, the technology.  So it's becoming clear I think that it will take multiple types of technologies to achieve their goal.  So I can imagine a multi-layer technology where they for instance to a scan of cargo first with x-rays.  And right now the technology for doing three dimensional imaging and x-rays is quite excellent, developed in the medical industry and now it's being applied in security in many ways.  And so that tells them if there's perhaps something massive inside the cargo and the types of special nuclear materials you're looking for, things like uranium, plutonium, they're typically more massive than lead.  And so something very massive, more massive than steel shows up then it may want them to take a second look.  And so then you can imagine using another type of beam to focus in on that particular part of the cargo container and they're looking at probing with gamma rays more energetic photons.  And so it turns out that there's a technique called nuclear resonance fluorescence that every nucleus when you shine a gamma ray on it, it will excite it and de-excitate and give you a spectrum that is characteristic of that particular isotope, that particular nucleus.  And so atomic spectroscopy has been around for a long time and this is basically the same type of concept applied to the nucleus.  The other type of thing you can imagine too is shining gamma rays in there and see if you get neutrons coming off.  If you shine gamma rays in and neutrons come off then that implies that the material is a fissionable material.  And there's a group at TUNL that are using, developing this, the basic nuclear physics for the fission approach as well as for the nuclear resonance fluorescence approach the two groups developed in both types of science.
Story_ID: 20891
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now back at Duke, you're a, you were director of undergraduate studies for--in the Department of Physics.  You were an adjunct professor of medical physics here as well.  The--have you ever been department chair here (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You smile like--
Speaker 2: Well that's again a service.  We have a long line of what I call very good department chairs and so yeah, I'm not sure.  I, I'm a service oriented person but that's a big service.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, I know lots of professors who don't want to be the department chair.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: For one reason or another.
Speaker 2: I believe in serving but right now it's certainly not for me.  I'm overextended as it is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So the ties to the medical physics program for me is--came out of a natural opportunity, kind of natural opportunity.  So I do a bit of, I don't want to--I guess interdisciplinary research.  So one of the things that my group does is to use radio isotopes to study plants and we do that in collaboration with faculty in the biology department here at Duke.  So we started in, from my perspective in a modest way because my primary research effort is in basic research.  But it turns out that a lot of the technologies used in studying plants were already developed in medicine.  And so what we're doing now is adapting technologies that were developed in medical imaging and to producing radio isotopes that can be absorbed and used by plants.  A lot of those were developed in the medical industry and so we're using those to apply them to plants.  And so one of the reasons I wanted to have an adjunct faculty appointment in medical physics is so that I could attract and mentor students who are interested in the types of technologies that would be useful for our plant research.  And so what we do basically is we make for instance a, called an isotope of carbon and put it in the form of a gaseous carbon dioxide and the plants absorb that through the photosynthetic process, they do photosynthesis, converts the carbons to sugars and we can track where the sugars go in different types of plants under different conditions.  That research is starting to grow.  We're collaborating not just with scientists here at Duke [Duke University] but also with scientists at Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory.  They're in fact developing our next generation imagers for plants.
Story_ID: 20892
Speaker 1: Okay.  Talk about your work with the American Physical Society.
Speaker 2: So I've also had service responsibilities both in the Division of Nuclear Physics and more recently I chair the executive, where in the chair line for the executive committee for the Few Body Topical Group.  And so again it's a service.  It's part of my way of giving back to a profession that has in many ways given to me as a, you know as a professional.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The American Physical Society is an umbrella organization for all physicists in the U.S. and so it does quite a bit of things and one of the big things it does, it sponsors meetings for our community.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And also provides a forum for us to organize ourselves topically.  And so I'm a member of the Few Body Topical Group and also Division of Nuclear Physics and I've had opportunity to serve both of those communities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are you a part of the--I was surprised one day to find a website that said Physicists of the African Diaspora.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Are you part of that group with the--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So as part of my service to the American Physicists Society, I also shared the--chaired the Committee on Minorities, I forget when that was.  I lose track of time.  But that was very rewarding.  One of the things I promoted, not sure if I started it but I certainly promoted it and that was giving young scientists an opportunity to speak at major meetings.  And so I particularly wanted to give opportunities for people who were doing their post-doctorial fellowship or students who were in their last year of their Ph.D., not just to give talks cause most of us in this community give talks that are what we call contributed talks, you know ten minute talks at major meetings or give posters.  So we're used to doing that.  What I wanted was a forum and an opportunity that will allow minority students to give invited talks at some of these sessions so that was one of the things that I promoted and got help to run when I was on that committee.
Story_ID: 20893
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you've published quite a bit and I--can you describe your latest work, your current work in layman's terms so we can understand what you're doing right now?
Speaker 2: So I guess the two most recent things that I--well I can tell you the easiest thing to describe is that some of the work that I did with the group in medical physics.  One of the things that a group, one of my former colleagues and we're still working on it, was something called Inspect, I think it was called, neutron (unclear) by excited--god, I forget all the acronyms.  But what he wanted--what this group wanted to do was to use neutron beams or particle beams to do diagnostics of tissue.  There is a, there's data in literature, in the literature that shows that there are certain elements that have a higher frequency than normal in cancerous tissue and so with this information one of our collaborators started to look at suppose you had an imaging technology that could image tissue and tell you something about it's elemental composition?  So, one way of doing that is to use similar techniques that are used in nuclear physics.  And so what we were proposing to use is either a photon beam or high energy gamma ray beam like over at the HIGS [High Intensity Gamma-Ray Source] facility or a neutron beam that we can produce downstairs in our lower energy accelerator laboratory.  And so we did that, we started an R&D program.  First of all we stopped and we asked ourselves is there any fundamental physics reason why this can't work and the answer was no, but there are technical challenges.  And the technical challenges is to make an accurate enough measurement to distinguish the abundance of certain elements like calcium was one of the things we wanted to look at.  Iron was another one that we wanted to distinguish out and to look at the concentration of iron per cubit centimeter of tissue to see if we could get a signature for cancerous tissue.  So that was one of the things we worked on and I think you'll see that in some of my recent publications.  The other thing that I've always had a fascination with too that you'll see in some of my recent publications that are probably coming out within this year too is to measure the basic interaction between two neutrons, that still is a bit of a challenge to be able to do and one of the things that--so we've done that quite a few times and so you'll see that also in the literature.  One of the problems of trying to measure the interaction between two neutrons is because we can make a neutron beam but we cannot make a neutron target and so we're always trying to measure that by some indirect technique that requires a theoretical interpretation of data.  And so you know every five years or so we'll get a new idea of how to do that and so I think you'll see that in some of my most recent publications as well.  And of course I think some of the work that we've been doing for homeland security and has recently come out in the literature and that is nuclear resonance florescence.  For instance, we did nuclear resonance florescence on uranium 235 and uranium 238 and discovered new excited states in those elements that nobody had ever seen before and it's purely because we have the most sensitive facility for doing that in the world, that's the HIGS facility.  It's the highest, most high--highest intensity polarized gamma ray beam in the world and that allows us to do certain things that nobody else can do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, that's part of a, Triangle Universities'--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So one of the things that is, it's not my research but one of the emphasis at Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory is something called fundamental symmetries and the study of weak interactions.  And to a lay person, people may ask why would anybody spend so much time studying fundamental symmetry and weak interactions?  Weak interactions, what do I mean by that?  If I, if the strong nuclear force, the thing that binds nuclei, it's--lets, let me give it a strength of one.  Then the weak interaction which is the other part of the nuclear force is about 10-7 so it's about ten million times weaker than the strong interaction.  Why is that important?  Well there's a lot of consequences of it and it's--many are starting to believe that it is these weak interactions that led to the initial breaking of symmetries that give us the universe that we have today.  That in the beginning there must have been some process, some force that broke the symmetry between for instance matter and anti-matter so we end up with a surplus of matter and that's why the universe is mostly matter today.  But the other thing that's more at home that I think most people take for granted in a weak interaction and that is the burning of stars.  Remember I told you that one of the things I missed about growing up on a farm and I kind of took for granted was the night sky?  Well all of those dots, all of those stars are burning by nuclear fusion and generating light and the closest one to us is the sun, right?  And so most people I think never think about the connection between nuclear process and life.  In some ways we live on this planet because of the nuclear processes in the sun but those nuclear processes are not driven by the strong interaction, they're driven by that interaction that is ten million times weak.  It is electro-weak fusing of four hydrogens to make helium that burns hydrogen to make our sun glow and that bathes our solar system with light and gives us the temperature for life to exist on this planet.  So in some sense the electro-weak interaction is responsible for life on our planet and in a big way, it's responsible or life in the sense that supposed it was the strong interaction.  It turns out that suns--stars like our sun live billions of years.  Our sun I think is about five billion years now and scientists predict it has about five to seven more billion years it can burn.  Well it takes billions of years for life to develop on planets.  If it was burning by the strong interactions, stars would live probably millions of years not billions.  So that weak force, that if you just took it for granted that why are scientists studying and putting so much effort in it, has huge consequences.  So something small can have a consequence.  That's one of the reasons I really am fascinated by subatomic physics.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you see, I mean I know you served on some of the minority committees for American Physical Society.  Are we getting young minority candidates at the rate that you should be getting them?
Speaker 2: Well I don't know about should be but it is what it is.  As a nation I would--we should try, we should always try to do better.  We should--let me back up from that.  We should always be trying to attract those people who have the potential to contribute to the mathematic and scientific infrastructure of our nation.  And I think we're not attracting all the people from, in particular minority communities that could be contributing but it starts early. I think there are lessons to be learned by looking at in the last decade the success and the steps though they're not where we should be as a nation yet either.  It's a progress that women scientists are making and so for instance, if I look back ten years and see where we are now and what I think I see in the pipeline, I think the nation is headed in the right direction as far as involving people of both genders in this enterprise, pursuit of new knowledge.  We're not doing as well when it come to minority communities and one of the things I believe and I don't have statistical data to back up all my belief but I do have anecdotal experiences, is that one of the reasons I think the success has happened with gender diversification is that it's the same, it involves the same community of people.  So culturally women are not that different from men.  How we see ourselves in the role we see ourselves in society is in large part due to our communities that we grow up in and so I think being more inclusive of attracting people into our field from the communities like what I grew up into requires a different type of effort.  It requires early on people seeing themselves as tinkerers, seeing themselves as being smart enough to figure it out if another human built it.  If another human understood it, I can understand it too, you know.  Those type of attitudes I think but those are cultural and social and so I think we're doing a better job at reaching out but I think it certainly is a pipeline issue.  If we've doubled the number of African Americans for instance doing physics in the last decade, it's still small maybe going from .8 percent to you know 1.4 percent so it's on a magnitude lower than this country has the potential to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have some theories but I'm going to keep it off camera for now.
Speaker 1: Okay, well--
Speaker 2: I've engaged (unclear).
Speaker 1: I didn't want to step on you when I (unclear).
Speaker 2: No, so I was just saying I have some conjectures on how we might engage our community in a different way.  There are a lot of things now doing it and I think what you're doing here is a part of it and I think there's a lot of components that have to come together.  I think it's a little bit of a culture change to see ourselves as scientists and engineers and mathematicians.

Speaker 1: We always ask this question in the same vein almost.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Boy, it's the same for America for me and that is that individuals have the opportunity to contribute.  In having that opportunity they can make a decent living for the people that depend on them.  And so yeah, my dream for black America is an American dream, it's the same, they're inseparable.  That I think after all we're Americans but we are a subgroup and I think that what we need in our communities, in all communities is the opportunity to be better tomorrow than we are today.  And I firmly believe that education is a key to that opportunity for improvement as an individual and as a community.  And so educational opportunities is what I will always fight for, for my community.

Speaker 1: Okay.  When you look back at everything you've done in this point in life, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Boy, my legacy.  I don't think it's there yet.  I was telling somebody that what--about fifteen years ago when I was just getting started I was at a meeting and I forget what meeting it was.  Maybe it was the National Society of Black Physicists.  But there was a bunch of African Americans--not a bunch.  We're still a small number but it was--we were there and we were talking and one of the things that we all said that one of the measures of our career should be that we reproduce, that we educate another minority Ph.D.  So I haven't done that yet.  I've produced one person of color that has a Masters degree and I right now have a person of color working on his Ph.D. with me so he will be my first African American Ph.D. recipient.  So I'm getting there.  I don't think my legacy is set yet but--and I don't want to say this in the sense that I am not enjoying the, all the other students who have worked in my group and received their Ph.D. under my supervision.  I hope I've touched their lives in very positive ways.  But as an African American this is one of the things that we set as a personal goal for ourselves to do and I'm looking for an opportunity to do more of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you look back at your life again, is there any major thing that you would do over again if you could or change?
Speaker 2: I'd do something differently than what I've done?  Of course knowing what I know now right?  Boy, that's a tough question.  It's not a question I can answer on the fly I don't think.  The first order I would say no.  I would certainly marry the same woman and I have no choice in my children.  I love them for who they are.  And I had no choice in my parents.  I did choose a, an advisor for my Ph.D. but I think it was the right choice.  I wouldn't choose somebody else.  So I guess there are very few if I look at the big rocks in my life there are very few big things that I would change.  I'm happy with the choices I made.
Story_ID: 20897
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell us about your family.  We--you know your children and your wife.  When did you meet your wife?
Speaker 2: I met my wife in boy--well we've been married for twenty--going on twenty six years I guess this coming July so boy, when was that?  We got married in 1985, that's what I remember and so we dated a few years before getting married so I met her in the mid-80s [1980s] here in Durham.  She was a student at North Carolina Central University.  I was a student here at Duke.  And when I was at--a student, I roomed with a law student at NCCU and so I typically socialized with people from North Carolina Central University and so that's how I met my wife.  And we were married for about three years and we had our first child, Eric.  Eric is a loveable kid.  I know he's going to see this.  He has trouble with staying focused but he knows that we love him and support him.  He is in college at Morehouse [Morehouse College] in Atlanta and is a computer science major.  Our daughter, Virginia, she's in college also.  She's three years younger than Eric.  She's in college as well at Spelman [Spelman College] so they both decided to go to the brother-sister school in Atlanta, both historically black colleges.  And we didn't--they chose them.  We didn't choose the colleges for them, it was their choice but we were happy with their choice.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you--what did your parents make of your career?
Speaker 2: So my mother and all the people in her family have a high regard for teaching.  My mother aspired to be a teacher. In fact, after starting her family she did teach.  She--substitute teacher but with--cause raising six kids you can't teach full time so she taught part time and so she loved teaching.  And she's just tickled pink when any of her kids went into the profession of teaching.  So I had a--I have a sister who after finishing college, she taught for a while.  She actually came back and stayed with my mother and taught at our former high school, Parkview High School.  She also has a major in physics.  And my brother, I think he never taught.  He taught--no, he really never taught.  He taught a little part time but his profession was full time research, also a physicist as well.  So my mother is very happy I think with the profession I chose because it's, to her it's teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think she likes the research but I think she loves the teaching part of it.
Story_ID: 20898
Speaker 1: All right.  Well the last question is a little bit different than legacy but similar.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered by somebody who had a desire to serve other people in science and to promote science and promote other people.  As far as my own science, I hope--I, I'm a firm believer that each generation plows its own field so to speak and so I hope that in terms of neutron physics, some of the things I do will be lasting and so I hope that will be a part of my legacy and I hope some of the stuff I do with plant research will be lasting as well.  But I think in the end it's--those are the things I think will be challenged and the thing I think will stay unchallenged, I hope is my contributions in service to communities of scientists.
