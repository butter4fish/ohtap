Speaker 1: This morning, we're going to be interviewing Professor [HistoryMaker] Jay Harris of the Annenberg School of Communications [Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism], here on the USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] campus.  My name is [HistoryMaker] Paul Brock.  The videographer is Carolyn Scott.  Let me begin by asking you for your full name and to please spell it for us.
Speaker 2: Jay T. Harris.  It's, J-A-Y; middle initial T; Harris, H-A-R-R-I-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Middle--no middle name, just the middle initial?
Speaker 2: Just the middle initial.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you want to sit in on this first reel?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  That's okay.  That's just fine.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  I'm going to ask you:  where are we this morning?
Speaker 2: Well, we're in my office on the campus of the University of South California at the Annenberg School for Communication.
Speaker 1: All right.  And the hard one, of course, is:  what is today's date?
Speaker 2: It is the 7th of October, 2005.
Story_ID: 428440
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you five simple questions.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They tell us that are meant to relax you, but more importantly it will relax me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So.  And they all require just very simple answers.
Speaker 2: That's no problem.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Fried chicken.
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of year or season?
Speaker 2: Late spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Favorite vacation spot?
Speaker 2: St. Barts [Saint-Barthelemy Island].
Speaker 1: And finally, your favorite phrase or your favorite saying?
Speaker 2: Nothing that I could say on tape.
Speaker 1: All right.  That's good enough for me (laughter).  I won't go any further than that.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 428441
Speaker 1: Let's begin by asking you your place of birth and your date of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born in Washington, D.C., in Freedmen's Hospital [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.] on the third of December in 1948.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what we want to do is explore how far back you can go on your maternal--your mother's side of the family, and then we will do the same with your father [Richard Harris].  First of all, your mother's full name.
Speaker 2: Her full name was Margaret Estelle Burr Harris.
Speaker 1: That's spelled, E-S-T (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) E-L-L-E.
Speaker 1: --E-L-L-E?--
Speaker 2: B-U-R-R.
Speaker 1: Harris.  Okay.  And her place of birth and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the date of birth if you have it?
Speaker 2: I don't recall it. I have a hard time with mine (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: She passed away in 1996.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  All right.  How much knowledge do you have of your mother's mother, her grandparents or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother's side of the family is fairly complete and lengthy knowledge compared to some black families. I could trace it back with some detail to the 1860s--
Speaker 1: Oh, wonderful.
Speaker 2: --and the family is the typical American melange of--which includes former slaves who came North from Virginia to Massachusetts, includes members of the Oneida tribe, who lived in Massachusetts, upstate New York includes a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Could you spell Oneida?
Speaker 2: Oneida?  O-N-E-I-D-A.  Her grandmother [Margaret Walker] was a white woman who emigrated from Manchester, England.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Came here for a better life.
Speaker 1: Do you--you don't happen to get a sense of the year or-
Speaker 2: Her grandmother came to the United States in the late 19th century, probably, 1890s. No, actually earlier than that, probably 1880s.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was her name?
Speaker 2: I don't know. Her mother's name was Sarah Q. Walker.  No one ever knew what the Q stood for, and she wouldn't tell anybody.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: Her grandfather--her father's name was John H. Burr.  The gym-- he was at the--he was the dean of physical education and on the faculty at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] from 1923 until his death in 1959.  The gym at Howard University is named after him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the grandmother who came to this country in 1880 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --was the mother of John?
Speaker 2: No.  She was the mother of Sarah.
Speaker 1: Of Sarah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The mother was white, the father was black.  It was a large family and it was a fair-skinned family.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they were--the family was in Boston [Massachusetts], and all of them or many of them could pass.  Some choice to and they disappeared into another world.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My grandmother chose not to, was an early, active supporter of the Urban League in Boston and worked at Camp Atwater [North Brookfield, Massachusetts], which the Urban League ran in Massachusetts for black families.  My grandfather was the director for many years at Camp Atwater.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that was your grandmother Sarah?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 428442
Speaker 1: They lived in Massachusetts before coming--moving down to Washington [D.C.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They moved to--my [maternal] grandfather got an appointment at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] in 1923 as an assistant professor in physical education, and they moved to Washington and lived for many decades on Fairmont Street just across Georgia Avenue from the campus.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.  Any detailed stories that you can remember them telling you or your mother [Margaret Burr Harris] telling you of--
Speaker 2: Well, they actually (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: -- (simultaneous) of their life, of Sarah [Walker Burr] and John [Burr]?
Speaker 2: Well, it's--they're interesting stories.  My grandmother was a bright, determined woman.  She was the first black person, according to newspaper clippings, to work in the [Massachusetts] State House in [Boston] Massachusetts.  I don't know what the name of the capitol building is but she worked there after graduating from Boston Latin [School, Boston, Massachusetts].  My grandfather went to what is now American International College [sic.].  It was called Springfield College [Springfield, Massachusetts].  It's where James Naismith was and where basketball started.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He was a track star, swimming--he sort of played all sports.  And he was in a newly developing field called physical education, but at that time it dealt not only with athletics, but it dealt with character building, which was actually quite an important part of what was happening in black colleges at that time.  And so, he built the--he helped build, with others, the physical education department at Howard.  He coached many of their winning teams.  My grandmother grew up very poor like other black families at the time.  Those who--people in the family were confronted with decisions about how they wanted to live life; did they want to live life, an easier life and pass as white; did they want to stay true to themselves, another vision of it.  And so my grandmother was very actively involved--
Story_ID: 428443
Speaker 1: --Funny story.  Once I was talking--I have always been a great admirer of Dr. [W.E.B.] Du Bois.  And I think I was a sophomore in college [The University of Santa Clara; Santa Clara University, Santa Clara, California], and I had discovered Dr. Du Bois.  I thought he--I thought that no one other than me knew of Dr. Du Bois, so I would lecture my parents [Margaret Burr Harris and Richard Harris] and [maternal] grandparents [Sarah Walker Burr and John Burr] on him to their bemusement.  And I also thought he walked on water.  Still do, although I realize his feet get pretty wet.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But I was holding forth on Dr. DuBois' many fine attributes.  And my grandmother was in the kitchen, and she said in a soft voice sort as I was wrapping up, "He was an arrogant S.O.B., too."  I sort of whipped around and said, "What do you mean?"  And she said---then I realized then that she had met him.  And she was--indeed, she had known him and knew Du Bois enough to form the judgment that he was an arrogant S.O.B. when it came to dealing with other--at least, when it came to dealing with other black families in the Boston [Massachusetts] area.  Actually, there were many ties between my family and Dr. Du Bois.  I have an aunt who gave me his hymnal.  It's from the 1930s, I guess.  It's a book called 'Cabin and Plantation Songs.'  And he had come back to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] to--he was at--I think he was at Atlanta [University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] then. And he had come back at Fisk to deliver the Sunday sermon or some such thing.  He had come by my aunt's house afterwards, and he had left his hymnal and one other book.  And my aunt, many years later in the 1970s gave me the books.  So that one of them--the book called 'Cabin and Plantation Songs' has Dr. Du Bois' notes in there for his unscripted remarks to Fisk on that day.  So I opened my grandmother's hope chest to those stories just to tell you sort of how this goes.  And in it, well, I still have this, there was an old browning, cracking newspaper, and I gently opened it up.  It was the front page--it was the paper, a paper from Boston, and the lead story of the paper that day was that Frederick Douglass had died.  And so one of the things that is very strong in my memory of that part of the family is that, people who I grew up thinking of as historical figures were persons who were public figures and at the time personal friends in their lifetime and in their lives.
Story_ID: 428444
Speaker 1: That side of my family where there's a great deal of detail.  There is--my family in Springfield, Massachusetts, which is where my [maternal] grandfather [John Burr] grew up, went to St. John's [Congregational] Church [Springfield, Massachusetts].  St. John's Church is still a very proud black church in Springfield.  And in chronicles in the history of St. John's Church done in the 1950s, it chronicles the arrival in Springfield and into the congregation of the church a black man, a former slave, who arrived in 1878, I believe, subsequently beginning--became a member of our family.  So on my mother's [Margaret Burr Harris] side of the family, it's an interesting--it's a diverse and fairly full portrait.  I actually have from one of my early--one of the earliest ancestors I know, a young black man who served in the U.S. Navy and during the Civil War at that time.  They had young black children, who worked on Navy ships in certain roles.  And so it's an interesting story on that side.
Speaker 2: Well, we're going to get more details from that.  Let's go back to that young kid who worked on the--during the Civil War on the ship.  Do you have a name for us?
Speaker 1: I have--I don't have it here.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I have it at home.  After we started a family history, just a private--small private book, I haven't finished it, but I have it.  I can provide it to you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I can actually show you the documentation (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We'd like to.
Speaker 1: --for it.  I'd--there is a--they're a group of scholars at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] who have traced a lot of these historical records.  I've just never had the time to go to Howard and look that up.  Another interesting part of that family's life, of my family's life, is that year between the early '20s [1920s], say the late '50s [1950s] when my grandfather was on the faculty of Howard, and there were--a number of the great black scholars of that time were contemporaries of his, friends of his, ranging from, say, Alain Locke to Carter [G.] Woodson.  And so, again, I had the good fortune--and I think, at least personally I would say I draw some strength from the richness of these stories, understanding that on--in my grandfather's house--grandmother's [Sarah Walker Burr] house where my mother and her sister were growing up, these people, who we looked back now and look back on them as giants, were her contemporaries--
Story_ID: 428445
Speaker 1: I have this lovely letter to my [maternal] grandmother [Sarah Walker Burr] shortly after my grandfather [John Burr] died.  And the letter was from the great black theologian Howard Thurman.  And Howard Thurman, before he left first for Massachusetts and then eventually ended up in San Francisco [California], was the chaplain at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] for many years.  And there's this lovely handwritten note from Thurman who had been out of town when my grandfather died.  But, again, you have this--I have in my personal library a shelf of books by Howard Thurman.  And it's very interesting to see something personal from Howard Thurman in your family's story, and in each of our families because all of our families at least have these types of stories.
Speaker 2: We want all of those details.  I'm going to move--because we'll get back to that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That'll be fine.
Speaker 2: --to the Civil War.  But I want to just move down to any relatives that you might know of immediately following that young cabin boy in the Civil War.  Do you have any (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, it would be--again, I would have to show you the records.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But we have in the family a family tree with the documentation from, say, a census in Massachusetts. On the Indian [Native American] side, I talked about the Indians in my family, an important part of my family.  In the 1860s, the State of Massachusetts caused a census to be done of all of the Indians in the State of Massachusetts, and it points to one member of the Oneida tribe whose name was Eli Burr.  And the census, which is a government document, reports that Eli Burr's grandfather--now, we go back two more generations--was a chief in the Oneida tribe.  So there is this--it's interesting.  You see, the metaphor of the tree for a family is very apt to be, because you see the various branches and it comes to a trunk.
Story_ID: 428446
Speaker 1: We were just talking about the Indians [Native Americans] on your side of the [maternal] family back in the 1860s, possibly.  Following that period, let's do this, let's go to Sarah Walker [Burr].  And do we know where she was born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: In Boston.  Okay.  And I'm not going to be lucky enough to get a date.  Right?
Speaker 2: No.  I could get it for you, that's on her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I may have the death certificates.  I have one thing from her brother, which is very interesting.  Her brother was a soldier in World War I [WWI] and sent her a number of postcards.  And the postcards, which was the main way that soldiers communicated with their families, all were censored.  And say, you had--they have these what we would today call redacted (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --postcards.  And I have probably twenty of those that her brother sent to her from France during the war, during World War I.  And so there is this--it's a whole chest of funny things.  You could--you just, you know, people say things.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We--they were, I'm sure, from my grandmother, important primarily because they were notes from her brother who was overseas in a war.  A hundred years or ninety years later they seem all the more important, because it was the first great world war (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --and we know about the history of black troops in the world wars and how that evolved.  So it's an interesting story.
Story_ID: 428447
Speaker 1: One of the things I'm finding to be very, very interesting, mostly from middle-income families: obviously, poor families did not do a lot of early recordkeeping and so forth.  But middle African American families seemed to do much more than I think may have been common, but I'm not positive.
Speaker 2: I think that's true.  As a matter of fact, from her father, I have a whole stack of postcards.  I don't know why she kept them.  But she lived in--they grew up in Boston [Massachusetts] in Roxbury, and I have any number of postcards from her father.  There were saying, "I'm going to"--some of them were saying, "I'm going to call at this hour" or whatever.  This was during the time when there were multiple deliveries during the day and prior to telephones.  And so the written record is much more complete at that time.  One of the other things that I find interesting, and this is particularly true of--well, this is true of my family in the North in the late 19th century is that, Jim Crow, the re-segregation of America, for a period between the end of the war or let's say, the conclusion of World War I [WWI], when the troops came back, the world in which my family lived was far less stratified and segregated.  You had working class people in Massachusetts of all sorts trying to get along; marrying one another, trying to build.  And so when you--I came of age in the second half of the 20th century in a fairly stratified society. In a de facto sense; segregated in many ways, including who you dealt with, who you thought about as your friends.  And you go back, a relatively short of time, you know, late 19th century, this, you know, the ex-slave from Virginia shows up in Springfield, Massachusetts, becomes this successful entrepreneur, marries into this family that is part Indian [Native American] and part black; and my [maternal] grandfather [John Burr] marries the daughter [Sarah Walker Burr] of this white woman [Sarah Walker], who was an immigrant from Manchester [England], where economic times were tough.  So you just see a varied difference toward--a different sort of America actually.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The cancer infection, if you will, of Jim Crow, of segregation, you can feel it over time spreading the (unclear) even in the North.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so, the world was much more rigidly segregated in the 1950s than it was in some ways at the turn of the century.  It's a very odd and confusing situation.
Speaker 1: That certainly is very true.  I look at Charlotte Forten [Grimke] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --and how integrated their life was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --back in the 1850s--
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And once (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and later--
Speaker 2: --again, a wonderful, great story.  If you read about her, read what she wrote about herself, read about her father [Robert Bridges Forten] and understand the role--that the life that they lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --was a very different life--oddly, enough, it's a different life from the life that Dr. [W.E.B.] Du Bois wrote about when he did his post-graduate study of blacks in Philadelphia ['The Philadelphia Negro'].  And if you came to Philadelphia, fifty years later, it was different again.  It's a--you see the evolution of a race and different social structures that both surround and define it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And it changes over time.
Story_ID: 428448
Speaker 1: Let's try to follow your [maternal] grandmother Sarah Walker [Burr].  And I started off with John [Burr], but let's go with Sarah Walker first, because we're going off here on a lot of branches.
Speaker 2: There're a lot of--yes.
Speaker 1: And what was, as far as you know, growing up, brothers and sisters and so forth, for Sarah Walker?  You mentioned one who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, there were more than--her mother was married twice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were children from both marriages.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her first marriage was to a white man.  The second marriage was to a black man.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My grandmother was a child of the second marriage.  There were more than six children from that second marriage.  I don't recall the number.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As I said, some of them chose to pass, went into what we would call today the white world.  Interestingly, my grandmother stayed in touch with them, but on a very discreet basis.  And she would call, check in with them, but respected the decision or at least understood and dealt respectfully with the decision that had been made. And, yet, this was her sister, and would check in. And we knew that she was there, the sister was there, but we never knew who or exactly where.  And those were among the many secrets that my grandmother took to her grave.
Speaker 1: What--your grandmother, sir, what was her first husband's name?
Speaker 2: No.  My grandmother was only married once to John Burr.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: I was talking about her mother.
Speaker 1: Her mother.  Okay.  That'll be great-grandmother.  Do we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Her--I believe her first name was Margaret [Walker].
Speaker 1: Margaret.  Okay.
Speaker 2: But I'm not sure of her maiden name, but her--but in her second marriage, her name was Margaret Walker. I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the--were they considered middle income or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think they were--as a matter of fact, I think middle income, as we think of middle income today, really didn't exist in the same way. They were a working-class family. This was at a time in the United States where there was not the safety net that we think of today.  So people really lived on the margins. And you had to make the rent every month.   And sometimes she didn't.  And so it was a much more tenuous existence then.  And you also had--your country was going through enormous change economically.  So the nature of jobs, the nature of urban life changed.  She lived in a tenement in Boston [Massachusetts].  The building is no longer there.  I was in Boston covering something once, some convention, the Urban League or NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and spent some time looking for the address.  It doesn't exist anymore. The building was torn down.  But she grew up in a tenement.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, she was--today we would think of her as very poor. I think that in the late nineteenth century would have been thought of more as a--just a working family trying to make it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Doing the best they could.
Story_ID: 428449
Speaker 1: Your [maternal] grandmother [Sarah Walker Burr] was one of the children, and what--do you have any sense of what it was like for her growing up?
Speaker 2: I think--she grew up in a large family by definition.  And most families were large at that time as compared to today.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I think it's safe to assume that there was never a lot of money to go around.  She went to Boston Latin [School, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To go to Boston Latin then and for many years thereafter was a very, very distinguishing accomplishment.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: And after Boston Latin, as I look back on her life, what I find most interesting is she went to work--she worked for her people.  There were a group of men and women in the late 19th and 20th century who--we use the phrase most frequently, "race men;" but there were a lot of race men who were not with the race women for sure. But this was a life that they chose.  It was a life that they chose consciously, her early work with the Urban League in the early days of the Urban League.  But then the decision to come to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] as a faculty member and to stay there for--my father--grandfather [John Burr] was on the faculty at Howard from 1923 until 1959.  And that--I mean race, certainly at that time, was the central fact of Howard University.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so she and my grandfather, as a team, were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They met there at Howard?
Speaker 2: No.  They met in Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandmother was working at camp--well, she actually worked for a famous--well, in certain circles, a very well-known black minister named [Reverend] Dr. [William] DeBerry, D-E capital B-E-R-R-Y, and was for many years the minister of St. John's [Congregational] Church [Springfield, Massachusetts] and the head of the Urban League in Springfield, Massachusetts, at the time.  The location of the Springfield Armory [Springfield, Massachusetts] was--you know, the major economic locus of Western Massachusetts.  And so she, I mean, coming out of Boston Latin, she makes the choice to work for Dr. DeBerry at a church and, what I guess would be the equivalent of a settlement house, but a place in-and the old pictures are wonderful, because you have former slaves coming in to Springfield; you have new opportunity, and they're training people there.  You had the--I mean, you had the education of a race as an active thing to be a part of.  And that is what she and her husband devoted their life to, I mean, from 1923 through 1959, and they were involved and bringing young black men and women through Howard and preparing them to prevail and prosper in a world which was likely to work against them.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so, that is--I mean, like, it seems to me that that's a marvelous thing to give your life over to.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And you could look--if you do that, you could look back on a life's work, and it's not really an accomplishment.  It's people.  It's just hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people whose lives you've changed to make better.  And that's what they did.
Story_ID: 428450
Speaker 1: Because as you mentioned going to Boston Latin [School, Boston, Massachusetts], and then that her parents really saw things for her that--a great career for her.  After Boston Latin, did she go on to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She went straight to the Urban League.
Speaker 1: Oh.  She went there.
Speaker 2: It seems--you mentioned, [HistoryMaker] Paul [Brock], you mentioned Charlotte Forten [Grimke], and while I would--I'm not making any comparison between my [maternal] grandmother [Sarah Walker Burr] and Charlotte Forten, each had their own accomplishments--but for many, many years, one of the noblest career choices, if you will, would be to commit yourself to contributing to the uplift of the race.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That was an active thing to do.  That's a big career decision.  I mean, I think it's the--it would be the same thing--I look at people, for example, who came of age in the, let's say, who came to adulthood in the late '50s [1950s] or early '60s [1960s], decided to go South, decided to stay there, forego--they foregoed--they chose to forego all sorts of opportunity that was available to them.  How many people we know, who in our lifetimes, who graduated from Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] or Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] by then, who made the decision to go south and teach children (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: To go south and do voter registration.  And you and I can remember many conversations about people each of us knew wondering whether they--why did they forego such opportunity for money and power.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, yet, we know that in some ways they were the ones who made the most important choice, 'cause they went south to register voters. They went south teach people to be citizens and to succeed.  And I'd like to think that--as a matter of fact, I think the history is clear that almost over the whole time that black Americans have--that black people have been in America, they have been people who committed themselves to that as a line of work.  And it is that as a line of work, if you will, that my grandmother decided on coming out of Boston Latin.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  When did she meet your grandfather [John Burr]?
Speaker 2: I believe in 1921.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were married relatively shortly thereafter, about two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Married just before he went to Howard.
Speaker 1: Went to down to Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 428451
Speaker 1: She [Harris' maternal grandmother, Sarah Walker Burr] obviously followed him [Harris' maternal grandfather, John Burr], and she taught at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: She did not.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: She was a faculty wife.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was--it was interesting how yesterday I was at the 125th anniversary celebration for the University of Southern California [Los Angeles, California], and the president of the university, President [Steven B.] Sample, was talking about being recruited here.  And every time he spoke of being recruited, he made a point of saying that his wife [Kathryn Brunkow Sample] and he were recruited.  At a certain level in education, the husband and wife are a team; they are committed to it.  So she was a faculty wife, and that is--that was--I mean, it was a distinction to be a faculty wife at Howard.  But if you did it right, it was also a role to play.  I mean, my family is--my family history is full of stories over decades of Howard students having dinner on Sunday at the house at 760 Fairmont Street.  I mean, this was a part of what they did.  The other thing that my grandmother did, which so many other people's grandmothers did for our generation, she held the family together during the [Great] Depression.  I think that particularly those of us, who have come of age in the sort of relative prosperity of the second half of the 20th century, don't have a real grasp on how hard it was to hold things together during the Depression.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: And the stories that I hear--you know, when I was growing, when you got a hole in your shoe, that was a sign it was time to get out the cardboard.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: There was no discussion about new shoes.
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: This is the first hole.  Let's get the cardboard out.  You know, all of that, I think, came from an ethic of being frugal, being prudent, "We're going to get through this" that I think--actually I think that my grandmother was responsible for.  I think that the fact that there was a depression did not mean that ten men from the Howard football were not going to come by on Sunday for dinner.  And so that meant we're going to get this macaroni and we're gonna stretch it.
Speaker 1: Right.  Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Say that's her role was, she was the anchor of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When they first came to Howard now, things were booming for about five or six years, and then the Great Depression hit.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: It hit Washington, D.C., and other parts of the country.  But they were part of the community, the Howard University--
Speaker 2: Through the whole of it.
Speaker 1: --right.  And so we want to set that stage, because now they're going to begin having children, one of whom was your mom [Margaret Burr Harris].
Story_ID: 428452
Speaker 1: Let's start by your mother's [Margaret Burr Harris] family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And start with your mother's siblings.
Speaker 2: She had only one sibling.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A younger sister.  Their lives were really in some way was quite similar.  They were both members, in their young days, of a group.  I think it was called the Howard Cubs [ph.] or something, some such thing.
Speaker 1: Howard Cubs?
Speaker 2: Something like that.  There was an organization of faculty children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, they grew up--her sister, whose name was Jonelle, J-O-N-E-L-L-E--they grew up in a very rich environment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm always reminded, I'm reminded from time to time of a [HistoryMaker] Nikki Giovanni poem ['Nikki-Rosa'], early poem by Nikki Giovanni, I think in the late '60s [1960s] or early '70s [1970s].  And she would say that--I don't know about herself, particularly or about young black people generally--that white people felt sad for her about the nature of her childhood that said Nikki said in the poem then "All the time I was quite happy."  And for whatever I might think looking back on a period of segregated schools or Jim Crow, much more, you know, riding in the back of streetcars when you go downtown, all of that was true.  But they also lived in a very good life.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And if they were scarred, you had to look hard to find the scars, because of the context of their life, they lived a good life.  They were the children of a distinguished member of the Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] faculty.  Both went to [Paul Laurence] Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].  Dunbar High School, for those who don't know it, it was probably better if you graduated from Dunbar High School, say in the 1930s, 1940s, you probably got a better education than you would get in most junior colleges and universities in the United States today.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: I mean this was a fine school.  And it's just an excellent school.
Speaker 1: Turned out the Ed Brookes [HistoryMaker Edward Brooke].
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And the Benjamin Davises [Benjamin Oliver Davis, Sr.].
Speaker 2: I mean, it was--the alumni from Dunbar is quite amazing and as was the case with a few other cities.  This was an ever--a group that continued to grow.  And based on merit, they were--creating generations of leaders who were very well trained.  They were ready either to bang on the door if that was what was required or they knew what to do once they were inside the door. And in a way that might not make as much sense to some people today, they were taught how to carry themselves.
Speaker 1: They were.  Teachers invested in their students.
Speaker 2: Yes. And so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) what they could not reach--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 428453
Speaker 1: Both my aunt [Jonelle Burr Washington] and my mother [Margaret Burr Harris], they went to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Your aunt, you know, what was her middle name?
Speaker 1: Oh, I'd have--I don't remember.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Not a problem.
Speaker 1: I'd have to find out for you.  But my aunt was, I think, two or three years younger than my mother.  They both went to Howard.  They were both Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority].  They lived--each of them lived all of their life in metropolitan Washington [D.C.].  And I say metropolitan Washington only because in their later years after they retired, both of them moved to Silver Spring [Maryland].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So they got about two miles outside of Washington.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: These are people who were born in Washington and lived there all of their life.  My Aunt Jonelle was a math teacher.  She taught math at [Henry] MacFarland Junior High School [MacFarland Middle School, Washington, D.C.].  And during most of my junior high and high school years, I went to Roosevelt High School [Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], which was right there with MacFarland.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what I didn't--well, I didn't walk to school.  I rode with my Aunt Jonelle.  And when my grades were bad, she'd pick me up.  When it was time to go home, I went with her and I stayed there at her dining room table and did my studies until my parents got home, and it was time for me to go there (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But she was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was--was she--did she marry and what was her--
Speaker 1: She married.  She had a marriage which was not a happy one.  Her husband died.  She was single well over--for many, many years.  Late in life, she remarried. But she was a math teacher.  That's what she did.
Speaker 2: And I was trying to get to the name she was known by at MacFarland.  That's where I was really going with that.
Speaker 1: Jonelle Washington.
Speaker 2: Washington.
Speaker 1: That's--that.  I thought you were looking at her (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  All of my kids went to MacFarland.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  This was--I think we went for a middle name.  Her--Jonelle Washington was her married name.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, Mrs. Washington, the math teacher.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And she, you know, all of her life (unclear), and again, a different way of looking at things today, in that period to be a teacher in MacFarland or Roosevelt or [Frances L.] Cardozo [Senior High School; Francis L. Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.] or [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] or [Joel Elias] Spingarn [High School, Washington, D.C.]; you could go through the names.  It was a very important job to have.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: I mean, at this time and in that community, these were very respected figures.  And so, and the question that one might ask today: well, why didn't she go on to do something important?  It's absolutely a question you would not have asked then.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: She belonged with being a preacher, a doctor, and a few other gigs, including the post office (laughter).  I mean, they were among the most established (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 1: --and respected of the jobs in the community.
Story_ID: 428454
Speaker 1: Your mother [Margaret Burr Harris], what did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother was a social worker.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her--my--a slight detour.  My father [Richard Harris], shortly after they were married, came down with multiple sclerosis.  My--this really caused my mother to change her career path.  She was a social worker and did that for all of her career, because the requirements--as my father became more and more ill, the burden on her increased, and she really did not have the time to give over to career development; I think one of the very frustrating periods for her, and this is--this is an assumption of mine.  There are some facts on which it's based, is that the early '60s [1960s] through the early '70s [1970s] were their own way a very frustrating period for her because members of her class, members of her generation, were moving into positions of influence in government and in business as doors opened, and--
Speaker 1: But this would have been after integration.  Right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  This is in the period that there was quite a fascinating period, as you know, that the period of the very early '60s [1960s].  It changed over time.  But in the very early '60s [1960s], the late '50s [1950s], particularly the very early '60s [1960s] in Washington [D.C.], people who were well known in Washington in certain circles, but within black Washington, started to move in to the larger political and government community of Washington in increasingly prominent roles.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We lost some of our best teachers during that period.
Speaker 2: They tend--yes.  And so you had, all of a sudden, you had a name like Pat Harris [Patricia Roberts Harris].  Pat Harris was a classmate of my mother's [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  I believe they were both Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority].  I could be wrong about that.  But Pat Harris emerged as a leader in government.  And so, these were her contemporaries.  And while I'm sure she had no envy of their success, her, our situation as a family did not allow her to do that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: She worked her nine to five as a social worker.
Speaker 1: She worked for the city?
Speaker 2: Well, she worked for--yes.  She worked for the city.  Most of the time, she worked--or much of the time, at least, she worked at a, I guess, what would be called a reform school at the time called Cedar Knoll [Youth Detention Center].  It was in Laurel, Maryland.  It was a place where teens who were in various degrees of being incorrigible were sent.  I don't know that that practice exists anymore.  I think, they're too many teens in prison for life now, but that's a different subject.  But she worked there as a social worker.  And she did the work that social workers do with families and social adjustment.  She then went on to work (simultaneous)--
Story_ID: 428455
Speaker 1: Let's go back a little ways, and she's growing up there at 760 Fairmont [Street, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: What elementary school did she go to?  Junior high?
Speaker 2: She went--well, I'm pretty sure that she went to Monroe [Bruce School; Bruce-Monroe Elementary School at Park View, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Monroe was three blocks away.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I assume she went to Monroe, 'cause I went to Monroe (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: And I assume she went to [Benjamin] Banneker [Junior High School; Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, Washington, D.C.], which was through the alley and across the street. And then she went on to [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So the--and Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]--Howard for those who know the Howard area, right there near the campus was--you had the campus; you had Freedmen's Hospital [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.]; you had Banneker; you had Monroe; you had Griffith Stadium [Washington, D.C.], where the old [Washington] Senators played. And you had the Wonder Bread Factory, which made the neighborhood smell like fresh--
Speaker 1: Great.
Speaker 2: --baked bread all the time, which was just wonderful.  So, and you had the [McMillan] Reservoir.  I mean it was a wonderful place to grow up.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: So she grew up in that milieu, and it was a very interesting thing, because in geographic terms, it doesn't cover that much territory.  But in terms of the breadth of quality of life, it was just an infinitely rich place.
Speaker 1: It really was.  I was looking back at my notes to make sure that--oh, and we did not have a date of birth for your mom.
Speaker 2: Oh, I will get that for you.
Speaker 1: Right.  So that--that's fine.  I was trying to get a sense of it when we were talking about it.  Anyway, the--where I wanted to go with this is just to build up the color of the neighborhood (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --and so forth.  And your mother probably lived at home as she went to Howard as I did.
Speaker 2: She did.
Speaker 1: And so forth.
Speaker 2: The neighborhood was not a neighborhood that changed much.  There were--I mean, on Fairmont Street there were other faculty families that lived there; other teachers who were not at Howard, but teachers in the public schools.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But this was--and there were, in the larger community around that area, I think we're probably talking about an area that's maybe twenty square blocks or something like that, you had, as was the case in Harlem [New York, New York], you had some of the greatest minds in America.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Not greatest black minds; some of the greatest minds in America (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Greatest minds, absolutely.
Speaker 2: --living in this little area.  And not all of them were in positions that would suggest that they were as bright as they were.  There were many graduates of Howard law [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], for example, who worked in the post office.  And they did their law on the side.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They trained under Charlie Houston [Charles Hamilton Houston], among the best lawyers in the country; but the job they got was in the post office.  So see you had the dental offices.  Private dental offices were in houses in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You knew the people who ran the store at the corner.  If you walked down the hill on Fairmont, you'd come to the intersection of Fairmont and Sherman Avenue.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they're on the--the southeast corner of Sherman Avenue, it was Mr. John's Market, little neighborhood store that had been there for many years.  Today, all of the shelves in stores are where you can grab stuff.  But in Mr. John's market, had this wonderful contraption; it was this long thing that you would do this (moving hands), and it would grab stuff.  And so the shelves would go up to the ceiling.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It was a little small place, and you could say, "I'd like a can of that," and he'd take his thing and bring it down.  It was a wonderful thing to do.
Story_ID: 428456
Speaker 1: And my [maternal] grandfather [John Burr], I--on summer evenings-I'll tell you two stories about Fairmont Street [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And one of my favorite memories, on really hot nights, we'd spend a lot of time on the porch.  We had a front porch that looked out and--Fairmont Street is a big hill, and it's part of the larger hilltop that Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] is on. And so, you would really look down on the street from the front porch.  And on the back porch, you could look down and you could see the capitol; you could see the Washington Monument until they built [Benjamin] Banneker [Academic High School, Washington, D.C.] up and put a new story there.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You could see all of that.  You could see the fireworks from our back porch on the Fourth of July.  But on hot summer nights, my grandfather would walk me down to Mr. John's.  I lived around the corner at that time on Sherman Avenue, all on the same block; I mean, it's sort of how it was in those days.  And he would walk me down to Mr. John's and we'd get a little pint of lime sherbet and a bottle of Canada Dry ginger ale, and he'd---we'd come home and he'd make me a lime float.  And we'd sit on the porch in this little chaise lounge and rocked, and we'd sit there, me and my grandfather, and we'd have a good time.  Another story which I love, 'cause it's a memory.  I don't know if this happens much anymore, but during the summer, the fire department and [DC Department of] Parks and Recreation would come by on hot days and put a showerhead--not a showerhead (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On the-
Speaker 1: --in the bathroom, but on the fire hydrant.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And it would spew this beautiful shower, and all of the kids in the neighborhood would come out in bathing suits if they had them, and underwear if they didn't, and just run around and have the greatest time.  And they would clean the--they were simple pleasures then when they would start (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And Banneker pool [Banneker Recreation Center, Washington, D.C.] was not that far away.
Speaker 1: Banneker pool I went to.  I went to nursery school at Banneker.  I went to--I'd go to the pool at Banneker.  I also went to the pool at Howard because my father--my grandfather ran the [physical education] department.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they were--those were the days when Howard football was really great. But, in any event, I mean, it was a child's paradise. And you could go down to Florida Avenue and U Street and go to the Lincoln [Theatre, Washington, D.C.] or the Booker T. [Theatre, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Right.  Or Howard [Theatre, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Go to the Howard Theatre.  In 1963, I saw the 'Motown Revue' [sic. 'Motortown Revue'] at the Howard Theatre; one of the most amazing moments in my life.  Marvin Gaye, The Miracles, everybody.  Just a wonderful, wonderful--I mean, it was a great place to be.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: I--a wonderful way to grow up.
Story_ID: 428457
Speaker 1: Your mother [Margaret Burr Harris] was living at home [in Washington, D.C.], of course, with her sister [Jonelle Burr Washington], and she graduated from Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and went into social work.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: At some period, she met this man that swept her off her feet.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Richard Harris.  Richard James Harris.  And he was a--he had been a first sergeant in the war in Europe in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: World War II [WWII].
Speaker 2: World War II.  He was by instinct and habit a hustler.  And so--and he came from a very different world than my mother came from.  My mother was a faculty child.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And this was a man who had been in the Army.  He had made his way by his wits, and he swept her off her feet, as you correctly said, and they were married.  And it was actually, to read the stories, the marriage was in some ways--well, the early years were somewhat challenging for my mother, because my father was a person who lived in another part of the culture of black America: musicians, clubs.  And so, there was this whole world that she was introduced to that we would, I guess, think of as fast and exciting.  And in reading her journals from that time, they were fast and exciting, but there were some frightening for her, because she was in uncertain territory. If you're in your apartment on Ontario Road and Duke Ellington is among the people who stop by you, you're a little bit taken aback.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes, you are.
Speaker 2: So that's where their first apartment was, on Ontario Road.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Duke Ellington, then the club caravan (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, he--yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the (unclear) and so forth.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There was--and then my father was a part of that world, his friend.  His--he grew up in a world that was very different from the world that my mother grew up in.  It was hard for her, it was hard for her parents [Sarah Walker Burr and John Burr], it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was getting ready to say--
Speaker 2: --hard for everybody (laughter).
Speaker 1: --your grandparents could not have been very happy.
Speaker 2: No.  They were--I think they were not happy, necessarily.  But I also think that it is in the nature of families in all times, if you love one another you work with what you got. And so, he was welcomed into the family with open arms and was very much a part of the family.  And my mother, for a few years before my father came down with multiple sclerosis was exposed to a very different part of life.
Speaker 1: And he had been in World War II, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --what was--what did he pursue after coming out and--
Speaker 2: Well, what he was doing when he down with--multiple--he went back to school on the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He went to Howard and was pursuing studies part time.  And he had a job over in Virginia with the [U.S.] Navy running--he was the operator of these new machines called card sorters, IBM [International Business Machines] card sorters, and--which was a wonderful job to have.  He was sort of--there were people who worked with him who--as the government's use of card sorters turned into high-speed card sorters into computers, they came up in that path.  He came off of that path in the early '50s [1950s] when he lost first the dexterity and the sense of touch of his fingers and went downhill rather rapidly.
Story_ID: 428458
Speaker 1: Your siblings, were you the first?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  I'm the only child.
Speaker 1: Only child.  Oh.  Okay.
Speaker 2: But if we could, we haven't done my father yet.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Let's go (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father is a very different story.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Richard James Harris.  Let's go back, grandfather, great-grandfather; how far back can we go?
Speaker 2: Can't do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) First of all, let's establish when he was born and where he was born.
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighteen [1918].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was born in Freedmen's Hospital [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.] and there is absolutely no record of it. My father was the son of a woman who was a member of a very prominent black family.  She was in her teens or early twenties at the time, was not married to my father's father.  And so, as was the case with other out-of-wedlock children, there was no record of the birth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was sent off after--we know that he was born in Freedmen's Hospital.  We know it was done privately, that there was no record of it.  He was then--he went to Norfolk, Virginia, where he was raised by a very, very good Christian family, John [Harris] and Julia Harris. And this was not an unusual thing to have happen a child born out-of-wedlock to a prominent family were to take care of the child, but they don't want to, at the time, burden the mother with the shame of having a child out-of-wedlock, as it would have been viewed at the time.  So John and Julia Harris were pillars of their church in Norfolk, Virginia, the Princess Anne Road area.  John Harris was a--he worked as a head waiter on a steamship that ran on the Chesapeake [River] from Norfolk to Baltimore [Maryland]; made that run back and forth.  And he was a--he served, according to his obituary, which I--which my son dug out of the [Norfolk] Journal and Guide [New Journal and Guide]--went to the Norfolk library and went back into the old Journal and Guide microfiche and found it.  He, according to the obituary, he served presidents and titans of industry.  So his, again, this is a very world from the world we know today.  John Harris was a head waiter on a steamship, a very solid job, and he was a pillar of his church, and they raised my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so Harris is the name of the family in Norfolk, Virginia that raised him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Julia Harris did not work.  She was very active in their church.  It was a very religious family.  My mother [Margaret Burr Harris] would tell a funny story, actually the story later in life.  The Harris family, John and Julia Harris, before every meal everybody had to say a Bible verse.
Speaker 1: Had to sing a Bible--?
Speaker 2: Had to say a Bible verse.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Say.
Speaker 2: Everybody would say a Bible verse.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And my mother was not deeply steeped in a study of the Bible.  And so when they would go to visit the Harrises, she would, and just before a meal, she would be upstairs with her Bible trying to remember a verse.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And I had the same experience years later (laughter) 'cause you had had to have a Bible verse. And, although I went to Second Baptist Church to begin with in [Washington] D.C., and then later to Peoples and Plymouth [Congregational Church of Christ, Washington, D.C.], Congregational Churches, I wasn't strong on Bible verses at the time either.
Speaker 1: Peoples Congregational [United] Church [of Christ, Washington, D.C.] on 13th [Street]?
Speaker 2: Peoples on 13th and Plymouth was at the intersection of North Capitol [Street] and Missouri Avenue.
