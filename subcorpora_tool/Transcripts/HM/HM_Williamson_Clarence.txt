Story_ID: 91274
Speaker 1: What are your first memories of your parents when you were growing up?  What stands out in your memory?
Speaker 2: Well, it's pretty vivid in my memory.  My dad [Robert Williamson] was a grocery store owner.  And therefore, my mother [Annie Williamson] worked in there, and my father worked there.  And I did also.  I think as a youth, when I became probably six or seven years old, I was in charge of the candy counter, you know.  And I always remember that.  I'd make the orders and do things of that sort.  And then as I got older, I become a chicken picker, and I don't eat chicken today because of that (laughter) 'cause I spent many a Saturday killing chickens and picking 'em.  So that, that gives me very good memories, yes.
Speaker 1: Individually, tell me what kind of persons would you say your parents were?
Speaker 2: They were hard-working persons.  Honest, hard-working, religious.  Mother, my mother went in, out of several religions, and my dad stayed a Baptist all his life.  And they sent the kids to Catholic school.
Speaker 1: Is there any experience about your mother that particularly stands out for you?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother was extremely talented for, for not only working but with not much educational background, but she could cook, sew, knit, paint, make objects, and whenever it was a need in the family for something, she could manage to raise it without us knowing how she did it.  She was very excellent in that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did she work outside the home?
Speaker 2: Never worked out the home, worked in the store with the family and when they all went to War, she ran the store by herself with me.  All my brothers were in the service.  And me and her purchased our first home in 1942 through my mother working in the store.  That was her goal.
Speaker 1: And how old were you when the family acquired the store?
Speaker 2: I was born in the store.  My daddy opened it up in 1924.
Speaker 1: Where was it located?
Speaker 2: 3546 South Indiana Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite stories of working in the store?
Speaker 2: Well, I got a chance to meet Jack Johnson, Joe Louis, Rochester.  All those people came in and out of the store because it was very few stores of black in the community at that time.  It was six black newspapers on 35th Street.  The Bud Billikin [Parade] started at 35th and Michigan, right there next door.  The "Defender" ["Chicago Defender"] was down the street, and I had a chance to the Sengstacke, the Abbott family and Truman Gibson and all of them at Supreme Liberty Life [Insurance].  And we delivered groceries to people, like, you know, the pastors of the church and the people who were doctors of the community.  And so, therefore, I had some type of communication.
Speaker 1: So you've always been solidly anchored in the community, from birth?
Speaker 2: Yes, I felt that way, I felt that way, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was your father like?
Speaker 2: Father was a great businessman.  He would use his kids to, to buffer the zone.  If anything to customer didn't like, he'd always come between and say, "Ah, they didn't know what they're doing.  I'll take care of it."  And it was a, it was just like a, like a frick and frack act, you know (laughter).  But he was good.  He, he--he had to be great because for him to survive at that time when everything was tough against him.  He had no one to go to, so he had to make it on his own.  I thought, in those days, I thought the building inspector was part of my family (laughter).
Speaker 1: What did he do before he opened the store?
Speaker 2: I think when he came to Chicago, he probably worked as a, as a busboy or something at one of the hotels downtown.  And the first money he made, he went into the business, and he never, never looked back.
Speaker 1: Do you know what year they came to Chicago?
Speaker 2: Nineteen twenty-three [1923].
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  I--have you say, my parents came to Chicago in--
Speaker 2: Around that time, huh?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah, whenever she asks the question, it's like--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  --when did your parents come, just say, "My parents came--
Speaker 2: My parents came, okay, that time, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, and when did your father come to Chicago?
Speaker 2: My parents came to Chicago in 1923.
Story_ID: 91275
Speaker 1: Your grandparents, what do you remember of them?
Speaker 2: My father's father, I can't remember anything about him.  And even, I went back to Memphis [Tennessee] a couple of years ago to, to backtrack.  I think we couldn't even find a picture of him.  All I remember, my daddy [Robert Williamson] told me that he was in the construction business a little bit, and he rode a big white horse, and they had Caucasians eat with 'em in the families every now and then at certain businesses.  But after that, I believe my granddaddy took my dad to Memphis when he was a young boy, with him before he came to Chicago.
Speaker 1: And your mother's parents?
Speaker 2: My mother's, my mother's parents was the name Sarah Metts, when I was a kid.  She had a home in Muskegon, Michigan.  And I found out in later years that it was the home of a black baseball Negro League player.  She had a rooming house there.  And one of my--my mother left one of my brothers to stay with her.  So he grew up in Muskegon, Michigan and finished high school.  And as a adult, when he came to Chicago, my parents sent him to Lincoln University in Missouri.
Speaker 1: So you were born into a family of businessmen.
Speaker 2: Well, not exactly.  Only that one person, just my dad, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, it sounds like your grandfather--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: My grandfather was business, yes, you're--I would say that, yes.
Story_ID: 91276
Speaker 1: Can you tell me what it was like growing up in the Williamson household?
Speaker 2: Well, as a teenager, it was, we worked, had to go to school, and we, and we worked with the neighborhood, played ball, kids, parties, married and different other things.  But it was--the only thing that I didn't like as a teenager, by me living in a storefront until I was a teenager, I couldn't have company and couldn't have visitors, you know.  And I think I really, always remember that part about it, yes.
Speaker 1: And what kind of child were you?
Speaker 2: I was pretty much of a quiet person as a child.  I was pretty quiet.  I more or less got out in high school.  I was more or less outward in high school, yes.
Speaker 1: Would you say you were a bookworm, athletic?
Speaker 2: No, I went, I played football.  I got my studies--I was a average kid.  I wasn't any, any great (unclear) (laughter).  There wasn't no--
Speaker 1: When--what is your first big dream or aspiration, and did you achieve it over your adult life?
Speaker 2: Well, my dream and aspiration was to--I would say I was involved in politics, and I probably wanted to be in some elective office at the time.  And I worked towards it, and I think I went back to school after I was an adult, 25 years later, yeah.  So I think I accomplished some of the things that I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: And how old were you when that first, your first big dream started to surface?
Speaker 2: I would say that I was probably about forty.
Speaker 1: You say you vacation in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What kind of things do you like most about Chicago?
Speaker 2: Jazz.  I usually go to all the jazz clubs in Chicago I could find.  And I stay pretty active.  I'm a board member of Jazz Unites on the South Shore here.  I just got through being almost like the general manager of the fest we had, the South Shore, over the weekend.  We got rained out a couple of days.  So.
Speaker 1: And I guess with having the store in the community, you met a lot of entertainers?
Speaker 2: Met a lot of the jazz people, yes, and people--and grew up with some too.
Speaker 1: What kind of memories do you have?
Speaker 2: Well, I could remember the great Gene Ammons and I could remember Chick Webb, and I remember my sister taking me to the Regal Theater when I was six and seven years old and saw Ella Fitzgerald sing "A-Tisket-A-Tasket" when she was 18 years old.  And I could remember those pretty good.  I can remember the drummers.  I can remember seeing Billy Eckstein at Savoy [Ballroom] in the bebop days with all the great people in his band.  And I can remember--I had a opportunity to go to those places.
Speaker 1: And what was the community like where you grew up?
Speaker 2: The community where I grew up, there was--probably anything a black person wanted, business was in the community.  The florist, the haberdashery, the grocery store, the hardware store, churches and the organization and it was, I--it was a great community, you know.  We were just--
Speaker 1: What did they call the community you--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Bronzeville, same thing.  It was in that area, you know.  It's called that now, but I can't remember.  It was Douglas or something else, I think in those days, they called it, around that time, yes.
Speaker 1: And where did you live in the community?
Speaker 2: I lived in the store, next to store.  We had vacant store, next to the grocery store, so the store and the business was part of the life.
Story_ID: 91277
Speaker 1: School, tell me your elementary, middle and high schools?
Speaker 2: I went to St. Elizabeth Grammar School at 4100 South Wabash.  When I left the grammar school, I went to St. Elizabeth High School at 4100 S. Michigan, and after that I went to Roosevelt University in '48 [1948], and I had a chance to meet Gus Savage [HM] and Harold Washington and all the guys in the community.  They were leadership.  I think Louis Roundtree was head of the Torch newspapers and things.  And I flunked out.  I didn't know what college was about.  I came from a family that didn't have any graduates there.  And I saw the things that I missed when I got there.  And I tried to go to [Chicago] Teachers College [now Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois], and I didn't make it there.  So I stayed out for some years until I went back, yeah, later, yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me some of your escapades with Washington and Savage and--
Speaker 2: Well, I was a Young Democrat with Harold and Savage and all, but Savage had newspapers in the neighborhood, and I knew him as a kid.  And Harold and I went to convention together, and, you know, down at Danville [Illinois] and (unclear) and Springfield [Illinois] and things of that sort.  And he was a, he was a very dynamic person.  He was a bookworm himself.  He was, always with a book, and all I can say is good things.  And we had a chance to ride home from Springfield several times, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have favorite teachers?  Who were they?
Speaker 2: I had nuns who were favorite teachers, yes.  I had a nun named Sister Mary Renee which was a high school teacher.  I think she liked all the boys and none of the girls.  She was a tomboy herself.  But, but they gave us good training, and they showed us how to make college entrance exams, and they taught us Black history back in the days I went to high school.
Speaker 1: And so when you were in high school, you were a better student than later or in elementary?
Speaker 2: I was average in high school.  I was--I never, I never become great--I never was a good book person, but I could hold my own, and I could get along.
Speaker 1: What did you do, what did you like to do in your recreational time?
Speaker 2: Recreation, ghee, I'm trying to think.  I loved the sports.  I think I went football, I went ice skating.  I had bicycle riding, and I used to like to go to picnics, and went to the show every Sunday, dressed up.  We had, you know, tailor-made clothes in high school and things of that sort.  And basically, museums and other--zoos and other things of that activities, yes.
Speaker 1: And so those are the things you do in Chicago [Illinois] when you're in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I'm adult, I like the scenery at the parks and as well as the observation towers, and I like to see the architecture of the city.  And sometimes I like to drive around just to see what changes have made since I have came (unclear) yes.
Speaker 1: Is there any secret spot that's really great that we don't know about?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your family was very active by way of the business, the kind of business they had.
Speaker 2: They were somewhat active in the business and social world of their, whatever their stature would bring them to, yes.
Speaker 1: And what kind of memories come to mind about the family's community activity when you think of those school years?
Speaker 2: Well, school years--and they couldn't go to too many parent-teachers meeting because they were working.  But they would always buy the ads in the book or support or buy the tickets or the candy which you had to sell or the, or the pledge boards or whatever you, you know, you had.  And then they would have to almost take care of some of the other kids in the neighborhood because by them being customers, they would come in and want participation also.
Speaker 1: Well, by virtue of your charge of the candy counter, did you have a special place among your friends?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, yeah.  And then I had a little devious thing.  Sometime when we used to--I think a friend of mine, it was called the katzenjammer kids in those days.  We would put maybe--sometime we take the sandwich cookie apart, put hot pepper and different things on it (laughter) of that sort.  But we'd get caught though, you know.
Story_ID: 91278
Speaker 1: So is that where you started learning about how to deal in politics?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.  It was actually--the basic principle of mine was, in order for my dad [Robert Williamson] to survive in business in Chicago [Illinois], we had to know what was going on.  So he, one of my brothers went in the 2nd Ward, and I went into the 6th Ward.
Speaker 1: At what point did you start to really get interested in the political scene?
Speaker 2: I was interested in it because I--no, I tell you how, a part is--it sure has come to my mind.  I was working in the store one afternoon, and Alderman Bob Miller came by the store, which I just knew of because he's a funeral director.  And he asked me to come out and help him in his ward organization.  And that was probably 1957.
Speaker 1: And how old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was 30--27 years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how did you find that experience?
Speaker 2: I become the precinct captain of Parkway Gardens when it first opened at 50--at 6300 South King Drive, 1951, you know.
Speaker 1: And so you kicked the participation up by--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I kicked the participation up by--
Speaker 1: --'57 [1957]?
Speaker 2: --'57, yes.
Speaker 1: And then you went off to college and met--
Speaker 2: I didn't go off.
Speaker 1: Well, I mean to Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, at Roosevelt, yes.
Speaker 1: Two years?  Two or three?
Speaker 2: I didn't make Roosevelt.  I think I made Roosevelt one semester.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, but then your friend and cohort, [Gus] Savage--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, it was (unclear) at the time.  You know how they played bid whist in the cafeteria and all flunk out of school, you know.  That happens quite often, yeah.
Speaker 1: And was Harold [Washington] and Savage, were they also in--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They were, they were not in politics.  They were at school because of the GI Bill.  They were older than I.  See, we went out of high school.  They went out after they came back from the service.  So that's how they got in there.  It was a lot of GI, you know, bills in the colleges in those days, yes.
Speaker 1: So when you went to college the first time, had you declared a major?  What was your interests?
Speaker 2: I was--interest was accounting.  And I got there and saw those big books that those department stores was using downtown, which I never saw before and things of that sort.  And the kids in the class was working at those stores.  So they knew all about the basis of it.  I felt like a lost soul in those classes.
Story_ID: 91279
Speaker 1: Now, we're moving into your adult life, after you did a little college and so on and so forth.  At what point did you evolve into marriage, family life and--
Speaker 2: At--in 1951, I decided that I had in my mind that everybody is supposed to get married at 21.  I, I have no idea where I got that conception.  But that's what I did.  So I was in the city, and if I went to the service, I wasn't getting married.  If I didn't go to service, didn't.  I didn't--I had to stay home because three brother of mine went, and they said I had a heart murmur when I took the exam.  So I stayed home.  And then I decided to get married then, after that.  I said, well, I'm not going to service, I'll get married.
Speaker 1: And tell us about meeting and marrying your wife?
Speaker 2: I met her in the neighborhood where we bought the home in the neighborhood.  I was, met her through family and friends, and we began dating.  And we got married.
Speaker 1: Her name again?
Speaker 2: Marion Degraffinreed.
Speaker 1: Would you spell it for me?
Speaker 2: M-A-R-I-O-N, middle initial "E", D-E-G-R-A-F-F-I-N-R-E-E-D, Degraffinreed, yes.
Speaker 1: And what was it about Marion that stood out?
Speaker 2: She cooked pretty well.
Speaker 1: Did your wife work outside the home?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  After the kid was, my son [Clarence Williamson, Jr.] was probably about seven or eight years old, she worked at Carson Pirie Scott as a clerk for about 15 years, yeah.
Speaker 1: When you moved from the family business into working in, out in the world, what were your first jobs?
Speaker 2: Well, when I left the family business and worked out in the world, I, I had the opportunity of Congressman [William L.] Dawson knew that my dad had a store at 36th Street.  And by my brother working in his organization, he had a daughter that had a store at 5518 South Prairie in the Garfield Hotel.  And he came by and asked me would I manage his store for his family and that he would give me a interest in the store.  And about, I guess I was probably about 30 or something.  And I went out and ran his store for about six years at 5512 South Prairie.
Story_ID: 91280
Speaker 1: Okay, and you're twenty-seven when you really start moving more into the political arena.  Tell me what kind of things were happening and what was going on in your political experience?
Speaker 2: Well, it was basically, a lot of civil rights was going on at the time when, when--I think we had the four silent aldermen ["Silent Six"] was in around that period.  I think that was [Claude] Holman and [Robert "Bob"] Miller and all those guys was in.  And the South Side didn't quite like their politics because they seemed like they wasn't speaking up often enough.  And I had to be--I was working with one of 'em at the time, so therefore, I would have the feeling about it.  And I, I felt, to me, it was somewhat advantage to a point that I think I was working for the alderman.  And when I was downtown, they didn't never know who the alderman was.  And I could almost act like the alderman, you know, at the time.  So that was a great experience in those days with Bob Miller, yes.
Speaker 1: And so, was Bob Miller extremely silent or was that just the perception?
Speaker 2: That was a perception because he was a business person, and he had a funeral home.  He was a pilot, you know, and he was a well-known gentleman, with a boat on the lake in the social world and everything else.  But he wasn't a great speaker or anything of that sort, yes.
Speaker 1: How long did you work with him?
Speaker 2: I worked with him till his death.  I came--off hand, I can't remember the exact date, but I know it was probably in the '80s [1980s] when he passed.
Speaker 1: The four silent--so from your experience with the alderman, where did the political trail lead?
Speaker 2: I, the political trail, I think I took my first job away from the store, of the businesses, as a--I think I was a bailiff one year.  Then I become a engineer.  One year I was designing streets and allies.  And then when I left that, I went and sold insurance for New York Life for about six or seven years.  And then I went back into, coordinated with Reverend Turner, I believe, in the Model Cities for a while.  And then, then I decided to go back to school.  And then I went to the probation department.
Speaker 1: And when you went back to school, was that when you got your Master's?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: At Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I went to Chicago State that year.  After I went to the probation, they had a LEAP program which they would pay the tuition and books and so forth, and I said, well, I can't, can't give up this.  This is a chance and I can go and finish some of the things I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: So in between all this time, you had fit-finished in your basic bachelor's courses--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and where did you finish that?
Speaker 2: Well, I finished my bachelor's courses, I think I was going to every junior college in Chicago at one time, you know, from the job and for myself.  Then I sent off for the CLEP examination.  And I was determined to get a bachelor's.  So I was going all kind of ways.  Then I joined Chicago State at the board of governors where I was able to take my experience and present it to the professors and the trusts and pick up maybe 27 or 30 hours at that, one time.  And then I, I had to do so many hours in the school.
Speaker 1: So what did you take your bachelor's in?
Speaker 2: I took my Bachelor's in Art.
Story_ID: 91281
Speaker 1: Okay, and your community life, where was the major focus during these years?
Speaker 2: Park Manor Community in Chatham, and I was a member of the Holy Name [Society] at St. Anselm's Church, involved with Knights of Peter Claver, Knights of Columbus, and probably Jazz Institute and things of that sort, yes.
Speaker 1: And I can see from your information that you've shared with us, that you're very well thought of in the community.  What kinds of community things stand out in your memory?
Speaker 2: We used to give, probably dinners at Thanksgiving time for the seniors.  And we'd serve the food and things of that sort where you get a chance to have your parents or your father over and they'd meet new friends and they would know who their son was and different other people's fathers and sons.
Speaker 1: How did you come to the State Senate?  Where were you in the trail at the time you ran and won?
Speaker 2: I was, I was at the probation department at the time.  And I didn't run.  I was appointed that year.  Eugene Barnes was named by Mayor Jane Byrne to head the CTA.  And it was a vacancy.  And by me being a member of or vice president of Executive Board of the 6th Ward with Eugene Sawyer, we had the majority of the votes of the committeemen's of the area.  So we had to get William Frost, Bill Shannon [William Shannon], John Stroger [HM] and Taylor and Sawyer had to go together to pick me as their candidate to replace Eugene Barnes.
Speaker 1: Did you run--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I ran the following year after the time.  They changed the boundaries of the legislature the following year, against the three into two.  And I was running as a part of Raymond Ewell [Ray Ewell, HM].  And that's when I got my political lessons of my life, is that Raymond say you didn't have to campaign too much because he was already there.  And Monica Faith Stewart [HM] was running against us at the time, and Monica and I--when I was in the legislature, she was living Carol Moseley [Braun, HM] and Ethel [Skyles] Alexander [HM] down in Springfield [Illinois].  So we all were buddies, you know, at the time.  But she ran against me.  And I had a good chance of winning, but something happened over in the 17th Ward.  They ran a guy named Jesse Jackson.  And he wasn't the real Jesse Jackson.  But he was Jesse Jackson.  So he etched out the third party on that particular election.
Story_ID: 91282
Speaker 1: Okay, can you retrace the climate when you were running?
Speaker 2: Oh, the climate, when I was running, it was four of us running from the same district, Charlie Gaines [Charles Gaines], Eugene--not Eugene Barnes, but Raymond Ewell [Ray Ewell, HM], Monica Faith Stewart [HM] and Clarence V. Williamson.  And by Charlie and I both being Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha] and the fraternity, and knew the same people of the Chatham Avalon Council in the community and about the same age, it was--we were getting out of the same trough.  But Monica was new, and she had a pretty good following on South as being a new person and a lady.  And Raymond Ewell was already established as a committeeman, and without a--and my organization had never had a fight 'cause Mr. Sawyer had never had a fight.  So therefore, it was hard.  But I, I didn't lose bad, but I lost the election.  So that was it, and, but that was a great experience, and I enjoyed it all.
Speaker 1: And you said they ran a Jackson?
Speaker 2: Jesse Jackson, yes.  And Jesse Jackson was voted on because they thought he might have been the real Jesse Jackson of Chicago [Illinois], but it was just a, a gentleman that had his name.  They never, they never campaigned for him or anything.  They just threw his name up at election day, yeah.
Story_ID: 91283
Speaker 1: Oh, boy, politics.  Now, what kind of memorable events stand out for you in your political memories?
Speaker 2: Well, it, being able to work at the Democratic Convention in Chicago [Illinois] in the '60s [1960s] was a real memorable event, you know, with all of that going on downtown.  Gee, that was a--you never will forget that in the '60s.  I was a driver for the Alaskan delegate which was only two--I think it was two Caucasian construction workers, an Eskimo and one black (laughter).  And we had the, the hotel downtown, and chauffeuring.  And I can remember that in the back seat, the two--two of the delegates was changing the capital of Alaska while they was talking in the car.  And I said, gee whiz, that's politics.  These guys--and when I read about it the next year, it had been changed.  They did it right in the back seat of the car.
Speaker 1: Anything else about that convention?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't get to the turmoil, but I saw it all downtown at the Hilton [Hotel] as driving, you know, passing through.  But--
Speaker 1: And what kinds of stories, those good, ol' stories you hear behind the scenes?
Speaker 2: It wasn't too much good ol' stories behind the scenes of that.  All I remember is that they were covering up all the stuff in Chicago from the, where we had to drive by with the delegates.  You can see, they was putting up fences and little things of that sort.  That was a cover up.  But I didn't hear any juicy scenes 'cause I was more or less tied with just a small delegation, yes.
Speaker 1: And did you get a sense of what that delegation's opinion was of Chicago or (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They loved Chicago great.  The first place they wanted to go was the race track, you know.  You know, so (laughter), so you could imagine, they come here to have a good time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did they get any sense of Chicago politics?
Speaker 2: I don't think they cared.

Speaker 1: We--for our CD-ROM that really is going to deal with the process of how the legislature works and, for students, would you trace that process for us?
Speaker 2: I could say the process, the way it works is that you're, you're in the legislature and they have all type of committees coming out.  And it's up to you.  You're put on so many of 'em by your stature and how much seniority you have as how far down the line you are.  But when you get on a committee, your best bet is to read and find out everything about what you're supposed to be involved in so that you can take a part in that.  And then if you know all about it, and you're not a person that can radiate your future to get along with the rest of your buddie, it's useless.  So, therefore, you not only have to understand and be smart, but you have to have social--have to have social skills to be able to use that.  And quite often I've seen one freshman down there, I don't want to mention the name, but he passed all kind of bills his first year.  And when, when all these guys came back for him to help 'em on the following year, and he wasn't able to help them, they said he'd never pass another bill again.  And that's just how ruthless it is if you're not in the right, (unclear) aligned.
Speaker 1: Was he not able to help them or he just didn't want to help them?
Speaker 2: He wasn't able to because he created a false illusion of being that and he was impressionable and everything else.  But once that impressionable atmosphere went off, he wasn't able to get back and follow through.
Speaker 1: There is this sense of state legislators that some people, for a time called the legislature was full of political hacks.  What do you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, it depends on what they call political hacks.  See, that should be defined because everybody down there is running for a party or running with something or some ax to grind something in some cases, you know.
Speaker 1: I think the definition might come under, they had the presence and they had the vote in the House, but their strings were being pulled by others.
Speaker 2: Well, I could say that's true, but it's, you know, you could say their strings are pulled by others and, and you gotta speak about what interests.  You know, is it money?  What about the donations, the campaign funds or who's helping them and who's this--sure, that all make influence because it's built-up influence, it's built up of influence.  And I'm sure that if somebody get down there and he goes his way, he can make it, but then, he's wondering about how he's gonna support himself or how he's gonna win the next election too.  So it's almost like a self-perpetuating situation, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how would you define, given your direct experience in the legislature, how would you define a political hack different from the person who's just dealing politics or--
Speaker 2: Well, I've seen--the definition of what I thought a political hack, I've seen one or two persons down there that was down there strictly because somebody sent them there, and they had no illusions on getting there on their own.  I've seen that happen.  But that's far and few at the present--it's not as many going on in the present date, but there were some people there that were just there because somebody put them there, you know.  And maybe that's what they mean by political hack, that could be some of the reason for that, yeah.
Speaker 1: What would you say about legislatures today?  What kinds of legislators do we have, in your view, hacks, professionals?
Speaker 2: Professional.  We have--I was down in the legislature about a couple of years ago, and I guess, by me getting older, the guys look younger, you know, things of that sort.  And, but I found out that, from the last two years, we haven't had any leadership in the legislature.  We have leadership in the Senate, but none in the legislature.  And I thought it was a little void of someone take leadership.  I don't think I could name you right now, the leadership in the legislature.  Would you happen to know that person?
Speaker 1: (Unclear) [Un-un].
Speaker 2: Okay, you know, you would know it some years back, but at the present time you wouldn't know that person.  So I think we both agree on that.
Speaker 1: As far as the participation from those who have, you know, won election or whatever, what is it like for you when you win, your first day in the legislature?  What was, what was that like for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was--you want to be proud of yourself and the people who you represent and that you put on your best.  You want to look the best.  You want to understand the legis--you want to go to all the meetings.  You want to do everything on time, and you didn't want to miss a day.  That was my feeling on it.  I don't know how other people feel about doing a job.  And I think I take that feeling with anything I do, is that I want to put my best foot forward.  I want to be proud of me, and I have to be proud of my mother and my father and my family as well as the people I represent.
Story_ID: 91285
Speaker 1: What would you say to young people today to create in them a curiosity and an enthusiasm about state government and legislators in general?
Speaker 2: I would say that they should start off in school with participation and activities of the student and usually social clubs and fraternities and church organizations.  And usually, that helps.  And then when they're at home, they should, you know, participate with their own community.  And I think they have to have their eyes open for them.  But if, if you have a person that's not interested in anything, it's hard to attract them to anything of that.
Story_ID: 91286
Speaker 1: Does your son [Clarence Williamson, Jr.] have any interests in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, he don't.  I've tried and pushed him and brought him to the organizations, to the table and everything else, and has no, no feeling.  I even--I went back to school to impress him 'cause he hadn't finished school yet.  He just finished last year, see.  He just finished last--he did it the same time I did it.  He waited till the same age almost, you know.  And, but he did finish, so that's one great thing.  But as far as being interests, no, he don't have it.
Speaker 1: Did he work in law enforcement?
Speaker 2: Yes, he worked in law enforcement.  He was a state trooper.  He's a Chicago policeman at the present time.  He has a degree in aviation management, and, and criminal justice.  And he's, he's, he's sending letters out seeking employment in aviation management at the present time.
Story_ID: 91287
Speaker 1: Is there anything about your political life, before we return to your personal life, is there anything about your political life that stands out, that I didn't ask you about and maybe I should have?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was assistant to Mayor [Eugene] Sawyer, in charge of compliance for labor and contract compliance and employment somewhat, you know.  And I did a couple of years with him, and I worked in the mayor's office.  And that was a real, a real doozy for a while there.  And, but I enjoyed it.  I had a staff of four people that I hired, and that I was able to move in and out of the system and do the best job I could with what I had to do it with.
Speaker 1: And what--during that period, you just described, what stands out most about your activity?
Speaker 2: I was passing a law to increase minority participation in contracts which is the same thing they did here just last year.  And we were--that's what we were working on at the time.  We were trying to make it an ordinance, and they were saying that it couldn't be.
Speaker 1: What do you think was our greatest achievement of your term in the legislature?
Speaker 2: Well, the only thing I could put down as written is I was able to go to a conference committee as a freshman legislator with some of the biggies, which was Harold Washington was part of the Senate at the time.
Story_ID: 91288
Speaker 1: Now, we'll revert back to your personal life.  How did your activity in politics impact your family life?
Speaker 2: Well, it made my wife [Marion Degraffinreed] not like politics as far as that part is concerned.  But we get along.  We'll be celebrating our 50th anniversary September 8th of 1901.
Speaker 1: You mean 2001?
Speaker 2: Two thousand one [2001], yes.  Oh, I did say 1901 (laughter).  I caught myself, yeah, (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, (unclear) repeat that for me.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: You'll be celebrating--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I'll be celebrating my 50th wedding anniversary September the 8th of 2001.  All right, okay.
Speaker 1: What is it she didn't like about politics?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess, you know, you're staying away from home.  That's the number one issue, you know.  Your activities is geared towards making you successful, and you did whatever it took to do it.  And that, and that mean traveling back in the legislature and home on the weekends and labor and working and the luncheons and the dinners and all the other things, you know.
Speaker 1: So maybe it's good you lost and it guaranteed you this 50--(laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got it over, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Is there anything, any other area I didn't touch on that I should have?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I went through most of my thing.  I, the store manager, insurance, engineer, butcher by trade and, and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --and what else?  That's about it.  I've been through about, you know, five or six different professions, but I love 'em all, you know.  And I carry insurance license too, gen--I'm a general broker, yeah.
Story_ID: 91289

Speaker 2: Just a good guy, that's all, just like a good guy.  Yeah, love people, good guy.

Speaker 1: Bring me up to date of what you're doing right now, currently, really?
Speaker 2: Jazz, Jazz Unites.  I've been to meetings and organization and Jazz Showcase and Be-bop Cafe and Lee's Unleaded Blues, and Crystal Lights with June Levon (ph.) and things of that sort.  And then that would be that.  Then I'd go to my Alpha [Phi Alpha]--my fraternity meetings.
Speaker 1: Tell me what Jazz Unites is doing developmentally, like right now?
Speaker 2: Well, we're mentoring kids, the children in high schools.  We're supporting bands and Block 37 and we have things at Ravinia [Festival] where we have the high school kids come out and do auditions with certain jazz--local jazz stars.  And we, you know, have radio shows and quite, it's quite a few different things going on.
Speaker 1: You're a board member?
Speaker 2: Board member, yes.
Speaker 1: And how long you've been with them?
Speaker 2: I've been with them about five years.
Speaker 1: What do you hear about the new Jazz Museum?
Speaker 2: I'm involved with that also.  We lost out because we had the property at 12th and Michigan, was supposed to be our location.  But a millionaire developer that was in the art business go the building and he's gonna put a building there with an art gallery in there.  So we are still looking for a location and probably supporters.
Story_ID: 91291
Speaker 1: Do you, I'm gonna just take you back to your parents for a moment.  Do you remember any experience, perhaps what was your assessment of an experience your parent, either one of them, had as business people in the African American community?
Speaker 2: My mother, she belonged to a business, black business women's club.  And among those was black women who had insurance agencies, businesses, Commissioner's wife, Mrs. Sneed (ph.), Mrs. Parker and Mrs. Wilson--her husband had a haberdashery and things of that sort.  They met, and they used to take trips and things of that together.  And they did a lot of things in the business world on the South Side.  I remember they went to Baker's Casino and different social affairs and the Quincy Club and things of that sort.
Speaker 1: And life from your father [Robert Williamson]'s perspective, how would you describe that?
Speaker 2: My father worked every day, you know, at least 15, 16 hours, and, but he would take me on his vacation with him.  He would go to Idlewild, Michigan up in Idlewild, and we used to go together as a day.
Story_ID: 91292
Speaker 1: Is there anything you would like to say to, or about your spouse, parent, grandparent on the videotape?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd--I can--all I can say is I love them.  They treated me well as a kid, and I feel that I--at the time, I don't think I had it, but as I got older, I thought about how blessed I was to be able to have all of the resources that they gave me that was around.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you repeat that and say--name your parents, I mean (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, my parents was Robert E. Williamson, Sr., Annie V. Williamson, my mother.  They were very good parents to me.  They put the right perspective, the right life and gave me the tools I needed to grow up in Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 91293
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  I would probably ask one other thing for the CD-ROM, what would you say in response to someone who says that the state legislature, going through state politics isn't as important as going to nationwide politics or what--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, that's automatically, that's automatically--
Speaker 1: But don't answer until we finish the--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: But basically, the question is, what do you say to people who consider federal--
Speaker 2: Much better than state.  Oh, I could speak, I could speak on that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, my point is that state politics is great for the state that you live in and it's more effective to the people.  National politics is more or less larger and it affects a larger number of persons.  Now, when you said the difference of it, sure it's greater because it's just like a state legislator and a federal congressman.  They get paid more, it's further to travel, and you're involving more people.  So it's a growth thing.  Some people never leave the state and some people never leave the national.  But I, I understand it's a higher, it's a higher plateau office.  And I accept that.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  What would be the impetus for someone to go into state politics, what would you say to them as would be the inspiration behind going into state politics?
Speaker 2: The inspiration behind state politics that I would say that, I would believe a person should go into state politics to get his foot wet, to get a good foundation that he can meet the people that's around him at home so when he go to the national, he won't be at a lonely spot without any help back at home or knowing what's going on at his home base.
Story_ID: 91294
Speaker 1: One more question.  What influenced you the most and why, politically and then personally?
Speaker 2: Politically, what influenced me the most was my dad [Robert Williamson] in business and, and you could say that through the racial divide of the South Side, we were plagued with people who were just like locusts.  If you were in business on the South side, they just took everything you had, unless you know someone to go to stop them from taking it from you.  So that was one of my number one reason for going, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: What values do you consider most important and why?
Speaker 2: I would say honesty and education.  And I think that honesty mean that you are able to have a parent that you feel that you want to make them proud and the feeling.  You gotta have that feeling that someone cares other than you, and then the second thing is that if you don't know what you're doing (laughter), you don't know what you're doing, so you should have education to be able to carry out the wishes that you want to do.
Story_ID: 91295
Speaker 1: Why do you think history, overall, is important?
Speaker 2: History is very, very important, and I, I'm a great buff of local history.  I know quite a bit about Chicago [Illinois] in past and present.  And it helps me tremendous in life and everything--and among friends and whatever because I didn't realize that so many people knew so little about what actually went on and what's going on now and what is coming, you know.
Speaker 1: Will you share with us your thoughts about The HistoryMakers project?
Speaker 2: My thought, when I saw it is that we, we have a lot of people out here that we never knew that ever existed on the South Side.  I can say right now, I could remember my dad [Robert Williamson] doing business with Kersey, McGowan and Morsell [Funeral Home] and I believe Mr. [George] Kersey was a legislature back in the 1920s or something of that sort.  I remember going to Adelbert Roberts, the first black Senator of Illinois and going to his house, delivering groceries.  And I remember he had a big fish pond and a yard, and a backyard with all kind of things.  He was correct--he was living in a graystone building behind De LaSalle High School.  And when I'd walk to the other room, they had little things like the theater had, that you walk, you know, straight to the kitchen to the back there.  And he had a daughter and things that they used to go to formals with my parents.  I think his son was a pharmacist or something of that sort.  And before my dad was about 94, I asked him, what was the fame of Adelbert Roberts?  How did he get to be senator?  And my dad said he was a barber for the white folks downtown, and they appointed him senator.  That's right.  They said that he was a barber.
Speaker 1: And how many terms did have?
Speaker 2: He served about three or four.  They got a statute of him in the, in the floor down there, Adelbert Roberts, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you very much for that bit of history.  What else do you remember about that first black senator?
Speaker 2: I remember him as--looked like the Prince Albert type of guy, you know, with the cut-away coats and all that stuff of that, so I remember that Prince Albert type.  And I remember Kersey, McGowan and Morsell, they had a funeral home they built in Chicago in 1915 or something.  It's still there at 35th and Indiana.  I think he lived in Hinsdale [Illinois].  One guy was a legislator and one was a preacher and one was a businessman, you know.
Speaker 1: Did--was he still living when you went to the state--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Roberts were--well, not when I went, but as I kid, I remember seeing him in his home, you know.
Speaker 1: But he was still living when you became active in politics?
Speaker 2: I couldn't say that.  I was a child when he was still living.  Yeah, I just know the history of it, you know, by talking to my parents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember seeing Jack Johnson standing on the corner of 35th and Michigan, you know, with is turned-dye (unclear) gray coat and his tam and all that, you know, like that.
Speaker 1: And you say you remember some other greats, coming in the store--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, the store would be--
Speaker 1: Did you have any personal exchanges with any--
Speaker 2: Just as, no, just as I was the little son, you know.  That was about all, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, then, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's very interesting.
