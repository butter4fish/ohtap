Speaker 1: Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I heard you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't have a favorite time of year.  It depends, you know, I used to say it was winter time but then my husband said it was because I never shoveled the snow.  I, I don't have, I really don't have a favorite time of year, it depends.

Speaker 1: Just to correct an error that I made, [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Adelaide] Cromwell, we're very pleased to be here in your home in Brookline [Massachusetts] with all these beautiful paintings and artifacts from Africa and so thank you for having us here to do the interview.
Speaker 2: My pleasure.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).  We wanna start with your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we're gonna start with your mother--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) we have a picture.  Tell me about your mother, what was her name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Yetta Elizabeth Mavritte, spelled, M-A-V-R-I-T-T-E.  She was a very pretty girl.  She was a student of my father's [John Wesley Cromwell, Jr.], actually, in one of his classes at [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School, Washington, D.C.].  She was born in Washington [D.C.], from a relatively large family.  She, I was their only child.  And after she married she went back to teachers, normal--teacher college and, and got her certificate or whatever and taught but she never really worked, she was a stay at home mother but a very pretty, pretty woman.
Speaker 1: What do you know about her growing up years (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I know everything about her growing up years.
Speaker 1: What did she tell you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, you see actually, I was born in Washington as I, as I've said, but fortunately for me my grandparents lived in what you would call, we used to call out in the country but it was really northeast Washington which is now very much built up.  So I had the good fortune of being able to see my grandparents as often as I did, on my mother's side that is, along right with my mother, every Sunday we'd go out to grandmother's.  And grandmother was the matriarch, the oldest of several sisters and they all lived in proximity to each other.  I was named for her as a matter of fact, Addie [ph.] they called her, but she was Adelaide [Seldon Mavritte].  So every Sunday we'd go out there and see grandma and grandpa [William Mavritte] and the aunts, the great-aunts and all the cousins.  And (unclear) my mother was the, my mother was the only daughter in this family until late because I have an aunt six months older than I am.  So my grandmother had, I have a picture of that group upstairs, most of them, and so she was a pretty daughter with all these brothers favored by her mother and father, I think.  And then when mother married, shortly after she was married, grandmother had Ruth [Mavritte] who is my aunt, it was her second daughter.  And they were all the, these sisters, my grandmother and her sisters they all came from Virginia, they didn't come from the Deep South but they maintained a very close relationship with each other.  So all the cousins are close, second cousins are as close as first cousins, first cousins as close as siblings.  They never argued, that is the older sisters, my grandmother and her sisters.  Her younger, one of her younger sisters was Helen Brooke, [HistoryMaker] Senator [Edward] Brooke's mother, and my grandmother brought her up like her child rather than as her sister.  So really that's how I know how grandmother grew up.  They were very strict.  My grandfather was a Baptist preacher and I, he was very, you know, read the Bible very often, only by trade he was a bricklayer and also a Baptist minister.  And he was very devout but he understood us, he let us have a little slack in a way by the time I came along.
Story_ID: 253775
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mother [Yetta Mavritte Cromwell] in terms of her personality, what was she like as a person?
Speaker 2: She was quiet.  She was not shy but she, she was not assertive.  Although her second husband died, Walter Washington was her lawyer and he thought mother wouldn't be able to take care of her business and he said, "Addie [HistoryMaker Adelaide Cromwell] I was very surprised at how your mother just took over when she had to."  And she gave me a many a smack when I grew up.  I mean she was a disciplinarian but I would call her loving and quiet, she was very loyal to her friends too, I remember that as a child.  She had friends who had different personal problems or problems with their marriages and mother never gave up on them when other people did.  So I, I don't think I could describe, shoot, I never saw or really heard her lose her temper.  As a matter of fact, I grew up in a very quiet house, nobody lost his temper, her temper.  But I think that covers mother, she didn't, she always looked good in her clothes.  She didn't have any particular hobbies except friends and family.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any special stories that she may have told you about her growing up years?
Speaker 2: No, un-un.  I don't think she saw, because she was young when, after all she was only twenty when I was born.  So I think that was always up to my grandparents [Adelaide Seldon Mavritte and William Mavritte].  There wasn't that distance that you might have had if grandmother had been in Mississippi or even in Boston [Massachusetts] and I didn't see them or if she was much older.  You see, she was, she could have been my sister and she had a sister my age.
Story_ID: 253776
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father.  What was his name?
Speaker 2: John Wesley Cromwell, Jr.  He was a very brilliant mathematician who was, but ultimately became the first black CPA [Certified Public Accountant] to practice, I think another one had also got his credentials but Daddy worked at it, he didn't teach it.  He was, well he came from a family of sisters.  He had one brother who died when he was, when the child was young.  They lived in Washington [D.C.].  My grandfather [John Wesley Cromwell, Sr.] brought up these children largely by himself because the oldest one, my father's oldest sister, was twelve when their mother [Lucy A. McGuinn] died.  So through my grandfather did marry [Annie E. Conn] later, grandfather sort of (unclear) to having the children with help, with outside help.  Daddy was, he had a temper and I don't know whether I should put this in the permanent record or not but it happened.  And he was a mathematician as I said, taught math and majored in astronomy at Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire].  And when I was growing up, well, he would help me with my homework.  I was not good in math and did not want to be good in math, did not like math, but I would go to Daddy to have him help me with these problems.  And, of course, I only wanted an answer, I didn't wanna know how it got to be that.  And one day in desperation, 'cause these were often crying sessions, he said, I said, Daddy, the book said, and my father was a mild man when his temper didn't go, as I said, he had a temper but he didn't show it, but that day when I said, Daddy, the book said, and he didn't indulge in profanity, he said, "God damn the book, somebody wrote the book."  And it's a story I have remembered and I have told my own students that because it's written down, doesn't make it true, even in math.  Now whether he was right or wrong that I don't know, but he was trying to show me, forget the book and let me show you how to solve this problem.  But he was an avid bridge player.  He was one of the founders of the black bridge association [American Bridge Association], a tennis player of, you know, that I have several trophies of his when he played tennis as a young man.  He was a well-rounded but kind of small in stature, nice looking, had all these sisters though as I said.  And poor man he was in a household of women because I grew up in a household with my aunts, you didn't ask me that yet, and my parents and there was Daddy, the only man in the house, but he survived.
Speaker 1: What year was he born?
Speaker 2: Eighty-three [1883], I think.
Speaker 1: How did he happen to go to Dartmouth College?
Speaker 2: Well I've happened, I, I, I'm very well versed in all of that right now because I've been writing about it.  He, there were some black men who had gone to Dartmouth in Washington and he knew them, he knew that they'd done well.  Robert Montgomery [ph.] was one I can think of.  And Daddy, Dartmouth was cheaper than Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] by like twenty-five dollars less a year.  And so he applied to Dartmouth and he was accepted and as I said was a, a Phi Beta Kappa student.  As a matter of fact, I have some (unclear) tapes of his, one particularly when he talked about his college years and at, at Dartmouth, and we don't have time to go into that now, but what I was interested in with him, he went, he came out of Dartmouth in 1906, that he was interested in, and my grandfather doing work, work getting A's, getting a good grade, getting a job because you had to survive and not having any time for frivolity, you know, not coming home for holidays for example, not having the money to do that but doing well in his schoolwork.  And no bitterness, no, no sense of prejudice on the part of his classmates who were, many of them were, mostly all, I think he was the only black in his class, I'm not sure maybe, I think there was one other black person in his class but there were very few.  I went back with him and my husband, and Tony [Anthony Cromwell Hill] for his fiftieth reunion.  He loved Dartmouth and Dartmouth loved him.
Story_ID: 253777
Speaker 1: Tell me about your grandfather, your father's [John Wesley Cromwell, Jr.] father.
Speaker 2: Well he was a very interesting man.  John Wesley Cromwell, Sr.  He was the last child of his parents [Elizabeth Carney Cromwell and Willis Hodges Cromwell].  He was born in slavery.  They came to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in 19, 1851.  He went to what was a very important school in Philadelphia, run, started by Quakers called the Institute for Colored Youth [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania].  It was kind of like, I feel like [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School, Washington, D.C.] of my period but that really was theirs.  And he went, after that he taught in Freedmen's Bureau [Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands] in South.  Then he started a newspaper called the People's Advocate and he ran, many blacks who had some sense of, shall I say some sense of what was going on in their world in the post-Reconstruction, Reconstruction America, or Reconstruction started small newspapers.  Grandfather's lasted over ten years and he started that.  Then he went to Howard University law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], second class of the Howard University law school.  His main job was, of course, (unclear) was teaching.  He taught at District, [Washington] D.C. schools.  And he, he always wrote, very active in the [American] Negro Academy [ANA] about which you may know something.  Very good friend of, Alexander Crummell.  It was a whole group of those men who were intellectuals at the time.  He, I remember him, he died when I was a little girl.  He was or shall I say, kind of estranged from his children as he got older because he, they did have a stepmother [Annie E. Conn].  But he was a figure in the community as long as he lived.  He was a meth, he was a A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] until Alexander Crummell came to Washington [D.C.] then he became active in the Episcopal church.
Speaker 1: Are there any songs, any stories, any legends that were passed down to you through your grandparents and parents?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I just heard that story about his profanity.
Story_ID: 253778
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your early years.  What is your earliest memory of growing up?  How far back can you remember your growing up years?
Speaker 2: Well, I think you should ask me in the situation in which I grew up, which was a atypical situation.  Large townhouse, something like this house with my father [John Wesley Cromwell, Jr.] as I said and his young wife [Yetta Mavritte Cromwell] and these aunts, three of whom or four of whom were teachers in the schools, and I was the only child in this whole collection of people.  So I, well, I remember, of course, the way we set up the house, the aunts lived, had their bedrooms on the third floor and the living rooms and dining room were on the first floor, and the second floor was our apartment.  So I used to, I remember running up and down to suit my needs from the third floor to the second, often eating two dinners or either the dinner that I wanted because mother would cook one and my Aunt Lucy [Cromwell] would cook another.  I was very fond of my Aunt Otelia [Cromwell] who was the oldest sister, who was a very distinguished person.  She too went to Smith [College, Northampton, Massachusetts] and got her Ph.D., Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and taught, was a wonderful teacher and she was such a nurturing person to me.  She taught me, so I didn't start school until second grade so she tutored me at home.  I guess, one of the things I remember, again it's, I don't know how relevant it's like the story of my grandfather, but I must have been about five, six, and this young man, Eddie Goins [Edward H. Goin] by name, was coming to Washington [D.C.] to stay with us for a few days.  Eddie Goins had been in a accident, car accident in New Haven [Connecticut] and had to have one of his limbs cut off, the arm.  And I remember Aunt Otelia taking me upstairs before Eddie came and said, [HistoryMaker] Adelaide [Cromwell], Eddie's coming, he only has one arm and you're not to look at it, you're not to say anything about it, and you're not to make any remark, act as though you even see it, and if you don't, if you do that properly, I'll give you a gift when he goes.
Speaker 1: Could I just ask you to spell the first name of your Aunt Otelia?
Speaker 2: O-T, O-T-E-L-I-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Goins, would you spell it?
Speaker 2: Goins, G-O-I-N-S [sic.].  His father [Reverend Edward F. Goin] was a well-known minister in New Haven.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: --when she said that she'd give me a gift if I didn't, you know, look at him or say something to him.  So he, after he stayed a week (unclear) and I dutifully obeyed and when he left, she called me up to her room and gave me my first wrist watch.  I remember it was a little watch that had little flowers around it.  That I remember as something early.  I remember they had a fifth birthday party for me and I didn't know they had told people not to bring gifts.  So my memory is going to the door anticipating gifts and getting none but some people were more aware of a child, brought gifts anyhow.
Story_ID: 253779
Speaker 1: Then there's one other story I tell, I don't know whether, this is what you think.  Washington [D.C.] was a segregated community as you know, but people of different classes lived in proximity to each other and I, though I lived on a big street, 13th Street, when I was a child, behind my street were alleys in which people lived.  All the way--they were built following the Civil War for people who didn't have means or just, I guess, it would be help for the whites who lived in the big house.  Anyway, those children who came from those areas would not necessarily be like us, they'd be kind of rough and tough children.  But I was by nature, friendly with people.  I, I, I knew where I was, knew who I was perhaps, but I liked all people.  And there was one little boy in that group whose brother was, people may know him because his brother was Reggie Briscoe [ph.] who played on the, on the Harlem Renaissance [New York Renaissance] team.  Well Reggie Briscoe's brother, we called Doll Baby [ph.], and, of course, if you know anything about black humor, it's hard not to look like a doll baby to be called Doll Baby.  So one day (laughter) in the heat of Washington, you asked me what season I like, well I didn't like those hot summers in Washington, I should have said that.  But I, when the sun went down it wasn't so hot, we'd get dressed up and go out and get an ice cream cone or skip rope or hopscotch.  So I got dressed up this day and went, I went to get an ice cream cone at Mr. Harmon's [ph.] store which was around the block on the other corner, and I bought the ice cream cone and I'm walking up the street with my clean dress on with the ice cream cone and this gang of little ruffians came out prepared to take of me and my ice cream cone.  Doll Baby saw me, oh no he says, don't hurt her, that's [HistoryMaker] Adelaide [Cromwell].  So I went off in triumph quickly home.  I think that's kind of all the earlier things, I, I must have been about eight years old, I guess, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Tell me a little bit more about your neighborhood [Shaw, Washington, D.C.] and the street you grew up on?  What are your other memories of your neighbors and--
Speaker 1: Interesting street actually.  It was a big street through Washington and I guess our family may have been the second blacks who moved in there.  I don't remember the, I don't remember any whites in the neighborhood except one eccentric old lady who never came out of her house except to have a black child come and do her shopping for her.  The corner stores were always run by Jews and there was usually one on every corner, at least two on our corner.  They were affable because they depended on these people for them.  We didn't do our regular marketing there but just small marketing.  And the people who lived on the block were professionals, doctors and school teachers and a few other government workers.  Right on the corner from my house was a hotel that was run by blacks called the Whitelaw Hotel [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Could you spell that for us?
Speaker 1: Whitelaw, W-H-I-T-E-L-A-W, one word.  And we used to have dances there.  And it was, it was also had a barbershop and it had a, a ballroom and then people had apartments.  Actually one of my earlier stories, I guess, if you talk you'll remember, my cousin who lived next door to me, George Lawrence [ph.] by name, took me to the barbershop to have my hair cut, trimmed.  And I had on khaki knickers, I guess, and the barber whose name was Mr. Lowe [ph.], said to me are you a little boy or are you a little girl?  And I said, I'm a little girl, you're a little boy he says (unclear) me, and I repeated.  Needless to say he cut my hair all off like a boys and my mother [Yetta Mavritte Cromwell] came up there and that was one of the times she lost her temper.  But it was a quiet neighborhood, people were all, they were lots of, I think they were school teachers, lots of them single women who lived on that street.  And around the corner, around the corner Duke Ellington's family grew up.  Another family that you would possibly, you should know but may not know, [Addison] Scurlock was one of the famous black photographers but they lived right around the corner.
Story_ID: 253780
Speaker 1: We all went to Garrison [Elementary] School [Washington, D.C.], that was the, the elementary school which is where I, all of this was in a three or four block walking distance.  And then when we finished Garrison we went to the new junior high school which was Garnet-Patterson Junior High School [Washington, D.C.], which was up on the Florida Avenue and became, it's funny how the black community segregated though we was, began to merge through the schools.  You'd go to a different grammar school and then you'd feed into a junior high school from the, from other children having come from other elementary schools, then you'd go to the high schools.  And, of course, you may know we had three black high schools in Washington [D.C.] and [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School, Washington, D.C.], Cardozo [Senior High School; Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.], and [Samuel Chapman] Armstrong Technical [High School; Armstrong Manual Training School, Washington, D.C.] and business and classical (unclear) or (unclear) we called the term here.  But you could go to college from all of those, they were not segregated to that extent.  But by the time we got to Dunbar, children had come from all over the city but we still live in a segregated world.
Speaker 2: Let's go back now to your elementary school.  You've given me a nice lead in to--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).  What do you remember about your elementary school experience?  Well, what was it like for you?
Speaker 1: Well, I told you I started in second grade.  And my father [John Wesley Cromwell, Jr.], they were always trying to decide where I was gonna go to school.  So rather than going to Garrison School in the first grade, my father and Aunt Otelia [Cromwell] decided that I should go to [Lucretia] Mott [Elementary] School [Washington, D.C.] which was over near Howard University [Washington, D.C.] because they knew the principal of Mott School and they thought that since I was starting in second grade I might be in a more understanding environment.  My memory is rushing across town with my father to be there on time because it was in walking distance.  I made some friends there, one or two I still have that I met at Mott School.
Speaker 2: Is that you, could you spell that name?
Speaker 1: Lucretia Mott, Mott, M-O-T-T.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Mott School.  It was one thing in Washington contrary to Boston [Massachusetts] before I came here, almost all the schools we attended were named for black historic figures or white people who had been active like Lucretia Mott or Myrtilla Miner.  We didn't have to go to schools named for some white folks we didn't know.  And so I went from Garrison School to Garnet-Patterson to Dunbar.  And then some students went to Howard University, which it was that way.  And you asked me about things, I don't remember very much.  Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden], I, we had good times--
Story_ID: 253781
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers in elementary school that you remember especially that influenced you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, my second, I'm not like you, yes, I remember my teachers.  I had, I could, Miss Burke [ph.] my first, the teacher in second grade was Mrs. Ferguson [ph.] over at Mott.  And then when I moved to, down to, to Garrison [Elementary School, Washington, D.C.], my third grade teacher was Miss Burke [ph.].  Fourth grade teacher was Miss Parker [ph.].  Fifth grade teacher was Miss Brown [ph.].  Sixth grade teacher was Miss Pierson (ph.).  How would that do for you?  Then I went to junior (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did any one of those influence you in any special way in your--
Speaker 2: No, I came from a household of teachers.  (Unclear) were a good influence.  I was well teached.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you in elementary school?  How would you remember yourself as a student?
Speaker 2: I was, I was, I was always getting very good marks but I was a gregarious person.  I had friends I, I wasn't well, how do I say it, those of us who were serious about school, who came from families that were encouraging them, we hung out together shall we say to use the phrase.  So we all studied, it wasn't, it wasn't, well, maybe as we got older there were a couple of girls and boys who might be known for the, being nerds but most of us had a good time and got good grades too.
Speaker 1: So you left there at what grade?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: The elementary school.
Speaker 2: Elementary school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't know, I came out of high school [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Washington, D.C.] when I was sixteen, how would that do for you for age?
Story_ID: 253782
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about the middle school years then, junior high (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Junior, junior high school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it isn't too much to say about those.  We, we were very excited, I think they called us Miss So and So, rather than [HistoryMaker] Adelaide [Cromwell], later I think it was Miss Cromwell to give us some sense of, and then it was a big, there were better facilities, it was a new school and we didn't have any cafeteria in our high school, gym in our grammar school [Garrison Elementary School, Washington, D.C.].  But we went to junior high we had a, because it was new, we had a gym, beautiful gym, a big auditorium, and classes that were more diversified, you received language classes, science classes.  I remember when we had a science teacher, Mr. Ferguson [ph.], was that, (unclear) was his name, he was kind of (unclear).  We used to love to tease him.  And he had a dislike for pickles.  We loved pickles so we'd bring pickles (laughter) in (unclear) gym, and Mr. Ferguson, that is that man's name, I should (unclear) he'd say who's got a pickle in this classroom?  And one day one of the girls Mabel Jones [ph.] had a pickle in her briefcase and she had to go to the window and hang her hand out with that pickle to take the odor out of the room.  We had science teachers, Miss Black [ph.].  And it was just a, we were growing up in a more diversified, I don't remember any, anything that stood out there, Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden], in the junior high school.  Well I might say this, as I said that I was, started school in the second grade, well my family, my Aunt Otelia [Cromwell] who, who looms very large in my education planning, thought that junior high schools were a waste of time.  She believed that you should go straight through until you finished grammar school and then go to high school the first year.  So this is the one, a trauma that I did have.  All of the other, my friends, my good and dear friends stayed at Garnet-Patterson [Junior High School, Washington, D.C.], I had to leave Garnet-Patterson and go to [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School, Washington, D.C.] first year, now it was possible because children who came from other parts of Washington [D.C.] didn't have junior high schools, black children.  So I was sent down to Dunbar as a freshman when all my best friends I had left at Garnet-Patterson.  But as I look back on it, I didn't like it, oh, I, I pitched one, I remember, I just, I didn't wanna do it and, of course, I did it.  But it was a great thing for me because I met another group of children whom my other friends never knew because they didn't, they came in as sophomores.  I met them as freshmen and they came from all over Washington and that's the vantage part which I think was a good thing for me.  But when that, when, and I used to rush to get home, I used to rush when, when high school was over to get up and be at junior high school in time when my friends came out so we could walk together home.  But that was only a year, and then they came down and we were all one again, shall we say.
Story_ID: 253783
Speaker 1: Let's continue by having you share with us your memories of [Paul Laurence] Dunbar High School [Washington, D.C.].  What was that experience like for you?
Speaker 2: Well Dunbar was a very positive experience.  I had an aunt who taught there, math, my father's [John Wesley Cromwell, Jr.] second sister.  But it was a familiar environment because we knew those people, they knew us.  Again, it was a broadening of the, of the curriculum and that Dunbar spent a lot of time bringing people for our assemblies to educate us.  I, I remember 'The Lord' [sic. 'The Green Pastures'], the play, 'The Lord' with Richard, I think it was Richard [Berry] Harrison who came in that play.  And we had set, assemblies like that.  We had the, the, important debating societies.  It was a very diversified curriculum.  As a matter of fact, I keep a copy of the, I decided to keep a copy of, of the yearbook that I had because I think people should see what we had as opportunities in that school.  And we were very proud of sending students, all of the students to college and they didn't go to Miner Teachers College [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.], they would go to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  If they didn't go there, they'd go away to school.  It was, I guess, some one or two didn't go anywhere but you don't know who they were, you just knew everybody else went somewhere.  The teachers were very anxious about that.  They were very strict disciplinarians, Mr. Smith [ph.], I can see him now, he was a very strict baldheaded man, didn't put up with any talking, laughing in the auditorium, we marched by group.  And we had a strict dean of women.  And the athletic component was very strong, we had a swimming pool for boys and girls.  We had, of course, all the other activities, it was a good time.  A really good time that you had serious boyfriends 'cause we always had little boyfriends when you were going along but that didn't count but by the time you got to high school, you were somebody's girlfriend.  Oh and then began to have social clubs of your own.  They were in the, in the school but mostly outside when you made friends.  And this, of course, as I look back on it, I think it's a normal adolescent manifestation but it's discriminatory.  It's early on before you get to high school, I don't think you discriminated among kids unless they can do something better, maybe dance better or sing better or just more fun to be around.  By the time you get to high school, you begin to pick whom you want to associate with.  And I can remember coming into to school on Monday and having had a meeting over the weekend, one of the girls have a party and we'd all be in a section, the section by sex, it was all girls, all boys, and passing out the invitations, not to everybody now, only the, and not realizing how that would make somebody feel who didn't get one.  But you, I don't think we were doing it consciously but in the social sciences we were doing it.  And I think it kept right on up to people who go to sororities and all the rest of it, it starts in high school.  But it's still an aura of equality and democracy.  And people used to say, people have said, that Dunbar was a school for the elite but I don't think that.  It was for the, it was for the blacks who could think we were smart.  And they didn't care who your father and mother were, the teachers didn't because their, their credibility rests on your success.  And if you were going to Williams [College, Williamstown, Massachusetts] or Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or, or Mount Holyoke [College, South Hadley, Massachusetts], they got credit for that.  So they were more concerned, they liked the pretty little light-skinned children whose fathers were doctors, you know, we heard about that, but if they were dumb, too bad.  Well somebody else's child would be, father would be a Pullman porter and if he or she was smart, they would take care of, that's always been my feeling about Dunbar and I think I had a perspective better than some children because I lived in the house with these teachers and I knew what they did for children in guiding them and how they behaved.  So it was a, I can't think of any negative experience really except as I'm just telling you that inadvertently we may have made someone else unhappy, but that wasn't conscious.

Speaker 1: Were there any teachers that particularly influenced you in any way that stand out in your mind today that you remember as being particularly (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: In [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School, Washington, D.C.]?  In high school?
Speaker 1: At Dunbar.  Were there any--
Speaker 2: Well they weren't any more important than those in my house but I would say that I was very fond of Mr. McDuffy [ph.] who taught Latin, he taught me Virgil.  I thought he was a, see I didn't have in my (unclear) family who taught Latin so, he was a good teacher.  Then there was an English teacher Lilian Brown [ph.], or L.S. Brown [ph.] who was a very strict but good teacher, and I liked her.  And then, I guess, the third one would be Carolyn Calloway [sic. Caroline Calloway] who taught math.  You know, I guess really none stood out really, Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden], you know, they were, well I liked the subject matter.  And I had a French teacher, Mrs. Gibson [ph.], Molly, Molly Brewer [ph.], she was married at one time to Mr. Brewer's [ph.], the association person.  She was, we didn't like her.  She was an unhappy woman, she was going through a divorce when we were in school.  So it was the fact that she was unhappy that made us a little unhappy but, but I remember that.  As a matter of fact, I was in her wedding when I was, when she had the first wedding.  So I don't think other than those, I think L.S. Brown, Carolyn Calloway and Mr. McDuffy.  But it was not a big, big distinction that's among them.
Story_ID: 253785
Speaker 1: As you move through [Paul Laurence] Dunbar High School [Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --from freshman to senior year--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --did you during that time begin to have any aspirations or ideas about what you wanted to do with your life and what you wanted to be?  Did anything begin to formulate at that time?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  I didn't, I never wanted to be a doctor or a lawyer.  I think I always wanted to be a teacher and I wanted to go to college that was the next thing.  And as a matter of fact, in my yearbook, and which I probably should have shown you before we started, you, you were asked what you wanted to be and I, so I think I said to get the most out of life as possible.  But the, the, the motto I had ex femina facte, a woman was made the leader.  So I think that kind of, (laughter) but going through that yearbook it's very interesting to see what the children wanted to be.  And they wanted to be, but in fact they could be, so a few guys wanted to be doctors, and most of those men who wanted to be doctors became doctors.  The girls wanted to be teachers, occasional hairdresser.  I think one dentist among the men.  It's a very interesting kind of revelation of the aspirations at that time, in that world, as opposed to a study I did here many years ago at the [Boston] Latin School [Boston, Massachusetts] when I asked those, which were there, like what they wanted to be, they wanted to be astronauts, the whole world opened up to them, you know, by that time.  But I don't think I had thought much further than, than, than wanting to be a teacher and going to college.  And in college [Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts] I guess I just wanted to get out of college (laughter) and get on and go to graduate school.
Story_ID: 253786
Speaker 1: In addition to the classes and the courses and the studies you did at [Paul Laurence Dunbar] High School [Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what other, out of school extracurricular activities were you involved in, outside of school, in your neighborhood, in the community?
Speaker 2: Oh, talking (laughter).  No, I we had clubs, the social clubs.  I was, the day, I took dancing lessons for a number of years and music lessons, but music lessons was a great waste of money 'cause I was determined not to learn how to play.  I guess the dancing continued through, through junior high [Garnet-Patterson Junior High School, Washington, D.C.], maybe into high school 'cause we had recitals and they were very important events to the teachers who taught us dancing.  But I can't think of, of course, I went to camp.  I started going to camp when I was maybe eight or nine.  I came up to Camp Atwater [North Brookfield, Massachusetts] because Washington [D.C.] was hot in the summertime, we didn't have a summer home, and the family went different places but not many places.  So this same Goins [sic. Goin] family that I mentioned earlier, they knew the people who ran Atwater, Dr., this Dr. Demary--[Dr. William] De Berry his name was.  So she told, Mrs. Goins told my aunt [Otelia Cromwell] about Atwater.  So after Auntie investigated it, I have a machine on.  After my auntie investigated it, I came up here.  And I guess I was the first person who came south of Hartford [Connecticut] to Atwater.  And then as more people knew about my going, they came and I went for several years and met some of my best friends at Atwater.  And get, and came back later as a camper, I mean as a counselor.  But that would be the, I think the other side.
Story_ID: 253787
Speaker 1: What about church?  Did church play a role in your life, in your family's life?  Were you active in church?
Speaker 2: Well, I was Episcopalian, still am I guess, whatever that may mean.  I went to Sunday school every Sunday to St. Luke's [Episcopal] Church [Washington, D.C.] and I told you [Alexander] Crummell, Dr. Crummell had started that church and we were active in the, actually, my mother [Yetta Mavritte Cromwell] was a born a Baptist and she died a, oh, Presbyterian I think.  She didn't stay as a Baptist, she really didn't like the Episcopal church, said they got up and sat down to much for her.  But I taught Sunday school.  It was, you know, the thing to do.  I like going (unclear).  It wasn't any big deal.  I never, we didn't go to any extracurricular, I never saw my father [John Wesley Cromwell, Jr.] in church at all, 'til, never but he was a religious man but he didn't go to church.
Story_ID: 253788
Speaker 1: As you approach your senior year in high school [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Washington, D.C.], you began to make some decisions about where you were going--
Speaker 2: Before my senior year in high school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Before.  What did you decide and how'd you make those decisions?
Speaker 2: Well, my, I didn't have much choice.  My Aunt Otelia [Cromwell] as I told you, was the first black graduate of Smith College [Northampton, Massachusetts].  I may not have said that but she went to Smith.  And so as long as I was doing well in school and I, you know, everybody said [HistoryMaker] Adelaide [Cromwell]'s going to Smith.  On those days that I wasn't doing so well or misbehaving, they thought maybe I might go south to school.  They would use that to me as kind of, well maybe you don't wanna go to Smith, Adelaide.  I rather liked the idea of going to Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio].  I had gone out to Oberlin to visit my great-aunt, my father's mother's [Lucy A. McGuinn] sister when I was twelve, I guess, (unclear) and I liked it.  It was a different environment, you know, it was all white, small sort of a, a small town.  And they lived on the edge of town, so I kind of thought I, I would go to, I mean I talked that talk but nobody paid any attention to it.  I, Auntie thought well, if she doesn't get into Smith, that was always a possibility, then you'll spend a year in a prep school.  So she had arranged for me to be interviewed by Northfield [Seminary for Young Ladies; Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts].  So the lady from Northfield came to see me, I think I was sitting on that sofa, that stool, I didn't have the slightest intention of going to Northfield (laughter) but I, I allowed her to ask the questions.  So, of course, when I got accepted, I think that was a experience too because you had to take the scholastic aptitude exam then.  And as I said to you before, Washington [D.C.] was a restricted world but they gave the exam over at Georgetown [University, Washington, D.C.], George Washington [University, Washington, D.C.] or something, so I had to venture over there.  And I don't think there was another black face in the room that day to take that exam but I was ready for it because I had had these experiences I just said, I, you know, in camp and in Ohio and talking with her.  So I, it just that I looked back on it as being probably more traumatic than it was.  So, of course, when I got the big fat envelope from Smith and it had all the, you're accepted, there was never any question that I wouldn't go.
Speaker 1: Now what year did you enter Smith College?
Speaker 2: Thirty-six [1936], 1936.
Story_ID: 253789
Speaker 1: And how do you remember the first year?  What was it like going there what, what are your early memories of entering Smith [College, Northampton, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Well, you see, I told you that my aunt [Otelia Cromwell] went there and she'd kept up her ties and as a matter of fact the house I was gonna stay in, it happened to be the house mother was a class, was a classmate, not a friend of hers, but a classmate of hers.  And, Mrs. Scales [ph.] who was the dean, was also a classmate of hers.  I think the first thing I know, two things I noticed that the only thing I well, no, I guess there are three stories.  When I went up to Smith I went with my mother [Yetta Mavritte Cromwell], 'cause auntie didn't wanna go and daddy [John Wesley Cromwell, Jr.] wasn't going, auntie never came until I had graduated, after I graduated but my mother came when I graduated, my mother came with me, my father came along the way.  So I, mother and I went up together and we were in the Pullman car and I went into the common bath, toilets there and these other two white girls were there, I knew they were going to Smith and, of course, I was (unclear) they never said a word.  I checked them out, remembered them, I have never forgot their faces (laughter) even (unclear) anywhere.  We got to Northampton [Massachusetts], went to my dorm, and my mother, I had put her on the train that day, I didn't want her around interfering with my (unclear) adjustment.  She went along dutifully, went back to Washington [D.C.].  She'd seen where I was gonna stay and (unclear).  They, a couple days later, they had these little dorms with different classes, all four classes were in the same dorm.  They had a party in our dorm, maybe, maybe it was two days later, nobody asked me to come.  I knew they were gonna, I was a bit sophisticated for a sixteen year old girl I think, as I look back on it.  And I didn't go and I stayed in my room.  Finally somebody came up, knocked on door, are you coming down and I said if you want me to, and I came down.  That was the first thing.  [HistoryMaker] Robert [C. Hayden], that was the only thing as I look back, that and the train ride that I was aware of anything that might have been, this is a black girl.  However, when I finished college and went back to teach, as we got older, I learned a couple of things.  I learned from the house mother that another girl, whose name it's not important to give, wealthy, (unclear) looking person, her mother saw me going to the bathroom, cause we had the, and she said to Mrs. Amy [ph.], "Is my Molly [ph.] gonna go use the same bathroom as that little girl?"  And Mrs. Amy said, "If your Molly's gonna stay at Smith College she is."  I heard that.
Story_ID: 253790
Speaker 1: The other thing that I heard which was really, I've told this later and I can show you the pictures there, 'cause I have 'em right there when I get up, one of my classmates, we was four very close friends.  One of them lives in Connecticut and she was up, I saw her I guess ten years ago now, and she [HistoryMaker] Adelaide [Cromwell], Addie, this is, did you ever know the story about Harris [ph.]?  And Mary [ph.] whatever, her and me, I said no.  Well she said when we were freshmen we were all, (unclear) and Harris was from Oklahoma and so is Mary Mead [ph.].  And Mary Mead was making some comments about me being black and whatnot and Harris was a senior, Mary Mead was a freshman and Harris liked me.  We, she had some rhythms, she could dance what a rare commodity among whites, she made a rare talent (laughter) among white girls.  So we would dance together.  Anyway, my friend Tina [ph.] told me that Harris told Mary Mead to cool it, forget it, this was Smith College [Northampton, Massachusetts], and she was to act right.  I never knew anything about it until she told me this about, I'd say less than ten years ago.  So I decided to write Harris a letter and I hadn't seen her since that first, she graduated my freshman year.  So I wrote her a letter and I had, she was still living in the same family home, I think they were quite well off in Oklahoma, and I told her that I had heard something and I wanted to thank her for it and that I had, had a fairly good life and what I'd, a little bit of what I done and I hoped she'd had a good life.  I haven't thought anything more about it.  Well about two months later, very plain envelope came, a letter from her husband, Harris was dead, she had died when I wrote that but he said to me how much she would have appreciated receiving it and I appreciate your doing it.  So those were the only things that I could sort of put together.  The other story about Harris, you know, appropriate not to me but to our recent election, as I told you, I was in Washington [D.C.] we didn't vote, blacks.  So the first election was between and [President Franklin Delano] Roosevelt and Alf Landon 1936, and I heard Harris say for, she was an expansive personality wasn't a big person.  If Roosevelt wins my father's gone move out of the country.  So I went to bed and not knowing or caring who was gonna win.  The next morning I'm going away to the john and I see Harris (laughter) in the hall and I said Harris who won the election?  Roosevelt.  So she (unclear) I said well I guess your family (laughter) gonna move out of the country.  Needless to say they didn't but that's the first time I heard somebody say that.  Oh, I heard that kind of feeling about, you know, shall we say the blue or the reds.
Story_ID: 253791
Speaker 1: Tell me about your academic experience at Smith [College, Northampton, Massachusetts] and your studies and your decision to major in sociology?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I like you went to the, when I went to Smith I took the distribution courses and I don't think I took sociology, the first year of sociology twenty-six but I got to at least get two languages and science and English, none of which particularly pleased me and I did particular well in them either, a serious student.  Didn't like 'em and didn't like the teachers.  Particularly didn't like the teacher of German, she was just a difficult woman.  But anyway, sophomore year I took to this Professor Hankins, Frank [Hamilton] Hankins.  He taught E. Franklin Frazier when he was at, when he was at Clark [University, Worcester, Massachusetts] before he came to Smith.  And Hankins was the curious sort of type.  He was a midwesterner.  And Smith was, was in those days for a white professor could, could retire from these good schools.  We were, everybody didn't have to be teaching in Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].  We had some very good professors who made their lives on these campuses.  And Hankins was one such person.  But he was sort of attracted to me, I guess because of Frazier also but because I was different and talked a lot.  So he influenced me to take, after I took his course in sociology, and the fear that I never knew anything about it before as a discipline, you see.  So then I began to take more sociology.  I took a course with Dorothy Fosdick, with Harry Emerson Fosdick daughter.  She was a young instructor, caring but not very considerate, but a good person and she in social institutions, I thought she was good.  Then my main professor was a woman named Gladys Bryceson [ph.] who had known, I can't think of this black woman's name who had died, Julia Derricott [ph.], would that be right?  Some woman of the, ahead of me who had been a friend of hers who had a very tragic death in the South.  And so Gladys Bryceson was, I think she was attracted to me for that reason and she taught the family.  And I liked her.  So I got very close to the department.
Story_ID: 253792
Speaker 1: I also was good in zoology.  And the professor of zoology was Professor Howard, Howard Madison Parshley.  And he--
Speaker 2: Can you spell his last name?
Speaker 1: P-A-R-S-H-L-E-Y.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He was the, no because ironically, I guess his field, major interest was genetics but I took that from him, but he translated Simone de Beauvoir 'The Second Sex' into English which showed the kind of breadth of his type of person he was.  And he was, matter of fact my first publication, which came because of the paper I wrote for him.  So I would say that I gradually began to move into my own field.  I do think however, that I did not take some other courses that I should have taken because I was very competitive and I again was thinking about graduate school.  I think in those days they didn't have, of course, you could take it for no credit, I would have liked to have taken a course in art for example which I didn't do or history of western civilization which I didn't do.  Those were big, highly competitive courses and you just had to, you know, buckle down and I didn't wanna buckle down for that.  So I got good grades and I graduated with honors [from Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts].  My dis- my honors paper won a prize.
Speaker 2: What was the paper on?  Can you remember?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  I forget the title of it but it was study of adolescence, black, class certification among adolescents in Washington [D.C.].
Story_ID: 253793
Speaker 1: But the time that [E. Franklin] Frazier was doing his, Dr. Frazier was doing his, one of his similar books, 'The Negro Youth at the Crossways' ['Negro Youth at the Crosswalks: Their Personality Development in the Middle States'], I believe he was doing that, part of series he was doing.  I was interviewed for one of the young people who was away at school, to broaden his sample.  And so the girl came to interview me, the people knew everybody, it wasn't a matter of having to look up, you knew who you might want for this or that thing.  So I was a junior, I guess at college and Betty Wallace [ph.] came to interview me and she did, like you're doing kind of here.  And the next day I got a call, next day or two later saying [HistoryMaker] Miss [Adelaide] Cromwell, in fact from Frazier, yes, Dr. Frazier, I want to meet the person who interviewed my interviewee better than she was interviewing.  So I came up and met him and that was the beginning of a long love affair.  From that day on we were very close and he never taught me in any formal sense but we were very close.  And I (unclear) to his classes and I guess we were just friends that all.  And then it became, oh, I know.  I was president of the sociology club at Smith [College, Northampton, Massachusetts] my senior year.  So because I knew that Frazier had been taught by Professor [Frank Hamilton] Hankins, we had Frazier come up to be our lecturer that year.
Speaker 2: Hankins taught Frazier where?
Speaker 1: At Clark [University, Worcester, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: At Clark.
Speaker 1: And at Worcester [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Oh, Worcester.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: See Frazier left Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and went to Clark and then to [University of] Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] where he got his Ph.D.
Speaker 2: So E. Franklin Frazier was a, a definite influence in your life (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, I would say so, yeah, um-hm.
Story_ID: 253794
Speaker 1: Any other extracurricular things you did at Smith [College, Northampton, Massachusetts] in addition to charity and sociology club, were there any other outside activities?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we had, and I used to (unclear) was on crew, not for a profession, I just took crew, I liked to paddle, and ice skate, boys.
Speaker 1: When you were at Smith did you ever come down to Boston [Massachusetts] to visit?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: On what occasion?
Speaker 2: Well I came down here, first of all I had a professor, Professor Denew [ph.] who taught a course which he called social maladjustment.  And I would take, I didn't think much of the professor but he, I admired him for organizing field trips for students from Smith to, to come down here and see institutions.  And that was not an easy thing to do.  So we came down and we saw all the, some settlement houses and the prisons while I was still in college.  That was one reason for coming here.  Then I had a classmate, I met at camp, Leah Malone [ph.] who was at Simmons [College, Boston, Massachusetts], I came down to visit her.  Then I knew Matt Brook [ph.], Matt Brook, Sr. [ph.] was my father's [John Wesley Cromwell, Jr.] friend, they went to, he was older than daddy but when I was at Smith they had, I met their children at [Camp] Atwater [North Brookfield, Massachusetts], Matt was a counselor, he kind of liked me, he's still alive so I should only say that he was a little dull.  But I came down for a weekend with them when I was still in college.  I guess that was all.  Didn't have much money to be running around there, you know.  And we didn't have cars.
Story_ID: 253795
Speaker 1: So what were you thinking about doing as you moved through your senior year at, at Smith [College, Northampton, Massachusetts]?  You're getting ready to graduate, what were you planning, what were you thinking about at that point?
Speaker 2: Graduate school.
Speaker 1: And so what happened?  Where did you go?
Speaker 2: And I applied to, two or three.  I, I didn't get in, I didn't get into Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], (unclear) but I didn't, certainly didn't get a scholarship.  I applied to Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and I got in and got a scholarship.  My aunt, second aunt, the one who taught math, had got her master's at Penn.  We had ties in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], so I happily went to Penn, and it was a great experience for me on two accounts.  First of all, my first official introduction to Africa academically.  I think I had taken the course where Africa came up (unclear) but I took special courses in Africa.  I met Kwame Nkrumah there, we were classmates and some other less well known Africans.  So from that side it was a very broadening and, and definitive.  The other side, now that I was out of college and in graduate school I could begin to have a good time.  And there was quite a active little group of, (laughter) black kids who were in college or graduate school and we had a good time that whole year.  So when I was sad, you know, I didn't do it every, not every night but every weekend 'cause I couldn't do that at Smith.  And there was a club we all used to go to and it was, it was, it, I still have--
Speaker 1: How long were you at the University of Pennsylvania?
Speaker 2: One year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got a master's [degree].  And I was, what I was seeing, well my, when I was, I was thinking about what I was gone do next.  I really didn't wanna get a Ph.D.  I, I didn't feel I'd do the work for it to tell you the truth.  But I wasn't motivated that much then so I thought of social work and I did, I didn't really want to be in one of those doctrinaire social work schools that, that have particular philosophy to mold you, you're either Freudian or Ronkin [ph.] or whatever.  Within my class at Penn was a young woman who commuted through this history course because it taught by, by Heinz Wieschoff who died with Don Homeshell [ph.].  And she talking and she said well why don't you come to Bryn Mawr [College, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania]?  They have a school of social work and it's not in doctrinaire.  I had never heard of it.  So I went up to Bryn Mawr and was interviewed and they had never had any blacks but they got themselves together and had a, one or two Haitians and I went up there as a graduate student and it was a good experience.
Story_ID: 253796
Speaker 1: Then I married and came to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], came to Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: So you were married in what year?
Speaker 1: Forty-three [1943].
Speaker 2: And who did you marry?
Speaker 1: Let's see if I can remember his name (laughter) for thirty years I was married to Henry A. Hill.
Speaker 2: Henry A. Hill.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, Henry Aaron Hill.  He was a chemist.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Ph.D. from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Ah.  And how did you meet him?  Where did you meet him?
Speaker 1: Blind date.  He was, he was sharing an apartment with a classmate of mine from [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School, Washington, D.C.] named Samuel [Z.] Westerfield who was up here getting a Ph.D. in economics at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and he liked Henry and thought we'd get along and we did, we were very compatible, certain points.  He invited me up for a weekend and I came and met him and the rest is history.
Story_ID: 253797
Speaker 1: Tell me about your Bryn Mawr [College, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania] experience.  You were there a year or two years?
Speaker 2: I was a student two years but I was, I, the first year I stayed on campus at Radnor Hall and then I went to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] because they give you a field placement, you see, so, it was good.  I was president of the sociology club there too.  They hadn't, it wasn't they hadn't had any blacks but it wasn't that there were necessarily prejudice.  Although they were prejudice about staying in the dormitories.  I found the, and I can't think of this child's name (unclear) as well as I know her [Linda] Perkins.  Anyway she's a scholar and she'd been doing work on black women's colleges in their general particle.  Linda Perkins I don't believe (unclear) but Linda Perkins.  And she came across a letter in the archives at Radcliffe [College, Cambridge, Massachusetts] when the dean had written the president saying that, asking really for a policy that he says, you know, we've had this one Negro girl, [HistoryMaker] Adelaide Cromwell, who came from Smith [College, Northampton, Massachusetts] and she was their Rhodes, Rosewell Fellow [ph.] and she stayed in the dormitories and she got along very well, says the lady.  She said one of her best friends was southern, (unclear).  I had two roommates Charlene Burse [ph.] and Renate Southers [ph.].  And Renate had another, and she's finished, she's now living in Philadelphia.  And we have another student coming and so anyways what's shall we do (laughter).  So, I (unclear) [Ellen] Irene Diggs was the woman who came later who was the assistant to Dr. [W.E.B.] DuBois and she didn't, she ended up not coming at all.  So I don't know who followed me but at that time there had not been any blacks in the dormitories at Radcliffe anywhere, so when I started it was Radnor Hall then afterwards they, they had blacks in Bryn Mawr but you couldn't stay on the campus, couldn't stay in the dorms.  But again no school can be arrogant about that because you can always find out when they broke their barrier down, but there was a barrier at all these women's schools at some time.

Speaker 1: So but I enjoyed Bryn Mawr [College, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania], it's just that we were, three or four of us were friends and I went back and forth to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  See I was, and I had a couple of good field placements and the, oh, yes, this is the funniest story I can give about Bryn Mawr.  They had to place you and, of course, you, your supervisor would tell you where you were gone be placed and I was placed in the public welfare department, so were some other Bryn Mawr girls, I didn't mind that.  But I was placed under a black man who I think was threatened by the fact that I hadn't, I had a bit of education, I guess more than he did for that time, and then I was not a shy person and I knew Philadelphia pretty well.  And he was getting on my nerves a little bit and I was gonna have to have a head to with him.  Well now a big political brouhaha broke out in the public welfare department.  Bryn Mawr took out all of its students and the time came to replace them.  Now, the supervisor Miss Birmingham [ph.] by name, had to replace me, see she had gotten me placed in there and the black man (unclear).  Well, [HistoryMaker] Miss [Adelaide] Cromwell, you'll have to have, 'cause we have to have another pace, placement, we've got one place for you.  Where is it Miss Birmingham?  It's at the House of the Holy Child [Children's Services, Inc., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and that was a very good adoption agency.  The woman who was the head of it probably the best place where the, in the adoption area in Philadelphia.  She was black, most of the children were black.  I said I don't wanna go there.  You don't?  No, I don't like children (laughter) she said, I don't want to work with children.  Well Miss, she's all upset now because one the one thing, it was (unclear), it was two, I lost by that, I would have been better informed had I gone there.  But she, and then she had faced me with it, but she was just so happy about the racial (unclear).  Well, Miss Cromwell, where would you like to go?  Oh, I said, well I don't know maybe Family Society [ph.], a very racist organization, or the [American] Red Cross, equally racist.  Well we'll let you know, Miss Cromwell.  And sure enough she came back and I had a very successful placement with the Red Cross, very successful.  And in those days it was for separating the blood.  But I, the woman, people weren't as well-trained as they would have been at that House of Holy Child, and I knew it.  But since she would not level with me, so we never discussed it, it never came up that it was a racial thing.  That was the only thing I could tell you about Bryn Mawr that was worth remembering.
Story_ID: 253799
Speaker 1: What happened next after Bryn Mawr [College, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: I thought I told you I came to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], I came to Boston [Massachusetts], married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And well I, I, I took, let me see, no, before I married, my last year I was working, had a, did I get a paid job?  I was working at the reformatory, staples [ph.], State Reform School for Girls [ph.].  I had a placement there and then they employed me, it was a casework agency.  Meanwhile I was invited, my, my career gets very complicated during this time 'cause I was doing several things at the same time.  I was invited to come to Englewood, New Jersey to be the executive of their small Englewood Urban League by a very good friend of mine who lived in Englewood, he and his wife, and I took it.  Gave up the state reform and went to Englewood.  And I had just sort of started there when [E. Franklin] Frazier recommended that I teach at Hunter [College, New York, New York].  Hunter was getting ready to, all these schools just like now, they were trying around to look for a black person who could stand up and talk English.  So they had the nerve to ask him to come and give a elementary, well not elementary but a, sort of a, a, ancillary course in (unclear) him, Frazier.  So rather than turn it down completely, he said, no he couldn't do it but he'd like to recommend somebody, so he recommended me, so then they wrote me.  I went up and did it while I was doing the Urban League work, I'd given up Philadelphia, no, I get confused 'cause I was at Hunter while I was coming up from Philadelphia but any, these things were all going on at the same time within a period of a couple of years.  And I, reason why I went, now that it was a law, oh they played up like I'd just been made a first Rhodes Scholar.  But it was the result of political activism on the part of the black students, and I wanted to help them since they had got the school to, to say they wanted a, could have a black professor or instructor, I went and took it.  And then I did that and Englewood and then I met, met Henry [Aaron Hill] and we married.  And I was, it was gonna be, (laughter), I was gonna be doing Englewood and Hunter and being married but I knew that wouldn't work out so well.  So what I did was I told the people at Hunter that I'd enjoyed being there for two years but that I had a master's [degree] from Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and also this social work and I thought that I, if they were taking me seriously I should be given a regular appointment.  If they did, I would, if they didn't I would have to leave.  I was gambling on the fact that they wouldn't because (laughter) if they had said yes, I'd have to stay at least for one year just to, but they didn't so I left Hunter and came up to my, to Englewood completely and then married Henry and came Boston.  And I don't know, I, I, was (unclear) I wasn't crazy about going to a graduate school but it was nothing more exciting to do, and Henry was busy with his work.  So I decided well why not?  So I went over to apply at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and was accepted.
Speaker 1: At Radcliffe [College, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Well you did both you had to do, it was little mixed up thing, you see.  Because yeah, you took your, in those days you were accepted in Harvard and took the exam with Radcliffe or vice versa it was very confusing.  And when I got to be appointed a teaching fellow, I was teaching fellow at Harvard not at Radcliffe.
Story_ID: 253800
Speaker 1: Okay, just for the timeline, what year did you start your graduate Ph.D. work at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: I would say '43 [1943], '44 [1944].
Speaker 1: And how long were you in that program?  How long did it take you to complete?
Speaker 2: Well, I started it and then I took a year off, went to Smith [College, Northampton, Massachusetts] and taught two years at Smith, and it was deciding whether or not I was gonna come back and 'cause I got a teaching fellowship so I came back.  They wanted me, because while I was having taught at Hunter [College, New York, New York] and having started my graduate work, Mrs. Bryceson [ph.] and [Frank Hamilton] Hankins were at Smith and they knew I was, hadn't been out more than a couple of years so they thought it would be nice to bring me back and they were instrumental in bringing me to Smith.
Speaker 1: What was the Radcliffe [College, Cambridge, Massachusetts] experience or Harvard experience like as a Ph.D. student?  How do you remember those years?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Excuse me ma'am, I'm sorry before we do the answer, I need you stop touching the mic against the jewelry.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  It makes a noise.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  That's okay, no problem.
Speaker 2: You should have told me before, um-hm. Well, you see, you must remember, Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden], by that time I was married and was, hadn't had a lot of experience, you know, academically, you know, at other institutions, and Henry [Aaron Hill] was a graduate student, well Henry had finished his degree, that's right.  So I was, I don't know how to describe, but I, I took the courses I was supposed to take.  I associated with other teaching fellows.  I was very close to Talcott Parsons.  Why I don't know because I never understood what he was talking about most of the time but I was his teaching fellow.  And then also I was telling him the other day, I was teaching fellow for Oscar Handlin.  And I had said to Oscar, do you remember when we met?  And he said, yes, (unclear) (laughter) because they were just beginning to make it social relations instead of just, so they were bringing in history and they didn't really look very happily at that, you know.  But so he came over, he always has been kind of (unclear) person and but I just said, well this is your community (laughter) teaching fellow I guess (unclear).  Oscar probably said what this is madam, but we got along very well, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Your thesis work at--
Speaker 2: Harvard.
Speaker 1: Harvard.
Speaker 2: Was under Parsons.
Speaker 1: No what the, the title of your topic, your research was on?
Speaker 2: Oh, what was my research on?  It was when I did the, the, I forget what I called it but it was the, it was the Boston Brahmin ['The Other Brahmins: Boston's Black Upper Class 1750-1950,' Adelaide M. Cromwell] was the outgrowth of that, the book was an outgrowth of that thesis.  I forgot the title of it, you know.  Boston upper class, Boston black upper class history, their history and--history and present social development or present social structure.  That's what it was.
Story_ID: 253801
Speaker 1: So you went to Smith [College, Northampton, Massachusetts] to teach two years and then came back and finished your Ph.D. work [at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: (Nodding).
Speaker 1: What was that teaching experience like at Smith?  How do you remember it?
Speaker 2: Oh, great.  I'll have to show you--I had a great experience there.  They didn't want me to leave, the students gave a big surprise party for me.  'Cause I was commuting you see I was, I kept it, I, it was, they were my own friends and my faculty.  I did it when I was young, it was still teaching but my, many of my professors were still teaching there.  And my very close friend, still is a close friend of mine, Laura Borman [ph.] by name.  We were close by accident because her name began with B and mine began with C, you know, they sat us in French behind (unclear).  And we, she majored in history.  She came back to teach same time I did, so we became very close friends and remain so.  She's living in Wisconsin, Indiana.  Became quite a, well she was vice president of Chicago [Illinois] when she retired, I guess.  But I would say my experiences were very good.  I would have stayed.  I was trying to decide whether I wanted to finish up and then Henry [Aaron Hill] was deciding whether he was gonna stay in, considering his business here.  He had a offer to come to, I think, Monsanto [St. Louis, Missouri] then but we decided to stay in the Boston [Massachusetts] area and so I gave up Smith.
Story_ID: 253802
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-one [1951] you were appointed as an instructor at Boston University [(BU), Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: I guess so, that, did I say that, yeah.
Speaker 1: How did that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) how did that happen?
Speaker 1: --opportunity come?  How did that happen?
Speaker 2: Well that happened (unclear).  I wanna get this (unclear) I was, the professor at Boston University at that time was a man named Anthony Morris [sic. Albert Morris] who was head of the sociology department but he never knew he need to have a master's [degree], he didn't have a Ph.D. and I was finishing up my Ph.D. and I had this social work trade and I was thinking in those days of trying to get a job that would draw on both of the backgrounds.  Well I went to see Anthony Morris, Mr. Morris, it may not have been Anthony, Anthony wasn't, but his last name was Morris, and he didn't, he didn't bite, he didn't think there was (unclear) job, thought I should have a job in one of the settlement houses but at that time I was on the board of a settlement house, I wasn't gonna be working for them.  So somebody wrote, talked to [Talcott] Parsons (unclear) do you, he said, remember Dean McKeckter [ph.] (unclear) was his name, McKeckter [ph.] brought me to BU because he was running the program at Sargent [School of Physical Training] in Cambridge [Massachusetts] and he wrote, talked to Parsons and asked him if he had somebody who would teach sociology at, at Sargent, which was part of BU and Parsons recommended me, so I started there.  And then I taught there a couple of years and, and I said Morris, how did I get this straight sociology maybe, and he, I guess they just brought me over to sociology.  But then as a matter of fact, this same Morris who didn't see that I was adequate to do his elementary level took a sabbatical and turned his courses over to me later.  He was a criminologist and I'd done some work when I studied with a group at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and done some work in the field, entering the prison, so he was happy to find me.
Speaker 1: So you moved from Sargent College then into--
Speaker 2: It--
Speaker 1: --the College of Liberal Arts [College of Arts & Sciences]?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  And I was there, things get so, when I was at Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] I took African studies as I told you, and a white friend named Lyn Watson who was teaching at BU and I didn't know that he was teaching at BU because, because we had been apart.  And I went to a meeting of the Eastern Sociological Society in Worcester [Massachusetts] and Lyn was there.  "What are you doing here," he says.  I said, "Well I'm teaching at BU."  "Well so am I."  He said, "We thought about starting an African studies program, would you be interested?"  So I said yes.  'Cause that program, contrary to a lot of the others, started from the bottom up, because it wasn't the big boys really, (unclear), these were (unclear) people.  So I, I was therefore, I was at BU, and it was (unclear) with intro to Africa.  And starting with, and so we had a committee and we hired Bill Brown [William O. Brown], I was on the committee.  And then Bill Brown hired me as his administrative assistant, so I stopped teaching for a while and was just doing administration (unclear).
Speaker 1: Right.  You, you became the first administrator and research associate right for (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was, I, well, I wasn't the first director, see this Bill Brown was the director [of the African Studies Center, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts].  I was hired as his administrative assistant and I guess I was, we didn't, we didn't have a category research associate then but when it came on I was one.  But I was sort of a well, I did a jack of all trades, I guess.  Bill was a kind of (unclear), he was a good friend of [E. Franklin] Frazier's too, he was a (unclear) white southerner.  And he liked me but he was a little frightened of me too and he should well have been (laughter) because he would sort of so, so quiet and shy and I was always saying Bill go do this, Bill go do that.  But he kept me on and I enjoyed the opportunity of being able to help him to plan his outreach.  Many Africans came through BU at that time.  And then, I've forgotten what I said, I wanted to go back into teaching but I went back into teaching for straight sociology and then sociology that dealt with Africa.
Story_ID: 253803
Speaker 1: But all the time you were teaching you were still associated with the African studies program?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I was with them until the '60s [1960s] when this guy named, I guess, I think he just died, (unclear) he died now, Bob Austin [ph.], did you ever know Bob Austin.  He was a student at BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts].  And he was a student in my class, no he wasn't in my class but he came to me as an instructor because he felt that the teachers he had well, well the students he had, were racist in the way they were treating some of the material.  Maybe on the family (unclear) whatever it was, I was given the same course with (unclear), he wasn't in my class.  So he told me all this he said I've talked to, around to everybody and, and nobody seems to be interested in doing anything about Afro-American.  So I said well, I, I don't have any, I didn't know there were any problems.  Oh, yes he said.  And then I went to dean, dean, I think it was, dean, he's in psychology, however, I went to him and told him this student had come to me and said he was upset about the way the courses were given.  This was an auspicious time because the foundations were beginning to get interested.  So he let me, we had a questionnaire of BU and to find out what faculty were doing and most of them weren't doing anything, and they said they didn't because they didn't know anything.  But one Clara Mayo was in psych [psychology] and was the only one who said she was interested and she wanted to do more.  So we designed a graduate program, 'cause just, 'cause see, because we patterned it after the African, it was, I also was, like I just told you earlier, committee on that so we patterned the Afro-American and the graduate program and we recruited people.  I, I was director of that, founder and director of that.
Story_ID: 253804
Speaker 1: There were some things I think that happened in the early '60s [1960s] that you were very instrumental in convening a West African social workers--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --thing in Ghana?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Could you tell us something about that?
Speaker 2: Well as I told you I was always interested in social work.  And when I, I, I taught at University of Ghana [Accra, Ghana] for a term, St. Clair Drake recruited me and he was interested in my interests in the fact that social work had not emerged as a profession, it was just another civil service job.  That was the one line I had.  Then this girl that I told you was in my class and she must have been an old student or I was young teacher, had married a Ghanaian and she was in Ghana and she was working for the social welfare department.  So with her interests and mine and St. Clair Drake's, we decide that we would have a conference in West Africa to talk about the possibilities of making a real profession out of this activity.  So we got money from, from Ford [Foundation, New York, New York], I think, I've forgotten, and had this conference, had (unclear) people there from Nigeria, from Liberia, Ghana, I have the book upstairs that Drake wrote on it.  I don't, maybe somebody from Senegal, I'm not sure but that's what that was.
Speaker 1: And what was the outcome or the outcomes of that?
Speaker 2: Well we can say we had this one book that came out, that I think, Peter O'Mallory [ph.] wrote, actually wrote that book.  It, I don't know how much really came out of it, (unclear) we got to know each other social, you see, most of the non, other, the best jobs you would get would be government jobs.  The people who worked for the, what we would call the voluntary agencies, Aid to the Blind [ph.], and they were lesser jobs, and they worked but the, it was a, it, it would require more work than I had to give to it.  I think it served its purpose but it didn't, well let me see, 'cause I, (unclear) on that, I guess, I was (unclear) I guess they kept it as a part of the curriculum at the University of Ghana at Legon [Accra, Ghana], that's about all I can say about it.  But it was a meeting of people who were talking about social work problems down the line.  I wrote one of the articles and there were other articles that were published.
Story_ID: 253805
Speaker 1: Another African activity that you were involved with was the assessment of higher education.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us when that happened and what that was about?
Speaker 2: Well in my best, I have to look at my own dates to see what it was.  But I was still teaching African studies, now how did I get, oh, I think this was a, I'm almost sure this was a, was an outgrowth of the Methodist church interested in this problem.  It wasn't governmental, and it wasn't academic in a strict sense but they appointed this commission and Harold [C.] Case of BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] suggested that I be put on it, and that's how I got to be on it.  It was, we went to, to evaluate, see the [Democratic Republic of the] Congo [DRC] was just sort of becoming of age, and it hasn't come of age yet really, but with the strong influence of the Catholic church, the Methodist church you see but I didn't see, I didn't see any papers to prove this but I would assume the Methodist church was trying to establish itself as a force in higher education and you had three or four universities there starting.  And so they wanted to see which ones should be supported and where they could put their emphasis.  So we were commissioned to visit all of them, three or four at least.  And we had a report and I don't know what happened from that either to tell you the truth.  But I, I have, I found it an interesting experience.  I, I was, I had never, I've been to the Congo twice, I was trying to establish when I first went to (unclear) whether it was before or after that.  The, the Belgians had a very pragmatic way of being colonial in a sense as opposed to the French and the British and you saw it very well in the Congo.  They had gave a large number of people a very low but equal education, except those that they exploited as workers, but I mean you could get a good elementary education in the Belgian system but there wasn't gonna be any help in going to, to Lisala [Democratic Republic of the Congo] or anything like that, unless you went through the church, and if you wanted to be a priest there was a small window of opportunity there.  So to, and they, and they provided good education at that low level.  So that was very interesting for me to see because I knew the British and a little bit about the French but I didn't know how the Belgians were.  And, of course, there are still, they are still dealing with that inadequate background.  Few people who really got a first class education on the Belgians, and they're still, maybe 'cause the school was going along but then, of course, all the political business had broken out.  But if they had picked up what I guess we had said there, and if all of the Methodists we had, had made a stronger presence and maybe, maybe they would have been able to get a larger tier of intellectuals.  But I just went to a memorial service last week for the first, I think he was the first liberal arts graduate and scholar from the Congo and he was in his seventies, Thomas Canada [ph.] by name.  And you see the British had two or three generations, the French too, certainly in West Africa.
Story_ID: 253806
Speaker 1: You had another activity in Africa in 1983 where I believe you convened a conference at the University of Liberia [Monrovia, Liberia]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --for African American scholars?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well I always had a sort of a fondness for Liberia as a, as an environment.  And felt that it was overlooked as people because we treat it like a stepchild, where the British with all their other problems and the French did give visibility and opportunity to their colonies, in West Africa I'm talking about.  So to me this was gonna be an opportunity to, to upgrade the visibility of Liberia by making it a sight for the meeting of scholars from that area.  And there were people there, you know, who, who welcomed this.  The president of the University of Liberia was a good friend of mine, she just died last year.  She had been wanting to do these things.  I met her when I was in Radcliffe [College, Cambridge, Massachusetts], she wasn't (unclear) with me but she was with her contemporaries.  So with her background and a few others, I made the case for the fact that we should have a higher academic presence in Liberia and it was my hope that we really would build on that.  Now we had Cuttington College [Suacoco, Liberia] there which is (unclear) run by the Episcopal church and the University of Liberia.  But they needed so much support but I carried the ball and took the, the idea to the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] and we published a book on it, talking about these problems they all shared but that I wanted Liberia to be the site of it to be the focus and it was my hope that it would continue.  Of course, it didn't, I mean the university went through all kinds of things, I don't know if it's still going on or not, I guess something's going on there but and we published a report.  The only thing I say that about, the people who came to that conference were some of the most distinguished Africanists of the time from America and there.
Speaker 1: Can you give us some names of some (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, Alex Skinner [sic. Neil Skinner] for one.  Hershel Charlotte [ph.] for another.  Ruth Hamilton Simms [sic. Ruth Simms Hamilton] for another.  They were very well known as Africanists.  (Unclear) that I had the money to bring them there, of course.  Joe Harris from Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  But (unclear) reason that the, the, they just, when we published this report ['Dynamics of the African / Afro-American Connection: From Dependency to Self-Reliance,' ed. Adelaide M. Cromwell], oh, I know what I was gonna say.  When I (laughter) got ready to submit the report to the foundation as a book, I had to have Doe [ph.], who was the president then, this awful man but he was president after all.  He had to write a small statement and I couldn't ignore him but other than that it's an interesting book, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was John Henrik Clarke a part of this--
Speaker 2: Yes, he was there.
Speaker 1: He was there.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, Um-hm, yeah.
Story_ID: 253807
Speaker 1: In addition to your pioneering work in the development of the African studies program and the conferences that you convened in Africa, you were the first as you said earlier, the first director of the Afro-American studies program at Boston University [(BU), Boston, Massachusetts], graduate program.  Were you the sole African-American, black, professor who was involved in all these things at BU?  I mean you seem to be out--
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I think so.  I brought Jim Teal [ph.] there and I was now in, I, I mean, I was appointed to African studies, I had created Afro-American studies, (unclear) see different.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I brought Jim Teal and actually he was the only black faculty to use to the Joe Boskin [Joseph Boskin], you know, Joe Boskin?
Speaker 1: I remember him.
Speaker 2: Well he was white, and, and Clara Mayo was white, and then I guess after Joe Boskin after the, Roy Glasgow you met, you knew Roy?  He may have been the next one.  But these people came under my umbrella, there weren't any people to recruit, it would have been nice if we recruit the English department, nobody there, defer to the history department, nobody there.  And, but I was able to bring some in, not as many as I would have liked to have brought in.  And then, of course, it was important to have somebody like Clara who was already committed to the field.  I wasn't against having white faculty but it would have been nice if I'd a group to draw on at BU but I didn't.
Story_ID: 253808
Speaker 1: I remember in the early '70s [1970s] you provided two of your graduate students in the Afro-American studies program--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: To work with my METCO [Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity, Boston, Massachusetts] students.
Speaker 2: Did I?  Yeah, I, um-hm.
Speaker 1: One of who is now a judge, Leslie [E.] Harris.
Speaker 2: Oh, I know Leslie (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well he was, he was one of the students.
Speaker 2: He was one of those, yeah.  I taught him with my son (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But the reason that I'm saying this is, I'm sure that you mentored them and brought into the graduate program--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --a number of black--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --men and women--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --into Afro studies.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tell us about some that are now out there as professors and doing, I'm sure you must have mentored and influenced a number of--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --our scholars who came along?
Speaker 2: Well, Leslie, of course, is a favorite of mine.  What's his name?  It was fellow out in California who's a, who's a very successful TV person.  He really was joint programs, you know, Afro-American studies and communications, Afro-American studies and social work.  And some of the people took that other part and went and ran with it, you know, became in communications this man I'm talking about now, I don't know, I get Christmas cards from him, very handsome man, he's got two lovely children, I can't think of his name.  And people have done well in social work.  Another person locally, you know, Claire Watkins Andrade [sic. Claire Andrade Watkins] who's at Emerson [College, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: She was one of our students.  Let me see who else?  I just named her, Wendy [D.] Puriefoy is a big to do in, in the, in the educational foundation world, she's another student.  Charles Terrell, who's in medical history, no, medical, medical administration, he was at BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] now he's in New York [New York].  Let me see who else, social work.  I, I have to (unclear), I'm drawing a blank on, Andre Herron [ph.], went on into law school.  Actually the fact that you asked me this question makes me bring up what I've been annoyed with, with Afro-American studies as of now.  When I left, I left a file of students by years, as a matter of fact, I put out a couple of newsletters.  And I have felt that, not for me, but for the credibility of what we did, that they should follow up because we're not sold that I'm, having started dying yet for God's sake, they're still operating in various fields.  And then an effort should have been made to keep up with these people.  And I have been, I, I, actually maybe next year, if I live (unclear) I don't have the, I'm will take that file out myself because soon as I saw it, Sandy Middle--you know, Sandy Middlebrooks here in Boston [Massachusetts]?  He was one of our students and he went off into (laughter) unclear.  And I, I guess there was another guy out in Indianapolis, Indiana, who writes me all the time he's a professor out there.  It, it, I see, they only stayed one year and unless you kept up with them so that you could lose them.  Herb Hunter [ph.], I guess Herb was a, Herb Hunter was a student in sociology of mine, he wasn't in the program but he teaches at Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania].  I think that's a part of our history, well listen, we don't want to forget our history and I think this is an important part of history program but I haven't done it.  I left it to be heard, to be done, and nobody who's followed me, has either the inclination or the time to do it.
Speaker 1: Well that's why I asked you the question 'cause I know there are people out there and several you have mentioned that I know--
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: --who had this year's experience--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --in Afro-American--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --then went on and used that as a foundation--
Speaker 2: That right.
Speaker 1: --for many other things--
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: --that they want to do--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --and I think that's very important.
Speaker 2: And there are a lot of them--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --there really are.  And this guy particularly, well I don't think particularly, but, you know, he's a, a major commentator on either Channel 4 or 5 in California.  And, you know, if they, every so often they'll write me or tell me, what, or I hear it, but I would like to see it, you know, black and white and so if they pick up with what I did, Leslie [ph.], we were laughing the other day because one guy O. C. Sydney [ph.], I hope you didn't know him, he was one of our (laughter) failures.  He came up from Richmond [Virginia], I think he was a con man from beginning to end, and he got caught on drugs.  But Leslie and I were laughing about it because I asked him who else was in his class, he said that his was a large class.  We were talking about it just last week because we speak, he spoke at BU and did a good, good job to on his work.  So after we were talking about the various students and what they did in his class and we both got to O.C. Sydney and I was like (making a sound), I think he did die poor dear, but he was, he was really, of all the students that I had, I, I think he was almost the only failure.  They seed, succeeded in various degrees but I would say he was a waste of money and a failure, and he came there that way and he--wasn't time enough to shape him, I don't know if he ever could be shaped, you know.

Speaker 1: Can I backtrack on the beginning of the African studies program?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I understand there were early discussions around what would be included in Africa--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --or what was not in Africa i.e. specifically Egypt--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and there was some, could you share or recall those discussions?
Speaker 2: Oh, (laughter) with some degree.  Dan McCall had a terrible temper as an introduction to what I'm gonna say.  And he--
Speaker 1: And Dan McCall was who just for the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Dan McCall was, was a professor of anthropology.  He was the first, I guess Bill [William O. Brown] hired me first as a administrator but he was the first out and out academic he hired to the program.  And he was a purist as in (unclear), you know, anthropologist, that Africa is a continent you see what its boundaries are and that standard right there.  Then he hired Mark Karp who was an economist that makes it difficult to begin with, being an economist.  Mark had a peculiar background, a very interesting man, very pugnacious, very determined, always fussing, very, and he came out of the state department [U.S. Department of State].  He went to Tufts [University, Medford, Massachusetts] and then he, he grew up in Beirut [Lebanon] or some place in Europe and he came through, people were (unclear), he had a very interesting life, diamond collared link, met Bill when he was in the state department, Bill had worked there.  So Bill hired him as an economist.  So far as Mark was concerned, Africa was, sub-Saharan Africa because the state, the state department took the Mediterranean that was the Middle East or whatever, it wasn't Africa.  And at one point I think there were just the three of us, me and Mark and Dan, there may have been Elizabeth Colson.  Anyway Dan just got furious at Mark one day.  I don't (unclear) just something violent because of Mark's insisting that that was not Africa as he saw it.  Well he meant in terms of documentation.  You see Bill was, we were trying to build a modern program, we weren't interested in, in Africa of anthropologists, we were in modern Africa.  And Bill Brown was trying to make up a collection of material based on government documentation, all those, and we had, had, well we still have I hope so, the best library archives on government documentation, people hadn't bothered to collect those records.  So Mark saw those from one point of view, Dan saw them as something else.  Dan thought it all belonged together.  Mark said this, the way state department were to cut it down, it would be so, so, so, so.  I didn't know we had a lot of what we had and how we had them, and I was kind of caught in the middle because I was working with the library trying to file things, where are you gonna file this piece, material.  Well I think we finally decided Africa was, it was a continent.  But Mark went to, no he, he, he went to Israel and he divided his time between Africa and Israel and I believe U, BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] in Israel and he died of a heart attack.  But we were, we would get along together and people would say how do you get along with Mark?  Well because I talk only about his mother-in-law and his synagogue, that's all.  Once you got into public policy you'd be like that.
Story_ID: 253810
Speaker 1: You have been very a prolific researcher and you've authored a number of books.
Speaker 2: Well I wouldn't say a number of books.
Speaker 1: One of the earlier books that, that I recall that you did was a biography of Adelaide Smith Casely Hayford.
Speaker 2: Casely Hayford.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I think there was even a title before that.
Speaker 2: 'African Victorian Feminists' ['An African Victorian Feminist: The Life and Times of Adelaide Smith Casely Hayford 1868-1960,' Adelaide M. Cromwell].
Speaker 1: Would you tell us a little--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --bit about that book?  Was she related to you?
Speaker 2: No, no relation at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was, I, but how I met her well, oh, (unclear) one of our early students in African studies was a man named Arthur Porter, a very interesting, Sierra Leonean.  And we became very close, he got his Ph.D. with us in history.  And when I was teaching in Ghana, he had gone back to Freetown [Sierra Leone] and I think he was president of the university at that time, and he, at Fourah Bay [College, Freetown, Sierra Leone].  And he asked me to come up and visit him.  So I went up to visit him and he took me to see this Auntie Addie [Adelaide Smith Casely Hayford] and she was lying on the couch, she was, I guess, the late eighties.  Very interesting looking white haired lady and very articulate and she'd been to the [United] States a couple of times.  Well, of course, he took me to see her, one because she'd been to the states and two because her name was Adelaide.  I had no further knowledge about who she was.  And then I was impressed by her.  I didn't even know how important Casely Hayford was her husband [Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford], her, well they were married but not happily.  He was a very important West African nationalist and a correspondent with my grandfather [John Wesley Cromwell, Sr.], I didn't know any of that then.  I left Freetown and went back to Ghana.  And one day I was in the library thumbing through some material and I picked up a Journal of West Africa[n History] I think it was called then, and she had written a series of articles on her background, on her life, about three or four.  And it was wonderful because I don't know that she could have remembered it at the time that I met her if I had done it by virtue of an interview, but having that as a background what she had done several years before I began to deal with her life.  I originally, because I had met several women who fit her general oh, category that is they were women I set on the cutting edge of change in Africa, who were born under colonization but had functioned as these countries became independent.  And I was gonna do a sort of a, a compilation of four or five of them whom I knew, but when I met her and saw how much she had, the rest of it just lost and so that I started on her life.  And it was been, it was most rewarding because she had a unusual life.  She was one of these large African Creole families, educated in Germany and in England, and married rather late for an African in her thirties.  Casely Hayford as I said was her (unclear) from Casely Hayford was one of the outstanding West Africa nationalists.  They met in London [England] and married, had one child [Gladys Casely Hayford].  She went back to Ghana with him, she couldn't dig Ghana, Ghana was just a generation behind her coming from (unclear), so that she went back to Freetown and she started this school.  And she came to this country, well, I've skipped some other part of her life but I mean, her as an educator is what interested me.  She came to this country to learn and to, and to raise money.  Came to Boston [Massachusetts], came to make, met, met Nannie [Helen] Burroughs, and various and sundry people--.
Story_ID: 253811
Speaker 1: That was one thing that interested me about her interest in education but another thing that interested me about her was the fact that even though she was African, a generation older, she was having the same problems women were having today.  She had a husband [Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford] who was a professional, didn't really quite jive with her or at least she didn't jive with him.  She had problems with her daughter who was very talented.  Gladys [Casely Hayford] by name, very different from her mother.  And that (unclear) me, so as I got into it, I found the universal aspect of her life, it wasn't a parochial story.  It was a much broader story than I had, than I had anticipated.  Now I don't know the other women who I had tentatively identified would have been quite as, as broadly gaged as Mrs. [Adelaide Smith] Casely Hayford was.  But she was quite a person.  And at, she was torn between being the product of, of British education and wanting to be an Africanists.  When she traveled here, she always wore a kente, have her, and but she wouldn't have worn it before but she thought it was important to assert that.  I know when I talked with her that time she said to me, wanted to know why I was in Africa, why I was in Freetown [Sierra Leone].  So I told her and she said, don't stay darling, don't stay here, and I thought that she said that then (laughter) if she had lived to see what had happened since then, she would have been a very, very broken woman.
Story_ID: 253812
Speaker 1: So, as you look at that book ['An African Victorian Feminist: The Life and Times of Adelaide Smith Casely Hayford 1868-1960,' Adelaide M. Cromwell] today it's done, it's been out, how do you feel about it?  I mean, what is your--
Speaker 2: Oh, I think it, it's interesting you should ask me that because Howard University Press [Washington, D.C.]  published it the second time.  It was published by Frank Cass [Publishers] first, a British publisher.  And I, now I've got (unclear) with anybody publishing requires money for distribution.  They liked the story, I mean it, when I gave it to them, there were people they knew understood the kind of Africa from which she came.  But Doubleday [Knopf Doubleday] or what they wouldn't have known what, anything about this woman.  So they took it on but they didn't give it the push that it should have had.  So I took it, I paid money to get it from them.  I then couldn't decide what to do with it.  Well, some of my friends said you should give it to the Feminist Press [New York, New York] and perhaps I should have.  But I said no, I wanna give it to Howard because Howard's press was trying to get on its feet.  So I gave it to the Howard University Press, they did a good job in paperback, they did.  But when it comes again to distribution, this very summer I was at a party hosted by the inimitable Skip Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.], and a young man came up to me, introduced, he said, oh I've used your book but I can't get it anymore, I can't find it.  I use it in my courses, it's an excellent book, he teaches at Columbia [University, New York, New York], I forget his name now.  So I called Howard, I said well, that's too bad.  And I was (unclear) because I think it's a good teaching book myself.  A lot of the teachers haven't used it.  He said, I called Howard 'cause they're doing some reorganization and she assured me, that the book was gonna come out and what they were gonna do a series of their key books.  So to answer your question, it may be in a batch.  I said well he said he couldn't get it.  Oh, no, no.  Is he talking about the earlier version?  I said, no, he's talking about that version.  Now whether they have actually put it on the market yet with the series, I don't know but it shouldn't be lost, it can't be lost because it was her life and her life was that unusual.
Story_ID: 253813
Speaker 1: Let's talk about some of your other writings, books, special publications, which one of the others is your favorite and that you have the most feeling for?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think that one is, what I just--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) got through, oh yes.  Because I think that's a, I mean I like biography, an autobiography anyway.  And that it was, she was such an, I don't know that everybody I would have done, as I just said a moment ago, would have appealed to me the same.  I liked the 'Boston Brahmins' ['The Other Brahmins: Boston's Black Upper Class 1750-1950,' Adelaide M. Cromwell], I think that that again is a book that was pioneering and if it hadn't been done then at that time, people I taught wouldn't be here.  They didn't leave any papers.  And it was a picture of Boston [Massachusetts] that I think we would need to keep, people should build on.  See nobody can build on Mrs. [Adelaide Smith] Casely Hayford, I did that.  Nobody can take it, (unclear) door open but that's, I don't think I left anything out.  But I, the 'Boston Brahmins,' is just a start (unclear).
Speaker 1: The 'Boston Brahmins' deals with Boston's black upper class.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: What was your thesis or is, is the thesis of the book?
Speaker 2: Well, originally when I was gonna do my thesis there weren't, there wasn't all this money out there that's out there now, I didn't have a grant.  I was of the impression and still am, that at least from, not so much now, because the television and the kind of, kind of communications that we have, but certainly up until the '50s [1950s], the upper class blacks and I knew two or three cities, I knew Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], I knew Washington [D.C.], I became to know Boston, the upper class black community patterned itself after, so far as it could, the white group in the same city.  In other words the upper class black in Chicago [Illinois] was not like the upper class black in Boston, it was more like the white Chicago and had the same values, same lifestyle.  Now there was also an element of the Black elites that I wasn't taking away from that.
Story_ID: 253814
Speaker 1: So what I really would have liked to have done if I, as I said, if I had done it when people were bringing, Ford [Foundation, New York, New York] was giving out these big grants, is it to take two cities and four groups but since I was doing it on my (laughter) own money I tried to compare the Boston [Massachusetts] blacks to the Boston Brahmins.  So I had to have a sample of each.  And, of course, it, as, for the times I think I couldn't have done any better, maybe today with the more advanced technology.  But what I did was, I worked out, I used different methods, I used questionnaire and, and interviewing for the Brahmins.  I used the social register.  I took the fifth name down from every page.  And I appealed to the women, I wasn't, didn't get men in it at all.  And I sent these women another questionnaire, much better questionnaire than you, they gave me I might add, more appealing, grab you better, and asked them questions that didn't have anything to do with race, church, and a lot of things.  Then at, I used the same questionnaire with the questions of blacks on it and gave it to blacks now.  The problem was how would you find a group of blacks comparable to those in the social register for whites?  And that's where it gets very muggy.  What I did was to use six women's clubs, and I think of the time, I pretty much had hit the groups, I mean, I knew enough about the group and it wasn't that large.  But now that I, if you, if you, if you lived in Chicago [Illinois] or Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] you could same thing but you could probably have a few other (unclear) things.  And if you think about it, it was the (laughter) the black women weren't as easy to get to answer the questionnaires, they did take it but I didn't more interviewing with them to get the documentation.  And so I, what I tried to prove the point that there were certain things that they were definitely patterned after.  But even if you didn't look at it from my point, that was my thesis my hypothesis.  But to gain that hypothesis just looking at it as a study, it gave you a picture of the blacks of the time.
Story_ID: 253815
Speaker 1: You also looked at feminism.  I know you did the feminist analysis for, if I'm using the right term, of two novels Dorothy West 'The Living is Easy' and Nella Larsen's 'Quicksand.'
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I found those interesting reading the work that you did on that.  Can you say a little bit about--
Speaker 2: Tell me what I said.
Speaker 1: --your study of those novels?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And what you came up, you know--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --why you did that and--
Speaker 2: Well I did it because I was asked to do both of them (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Of course, I knew Dorothy West as you know, knew her well.  I never knew Nella Larsen.  Nella Larsen's story was a more tragic one I think.  I'm trying to remember now, what I said and what I, you know, what I thought about her.  She (unclear) well she was accused of plagiarism and she denied it but it did a job on her and the tragedy of her life was after that she retreated into nursing, nursing, she became a nurse.  And the latter part of her life she didn't write at all.  Her personal life before that was not so happy either because she was married to an Imes [Elmer Imes] I think his name was, is that right, Imes?
Speaker 1: Imes?
Speaker 2: I think so.  And he was down at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], he was a professor.  And I don't think she liked that lifestyle, she didn't find her niche.  Dorothy never left her niche.  It didn't make, as a matter of fact it, it opened up for her from her earlier life to her later years in life (unclear) because you just sort of lost it at the end.  But I mean she lived to get a lot of attention and appreciation whereas Nella Larsen did not.  Then, of course, if I remember, of course, it was a question of color in Nella Larsen but I haven't looked at that, Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden], you throw that to me as a curve.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I know I found it interesting and but these things, and I knew the, I knew the family, that her husband's family but not knowing her, not living in New York [New York] with her, I'm speaking at it from a distance.  And like I say I, I repeated myself then I don't think she, after she, after that plagiarism attack I don't think she ever really got back again.  But they were both, both interesting women as women go.  And I must look back at what I said about Nella.  I guess (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well I just wanted to bring those up because I was interested--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in people knowing the breadth and the depth (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of, and the variety of things that you've looked at and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: --written about and thought about--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --as a scholar.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 253816
Speaker 1: You went to [Paul Laurence] Dunbar High School [Washington, D.C.], you lived in Boston [Massachusetts] for many, many years, you did a study 'Developing a Black Meritocracy[: A History of Black Graduates of the Boston Latin School,' Adelaide M. Cromwell]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of Boston Latin School [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us a little about that study?  Why you did that and (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I can tell you why I did it.  I was always interested in how Boston [Massachusetts], Boston people didn't really reach the level of achievement that they should have reached given what was supposed to be out here.  And so I, how did I say this, I decided I would do, have a program at BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], which I did have in the summer for three summers, I don't, probably didn't even put it down, at taking Latin School children in the seventh grade when they first went in, taking those that were not gonna fail 'cause there were some that were gonna fail, they knew they weren't gonna make it or at least they felt and others they knew were gonna make it.  But they take a middle category and see whether we could give them a program in the summer of enrichment which would take Latin and give it a black component to take English and math, I forget the subjects.  And I had a faculty in the school and we, collected the students, got some money, and I hate raising money but I raised the money, and then to get the children to come.  And that was very funny, Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden], because I would identify Suzie Jones [ph.] she was very poised young girls.  And then I'd called Mrs. Jones, we'd like to have, we're offering a program to your daughter this summer at Boston University.  Would your, would you like your daughter to come?  Of course, she didn't understand it and she'd say, Suzie, she would be upstairs looking at the television (unclear) not thinking about coming but would come.  And we had a two or three summers, I forget now, and we had faculty meetings with the parents and they could come and talk and the students.  I've never done any follow-up on that because my main contact at Latin School, Edith Walker left after that.  And 'cause I got involved in other things.  I, the truth I never had enough backup people, I had to do everything.  And I, I chose to do all these things but if I could have had somebody just to take that one program.  So after having had that, they had the 350th anniversary of the Latin School.  So having met these children see, through this program, I said I would like to examine the history of blacks at the Latin School.  Having had the contact where I, I wouldn't, I don't know if I could go in cold or even thought of going in cold, so I went over there and began to dig.  And, of course, you know they didn't have a lot of records, you understand that, that's the story (unclear).  But I got enough material to put it in a booklet of the background who the first blacks were, Parker Bailey, (unclear).  And you see the interesting part about it was, any child who got through Latin School who was black, was a bright person.  And a number of them took the next step and got to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] but after that where?  No place to go.  The schools wouldn't take them back in the school system, they couldn't teach in the school system.  And they came to Washington [D.C.], more than one did to Dunbar.  And so I didn't know, this is before my time.  But Parker Bailey was the first one and he did just that, came to Washington.  And I remember a family name in Washington but I didn't know him.
Speaker 1: He came to Dunbar?
Speaker 2: Dunbar, that's right.  And I'll tell you who else came to, Grimke, Angelina Grimke, 'cause she was, (unclear) but she too came to Dunbar.  Dunbar got the, a number of people from all over the country who couldn't get any (unclear) said, of course, they couldn't get in the colleges.  But they didn't wanna go south 'cause Washington was paying equal salary for blacks as well as whites.  So I it, Grimke, Grimke, and the lawyer, I mean the, Parker Bailey, Groves, Marjorie, you know, Marjorie Groves, Marjorie Groves 'cause she's still alive, her father and the lawyer, it'll come to me in a minute, good friend of [W.E.B.] Du Bois, they were the first three, the lawyer didn't, he stayed in Boston and practiced law.  But I did the history on the blacks, got a whole list of them and so far, Bob, so far as I know, I haven't left any out and I didn't put any in who didn't belong.  I was fearful that I, some didn't finish, and they didn't, they didn't like it the fact that I didn't put 'em in, but I just, they had to finish.
Speaker 1: Well let me, I'm glad I asked this question because we're at the end of the tape but we've kind of come full circle now because you're coming back to Dunbar High School (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --by talking about the prestigious, esteemed faculty--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --that you had--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and how they came through Harvard and so on and so.
Speaker 2: That's right and came to Washington--
Speaker 1: We've kind of made a nice little circle here--
Speaker 2: Circle, okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 253817
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Adelaide] Cromwell, what do you still wanna do that you haven't done?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh, I don't know, that I haven't done.  I might like to go back to Europe and go to, do more of Italy and travel.  I'm not, that's not, I mean, I could do it if I really wanted to so I really shouldn't say it but I, if somebody said let's go, to (unclear) to, to (unclear) I might do that.  I might take a ride across the country by train.  I've come across some, I don't recall (unclear) by train but I might do that if you can get comfortable trains, you know, (unclear).  In so far as more substantive things, I suppose I would put my own life, not in any way that's its publishable particularly but I think to put some of the meat on the bones that I gave you.  So that if I wanted to, or if Tony [Anthony Cromwell Hill] wanted to or somebody else that it was worthy of doing, I might do something like that.  'Cause I've done an awful lot about our own family, my father [John Wesley Cromwell, Jr.], and my aunts, and my grandfather [John Wesley Cromwell, Sr.], and my great-grandfather but I've done very little of my own unless it was tangential to theirs, you see.  So that might be something I will do (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is there anything--?
Story_ID: 253818
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is there anything that you've already done or accomplished that you would have liked to have done differently?
Speaker 2: You mean besides marriage?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I guess both of those, I've done both of those really, yes.  But as far as anything, and nothing is more serious than marriage so we really can't laugh at that.  But I don't think, I, I don't think I'd a gone to any different schools if I, I, I'm not, I don't go along with all this shopping of the schools the children are doing now.  Like you're going to Filene's Basement or something you go around.  I think that parents or guidance counselors oughta be able to direct your children to school.  So I don't know that I would have chosen another school.  I did mention Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] as I said to you, I don't think I'd a been wrong if I had gone to Oberlin either but I was happy going to Smith [College, Northampton, Massachusetts].  I was never unhappy there, not one day.  And the same with Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Radcliffe [College, Cambridge, Massachusetts] (unclear) I don't judge it in the same way because my life is the, schools almost like a job, of the living of the life.  And yet on the other hand I do enjoy, did enjoy knowing [Talcott] Parsons and [Oscar] Handlin and some other graduate students that I knew.  I, I have, I never thought I'd live in Boston [Massachusetts], I thought that, 'cause I told you how I happened to be here but I'm really glad I didn't go back to Washington [D.C.].  I think if I had toyed with something I might have stayed in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] but I don't know that would have been right.  Boston has been good to me and so I'm glad that I ended up here.

Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, I hope that it's a, remains, it's a productive community.  I hope it's competitive for, in the larger sense but doesn't lose its sense of responsibility for itself.  I hope that we remember our, our ancestors, not in a noble way but in a accurate way.  I hope that we gain strength from each other but have enough strength to mingle among other people comfortably.  I hope we do away with some of the fraudulent things that we have such as Kwanzaa, which I think is a disgrace.  I hope, I wish that we would be, continue to be respectful for, for aged, people of age.  I guess and, and be politically active.  I, I think that that's the one thing that we lost and if you read, my grandfather [John Wesley Cromwell, Sr.] played with some friends of his after the Civil War and (unclear).  These people were so aware of the political process, what, where power was and not in money alone.  And I, and I think that we should really examine our political strengths.  And have the judgment to pick the right leaders, not the ones who have foisted upon us, either for their own personal ambition or by the white world.  That's enough.

Speaker 1: How do you wanna be remembered?
Speaker 2: As I am (laughter).  I wanna be remembered as a friendly, (laughter) relatively agreeable person who tells the truth when she sees it.  Is not upset by rank or as in my story about Doll Baby [ph.], comfortable with people, all groups.

Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: What do you mean what I want my legacy to be?  I don't know.  What did you say or where, what did you--
Speaker 1: No what, what, do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, I suppose just what I said, a person who, a woman who gained certain strengths from the separation and segregation but was able to move beyond that and, and keep my value, keep my values intact.  I've never had a lot of value about material things.  So I would not, I don't care what kind of car I drive, as long as it runs.  I do wanna live in a comfortable home.  I think you should have a comfortable setting but the material aspect of life it doesn't interest me.  But I don't wanna be uncomfortable either.

Speaker 1: Is there anything you'd like to add to this interview that I've not asked you about?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden], 'cause you've covered many, I mean, they're all, there are many aspects that I would have been willing to go into more detail about but I think you've hit on.  I, I, I participated once in a conference of Women of Africa and African Descent [Conference for Women of Africa and African Descent, Ghana].  I don't think I put that down anywhere.  [Kwame] Nkrumah, did he call that, he called that meeting, yes.  That was an interesting meeting, but just a facet of my, really I had nothing to do, I was there, but I didn't have anything to do with setting it up.  And as far as I know it had no sequel but it was interesting.  (Unclear) the American delegation was composed of leftists, shall we say, those who belong to the party because after all Du Bois, Mr. [W.E.B.] Du Bois was alive then.  And those who were state department [U.S. Department of State] chose selectees and me, I was in the middle, very pleasant place to be at that time.  And, and they did a, got a, got a whole scene I didn't go into it because it just took place for only a short period but it did show our divisions.  And I remember when we finished that meeting, does the name Harold Isaacs mean anything to you?  Well he was visiting, oh dear, the lawyer, oh, Brandeis [University, Waltham, Massachusetts] lawyer, out there, a black woman, I can't think of it, and I even stayed at her house.  When we convened, these three different divisions that I just told you about, the state department, the Left and myself, we're gonna have a report.  He sat there, I kept looking for him to get up and go, he didn't.  So I said I'm very sorry I can't stay and talk here for this I didn't come to talk to Harold Isaacs.  What's the name of that woman, she got very upset, well I don't know why you said that.  But that's my opinion.  That's the way I feel about it.  And I did feel that way and I thought he should have had enough sense to excuse himself.

Speaker 1: How would you characterize or describe your contribution to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] during the thirty-four years that you were associated with the university?  How would you characterize briefly, your contribution?
Speaker 2: Well I think first of all I maintained a presence which was a good contribution.  I mean some of the schools didn't have a presence, black presence.  I was active at faculty meetings.  I was active with the black student group, UMOJA [Boston University Black Student Union].  They consider me as one of their founders.  I think my courses were well accepted.  For me the students were, you know, (laughter) I was, this doesn't quite answer your question but does through a facet to it.  I gave a seminar on Africa, I think that I forgot the title of it, and a couple of students cross registered, one was from Nigeria who was a graduate student at Brandeis [University, Waltham, Massachusetts] and had to give a big paper and he gave me this paper which I took and when looked at it, I realized it wasn't written for my course.  So I called Brandeis and I said would you tell me the names of the courses this gentleman is taking?  Oh, he's a very smart student (unclear).  But, oh, he just a, gave me the courses.  One of these fit, it was just like, you know, like that.  Me, seriously, it was not my field.  I then turned it over to a colleague of mine in sociology because the one thing I did not want to be, I, I didn't wanna be thought a dumb person, a fool, but I wanted to know what I didn't know.  And this colleague of mine evaluated it the way I would have had it been mine.  So I called this student up and said Mr. (making sounds) (unclear) his name, would you come here I wanna talk to you?  Oh, he says I'm too busy.  I says no you're not (laughter).  I says you better come and see me today.  So he came on up.  I said, now why did you hand me this paper when, you know, it's not for my, I'm not saying it's not a good paper, but didn't you have enough respect for me as a black person, as a woman, not to do this for me, do you think I'm a fool.  I said you take that, I said if I reported you, of course, you know, you would be, your passport, be sending you back home.  You write me a paper and give it back to me.  So that was an experience, I think, (laughter) (unclear) would underestimate everybody.  But I, you know, I, I just think that these were small things you put, maybe somebody else could better say, I, I think someone else can tell you better what you can do, you're rather arrogant.  Think you can tell it yourself.  You know, I mean if they had put (unclear) a suite of rooms for me in African studies, they must have thought I did something, did something right.  And the same with the honorary degree.  But I don't think it was any, I think I'd done the same thing at any school.

Speaker 1: We have a photograph we're gonna look at in a few minutes at Boston University [(BU), Boston, Massachusetts] there was a suite or a place--
Speaker 2: Yeah (unclear).
Speaker 1: --named after you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was that, what was the suite can you just--
Speaker 2: It's in African studies.
Speaker 1: Oh, it's in the African--
Speaker 2: Yes, it's in the African studies program [African Studies Center, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts].  They have a library, sort of a common room, and then another room and, you know, the [HistoryMaker] Adelaide Cromwell Suite.
Speaker 1: Adelaide Cromwell Suite?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we'll take a look at that photo--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in a few minutes.
Speaker 2: I wanna give you a--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Just 'cause of the tape.  Okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of me when I was baby with my mother [Yetta Mavritte Cromwell].  It was taken in Washington, D.C., I guess that maybe I was a few months old, by George Scurlock who was a famous black photographer in Washington.  Apparently I broke my mother's beads right after this was taken.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Give me one second to get around to it.  Push photo (unclear).  Great.  Okay.  We can change.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  Thank you.  That's, are you all ready?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Yes, please.
Speaker 2: That's a picture with me and my father John Wesley Cromwell [Jr.].  It was taken in Toronto [Ontario, Canada], I think, when I was living there briefly.  He looks very happy and sporting his Phi Beta Kappa key.  And, and that's about all I can say but he visited me every year wherever I was.  No, wait a minute, maybe it wasn't in Toronto, I'm sorry, that's not correct.  It was in Cambridge [Massachusetts].  He never went to Toronto.  He came up every year for the Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire]-Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] game and, and the, that was probably one of those occasions, yes it was.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  We've got the narration, I just wanted to get, cleanup a reflection that was in there.  Great.  Okay.  We're ready with the next.  Okay.  Go ahead when you're ready.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of me taken again by Mr. Scurlock in Washington with my Aunt Otelia [Cromwell].  She was very, she was my father's oldest sister, an eminent scholar and educator.  And this was my, I guess, my second formal picture.  The other one had been with my mother.  And I don't know what more to say about it.  I seem to be behaving myself there.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Good.  Next.  Okay.  Whenever you're ready.
Speaker 2: This is a copy of an oil painting that I commissioned of my Aunt Otelia by Georgine Russell Hill, (unclear) which was given to Smith College [Northampton, Massachusetts] too.  And it, it on display and it's hanging in the browsing room of their library.  Yeah, it was a picture taken when she graduated from the college dressed in the dress that she herself made.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  And the spelling of the artist's name?
Speaker 2: Georgine, G-E-O-R-G-I-N-E, Russell, R-U-S-S-E-L-L, last name Hill.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Thank you.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear) go ahead, please.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of a team that was sent by the Methodist church to the [Democratic Republic of the] Congo.  We was taking a little rest there.  We went there as I said to evaluate the institutes of higher learning.  The gentleman on my left is Z.K. Matthews who is probably the most outstanding nonpolitical person in South Africa.  He was president of Fort Hare, University of Fort Hare [Alice, South Africa], college or whatever they called it.  And the other man on the other is a bishop, Bishop [Friedrich] Wunderlich.  I don't know how to spell it or which church but that was his name.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  And what year was this taken?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Approximate is okay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) does it say on it?  Look on the back of it, does it say?  Oh, oh it would be taken in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this one (unclear) that was a delegation that went to the Independence of Dahomey [sic. Republic of Dahomey; Republic of Benin] representing President [John Fitzgerald] Kennedy.  The chairman of the delegation [Anthony J. Celebrezze] was the who was then secretary of health, education and welfare.  Oh, I couldn't see this.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Processing date is August '63 [1963] on the border, if that's what you're looking at or are you trying to see who's in the--
Speaker 2: No, I'm trying to see.  Let me get--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Sure, you go ahead.
Speaker 2: --(unclear) I can see, Tommy [ph.], no Tom [ph.], maybe--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Harpocello [ph.]?
Speaker 2: Yes that's he is, we, we were, we was in Portugal, so we were just going out.  We had just met each other from Washington coming over to Portugal then to West Africa and then we went through a lot of celebrations.  It had to be taken on our trip back we stopped in Rome [Italy], there would be much (unclear).
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  And is (unclear) the man on the, on the view to your far right with his hand on his hip?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, exactly.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's, and that's Celebrezze in there and his wife [Anne Celebrezze].
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Good.
Speaker 2: We had a audience with Pope [St. John XXIII] in Rome too on that trip.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Next.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: How do you want this, on the long?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Just like you've got it, that's perfect, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's a picture of my son, Tony Hill [Anthony Cromwell Hill], with me on my seventy-fifth birthday party, which was quite a celebration.  We won't say how many years ago 'cause I've had (unclear).
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: This is the last one.
Speaker 2: This is the, the people at BU or the African studies people, I guess.  They named a, a suite of rooms in my honor and this was on the occasion of that presentation to me.  That is an interesting picture because (unclear) President [Jon] Westling and the current president of, of the college were there, to his right is John Silber, a former president, and to his left, I guess, to my left was Dennis Berkey who was then the provost of the college.  It was very nice to have them all there at the occasion.
