Speaker 1: Okay. I'm sorry. My name is Lee Bailey. We spell it "L-E-E B-A-I-L-E-Y." Now as far as I know, today's date is July 23, 2001. My birfday--or is it "birthday." I'm so accustomed to being around folks who say, "birfday." That I end up saying "birfday." Sort of like a hyphenated birthday and birthday. You'll also notice I tend to go left and right as opposed to staying on course. That's what you get for wanting to interview me. I was about to say before I interrupted myself--my birthday is July 27, 1947.
Speaker 2: And I'd like to have the location where we're at right now and your profession.
Speaker 1: Ah, yes. The location--Cahuenga Boulevard in Los Angeles [California]. We're at the headquarters of Lee Bailey Communications. As a matter of fact we're at 3151 Cahuenga Boulevard West, Suite 205 to be exact.
Story_ID: 2772
Speaker 1: I was getting ready to ask you who raised you for the first say--eight years?
Speaker 2: My grandfather and my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about them? What their names were and--
Speaker 2: Sure. My grandfather's name was J. C. Bailey and my grandmother's name was Alvenia. Alvenia Bailey. The thing I remember about her I guess, that she was one half Cherokee or something like that. But a lot of black folks say they have Indian blood in them, so it's not really much of a big deal any more. But when I was growing up it was like--it was like a big deal. But J. C., John Bailey, and I don't think the C. in his middle name really stood for anything. I always asked him, but he never could come up with an answer for it. But his first name was John.
Speaker 1: So what--what did--did they tell you anything about their growing or do you have any memories of, you know. From the time you spent with them?
Speaker 2: I remember they came from--well my grandfather, he came from a large family. It was primarily boys. I think maybe ten, something like that. And I think it was two or three girls. I remember them saying some of them died--a couple of the kids or one of the kids died early. I never knew my grand aunts. I met a couple of my--several of my uncles. My grand uncles. I met about four or five of them. One was named--I remember his name was Square. Either Square or Squire. I think it was Square. Which I always thought was interesting name. Square Bailey.
Story_ID: 2773
Speaker 1: You were talking about [Bailey's great uncle] Square Bailey.
Speaker 2: I remember Square if I'm not mistaken. As I think about it now, it's a weird sounding name. But I'm almost sure his name was Square. Uncle George, Uncle Phillip. Maybe it was Squire, but it seems like Square for some reason was his name. I remember them. I remember we used to dig a hole in the ground and do like a barbecue kind of a thing. They would slaughter a hog and barbecue it. We'd have these family reunions and we had this thing called third Sunday in August down there. Everybody would go to church, and after the services, they'd have these incredible meals of, you know, all kinds of dishes. And sweet potato pie. And different families would be exchanging, you know, their food and stuff like that. I recall that. I recall--and something has been--I've been trying to put together in my mind for a long time. I remember as a kid I went to school for a couple of years. And I remember seeing--I don't know why, but I got these memories of watching these African movies. The movies were I believe were done--I don't know where they came from. But it was like movies where they had depictions of Africa in this wild settings. I remember being frightened by them. Like it just--used to really--used to really scare me. I could never figure out what I was looking at. And I'm not even sure why I'm saying that, but you get me thinking about my childhood while I was there in Georgia. So for some reason that pops into my mind. And all my life I've always thought about that, the times when I went to school there. And those movies always stand out. I remember being picked up by the school bus. And it was like one of those one room kind of situations you see on TV sometimes. It was a situation like that I recall, and those movies. Seems like we saw the same movies over and over. I don't remember any other kind of movies except for these scary African movies.
Story_ID: 2774
Speaker 1: Now were there other memories you had? Because these were formative years, the first eight years, too. Were there other memories you had of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. I remember my Uncle Mook (laughs) as we called him. I remember he was like my buddy before he went to the army. He would--I remember him--he would always ride me on his handlebars. Or it was like a little basket, you know. It was on a bicycle with a little basket. I would sit in that, and he would always ride me around. So I have a--but I was like at the most two or three years old. I don't know why I remember that. But I remember that. I remember as I got a little older I remember one time I found fifty cents. Let's just say I found fifty cents. I remember going to the store. And I bought, and I bought, I bought, I bought, and I still had money left by the time I got through buying candy and soda pop and whatever else I could think of. Boy that was fun. Fifty cents went a long, long way back then. I also remember setting the forest on fire. That was scary. That was real scary. You know, the whole thing with kids playing with matches. Well, I'm here to tell you--I had my bout with that. We had a forest across the street--across the road I should say, not street--but across the road from where we lived. Well, it was forest all around. But there was this clump of forest across the road, dry brush, and for some reason I just--I was compelled to start this fire. And first it was, you know, just a little bit. And I figured like I could put it out. And then before I knew it, it got out of control. I think it burned about maybe--it didn't--it wasn't a huge conflagration or anything like that. It didn't consume the whole forest or jump across the road or anything like that, but it was enough to scare me to the point that I will never ever do that again. And, of course, I got the you know what beat out of me for doing that. As a matter of fact, I remember getting whippings all the time, 'cause I was always doing something crazy. It's like I think about that now. It's like, "you weren't a very smart kid," (laughs). I used to get whippings all the time. And they were deserved, 'cause I just did some crazy stuff when I was a child.
Story_ID: 2775
Speaker 1: In growing up, did you have a sense that your mother was away? Or were your parents for all intents and purposes your parents--I mean your grandparents.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) My grandparents [J.C. Bailey and Alvenia Bailey] yes.
Speaker 1: That was the latter that was the case.
Speaker 2: Right, right. That was pretty much it. I always thought of my--because I called them "Ma" and "Pa." And it took me a long time up until maybe a few years ago to call my mother [Helen Smith], my mother. I always called her Helen. I was growing up, it was Helen. It sounds--it doesn't sound good, but I mean you know, I loved her. She was my mother, she provided for me. But I was so ingrained of thinking my grandparents were my parents that, that is how it was in my mind, that is the way it was for years--even like I said up until maybe the last fifteen years or so. It took me that long to really start calling my mother "Mom" or "Mother."
Story_ID: 2776
Speaker 1: Now what did--what do you think--what lessons did your grandparents teach you in those early years that sort of still stay with you?
Speaker 2: Work I think. Me and my grandfather [J.C. Bailey]--you know, we were on a farm. And he was a hard worker. Now I've never been one for working manual labor. I work hard, but I don't like lifting bales and you know, plowing fields and stuff like that. Picking cotton, which I did--hated it. So what I got out of that, I learned I didn't want to do that. That I had to do whatever it was necessary to not to have to do manual labor. Because I can hear in my mind my grandfather telling me that I was never gonna be anything. 'Cause you know, his whole orientation was working hard on a farm. That's hard work. I was not born to plow fields and pick cotton. So I made it up in my mind to want to achieve something. And in a lot of ways to show him, to prove to him that I was about something. That I wasn't lazy as he thought I was or accused me of being, because I did not like picking cotton. Didn't like it at all. Hated it. Still do. So--
Speaker 1: So do you think that, that negative messaging had a positive affect?
Speaker 2: From the point of view that it made me want to prove to him that I wasn't lazy. Yeah.
Story_ID: 2777
Speaker 1: And your grandmother [Alvenia Bailey]. What impact did she have on you? And what kind of person was she?
Speaker 2: That's interesting, because I don't remember a lot about my grandmother in that way. She did most of the cooking and was--you know, she had a role of the female back in those days, it was kind of somewhat passive. But for--I don't know--for whatever reason, I don't remember a lot about her really having a big impact on me. I just don't. It was like my grandfather [J.C. Bailey] who really--who was on me one--for one reason or another. So I can't honestly give you any kind of opinion or thought I should say about her. I'm not sure what that means. I remember her, but I don't--nothing jumps out at me as something that I would recall that she impacted me in any kind of way. I remember her--she would give me--she would go and get a switch or something like that. So like him didn't have a problem giving me a whippin'. That's about the only thing I can recall. But it was like me and my grandfather, we you know. We spent more time together. So he was a bigger influence on me, because just spent more time together.
Speaker 1: Were there other people that had an influence on you in this first eight years that you looked up to? Or--?
Speaker 2: Perhaps my cousin. We called him Pluke (laughs). I'm thinking--all these crazy names. He was like my buddy. He was older than me. Maybe about three or four years older than me. I used to hang around him a lot. So I would say him. Yeah. George Robert I believe is his real name. It's funny--you know I don't--I haven't seen them in so long, 'cause once I moved to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] I sort of lost contact with them--not completely. And then I grew up and moved away, came to California. And so a lot of them I just don't know a lot about 'em any more.
Story_ID: 2778
Speaker 1: Now what were you like as a child? I mean were you mischievous? I mean you know, were you spoiled? Were you know--were you rambunctious? Were you well mannered? I mean what would you--how would you describe yourself?
Speaker 2: I'd like to think that I was somewhat mischievous--somewhat. But I think overall well-mannered. I don't think I was spoiled at all. I think I was somewhat shy--as I am now to some degree. I think very well-mannered, very well-mannered. Someone that got along with pretty much--pretty much everybody. Went out of my way to make people--to make people happy. That's still sort of my personality.
Speaker 1: So you--if you were shy did you live in your head a lot? I mean, were you one with an active imagination? If so, what did you dream about?
Speaker 2: Oh, I used to dream about being, you know, being a fireman or a policeman or, you know being on the radio. That's the kind of--that's why I think I ended up going into radio. 'Cause I really was fascinated by the radio. That's something that probably of all the things I've fantasized about doing. Radio was just something that just intrigued me.
Speaker 1: And what was the radio--what was your exposure to radio at that time?
Speaker 2: Just listening. Just becoming engrossed in the fact that the, you know, the theater of the mind. I would hear something, and then I could you know--a good radio drama would come on, you end up seeing what you're listening to. That intrigued me, I was always intrigued by that. Hearing songs, some of the blues songs and R&B songs and gospel songs. You know, things like that. That always intrigued me. So I always thought that I wanted to try that--be a voice on the radio. That always appealed to me.
Story_ID: 2779
Speaker 1: When the decision came for you--do you know how it came about that you actually ended up coming to move with your mother [Helen Smith]?
Speaker 2: I can't say that I remember exactly. It was a point where pretty--after I moved, my grandparents, they ended up moving to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] as well about a year or so after I got there. Now there--as I think about it--now as I think about it--as I was growing up, my grandfather [J.C. Bailey] would take me up north to Pittsburgh. I remember taking about two or three trips before I eventually moved there. I would go up on--in the summer he would take me to Pittsburgh on the train. So I remember--I remember that. So I think--I just assume it was at a certain time my mother decided that it was time for me to come live with her to take me off of their hands and be part of her family. Because that's the way it should be.
Speaker 1: Had she gotten remarried at that point?
Speaker 2: (Nods head for yes). Um-hmm, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She had been--she had been married at that point. I had two little brothers Sonny [Robert Smith, Jr.] and Eddy [Edward Smith] were--when I got to Pittsburgh, they were already about maybe two or three years old. Excuse me maybe four. Maybe about--I guess about three or four, yeah. One was about three or four, and one was about two or something like that.
Speaker 1: So how--how was this then? Because this was all new to you. You know, one year--even though you have visited there you're coming into an already sort of made family. How did--how was that adjustment for you?
Speaker 2: It wasn't hard. I don't remember it as being--as being hard. The only thing I remember is that I had this accent. You know, (speaking with a southern drawl) "I'm from Georgia." I had this drawl. And had a couple of neighborhood bullies, they just couldn't handle it. That was something that was just very foreign to them. Plus my name was Harvey. So that was something they couldn't handle. They always, you know, freaked me out. It was no big deal to me, but it was a couple of guys. I can't remember their names now. They just hounded me mercilessly because I had an accent and my name was Harvey.
Story_ID: 2780
Speaker 1: Now where'd the name Harvey come in?
Speaker 2: My grandfather [J.C. Bailey] gave me that name apparently. It was--he said it was some white man he knew. And that's all he would ever tell me. Beyond that I don't know. I'm just glad he called me
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] So wait, when did Harvey--When did Lee come into--
Speaker 2: Oh! Lee is a name I gave myself when I--actually when I came to Los Angeles [California]. What happened was I'd already been in radio for several years. And I was using the name H.B. Bailey. Harvey Bailey. That's what H.B. is for. People would--some people call me H.B. for Harvey Bailey. So I liked the sound of H.B. Bailey even though the B. in H.B. didn't mean anything. Because H.B. was really Harvey Bailey. So it was Harvey Bailey Bailey to some people. But when I came here to L.A. [Los Angeles], the program director, for whatever reason, he felt the idea of me having a name with initials would confuse the audience. So he says, "well I was thinking about it. And I'd like for your name to be Sam, Sam Bailey." And I said, "Sam Bailey! I don't think so." So I says--and he says, "well unless you got something better." And I was like getting ready to go on the air within a half hour. So I had to make up a--come up with a name right then and there. So he--so I says, "well then if I change it, let it be Lee." Now to this day I don't know why. Unless it was something going on subliminally that I came up with that. Because I hadn't been thinking about any other names. Now when I was a kid, I used to think about--or maybe--maybe it was something I thought about when I was a kid and forgot. Because when I was a kid I didn't like the name Harvey. Again not only were the bullies unhappy with my name but other (laughs)--other people were too. I remember there was this guy. He wanted me to go with him to meet some girls across town. So he says, "man whatever you do, don't tell them your name is Harvey." I'm like, "oh God!" It doesn't get any worse than that. When you can't even tell people your name is Harvey. I'm like, "God! It's that bad?" So I had this complex, and still do to a certain extent. Not completely, because I can sort of handle it now--sort of. But the name Harvey Bailey just--just brings back all kinds of bad vibes for me. Anyway, so I used to make up these names to call myself. And perhaps Lee was one of them. Now as I've gotten older, the stigma of being called Harvey didn't bother me. Especially after I came to California. Because what happened was I joined the [U.S.] Air Force and I got stationed up in Sacramento [California]. And nobody cared that my name was Harvey. So that why I kind of like always--that's why I really came to like California. Because growing up in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] to me was a horrible experience. Because the people I grew up around, if you didn't dress like them you were ostracized. My name was Harvey not John or Bill or Steven or something like that. I got talked about because of my name.
Story_ID: 2781
Speaker 1: So I want to go to--I know you were--I want to go to other things. You know, sort of those years in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and other--you know, you were talking about how you felt out of place. You know it was--and I'm just trying to sort of figure out who you were at that point in your life. You know.
Speaker 2: That's a good question. I'm not really--I didn't really have a bad childhood. Nothing traumatic or anything like that. I remember one of the positive things on the other hand was that the older guys would always ask me to talk to their girlfriends on the telephone because of my voice. So that was always fun to talk to, you know, these older girls. I was what--10, 11, 12, maybe 13, 14. I can't remember--but somewhere around in there, and these were older guys with girlfriends. I didn't know the first thing about a girlfriend for myself, but they seemed to get a big thrill of letting me talk to that--that was--you know, when I think about it that was so bizarre. But that got them all kinds of good things shall we say. So it benefited them greatly to have me talk to their girlfriends. I remember that.
Speaker 1: When did your voice start to change?
Speaker 2: I suppose when I was around that age. Ten, 11, 12, 13 something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay. Were you surprised about it when you heard?
Speaker 2: No. I don't even--I think it's like a lot of things, you don't even know or you don't even think anything about it, except for when people start making a big deal over it. Then you know you're on to something. But on my own I didn't--I didn't realize anything.
Story_ID: 2782
Speaker 1: And so--now tell me the schools you went to in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Grade school was Mary J. Cowley [Elementary School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]. Junior high was Lattimer [Junior High School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]. High school was Allegheny [High School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: So what kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was average. Yeah. I was not a great student. I was good in history, geography, stuff like that. English--okay. But math brought everything down. Horrible in math. Hated it and just could not grasp it, so that brought my average down. So I was about overall a "C" student. So that made me average.
Speaker 1: What was getting your--get--you know what was motivating you during that time? I mean was it--you know. What was occupying your time and your attention and your thoughts and all of that?
Speaker 2: Wanting to be on the radio. Wanting to be accepted by people. I also was very much into diction. I knew that I was on to something, because everywhere--well I was also motivated because to--if you remember earlier I was telling you that I had that accent. So I was very motivated to get rid of my Georgia accent. It worked so well that I would go places in Pittsburgh and people would always ask me, and even now, "where are you from?" "I'm from here." But I would go places where people didn't know me, and they would ask me where am I from. So I suppose I didn't sound like a Pittsburgher.
Speaker 1: And were you--in high school were you doing anything in radio? Or you were just an active listener? Were you--did you--
Speaker 2: Just an active listener for the most part. But what happened was I became a "gofer," if you will, for a local station WZUM--in was it Duquense? No, in Carnegie [Pennsylvania]. In Carnegie there was WAMO [Carnegie, Pennsylvania radio station] "wam-o," which had been there for years. Still is as a matter of fact, as the local black station. And then WZUM [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania radio station] or "zoom" came on the air. And I became enamored by them. And so whenever I could I would go out to the station and just hang out and do whatever it took to be friends with the DJ's [disc jockeys]. So I spent a lot of time there when I wasn't working or in school or what have you. Just to be in that atmosphere and you know, just trying to soak it all up, because I knew that that's eventually where I wanted to be.
Speaker 1: And you wanted to be a DJ?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be a DJ yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 2783
Speaker 1: I wanted to be a DJ [disc jockey]. Wanted to be on the radio at some point and time. Now that never happened until I joined the [U.S.] Air Force and got stationed in Sacramento [California]. Now actually I didn't become a DJ until after I was released from the Air Force. But again I kept hanging out at stations, learning all of the things I could without being a DJ. And it got to the point where about a year before I got out of the Air Force, I went up to a station called KPOP [Roseville, California radio station], "K-pop," in Roseville [California] right outside of Sacramento. Approached them about becoming a DJ. And after they got through laughing because I had no experience. But I kept coming back, and they saw I was serious. So they would--they ended up letting me go in the production room and doing a tape. So I went in the production room, played some music and made a demo tape. And lo and behold, they said, "my God! You're on to something." And that's sort of how it began. Now I still have a year to go. And I think what also helped was the fact that the owner and GM [general manager] of the station name was Gene Raigel. He was an Air Force reserve colonel. Now I was a Air Force a sergeant E5 in the Air Force. What happened is I was stationed in Sacramento at McClellan Air Force base. And like I said, Roseville was a few miles from there. And again being this radio freak I was aware of--if it was on the radio within a thousand miles I was aware of it. And "K-pop" would sign off at 10:00 [pm] at night.  So I knew--I was so accustomed to daytimers. So I thought--I said to myself, "I wonder if I would approach them." Because at that point I figured I knew that they could go twenty-four hours if they wanted to. But the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] required them to do I think it was eighteen hours, from six a.m. to ten p.m, whatever amount of time I guess they were doing the minimum. But they could go beyond sunset, so they were theoretically a twenty-four hour facility. Anyway, since they were signing off at ten [p.m.] I figured they might be open for the idea of someone doing a soul show. Because in Sacramento at the time there was no one doing black music or soul music, if you will. And they were like a middle of the road station playing Frank Sinatra and you know, stuff like that. But I figured like, "well, they're signing off at 10:00 I could--you know from ten [p.m.] to midnight or whatever do some soul music." And eventually that's exactly what happened. After that they saw that I was really, really serious. They allowed me to do that. Now for a year--for a whole year before I got out I would go up there. They would sign off at ten [p.m.]. I would go up there and from ten p.m. until five or six [a.m.] the next morning I would be in the station by myself practicing, getting ready for my debut. Because what happened was they says, "well we don't want you to go on the air until you're out of the Air Force completely." So it was either a year or six months. I can't remember exactly. But it was a while before I was due to be released from the Air Force. So they allow--and what happened was also I had gotten--developed asthma over the years. I was in an outfit where we were flying. And since I developed asthma, I wasn't allowed to fly. So basically for a year I couldn't do anything. So I had all the time in the world on my hands. Now they also required me at that time you had to have a first class license [FCC-issued broadcasting license]. So I went and studied and got my first class license and they were impressed by that as well. So when they saw that I was serious then they gave in, and they allowed me to come in and have full reign of the station. And even now I think about "wow, that's incredible." Because they didn't know me from Adam. I could have turned the transmitter on and done who knows what! But they would leave. I would go there before the last guy got off the air. They never gave me a key per se. But I would get there before he got off the air. And I would--if I left before six a.m. the next morning, I would just lock the door.  But beyond that--to turn the transmitter on was just a flip of a switch. I could have gone on the air and said anything, and just been a complete fool. But, of course, that wasn't my agenda, but I think sometimes that, you know, it was just God sent. I mean it was--that's what was supposed to happen. They felt they could trust me and they could. So I'm very, very grateful for that.
Story_ID: 2784
Speaker 1: Before I get into the radio piece a little bit more, I'm wondering with the service, your decision to go into the [U.S.] Air Force. What that was predicated on? And two--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)That was predicated on--to keep from being drafted by the [U.S.] Army. That's what that was about (laughs), 'cause I was being hounded by the army to be drafted. And that was--this was like during the height of [the] Vietnam [War] and I didn't want that. 'Cause a lot of my buddies were drafted and they were coming back in, you know, not too good a condition. Some of them didn't come back. So I talked to the--talked to the Air Force. And the story they gave me versus Army life. It was like--this is a no brainer, if I have to go in then. And I don't regret. Don't regret it one bit. 'Cause oh God! That's one of the best times of my life. I lived real, real good when I was in the Air Force. Real good. I mean I lived off base. I had my own house. I was in a flying outfit the 5--52nd Airborne early warning squadron. And we flew--we had missions maybe--I don't know, twice a week I would fly or something like that. My rotation would come up with so many guys in it. I'd only have to fly maybe twice a week. And for the most part I was off. So I did very little work when I was in the Air Force in that sense. And, you know, made a nice little living. Lived on base for a while before I moved off base. And when I moved off base they subsidized my housing. You shopped on base at the PX [post exchange] for everything. So everything was, you know, very inexpensive. Didn't have any medical concerns. So--as a matter of fact, I even had a part-time job as a writer with the 'Sacramento Observer' [newspaper]. So I was able to make a little bit of money on the side as well as my check from the Air Force. So I was doing quite well, doing quite well. And probably would have stayed in except for I really wanted to be in radio. So that's really why I got out. But yeah, I got in the Air Force, I went in the Air Force to keep from being drafted by the Army.
Story_ID: 2785
Speaker 1: When you finally went on the air [on KPOP, radio station in Roseville, California] what did--what was that whole thing--experience like? 'Cause you've been practicing. You know for almost a year, six months.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Um-hmm
Speaker 1: You know, so what was that whole thing like?
Speaker 2: It was like I had been doing it all along. I mean Sacramento [California] was so starved for, you know some soul music. I became--I was a star (snaps fingers) just like that. I mean I got over like you would not believe, just like that. Within a week or two I was big stuff. Oh yeah, I was the man! And so all that felt real good. It felt real, real, real good. But I've never been one who let all that, you know, completely take me out and start ego-tripping and all that. But I realized the power that I had and what was--what was going on. And there were a lot of benefits to it. I mean all of a sudden--by that time I had, you know, I had my share of girlfriends. But--but when that happened it was like "oh my God!" I could just choose this one or that one. I mean I was just in heaven (laughs). So it was a good experience. Real good.
Story_ID: 2786
Speaker 1: And are you making a decent living [at KPOP, Roseville, California radio station] besides just being sort of a star of the community?
Speaker 2: I was--I was doing okay, I wasn't getting rich or anything like that. But it also--it also opened up other doors in that I got voiceover jobs from that. I got to be a spokesperson for several--like a furniture company, I was doing commercials for them, because all of a sudden I was this personality in Sacramento [California]. So yeah, tt opened up doors like that, so I was able to make a nice little living. I didn't get rich by any stretch. But, you know, fortunately I didn't need a lot. So I did okay. It lasted about a year before reality struck, and I realized that, "okay, I think it's time for me to move on." And by that time I was getting job offers from other markets. I became aware of my value to someone else, and so I got offers. I took a job in Flint, Michigan. Worked there for a couple of months and decided that I didn't want to be in Flint, Michigan. It was like the armpit of the U.S.A. in my opinion at that time. So I hightailed it back to Sacramento. But while I was in Flint though, I was able to make contact with a guy who worked at a top 40 station--a white station. So he would allow me to come in and hang out in his production room, utilize their jingles and stuff like that. So while I was there, I put together a top 40 demo tape. So when I got back to Sacramento I went down to Stockton [California]. Because what happened was--oh yeah, I went back and got--that was when I got married. I got married. And so we were laying in bed one night listening to a station out of Stockton, KSTN [Stockton, California radio station]. And the guy was--the DJ [disc jockey] was on and he was just horrible. I mean just could barely pronounce his own name. So I said to myself "if this guy can get a job in top 40, I know I can. I know. I just know I can take his job." So the next day or a day or two later, I went down to the station, met with the program director, gave him my demo, and I felt pretty confident that I was going to be able to get that guy's job. So sure enough a day or so later, the program director calls me. And he says, "well I'd like to--I'd like to bring you in." So I said, "well what time do you want me there?" You know, 'cause it was like from midnight--it was an all night shift from midnight to six a.m. I said, "well do you think I should be there by 11:30 [p.m] or 11:15 [p.m.]? How close to midnight do you want me there?" So he says, "what are you talking about?" I says, "well you said you're gonna hire me, and I'm for the all night show, right?" He says, "no, I wanted you to do afternoon drive from three [p.m.] until six [p.m.]." I'm like "oh my God! Wow! What?" So yeah. I was Mr. Big Stuff all over again (laughs). Now this wasn't San Francisco [California] or whatever, but to be a black man on a white station in a prime time--you know, morning drive and afternoon drive are the two most important shifts in radio. And to be put in that position (snaps fingers) just like that, oh, well made me feel real good about myself. So oh yeah, I accepted that in a heartbeat. And that worked out for a while. And I got an offer from their competition KJOY [Stockton, California radio station], but that was for all night, and I had to think about that. But since they paid almost twice as much as KSTN I said, "well I think I can put my ego aside and work all nights at K-joy. 'Cause I'm making almost twice as much money." So I did that for a while. Then I got an offer from KNDE [Sacramento, California radio station] up in Sacramento. Now interestingly I was commuting from Sacramento for over a year or so. And then finally me and my wife said, "well why don't we just move down to Stockton?" So about maybe three months after we moved there, then the offer came from KNDE, "Candy"as they call it, which was an alternative rock station, one of the first in the country. So again it was more money, plus it was back up in Sacramento. So I took that. And that was from seven [p.m.] to midnight. And that worked out real well. At that point I had a chance to do a lot of voiceovers for KXTV [Sacramento, California television station] channel 10.  I was the voice of channel 10 for a long time. So that worked out well. But from there I got an offer to go to Washington [D.C.] to work for WOOK radio [Washington, D.C. radio station]. And I was there for two years before I came to LA and--to work at KDAY [Los Angeles, California radio station].
Story_ID: 2787
Speaker 1: So how did you find Washington D.C. then?
Speaker 2: Oh! I loved D.C. I was back in black radio at that point, so D.C. was great--D.C. was great. Again I was doing afternoon drive from three [pm] to six [pm]. Worked--and that was pretty good--again that was more money. So they paid me a lot more money. They moved me to D.C., paid for my moving. So I was able to live pretty good in D.C. But by that time things were happening between me and my wife--we were sort of like falling apart. And plus I was wanting to move up to a bigger market. So that's why I ended up coming to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and working at KDAY [Los Angeles, California radio station]. And again it was a part-time situation. But it was for about the same amount of money I was making in D.C. So I figured like, "okay I'll be in--I'll be in LA. I can do voiceovers on the side. Whatever, whatever.  Plus I'll be in a bigger market and I'm not really going for less money. It's less work but the same money I'm getting for doing more work." So that was a no brainer. So I worked at "K-day" for a year or so. Then moved over to KGFJ [Los Angeles, California radio station] and they had a sister station called KUTE [Los Angeles, California radio station] "Cute-102." And at the same time--actually while I was at "K-day," KDAY, I was working part-time at KMPC [Los Angeles, California].  Which was like this big 50,000 watt station owned by Gene Autry [radio personality] . That's when Gary Owens [disc jockey] worked there, Wink Martindale [disc jockey]. Almost--back then, back in the 70s [1970s] all of the--all of the guys who worked there, they all had game shows. All of them had game shows. So I figured like, "well maybe I might get lucky as well." It didn't quite work out that way. But KMPC was a huge station in L.A. back then. So I worked there--I worked there part-time. Usually on the weekends, I worked at "Cute-102 and KGFJ. Then finally I was full-time at "Cute-102."
Story_ID: 2788
Speaker 1: And that's when [unclear] City came in. Frankie Crocker [disc jockey] bought the station [KUTE, Los Angeles, California radio station]. And that was sort of like the beginning of the end. That was in 1979 is when they came in. And I lasted about maybe a year under them. It just didn't quite work out. Me and Frankie didn't see eye-to-eye.
Speaker 2: Frankie was--he was quite a character they say.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh yeah, yeah.  Yeah he was.
Speaker 2: In what way?
Speaker 1: Well he was full of himself for one thing. I mean he had some--you know, he had some successes. But he was always a guy with a strong ego or at least that was his persona. As a matter of fact, Frankie used to work in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] when I was a kid. He worked at WZUM [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania radio station]. So I remembered him from there when I would go out there and hang out. He drove a [Chevrolet] Corvette [automobile]. I mean he was always a flashy flamboyant guy from the very beginning. But he was well-educated, erudite I guess you could say. But a guy who--you know, he knew what he had accomplished in life. He was accustomed to the industry, you know, just sucking up to him. Giving him anything he wanted. He made a lot of money. So you couldn't really tell him a lot. But we got in trouble because they bought "Cute-102" [KUTE]. We were already very successful in this market. This was like during the disco era. I was [rated] number two in my time period. He came in, and because he was successful at WBLS [New York, New York radio station] in New York [New York], he wanted to change everything, and did. Change everything from what we were doing that was already working, to what he was doing in New York. And it just didn't make sense. But that's what he wanted and that's what he did. It even got to the point where--he was doing a show, he was on the air on both stations at the same time. Now it wasn't like he was doing a real syndicated show where like Tom Joyner [radio host] does now, where you're just doing a show but it's carried by many different stations. He was trying to do a show whereby trying to fool the audience in thinking he was in both places at the same time. So there were a lot of times when he would open the microphone and he would give the wrong call letters because he got confused. And it was like "this is a joke. Why are you doing this?" And, of course, I was the type of person if there was something on my mind, it was hard for me to not say anything. Because there was resentment that he came in and just changed everything from top to bottom when something was already working. I mean we had to like stop doing what we were doing that was already working and do it his way, which wasn't working. So there was resentment there, and then we see this guy doing this obvious ego thing of being here and talking to a New York audience, but not thinking it through. But just saying he's WBLS while he was at "Cute-102." So he'd open the microphone and he'd be talking to the L.A. [Los Angeles] audience trying to give them New York temperature, New York--and it was like "this is just crazy. It doesn't work in the best of circumstances. It just doesn't work."
Story_ID: 2789
Speaker 1: So you ultimately--well he comes in and he lets you go--
Speaker 2: Right. Frankie [Crocker, disc jockey, radio executive] after a while, Frankie got tired of me and a few other guys always telling him that we didn't think he was all that. So one day we came in and he told us "you need to go over--" because the station [KUTE, Los Angeles, California radio station] was out in Glendale [California] and the headquarters was on Wilshire Boulevard [Los Angeles, California]. Matter of fact the same building where Cathy Hughes's [radio executive] station is. KKBT [Los Angeles, California radio station]. So he says "you need to go over to Wilshire and collect checks." We get over there--they didn't know anything about anything. But they went ahead and backed him up. And like I was saying for a long time, I was very bitter and resentful of him doing that. But as it turned out, it was probably the best thing that ever happened to me in terms of me coming to the point where I am now. Because I had to decide if I wanted to stay in radio as a jock [disc jockey] or not. And all along, I knew it was only a matter of time before I had to--before I wouldn't have a job as a jock, because the chances of me staying a jock were very slim. I mean you look around. There's just a very few guys--or very few people who are jocks for long periods of time, who--where it's a lifetime job. There's a few. But for--on average, it's just not something you can bet on. Plus on top of that, I'd gotten to the point where I was kind of tired of it anyway. I wanted to--I wanted to do my own thing. But because the money was good, I just couldn't walk away from it. It was hard for me to just walk away from that money. So he made it easy for me by separating me from that money. But at that point I had to decide if I wanted to go back and do that again in another, you know, another station, or did I really want to go into business for myself and open up my own company. Well fortunately my severance pay was enough so that I was able to--by that time already I had bought a house. So I was able to build a studio in my garage. And things took off from there.
Story_ID: 2790
Speaker 1: Once I had my studio, then I just went out and solicited business doing voice-overs as well as production itself, doing the whole thing. And it was quite lucrative for a while. Now in the meantime, I had the idea for doing a program called 'RadioScope.' Which is where this whole thing came from. So from '79 [1979] to about '83 [1983], I worked on the concept on and off. And in '83 [1983], we went on the air.
Speaker 2: And what was the concept for 'RadioScope?'
Speaker 1: Well basically to inform and entertain people about what was going on in urban entertainment. Pretty much the same focus as it is now. I mean there was no show like it then. There are several kind of like it now. But I was a big fan of 'Sixty Minutes' [television show]. So that had a big influence on me. Also 'All Things Considered' [radio show]. I was a big fan of that. So I wanted to do a show similar to that kind of a thing. So--and again it was a thing that utilized theater of the mind. So I've always been a production freak so to speak. Just in the, you know, slick production values. So it embodied that as well. But basically it was a program that informed and entertained people as to what was going on in urban/black entertainment. And that's still what it does even now.
Story_ID: 2791
Speaker 1: Now urban entertainment. What do you think its genesis? When did it sort of start? Now--and what is now the current form of what is called urban entertainment?
Speaker 2: Back in the 70s [1970s] I would say.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what do you think its genesis was? You know. What was the--sort of the beginning of it?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure if I'm clear on--
Speaker 1: Do you think--you know--was--did it come out of the disco phase?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah! Yeah.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Yeah. Okay.
Speaker 2: In that sense yeah. It was sort of like--sort of beginning or right around the same time. But the disco phase certainly helped it grow. Absolutely. As a matter of fact the term was--came into vogue because it was a way of stations not being called black or soul. That's how the term for the most part was used back then. If you were urban, it was a code word for black or soul or what have you. But advertisers were more friendly towards an urban station. So was the belief. And that's sort of like how it began.
Speaker 1: So who's considered the father of urban radio?
Speaker 2: Oh you got people like Jerry Boulding [radio executive] and even Frankie Crocker [disc jockey, radio executive] I guess to a certain--to a certain extent. But a guy that I worked for, for a while, Jerry Boulding is certainly one of them I would say.
Speaker 1: And what about--I mean because we had interviewed a man named Barry Mayo [radio programmer]. Did you ever come across him?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Barry, oh I know Barry. Sure. Sure I know Barry. Barry came along--he got in the business after me. Progressed, I mean just went (snaps fingers) right up the ladder. He became a G.M. [general manager] of stations. Then an owner of several and cashed out, took his millions and living happily ever after. But I think he's still involved in radio, I guess just for the heck of it. I think he's with ABC [American Broadcasting Company] or [BBC, British Broadcasting Corporation] Radio 1 or something like that. I'm not quite sure. But Barry has done quite well. Quite well. Yeah, so he's one of those people that I would say was a student of Jerry Boulding. Excuse me. But yeah, he made--he certainly made his mark, especially in Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 2792
Speaker 1: Now so you--you're working out of your house or whatever and you're producing these things. And then you decide to basically come up with 'RadioScope.' Which is a radio series that's syndicated. Right?
Speaker 2: (Nods for yes) um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So how do you go about--this is new to you though. I mean you've been a DJ [disc jockey]. How do you go about knowing the whole syndication business?
Speaker 2: Well I hit the bricks. I talked to anybody that would talk to me who was in syndication. I was like--I did like a home study course. I mean I was just on the phone. I was reading vociferously. I was just--I was into it. I just made sure I learned as much as I--as much as I possibly could. And really I would--if I heard about somebody doing a syndication, I would call them and ask 'em everything I could think of. And most people, most people were kind enough to answer all my questions. Take my calls and answer my questions.
Speaker 1: And what did you learn in the process?
Speaker 2: Oh God! I mean it's hard to say every, everything. But I mean I learned enough that I knew that it was something that I could accomplish. Basically put together a demo, ship it out there, ship it to the stations, follow up. If they like it, if you can get enough of them to carry the program, then you amass enough audience. With enough audience you get enough--you'll get advertiser interest. And so I just followed that. I mean it was fairly, you know, fairly simple. And so that's how it began. Excuse me. Now on the other hand, I wanted to take this to Westwood One [radio network]. And there was another guy named Bob Dockery [radio executive]. He had a company called--what was it called? Syndicate It [syndication company]. So I approached both of them. Neither one was interested. And that's how I came to do the program myself, because I couldn't find anybody else that wanted to syndicate the program. Because really I just wanted to, after--when it was all said and done, I just wanted to produce the program. Excuse me. Not be bothered with all the work of clearing stations, going after advertising so on and so forth. But after I got all these rejections from people who said, "that concept would never fly." I believed in it, you know, so much, that I said, "well I can do this myself. I'll have to do this myself." And so that's what happened. I just put some--after I got my demo together, I mailed it out to stations and would call 'em up. Well I mailed a--along with the tape, I put like a little three by five card with a questionnaire on there. Asking them "do you like the program? If not, why not? Or if you like the program, would you run the program?" You know basic questions like that to try and find out just what the response would be. And so I got enough positive responses that I said, "well I'm on to something here. So I was able to get a contract with the U.S. Army. It was my first sponsor. I went to New York [New York], sat down with them and they liked what they heard. And they decided to be the first sponsor. Now of course chump change money. They weren't crazy. But nonetheless they gave me the go ahead. So we went in with them as being the first sponsor.
Story_ID: 2793
Speaker 1: And that led to how many--you ended up being in how many markets after that?
Speaker 2: God! That is--we went on the air with I think about thirty-five affiliates we went on the air. I mean we had--but they were strong affiliates. We went on the air with New York [New York], L.A. [Los Angeles, California], Chicago [Illinois], Detroit [Michigan]. I mean we went on the air with the top ten [largest populations]. So the way radio and even television works as you know, if you have the top ten, you really--I mean what is it? 80 percent of the population lives in the top fifty and 80 percent of that lives in the top ten, so on and so forth. So if you have the top ten, everything else is gravy. You've really got everything you need. So we may have had maybe nine out of the top ten. Eight or nine out of the top ten. So we had acceptance from key markets. Key stations in key markets right off the bat. I remember here in L.A., as a matter of fact a buddy of mine name was Alonzo Miller. He said he was gonna do me a favor and only carry the program three days a week as opposed to five. Because he just couldn't believe I could come up with all that information. I mean this--you got to remember this was back in '83 [1983], when something like this just hadn't been done. So he just couldn't believe that I could find enough information to do a show five days a week plus an hour--it was like a three-minute daily program and an hour-long weekend program. He just couldn't fathom how I could do it. So I begged with him. I said, "Alonzo please just carry the program as is. Don't do me any favors please. I'll prove to you there is more than enough information out there." And so after, you know, a couple of weeks, he chilled out. But I always thought that was funny. How he thought he was doing me a favor, (laughs) trying to carry it three days a week. Of course, what he wasn't realizing from an advertiser point of view, I'm going out selling five days. And he was only gonna carry it three. It was like "oh my God! That's really gonna screw me up." Plus it didn't really make sense. But he was really sincerely trying to look out for me. And he just didn't--in his mind's eye just couldn't understand where all that information could come from.
Story_ID: 2794
Speaker 1: So you--'RadioScope' [Bailey's syndicated radio show] started in what year you say nineteen eighty--
Speaker 2: Three.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Three [1983]. And then its still going today. So it's been in existence for almost twenty--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm. Yeah.
Speaker 1: And now are there certain things that you consider significant, you know, in its--you know in its life? You know. Or certain milestones along the way?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah I guess I could say the infamous Chaka Khan [singer] interview. That's one that people talked about and still talk about for a long time. I interviewed her at a hotel here [Los Angeles, California]. And we don't know if she was shall we say under the influence or not. But she said some pretty wild things. And when it aired, wow! The phones went crazy. I mean people loved it because it was a very real interview. That's the thing that--you know, over the years I've gotten people to really give it up to me, and I don't know why that happens. I mean people will tell me some of the most sensational things and I don't know why. But we had this conversation. She almost alluded to how she lets her son, you know, sleep with her. And so--it probably--I'm not sure if it makes sense to even talk about it now. But, you know. "Oh go ahead! No, no. Go ahead!" (Laughs). But--well it's all factual. And if I don't, you know, misstate myself. But anyway it almost sounded like there was something else going on between her and her son. And I'm like hearing this. And I'm saying, "wow!" And so I said, "you don't mean--you don't mean--" She says, "that you mean--are you trying to say you don't--are you trying to say do I sleep with my son? Do I--no. Do I have relations with my son?" I said, "yeah. That's what its sounding like." "No I don't." But when you hear this thing, the way she's talking you couldn't help but to think, "is she saying what I think she's saying?" "And my son looks at me like a lover would." That kind of thing. You know, that kind of language. I'm like, "am I hearing this correctly?" So after that interview aired, my God! Like I say the phones went berserk! People wanting a copy of that. So that was one of the highlights. Another one was the late George Howard [saxophonist]. George was a flautist? Was he a saxophonist? I can't remember now. Anyway I was interviewing him. And it just--we just got off on the bad--on a bad foot. I mentioned something about his music being called jazz, and he didn't like that. He just didn't like that at all. So he ended up taking his microphone off and throwing his--throwing it down. And the last thing you hear as he walks out, "I'm gonna tell Larry on you." (Laughs). To this day I'm like, "what? Who in the hell is Larry? And why are you gonna tell Larry on me?" I haven't a clue. I don't know to this day what that was all about. But again it was one of those interviews where you could just cut it with a knife, because he just was not feeling me to the point where he walked out. But like I say it just became a joke when he said, "I'm telling Larry on you." Who is Larry?
Story_ID: 2795
Speaker 1: So you--what other stories do you have? Were there others that were--and how did you go about choosing your first--the subjects you went after?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we were just--even now, I mean we're covering who's hot and who has a story or who's in the public eye. I mean it's like [Sean] "Puffy" [Combs, record producer, rapper]. I'd love to sit down with Puffy and interview him. Just like you're [interviewer Julieanna Richardson] sitting down talking to me. You're choosing people for their celebrity value or their value of some kind. And these people had music out. They were artists. Or some had movies out, whatever. I mean like I say we're [Bailey's radio show 'RadioScope']--the same thing as 'Entertainment Tonight' [television show] or any kind of entertainment magazine be it print or television or what have you. They're the people that the public is interested in. So that's our job is to interview them. Now where we sometimes get in trouble is that--or where I sometimes get in trouble I guess--is that I never look at it as if I'm working for the P.R. [public relations] firm. I mean I'm there to get a story. I mean I don't know why, but I sort of consider myself a journalist. So I'm digging. I'm going for--going for the juice. I'm not trying to come away with the most personal and intimate story of someone's sex life and all that. I'm not--I don't go there for that. But if it comes up, and if--I have a rule. If somebody mentions something three times in an interview, well I'm gonna go there and investigate that. Because like "you keep mentioning this. So obviously there's something of interest here for some reason." So I'll go there and find out what that's all about. And I've been able to find out some pretty interesting things over the years. And then there are some people, of course, you don't vibe well. I'm sure you've come across people where you just--it just--just doesn't work out. They just don't like you. Or maybe--and sometimes maybe it's not necessarily them being personal with you. They just maybe don't like the interview process or don't like being asked certain questions or what have you. And so it just--it just isn't working. So I've had my share of that. But for the most part though, I would say I'm probably--I think I'm a better interviewer than I am an interviewee. Matter of fact I know I'm a far better interviewer than I am a subject. But I'm getting better though.
Story_ID: 2796
Speaker 1: Now what other programs have come along since that time?
Speaker 2: Well we've done--we [Lee Bailey Communications, Inc., Bailey's production company] have an award-winning program called 'King: From Atlanta to the Mountaintop' that--we can't stop playing it. That program was done in eighty--let's see, '85 [1985]? '85 or '86 [1986]? It's a three-hour doc[umentary]-drama. It's just a very, very powerful program that, like I say, stations to this day, every [Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] Holiday they have to play that program. It's become a tradition with certain stations. So that's something I'm very, very proud of. Very, very proud of. Even the Library of Congress has a copy of that. Then we have a Marvin Gaye [singer] program called, 'Marvin Gaye We Miss You.' Another docu-drama that is highly revered. And again every year around Marvin's birthday stations have to air that, because of the quality of it and the story itself. You know, very--if you know Marvin's story, then you know it was nothing but drama. As was Dr. [Martin Luther] King's story. So we're--you know, we're sort of like really kind of--really kind of a company--or our productions always have--pretty much have a dramatic element. You know, some sense of drama about 'em because that's just--I don't know. That's sort of our forte. You know lots of information. But again that infotainment angle. That's sort of the cornerstone of what we're all about, is infotainment. So, you know, making it informative and entertaining at the same time. So.
Story_ID: 2797
Speaker 1: How did you get involved with--is it EEUR Web?
Speaker 2: 'EUR' [Electronic Urban Report] Web--E-U-R and 'E-U-R Web.'
Speaker 1: Right. How did that come about?
Speaker 2: That came about because several things. Once I became aware of the Internet and the [World Wide] Web, I knew that, that was the next phase as far as I'm concerned. Plus I see myself as a information provider, not a radio company, but an information provider. I mean I hope to some day be sitting where you are or be doing something similar. In other words television is part of my game plan as well at some--hopefully some day I'll be there. But television, print, what have you. I want to be involved in the dissemination of information. I saw the Internet to me as the next logical step, on the one hand because its multimedia, but on the other hand, it was also another way of getting in front of radio people to show them that we had--we have all of this information that they could have by carrying our programs. So that was--because you have these--in radio you have these prep shows--not prep shows but prep services. So this was one way of competing with them as opposed to say charging for it. I could give it away. So we were able to reach--or are able to reach the public at large as well as radio itself. So 'EUR' is used by almost every urban outlet as show prep, I mean because we have something in every issue for the jocks to talk about. So that's been very, very successful for us.
Speaker 1: And you--what did--what has the--what is your experience, you know, with 'EUR?' What has it taught you? You know, that you didn't know? I mean--
Speaker 2: I'm--you know, I'm not sure if it's taught me anything about the news business you're saying? Or?
Speaker 1: Well I mean has it taught you--? Did you get feedback that you didn't otherwise get?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Oh! Well--
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) You know, that you wouldn't get in radio? That's all I'm saying.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Oh yeah. In that sense yeah. Oh well the whole--plus we were interactive.  I mean that whole thing. Oh yeah. I mean you get--the feedback is (snaps fingers) instant. I mean sometimes we would do something--but we--but in a way though as I think about it, that's sort of a carry over from our 'RadioScope' program. Because even 'RadioScope,' we sort of in our minds pioneered that interactive element. We've always from the very beginning--we had what we call the feedback line. Where we just put a number out there for people to--as I told you before, we're getting phone calls about the Chaka Khan thing ['RadioScope interview with the singer]. I think we were like the first show--the first entertainment show that had, like a number people could call and leave their questions or comments or what have you. So I knew that that was very important. I mean I know people--your average person, they want to express themselves or they have questions or what have you. They want to be involved. So when I did the 'EUR,' that to me was a natural. And of course, the Internet lends itself to that with e-mail and the whole interactive--interactive aspect of the Internet. I wanted to make sure we involved that. But now interestingly enough, there are publications on line that don't want to hear. And there are websites--there's no way in the world you can send them e-mail or contact them whatsoever. They don't want to hear from you. Which to me is like, "are you crazy?" They don't give out their e-mail address. You cannot contact--they don't have a phone number. There's no way in the world you can contact them. There are even publications online I've come across--same way. It's like to me "that's insane!" The best thing you can do is provide interactivity. Give people a way to feed back to you. And that's one of our secrets. I mean I can't believe some of these other--some of our competition doesn't do that--like "duh, are you crazy?"

Speaker 1: So this--what are your plans for your--you know, from this point on? What are you wanting to do and accomplish?
Speaker 2: Well as I said, I mean I'm really looking at being a information provider for all platforms--cell phones, pagers, television, radio, print. It doesn't matter. I want to be in the mix regardless of platform, and that's where we're starting to head now. I really like the international element of where we are now. With the [Inter]net, I mean you can have a worldwide audience in which we do. Radio, well you can have one if you have the proper distribution and all that. But it's not quite, quite the same. I mean with the Net people--oh God! I mean we get email from people all over the world, from places that you would think would never care less about what going on in black American--black entertainment.
Speaker 1: Now how many people is it taking to staff the Internet part of, you know, Bailey--
Speaker 2: There's only about--there's only about four, five or six. It's a very small staff.
Speaker 1: And are there--are you going to stay with the free model? You think? Is there--you know the Internet--it was like the "Wild Wild West." And now, you know, you've survived the dot com [collapse, devaluation of Internet technology stocks in the early 2000s].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. We've been very fortunate. We're doing something right. Sometimes I wonder like "wow, why are we still here?" You know what, I think we will to a certain extent for the most part. Because I think it's easier to get people to come if it's free. But we're starting to learn how to introduce elements that will be for pay--in other words a premium. A premium level is what we're beginning to learn how to introduce. Because I don't want to get any--put anything in the way of the masses coming in. So when the mass is coming in, it's like enough of them will pay for some of this--some of this content, or certain kinds of content. And that's how we're--that's how we plan on approaching that. As well as--like I said, by providing content to other media, other platforms. So we were starting to have success in syndicating/selling our content to other websites, as well as--we just signed a deal with this pager alert service. What do you call them when you get your little alerts on your two way and stuff like that? And then we're talking with Sprint [Corporation, telecommunication company] now. So the potential is just enormous.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) As well as selling it to them and then taking advertising space and being able to sell that to where we're seeing all the numbers we're starting to amass on a daily basis now. And I'm like looking "gee, merry Christmas. We've got millions of people looking at us. This is worth something to somebody."
Story_ID: 2799
Speaker 1: Now what--who's your--who's your Internet audience [for Bailey's website 'EUR Web']? What is the age range?
Speaker 2: The age range for the most part is an adult audience. When I say adult, probably eighteen to twenty-nine, with a focus being in the twenty-three to about thirty age range. Interestingly, in my opinion, primarily females. I don't know why. I don't know why. But I would say probably a 60-40, 70-30 split of females is what it's--the preponderance has been from the beginning and still is. I don't know why that is. I have no clue. And we don't do things from a female point of view. Certainly I've got--I've got female writers. A couple of 'em. But the--there's always been--well, you know, I'm at the head of it. And I don't see things from a female point of view. I try to see 'em from--you know, a humanistic point of view. But not a female point of view. But we're pushing some--all the right buttons as far as the ladies are concerned for whatever reason. So I don't know. I'm not gonna--I'm not gonna fight it. It is what it is. So.
Story_ID: 2800
Speaker 1: Now did the dot com collapse [devaluation of Internet technology stocks in the early 2000s], did that affect you at all?
Speaker 2: I can't say that it really did. I think the economy being a little sour right now [July 2001] has more of an affect than the dot com collapse. No I don't--I don't think--the dot com collapse itself did, because I wasn't able to get any of that dot com money. So when that dot com money went away, it didn't affect me at all because I didn't have any of it. You know, unfortunately I've had to do everything out of my own pocket. So it didn't matter to me. I'm kind of like grateful a lot of 'em are gone. But I think that's the way it is anyway. You know, you--it was a shaft kind of a thing. So after all the crapola leaves you got the real, the real stuff. And I think we're still here because we offer value. We really have something of value. We found a niche. That's why I think we're still here.
Speaker 1: Now how are you supporting this enterprise? And does the radio support the Internet venture? Or--I mean how--you know, how has that, you know, come about?
Speaker 2: Well, we are able to sell advertising and sponsorships. Now 90 percent of that we sell is for 'EUR' ['Electronic Urban Report,' Bailey's online publication]. When I say--in other words, there are advertisers who are buying 'EUR.' Now we have a couple of advertisers who are buying 'EUR' and the radio element. So in a sense, we're learning how to sell them--to sell the combo of radio and Internet. Which is a--or as they call it, an integrated platform approach. So I think that makes a lot of sense as well. Because there are some that want--you know, advertisers want one stop shopping. That's why we also have a print vehicle called 'EUR Infotainer.' Which is a limited release in the L.A. [Los Angeles, California] area at restaurants and what have you. But our plan is to make it national as well. So--but that's why you see all of these media companies doing radio--television, cable and print, billboards and what have you. Because they want to be known as a media outlet. And again that goes back to part of a plan of either supplying information to all of these other media platforms or working out a deal whereby we can have advertising on all of these other platforms.
Story_ID: 2801
Speaker 1: Now are you excited about your life right now and where you are?
Speaker 2: (Laughs).
Speaker 1: Or are you a tired entrepreneur?
Speaker 2: I am a tired entrepreneur. But I'm excited as well. I have to admit I'm excited. I mean I do this because I'm really--you know, I'm passionate about it. Now I would have to admit I would like to make more money. I would love to be debt free. As of right now, Uncle Lee has a little debt baggage holding him down. But once we're free of that, and it looks like things are, you know, just right around the corner from having all of my problems taken care of. So God willing, that'll be behind me, you know, fairly soon. And things will be real smooth from that point. As far as I can see.
Story_ID: 2802
Speaker 1: Now in terms of, you know, the entertainers and things that you, you know, focused on or--because a lot of your focus even though you've been in the majority markets, you have been focused on the urban. You know, whatever. Urban or minority market. And I'm just wondering if you see--what do you think about that market? Is it a market that--I mean you're forty-seven--how old did you--no. You're fifty--
Speaker 2: Three.
Speaker 1: Fifty-three. So I mean this is a whole new group of people. Even though I know you say that, you know, your audience goes up to forty-nine. But it is--
Speaker 2: And even older. I'm just saying on average. Now we have people my age and older, which--I didn't talk about that. I mean that always freaks me out as well. That people my age and even older--but see I guess maybe it's like me. I don't consider myself some old fogey or something. Not by a long stretch. I mean--I guess I think like a thirty--not think like a thirty-five year old, but I don't know. I mean I'm into contemporary music and entertainment. I'm not stuck in the '70s [1970s] or the '60s [1960s], or the '80s [1980s] or what have you. I mean I appreciate that; I like it. But, you know, I want to know what's going on with the Puffys [Sean "Puffy" Combs, record producer, rapper] and you know. Every other--you know, the J-Los [Jennifer Lopez, singer, actress]--Jennifer Lopezes and Mariah Careys [Mariah Carey, singer] and, you know, whatever rapper. I mean that interests me. That's where my head is. And apparently a lot of other people are interested as well. I think a lot of the baby boomers--you know, I think we're different from other generations that have come along in that as opposed to us just being--now there's still a lot of us that like--that are stuck in the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s], but there's a whole bunch that are not necessarily stuck there. Now we know that, we appreciate that, but we want to be in the mix. And I don't see myself growing--not yet at least. Now having said that, I don't like every rap song I hear. I don't like every R&B song I hear. I don't like every gospel song I hear. I simply like what I like regardless of genre. Some country songs I like, just 'cause I like 'em. So I'm looking forward to getting older and being this hip old dude. 'Cause, you know, quiet as it's kept, I can still boogie with the best of 'em. And that's the truth. I'm no slouch on the dance floor--one of the few things I can do. And I enjoy that. I enjoy--I remember there was a time Bobby Brown [singer]--this was years ago when he first came out with New Edition [R&B group]. You know he's always prided himself on being a hot dancer. He was at a party one time. He's of course, a lot younger. But I had to show him a few things he hadn't seen before. So I still remember that. I said, "yeah see. I may be older than you. Just because I'm older than you, doesn't mean I'm ready for a wheelchair young man."
Story_ID: 2803
Speaker 1: Who are some of your favorite artists?
Speaker 2: Who are some of my favorite artists? Well I like Luther [Vandross, singer]. I like Luther. I still like Teddy [Pendergrass, singer]. And I miss some of the, you know, the real singers. I think that's one of the problems nowadays. You don't have a lot of singers with character in their voices. I mean one of the biggest problems we have nowadays everything is so producer-driven and there's such an emphasis on youth by the labels. And that's partly because the people who buy records for the most part are kids. But there's that emphasis on youth. So you get these--and so many one-hit wonders. And it's all about the looks, so you don't really have as much I think talent as there once was. So of new people, God! It's hard to say. I mean Mariah [Carey, singer]. I kinda like Mariah. I don't mind looking at her as well. This new girl this Alicia Keys [singer]. Jill Scott [singer], Maxwell [singer]. I guess I'm kind of attracted to them because they have like that old soul, you know, literally and figuratively about them. Their music and their spirit seems to have some substance to it. And again they have a certain character in their voices. They're not like "it could just be anybody." You know, when you hear them, you know who they are. And that's what I appreciate--that's the kind of personality I like. Somebody that when I hear them, "oh that's so-and-so--that's Maxwell. That's Jill Scott." You know who--you know who you're talking about. You know who that is I guess I should say. That kind of thing. So those people off the top of my head that I can think of. On the other hand, you know, Denzel [Washington, actor]. He's no spring chicken anymore, but you know. When it comes to acting, he's the man. He's Samuel L. [Jackson, actor]. He's great. Omar Epps [actor] is very good. Who have I seen recently? I'm trying to think of who I've seen. Well there--you know, it's hard to think of 'em off the top of my head. But, you know, Halle Berry [actress]. I like looking at her (laughs). And she's a pretty good actress as well. And her husband Eric Benet [musician] as a artist. I think he's on to something. As a matter of fact, he's got a new album coming out real soon. So I'm looking forward to--forward to hearing that. So I'm not ready to retire just yet. I'm in the game.
Story_ID: 2804
Speaker 1: Now the other thing I want--when you think about the young boy who was in Georgia listening to the radio. You know, and you think of where you are now. What are your thoughts about that? You know that transition that has happened?
Speaker 2: Wow. I don't think that young boy would know this guy. It's easier for this guy to know that young boy. But I mean when I was--as I think back I had no clue that I would come this far. And now that I am this far, I want to go a lot, lot farther. But no, I didn't think I'd ever get this far. I mean I'm still flaggered that I'm sitting right here. To me--that's what I told you before. How'd you guys [the HistoryMakers] choose me? Because it's still mindblowing to me that somebody knows that--you know, a lot of people know that I'm here. I mean I just--I don't know why that is. I have a hard time accepting compliments. Always have. Because to me its just, "just do it." I mean I'm not in it for the accolades and all that necessarily. Every once in a while--and then after having said that, there are days I do wonder if anybody knows I'm here. But for the most part though, honestly I can say I'm doing it because I enjoy doing it. I get my cookie doing what I do, because I really, really like it. I'm not doing it for somebody else necessarily. But like I say having said that, that there are some days you wonder if you're being appreciated. And I guess so, because you're [interviewer Julieanna Richardson] here talking to me. And I'm like "wow." I look at the other names of the people you've interviewed and it's like "wow! You're doing all these famous people and I'm one of 'em. This is mind-boggling." Or when I meet somebody. I mean I've met people over the years that trip out on me. I mean it's like you meet a Johnnie Cochran [attorney] and he's like a fan of yours. It's like (makes non-verbal exclamation). Or other famous people that you're just enamored of and it's like they're enamored of you. But they know how to handle it better. They're cooler about it than I am. I'm like "oh God! I can't believe this. You get off on me? When it's like I think you are the bomb?" So that--you know that's a real big thrill to know that, you know, you're having an effect on someone. And to know that--well there are people that have been inspired by me too. This girl, oh God, tt went right out of my head as I was thinking about her. She's a new artist on Motown. I can see her face, I can't think of her name. So I shouldn't even try it. But hopefully it'll come to me in a moment or two. But one of my people interviewed her and she told them that I was one of the reasons why she stayed in the business, because a long time ago at a conference I gave her encouraging words, and took the time, I don't know, took a half-hour, an hour or whatever and just talked to her. Now, of course, I don't remember her from squat. But--India.Arie [singer]--now that's like "great! Wow! This girl's becoming a big star now." And she tells the story of how one day a long time ago, several years ago, when she was quote unquote nobody, I took the time to talk to her. And give her the benefit of what I know and encourage her. And, you know, I always try and encourage people. If I can't really help 'em per se I'll try and encourage 'em. I always tell people, "Look if you really believe--and it's a simple thing. But if you really believe in it, go for it. Don't let anyone stop you. Bottom line. If you really, really believe in it, then it's worth doing. Do it. Go for it." It's just that simple.
Story_ID: 2805
Speaker 1: And two more questions. I want to ask about the importance--what you see the importance of Urban radio to this, you know, to the world? And what importance--where do you see it in the whole scheme of things?
Speaker 2: Well I mean on the one hand I have mixed feelings. Because I think urban radio is not all it could be honestly. I think urban radio and radio in general is not all it could be, in the sense of it providing information--again I go back to me being an information freak. And you get very little information and very little innovation and variety from urban radio, and music radio in general as far as I'm concerned. Now you're starting to hear a little bit more, but I'm coming from a point of view as a syndicator, a person who produces programs. And the walls that are thrown up to us. It's just incredible. I mean the barriers we have to deal with to get stations to air our programs. Now some of that is because of the consolidation. Stations going out--companies going out and buying everything they can see, so they have a huge debt load, and so they don't want to give up inventory--you know, commercial inventory. Because generally programs are distributed on a barter basis. In other words, stations don't have to buy them, we give them to the stations in exchange for commercial minutes. A lot of 'em are refusing in that sense. But whatever the reason, the fact that you really don't get a lot of--you get very little information other than what the jocks are taking from 'EUR Web' ['Electronic Urban Report,' Bailey's online publication] or maybe some other prep shows. But as far as like news, you don't hear news on the radio--on music radio, urban radio. Sunday mornings you don't hear a lot of public affairs shows. I mean, there are a lot of issues that need to be dealt with still. In the community at large and certainly within the black community. Now urban radio is in a perfect position to champion those issues. But for the most part, they'd rather not. They'd rather just play music. So I fault radio--that's where radio I think falls down.
Story_ID: 2806
Speaker 1: I say that if radio isn't careful, it might find itself extinct because of the Internet. Now some people don't buy that. I'm not gonna say its gonna go away within the next five years, but there are so many advances coming along that radio I don't think is gonna have the same kind of appeal or power I guess in the coming years. And neither will television. I really see the [Inter]net as being the end all, be all--and neither will print because again the net in terms--to my way of thinking encompasses all that. I don't see it replacing any of the other media but I see it becoming so huge that it's going to effect the other media, so that if they keep doing the same things they're doing like radio just insists on being a jukebox, it's gonna shoot itself in the foot. Because when I want information the last place I think of to go is radio--unless it's all news or what have you. But we're talking as far as black information is concerned, it's not there. That's where I think the [World Wide] Web comes in. Now if a station--that's just one example. Then you have your thing like with say traffic reports, and, you know, well things you need like weather reports. Well traffic is a good example. It makes more sense to log on, find out what the traffic patterns are before you jump in the car. Or if you're--nowadays what they use navigational things. You can find out radio can't be personalized like that. You have traffic report now, they're talking about what's going on, on the 405 freeway [interstate highway in Los Angeles, California]. Well if you're on the 134 [highway in Los Angeles, California] or if you're in South Central [Los Angeles, California] on a surface street, it doesn't affect you. I mean so a radio traffic report as an example can't personalize. It can't tell you exactly what you want when you want it. It's impossible for it to do that. So that's why I say the little things are chipping away. Like when you want to hear music, you want to hear the song you want to hear when you want to hear it. Radio can't do that. The Web or the Net can. Now--it's not there yet, but certainly the promise and possibility of all that is looming large. Then you have the thing of Net radio being wireless. Or radio or the Net itself being a wireless proposition. So it's not inconceivable you can drive around and listen to Web based radio stations or Web based music services, what have you. Where you can play what you want to play or even--who knows. I mean nowadays you can program your own music, upload your own music to a web site and play it back wherever you are. I mean it's just--there're so many combinations of things you can do in this digital world. Whereas in an analog world of radio, it's just, you know. That's pretty much it. Whereas now otherwise it's all over. Wherever your mind can go, you can go.
Story_ID: 2807
Speaker 1: I want to know if you have been concerned of the consolidation that's happened, you know, in the radio business. That there basically almost two owners. Clear Channel [media conglomerate] and Viacom [media conglomerate]. I mean there's, you know, West[wood One, radio network]--I mean there are others.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Does that concern you at all?
Speaker 2: No not--overall no. No it hasn't. Because again I go back to what I was saying before. They weren't exactly taking all of our programs. You know maybe I shouldn't say--I mean yes it does, but I don't know that it concerns me any more than before. Because we've had the problem before and we're still having the problem. Which to me is kind of ironic. Now that we don't have competition, it seems like it would be open to more programs, because they really--you know, what have you got to lose? But again I think as I said before, I think because of the consolidation and the cost of the consolidation they're maybe closed to outside programs, because they want to keep all of the inventory for themselves. Now I think maybe the way to go, something I've been thinking about, is maybe the--it's time to look at another model. Maybe the barter model needs to be dropped or re-examined. In that I'm thinking that maybe it's time to go to stations and say, "look we'll sell you this here. For x amount of money, we can just sell you this," and not have to worry about them giving us--being concerned with them giving us [advertising] time. Because on the other hand, they're gonna have to do something. They can't--I just don't see them being successful by playing the same songs over and over and over. Again like I said I think things like the [Inter]net among other things, television by having the kind of variety of programs that are on television, is just showing radio to be too one dimensional. By playing the music and playing the same twenty or thirty songs over and over. So at some point in time, somebody's gonna wake up and realize "we have to have more programming." So if they're not in a position to barter it, then maybe they'll buy it.

Speaker 1: Your grandfather [J.C. Bailey] passed away when?
Speaker 2: I can't remember what year. But he was ninety-four--94, 95, 96. It was maybe '81 [1981], two [1982], three [1983] or something like that.
Speaker 1: What do you think? He saw some of your success though.
Speaker 2: He saw some of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He didn't see a lot of it--I guess I was out here [Los Angeles, California] and he was back in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) What do you think he would say if he could see you now?
Speaker 2: Well he even admitted that, you know, he was proud of me. And so he saw that I wasn't that--he used to call me a lazy scoun (laughs). So he saw that he was wrong about that. So we settled that a long time ago. He found out that I was not that lazy little scoun that he used to call me.
