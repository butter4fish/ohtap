Speaker 2: No.  I would like to have more vacations then I do have.
Speaker 1: And the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?

Story_ID: 646642
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well I'm gonna ask about your family history, I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Philip McKayle, Sr.] side, but we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Her name is Wi- my mother was Eva, E-V-A, Wilhelmina, W-I-L-H-E-L-M-I-N-A, Cohen, C-O-H-E-N [Eva Cohen McKayle].
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, she was born January 26th, 1898.  And she was born in Jamaica, British West Indies at the time.
Speaker 1: And she's--you were telling me earlier she's from Ocho Rios [Jamaica]?
Speaker 2: Ocho Rios, yes.
Speaker 1: Now can you--what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family, how far back can you trace it?
Speaker 2: Well, I never was in Jamaica.  I've been all around the world, I've never been to Jamaica.  So it's in the recent twenty or so years, I've been meeting my mother's and father's side of the family.  I've been--I, I, I know of course my--her immediate family like her sister Louise [Louise Cohen], but they're not around anymore.  My mother's family are all gone.  And my Uncle Gussy [Gussy Cohen], and he was a very big man in Harlem [New York, New York] when I was a little boy growing up.  He had a club called Jocks Place [New York, New York] that introduced people like [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt to the cafe society world.  And I think that's most of the people that I really know from my mother's family.
Speaker 1: Now, the Cohen is a Jewish name and is there a story there?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother's father William Lionel Cohen [William Cohen] was an English Jew.  He came from England to Jamaica to--with his brother.  They managed the sugar plantations of Sir John Pringle, who was a Scottish landowner.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they came over as managers of a sugar plantation.  Now, what about your grandmother, do you know anything about her?
Speaker 2: I--I never met her.  Never--I never spoke to her over the phone.  I've just seen pictures of her.
Speaker 1: Do you know her name?
Speaker 2: No. I do know it, but I can't remember it.
Speaker 1: And she never--she never lived in the United States I guess?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet Mr. Cohen, your grandfather?
Speaker 2: No, I spoke to him over the phone when I was a little boy, never met him.
Speaker 1: So, he maintained a relationship with his daughter over the years?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And--and both of his daughters and his, his son, Gussy, who was the one who had the club in--in New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Now, your Uncle Gussy, this Jocks Place, so this is a popular club, was the club in Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was in Harlem, 137th [Street] and 7th [7th Avenue; Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard] I think.
Speaker 1: So this is right in the heart of Harlem?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So he was--was his club, I guess, popular during the heyday of Harlem?
Speaker 2: It was very popular and he and his wife lived on Sugar Hill up, up, up above Harlem.
Speaker 1: Now, that yeah, that's the--that's kind of a ritzy area for Harlem, right, Sugar Hill?
Speaker 2: It was yeah.  That's where it got its name (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah a lot of, you know, young people, you know, associate it with the name of the Sugarhill Gang, you know, they're rappers, but that's in New York is known as Sugar Hill?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, you know, very beautiful apartments overlooking the park.  If you look down you can see Harlem below it.
Story_ID: 646643
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Eva Cohen McKayle]--now did she grow up in Ocho Rios [Jamaica]?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother grew up in Ocho Rios and she didn't come to the United States until the '20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: Was her brother already here at that time?
Speaker 2: I don't know that, I don't know when he came, but they we--her bro- both her brother and sister [Louise Cohen] were here, so they all came to New York [New York], I don't know when.
Speaker 1: They could've all come at once.
Speaker 2: Could be, but I have no idea.
Speaker 1: But he got involved.  How did--is there a story about he established the club [Jocks Place, New York, New York] or how he was able to do that?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  He was a very up to do, well to do relatives.  I don't know very much about him other than he was Uncle Gussy [Gussy Cohen] and he was well off.
Speaker 1: Do you know if he was well off before he left Jamaica?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was wondering if he made his fortune there or, or made his money there before he got here, and established the club or made it here?
Speaker 2: Now you've given me something to find out about (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, essentially, Harlem's [New York, New York] Jamaican community is a powerful community.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is--there's probably a story that probably a lot of people who can probably tell it, I'm thinking, just thinking.  But, so your mother had--did she have a chance to finish school in Jamaica?
Speaker 2: Yes, she went to business school after graduating from early school and she learned to be a sho- to do shorthand and that was her business, she was gonna come up here and do that.
Speaker 1: So, did your mother have any stories that she shared with you about growing up in Ocho Rios?
Speaker 2: Lots of stories and you know, I heard most of them when my daughters [Gabrielle McKayle and Liane McKayle] asked her about her life.  She was very happy to tell them, but I don't remember her telling me many stories.  But she would talk about pappy bringing the buggy out and hitching the horse to it and they went riding, 'cause that's the era of horse and carriage.  Going through Fern Gully [Ocho Rios, Jamaica] where the ferns were so large they would lace above the road and you would be in the shade.
Speaker 1: Did she--so, was she raised by her father [William Cohen]?
Speaker 2: Father and mother, yes.
Speaker 1: So he was fairly well off coming here as a manager of a plantation?
Speaker 2: Well, he never came to the United States, but in Jamaica yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in Jamaica, well yeah in Jamaica that's what I mean.  I'm getting my, you know, I consider Jamaica here too (laughter).  But that's my problem.  So he was doing, you know, fairly well.  So she--she was raised under fairly--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --nice conditions?
Speaker 2: She would say they lived in a stone cottage and she said whenever there were hurricanes, they would gather all the people from around and bring them inside in case their wooden houses would blow away.
Speaker 1: Now did your mother meet your father [Philip McKayle, Sr.] before she came?
Speaker 2: No, they met in New York City.  Like people from other countries who come to the United States, they live in communities where there are other people from where they came from.  I don't think they would ever have met in Jamaica.  They met here.  Because there's sort of class distinction in Jamaica and my mother was very well to do.  My father was from Cornwall Mountain [Jamaica], which is up in the mountains and I don't think they would have ever met in Jamaica.
Speaker 1: That's interesting because your mother with a Jewish father, she was lighter skinned--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --than your father.  Your father being from the mountains did, did he have Maroon heritage?
Speaker 2: He--they talked about the Maroons, but he wasn't, no.  He, he wasn't from a Maroon family.
Story_ID: 646644
Speaker 1: Let's go to your father's side and then we'll, we'll talk about how they met.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Philip Augustus McKayle: P-H-I-L-I-P, A-U-G-U-S-T-U-S, and then McKayle, M-C-K-A-Y-L-E [Philip McKayle, Sr.].
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in June--no August, August 8th, two--what is the date now, 1902.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's a little bit younger than your mother [Eva Cohen McKayle]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1902.  And he was born in--
Speaker 2: He was born in Jamaica.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the place?
Speaker 2: Where he lived?
Speaker 1: Yeah (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Cornwall Mountain [Jamaica].
Speaker 1: Cornwall Mountain, okay.  Cornwall Mountain.  From what I understand, Cornwall in Britain is like a jagged kind of sea coast, you know, is Cornwall Mountain comparable to that, you know?
Speaker 2: I don't know that.
Speaker 1: What do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: I don't know very much about them.  I've seen pictures of my grandmother [Maria Mair McKayle], my father's mother, she's dressed in white, a little white hat on her head.  But I never met any of those relatives, so I don't know them.
Speaker 1: What did your father say about his parents?
Speaker 2: He talked mostly about growing up in Jamaica and going to school.  But he didn't talk that much about his parents.  I don't know anything about his father [John McKayle].
Speaker 1: You don't even know what kind of work he did or anything?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know what he did.
Speaker 1: So do you get the sense that your father, well he went to--he was able to go to school, so they, you know, did you have any sense of what kind of means his family had?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  He was a very intelligent man.  He came here and he was a maintenance man at the Trans-Lux theater [New York, New York], which was a theater that showed newsreels, because of course there was no television at that time.  And they would show the news, the eyes and ears of the world ['Paramount News'] in news theaters.  And there were several of them in New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: I never heard of those.  Now this is something that's--
Speaker 2: Trans-Lux theater.
Speaker 1: Always learn something new in these interviews.  But a lot of people know what I don't know, you know.  But they had actually news theaters in New York?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And then he worked as a maintenance man at the Copacabana [New York, New York].  That was always fun and I would be invited to go with him during my vacations and we would go to the Copacabana.  I remember being there one day and he was trying to entertain me.  He was polishing the dance floor and he put steel wool pads on his feet and he was sort of gliding around and dancing, much for--to my amusement.  Then we heard these applause behind us, we looked around and there was Carmen Mir- Miranda, 'cause she was the headliner there.  And she was enjoying it just as much as I was.
Speaker 1: Carmen Miranda is famous for the hat with the fruit on it?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, that was one of the selling points of the Copacabana, yes.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  This is, so this is, so he would actually skate across the floor with the steel wool (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, skating, moving and gliding.
Story_ID: 646645
Speaker 1: Now this is gonna reoccur in your story I know from--from the book ['Transcending Boundaries: My Dancing Life,' Donald McKayle]. So, but, now well tell us then, is there any--do you know, you know, you know we all would suppose he left to Jamaica to come to New York [New York] for a better life, okay, but did he have relatives in New York City or did he just come cold on his own?
Speaker 2: There was a whole community, they knew each other, but I don't know who came first or what have you.  But there was a very strong Jamaica community that we grew up with, Mr. and Mrs. Samuels, and other people, and I just thought I grew up that way, that was it.  I didn't know of their comings and goings before I was born.
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense that they were from the same region, were they from Cornwall Mountain [Jamaica], I mean most of your father's associates or?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, I think so.
Speaker 1: And that's often the case with African Americans that moved from the South to the North.  In the town, will establish a church and a neighborhood or maybe even where same and similar, you know, people with same or similar backgrounds would gather.  So your dad [Philip McKayle, Sr.] was able to, you said he was able to finish school in Jamaica?
Speaker 2: Yes, I don't know how far he went in his school, but he finished high school.  I think I was the first one to go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay, now then, is there a story about how your parents met and fell in love?
Speaker 2: They met at a social event where they were brought together for--in a party in that--that--that way.  I don't think, as I said, they would ever have met in New York. They found each other in Jamaica--they found each other in New York.
Speaker 1: So being an immigrant sort of transcended class differences?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very much so. I'm first generation United States.
Story_ID: 646646
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their sense of humor, what they look like, what they--how they walked, talked and their talents, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think I'm a mixture of the two of them.  My mother [Eva Cohen McKayle] was very close to me and she raised me very well.  My father [Philip McKayle, Sr.] was working, but he was a dapper man, he dressed beautifully.  So I was always very impressed with the way he looked.  So I think that became part of what I knew as a young man and always loved beautiful things.
Speaker 1: Any other traits from your parents you think you inherited?
Speaker 2: Well I'm a good cook and my--both my mother and father were good cooks, yeah.  And we'd always have wonderful big meals for the family.
Story_ID: 646647
Speaker 1: There's a--I know your book ['Transcending Boundaries: My Dancing Life,' Donald McKayle] opens up with dancing?
Speaker 2: Yes, my book opens up with--at the Renaissance Ballroom [New York, New York].  My mother [Eva Cohen McKayle] brought me to my first social event where I get into my long pants, as a little boy, we wore knickers, we didn't wear long pants.  And it was wonderful.  I remember that so strongly.
Speaker 1: It seems as though there's a lot of dancing around you when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Dancing, a lot of music?
Speaker 2: Yes, music and I remember my Aunt Alice [Alice McKayle] who was my father's brother's [John McKayle] wife, had a Victrola, one of those ones that came over the high top and wind it up and put on a hard disc and put the needle on, it had lots of music four us to listen to.
Speaker 1: And now you have just--do you have just one brother?
Speaker 2: I had one brother, he's not around anymore, he died.
Speaker 1: Which one is the oldest?
Speaker 2: He's older than I.
Speaker 1: So when was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in 1929.
Speaker 1: Okay, just a year older.
Speaker 2: A year older.
Speaker 1: And his name was?
Speaker 2: Philip Augustus McKayle, Jr. [Philip McKayle, Jr.] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Tell us something about him.  Did he dance as well or did he--
Speaker 2: No, no dancing at all.  He played basketball. That was his love of sports.
Speaker 1: Was he pretty good at basketball?
Speaker 2: I thought he was pretty good.
Speaker 1: Did he get a chance to play for any of the college teams or professional teams?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: What did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: He had a series of different jobs.  He was--he didn't have a profession.
Story_ID: 646648
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory (laughter).  Oh that's so long ago, you know, 'cause I'm eighty-three now.  So that's a good while ago.  I do remember my father [Philip McKayle, Sr.] and mother [Eva Cohen McKayle] getting all dressed up and going out, and we--my brother [Philip McKayle, Jr.] and I were left at home.  No babysitter, we were just left to be--be good (laughter).  And my mother was very fashionable and always had a Persian lamb coat and a Corde bag, and you know, had her hair fixed very nicely.  And my father wo- and his brother John [John McKayle] and their friends would wear derbies.  So, that was the era that we grew up in.
Story_ID: 646649
Speaker 1: Now, you were raised, from what I read off of 110th Street in the beginning, you--?
Speaker 2: Well, 111th Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 57 East 111th Street.  I remember it because I was made to memorize it.  My address is, in case I got lost I could be brought home.
Speaker 1: Now this is--that would be considered like the border of Harlem [New York, New York], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Above 96th Street was Harlem, yeah.
Speaker 1: I know the old story of people on the train, that you know, they tell visitors that they could make all the white people get off the train at 110th Street, you know.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You've heard that haven't you?
Speaker 2: No I haven't heard that, that's funny.
Speaker 1: New Yorkers tell visitors, "Watch me make all the white people get off the train."
Speaker 2: Oh I love it.
Speaker 1: Then they all get off.  I don't know if they still do, 'cause it--I don't think they still do.
Speaker 2: No, it's very gentrified now that whole area.  I remember Strivers Row in Harlem with all the brownstone houses.  And we would go to the--get our chickens on--on Lenox Avenue [Malcolm X Boulevard].  There was a place that had live chickens.  I'd go with my father [Philip Cohen, Sr.] and he would reach in, press the breast of the chicken and pick the one he wanted.  And they would butcher it for him.  And we'd take it home. That was our Sunday meal.
Speaker 1: Okay, you had live chickens right in the city?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What were--so were you raised in that house, you know, was that your childhood home, 57 East 111th?
Speaker 2: Yes, until we moved to the Harlem housing projects [Harlem River Houses], which was the first projects built in New York City [New York, New York].  And they were four or five stories, so they weren't like the big columns that are now projects.  And we were right on the Harlem River, 151st Street to 155th [Street] for the projects.  From the Harlem River over to Macombs Place.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. All right. And how old were you when they moved there?
Speaker 2: Well I was around seven, seven yes.
Story_ID: 646650
Speaker 1: Can you give us a sense of what it was like growing up?  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I always, when I think of smells, I think of food, you know, 'cause my mother [Eva Cohen McKayle] was a great cook and there were always wonderful aromas coming from the kitchen.  And I remember there were--the--the projects [Harlem River Houses, New York, New York] were very well manicured and kept, we had little gardens, victory gardens, 'cause that was World War II [WWII].  We planted victory gardens.  And I grew flowers and vegetables.  And that's where I began to learn how to cook because I was growing my own food.
Story_ID: 646651
Speaker 1: You were telling us about some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I remember we went to All Souls' Church [All Souls' Episcopal Church, New York, New York] until we--while we were living in East Harlem [New York, New York].  And then when we moved to Harlem housing projects [Harlem River Houses, New York, New York] we went to St. Luke's Episcopal Church [New York, New York] because my parents were Church of England Episcopal.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, All Souls' was that a church, that's not Episcopal?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's Episcopal.
Speaker 1: It is, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: High church.  At that time they had altars, you know, they don't have them now so the priest faces toward the congregation.  But they were facing away.  And I was an acolyte and I had to learn how to serve the communion with the priest.  And it was a very special way of growing up.
Speaker 1: Were your rectors black in those churches?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Father Denzil Carty, I remember him and I don't remember the fa- the pastor at All Souls', I was too little for that.  But I grew up as an acolyte and I was also in the liturgical choir, and had to learn to sing that sort of sing-song (chanting), "Ali ali lama sama, haven e aeo." That sort of thing which we did.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So was the church--did the church have a big impact on you?
Speaker 2: Very much so.  And also there was a lot of theater in the church, comings and goings, and I liked that very much.  I think that's where I got my love of theater from the church.
Speaker 1: Now, are you referring to drama within the church or dramas staged by the church (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, the actual services had a very orderly way of being done, when you would sing, when you would kneel, when you would get up, when you would come in you would genuflect before going into your row.  And so that was--that was what I called theater, it really was.
Speaker 1: The rituals that reinforced your faith and that sort of thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The rituals, yeah.  And I would, I was in--in the choir there so I learned to do that too.
Story_ID: 646652
Speaker 1: This is--1930s were the beginning years of--well were the heart of the Depression, what we call the Great Depression.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you grew up in it, you probably didn't have any sense of it I guess?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't know.  We weren't depressed at all (laughter).  That was the way we were, you know, that's where we lived.  And so, you know, my father [Philip McKayle, Sr.] always worked.  My mother [Eva Cohen McKayle] also did some work at--in the Garment District [New York, New York].  And my Aunt Alice [Alice McKayle] was an operator.  She sewed on the machine, she made the dresses and my mother was a finisher.
Speaker 1: What was school like?  Where did you start school?
Speaker 2: Well, I started school when I was in East Harlem [New York, New York], I went to kindergarten and first grade.  Then my second grade, we were moving to Harlem housing project [Harlem River Houses, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: P.S. 101 [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, P.S. 101.  And then when you moved?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to Cath- to a Catholic school for a while.  My mother didn't like the public schools.
Speaker 1: I remember the story about the nun and chasing the student around the classroom?
Speaker 2: Oh that was something (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, what was the name of the Catholic school?
Speaker 2: Resurrection [Resurrection School, New York, New York].  And we had this nun, I thought she was a very pretty nun, you know, but she could be ruthless when she came to discipline.
Speaker 1: Well, tell the story, tell the story.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, kids can be kind of cruel to each other and this was one boy who wasn't too bright and we would always make him do things which would cause him to be disciplined by the teacher and then we'd watch.  She'd say, "Come up here." And she'd take her strap out of the top drawer, you know, to hit him across the hand and he'd pull back his hand.  That means two, and then reach out again, and suddenly he would get frightened and he'd start to run around--away from her and she'd follow after him and she had a cincture with all the knots down it.  She'd run after him and bap hit him on the head, you know.  "Stop." He'd stop.  Frightened, trembling.  Julius [ph.] and Julianne [ph.] was his sister.  I can't imagine why we were so mean to him (laughter).
Speaker 1: I don't know, it's one of these.  Now you had, when your family--you had a story about when your family moved and you were--about how old were you when the bullies were chasing you?
Speaker 2: That was before we moved that was at PS 101.
Speaker 1: So this is when you're in the first grade?
Speaker 2: First--first grade, yeah.  I could be going to second grade.  But I was a good student.  I memorized my work, I knew everything.  I could answer, hold me han- my hand was always going up.  And so I was a little bit insufferable to some of my schoolmates.  So they would chase me.  I could run, I was a wonderful runner.  I'd get home before they could catch me, get up the stairs.  And I remember my godmother, Renie Huskuson [ph.], she was from Barbados.  And I got up to my home, my mother wasn't there and I couldn't go downstairs again because I would face the people who were chasing me, my opponents.  So I would go to my godmother's house, she lived two floors down from us.  And she'd say, "What's wrong?" And I told her the story.  "You're not gonna run for the rest of your life, come on we're gonna go down there and settle this once and for all."  And so she took me down and she had these sort of sling shoes they were clack, clack, clack she went down the stairs.  And there're my opponents outside.  She says, "Okay, now which is the one."  I said, "That's the one who has been chasing me."  And she said (gesture).  And she said, "You better hit him first or I'll hit you."  So I went pow, hit him right in the--and his nose began to bleed and that was the end of the fight.  I never--like she said, "You'll never run home from school again." They didn't bother me after that.  And she took me upstairs and gave me something to eat.  She used to make cou-cou which was a Germ- Barbasion [Barbadian] dish made with cornmeal and corn pone and things like that.  She was quite a lady.
Speaker 1: So this is your godmother?
Speaker 2: Godmother.
Speaker 1: What was her name, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Renie Huskuson.
Speaker 1: I should ask you to spell it probably since it's not a common name?
Speaker 2: I'm sure if you're looking in my biography ['Transcending Boundaries: My Dancing Life,' Donald McKayle] you'll find exactly how it's spelled (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) That's fine, that's fine, it is in the book--it's in there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 646653
Speaker 1: So I take it you really liked school?
Speaker 2: Very much.  I was looking forward to going to school and to building projects, I li- I was very good with my hands.  I painted and things like that.
Speaker 1: So you're a good art student?
Speaker 2: Yes, very good art student.
Speaker 1: Now did you--could you sing at that stage?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes I sing out loud and strong (laughter).
Speaker 1: And I think I read now that one of your first activities in the arts was being part of a puppet show?
Speaker 2: That was yes, that was when we were at P.S. 46 [P.S. 46, Arthur Tappan School, New York, New York], that's when I moved to Harlem housing projects [Harlem River Houses, New York, New York].  It was 'Punch and Judy.'
Speaker 1: This is after the Catholic school?
Speaker 2: Yes, this was in P.S. 1- P.S. 101 [New York, New York]--no, no, no P.S. 46, P.S. 46 and that was in the heights.
Speaker 1: What role did you play in the puppet show?
Speaker 2: I was Punch and was we had the hand puppets and we were behind desks, the puppets came up above the desk.  We'd manipulate them and move them around; and I would make the voices to the different characters.

Speaker 1: Did your parents [Eva Cohen McKayle and Philip McKayle, Sr.] speak with a Jamaican accent?
Speaker 2: No, no--my--they had a very cultured accent.  My grandfather--Uncle Jo- my uncle John [John McKayle] had a very good Jamaica accent, but I could pick up accents very well so I would read Louise Bennett [Louise Bennett Coverley], uh-huh, Miss Lou says in perfect patois.
Speaker 1: Can you speak a little patois for us?
Speaker 2: (Speaking patois) (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  Now the music when you were growing up, what was the popular music, was it calypso yet?
Speaker 2: Well we knew calypso because of being in Jamaica heritage.  But calypso hadn't become popular until later on in the United States.  At that time we knew the Duke of Iron, and Lord Kitchener and things like that here.
Speaker 1: I often wondered why those groups had those--they would be named after these British--these pompous British names?
Speaker 2: Very, very, very British.
Speaker 1: The Duke of Iron?
Speaker 2: The Duke of Iron.
Speaker 1: Did those--do you think those names influenced 'The Duke of Earl' the song later on in the '50s [1950s], the popular song by Gene Chandler?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I remember at that time King Edward [Edward VIII] had ab- abdicated his throne, you know, and there was a song (singing), "It was love and love alone, made the king leave the throne.  It was love, love, love and love alone made King Edward leave the throne.  The 10th of December we hear the talk, he gave his throne to the Duke of York, oh." ['Love, Love Alone'].  I even remember the words, it just came to me (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's something, okay, yeah, that's something that was in the news when you were a little kid I guess?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, and in Trans-Lux theater [New York, New York], you know, you could see the pictures of Wallis Simpson, American divorcee (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, the one that stole the--that lured the king from his throne.
Speaker 2: Yes, it's like can I continue without the woman I love.  Then King George [George VI] came on and he was the one that had the stuttering.
Speaker 1: That's the one that the movie 'The King's Speech'?
Speaker 2: Yes, 'The King's Speech.'  And I remember going down with my father and all his Jamaica compatriots to see King George, Queen Elizabeth [Elizabeth Bowes Lyon] which was the queen mother and the two princesses, Elizabeth [Elizabeth II] and Margaret [Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon].  And they, those princesses is now Queen Elizabeth.  And he'd put me up on shoulder.  He gave me a little Union Jack to wave when they came by.  And I was so disappointed 'cause I expected to see the king with a crown and everything, of course they were not dressed that way at all (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess kids would expect to see the crown, ermine cape and all?
Speaker 2: Yes, white with all the black stuff on it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, right, right, the scepter, or.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know the (gesture).
Story_ID: 646655
Speaker 1: When you were growing up, were you allowed to, to walk the streets of Harlem [New York, New York] with your friends and observe what was going on, and?
Speaker 2: We were kept on a strict, you know we couldn't, we didn't really go much out of the projects [Harlem River Houses, New York, New York].  My mother [Eva Cohen McKayle] didn't like the neighborhood.  But so I grew up in the--in the playground there and did a lot of arts, crafts, and when we had the May Day celebration they put up a maypole and little girls go get dressed up as flowers and they would do the maypole dance and platting the strings around the maypole.  And then I was master of ceremonies and I would crown the queen of the May.  That's the kind of thing that I was doing.
Speaker 1: So as a child you were considered like a master of ceremonies?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was acting (laughter).
Speaker 1: Doing voices in the puppet show?
Speaker 2: When flowers bloom for garlands to make, I crown thee queen of the May. (Gesture) And placed the wreath on her head.
Speaker 1: Just another point too, is that the projects, 'cause people consider then now, were not bad back then, they were different then?
Speaker 2: Very different.  As I said they were four stories high, well kept with a garden and what have you.
Speaker 1: And they were thought of, I don't know if you thought about it as a child, but people say now they were transitional housing, you know, for up and coming, you know, couples?
Speaker 2: Well we were there until we moved to the Bronx [New York], which is when I went to junior high school.
Speaker 1: So you were, what, about twelve then, eleven or twelve?
Speaker 2: Was I, I guess, I guess so, yeah.
Speaker 1: What school did you go to in the Bronx?
Speaker 2: Junior High School 118, William Niles Junior High School [J.H.S. 118, William W. Niles School], it was between Lafontaine [Avenue] and Arthur Avenue, I forget what street exactly.
Speaker 1: Now as you progress, were you seeing yourself in the future as a performer or?
Speaker 2: No, I had no idea about that.  I knew I loved to perf- I was always in front doing something and I was in the choir and what have you.  But I was gonna be a teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I am (laughter).
Story_ID: 646656
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers that--and other people in the community that inspired you when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Well I remember when I was in--well into grade school, we had a teacher who, he was an activist, Meeropol, but he had a different name and he played--taught and we learned 'Strange Fruit' that that Billie Holiday sang.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is Lewis Allan, right?
Speaker 2: Lewis Allan, yeah.
Speaker 1: That was his pen name and he--his real name was Abel Meeropol.  And he actually wrote 'Strange Fruit,' the Billie Holiday song?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now a lot of people think Billie Holiday wrote, but it really, she really didn't.
Speaker 2: No, "Southern trees bear strange fruit, blood in the leaves and blood at the root.  Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze, strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees."
Speaker 1: So this is--he was an activist?
Speaker 2: He was an English teacher, that's (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was at the middle school you attended?
Speaker 2: This was--middle school, no it was still P.S. 46 [P.S. 46, Arthur Tappan School, New York, New York], I'm trying to remember now.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: He wasn't high school?
Speaker 2: High school, high school, you're right, it was high school.
Speaker 1: It was high school, okay.  What was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: DeWitt Clinton [DeWitt Clinton High School]. That's in the Bronx [New York].  Yeah, he was high school.
Speaker 1: Were you--so he was an inspirational teacher?
Speaker 2: Very much so.  We had the Frederick Douglass Society and he was the faculty mentor there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was the head of--so he created the Frederick Douglass Society for the--to teach black history to students?
Speaker 2: We learned, yes, because there was no such subject in school.
Speaker 1: Now was the school integrated?
Speaker 2: The was integrated, yes, but barely.  Mostly white students and you know, there were like two or three black students in my class.  I remember there was a girl named Rowena [ph.] that we grew up with.  And we're living in the Bronx my Uncle John [John McKayle], we stayed with him and Aunt Alice [Alice McKayle] 'cause he was the superintendent of a building on Washington Avenue.  That's how we got to go there, 'cause we used his address.
Speaker 1: So this was, from what I read, is your mother's attempt to make sure you were in a good school?
Speaker 2: Yes, away from the bad element, no gangs, we had zip guns, no zip guns.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a dangerous--
Speaker 2: She was very good at doing that.  And because I was interested in school it was not a problem to me.
Story_ID: 646657
Speaker 1: In high school [DeWitt Clinton High School, Bronx, New York], were you in the, in the college preparatory track in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, I wanted to go to New York University [New York, New York], but when my parents [Eva Cohen McKayle and Philip McKayle, Sr.] didn't have the wherewithal to send me to that school, so I went to City College.  I got a partial scholarship, but they couldn't pay the rest of the money.  So I went to CCNY, College of the City of New York [sic. City College of New York, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: I don't wanna get you there yet.  I just--
Speaker 2: Okay, I jumped.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know everybody likes to jump ahead but.  Well, tell us about high school, what kind of a student were you in high school and you know, were you part of any--you know, well you haven't told us about Frederick Douglass Society all the way yet?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Any other clubs or did you run for class president or?
Speaker 2: Yes, I ran for president.  I ran for president in junior high school [J.H.S. 118, William W. Niles School, Bronx, New York] too.  And I had a campaign and we made--bow ties were the big thing then, Frank Sinatra.  So I made bow ties that said, "Vote for McKayle [HistoryMaker Donald McKayle]," had people put them on, cardboard, paper--construction paper.  And I had a nice campaign.  Had campaign managers (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you win?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.
Speaker 2: I won.
Speaker 1: This is a pretty big deal.
Speaker 2: It was a big deal, yeah.
Speaker 1: This is a school that's not majority black, right?
Speaker 2: Around, twelve twenty--to twenty black students in the whole school.
Speaker 1: So that was remarkable that you were the president (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was, I was a popular kid.
Story_ID: 646658
Speaker 1: Now were you aware growing up of your Jewish heritage?
Speaker 2: My mother [Eva Cohen McKayle] would tell me things.  I remember I had two Jewish friends when I lived in the--in Harlem [New York, New York], and they were twins.  And we used to play together downstairs right in front of the building.  And their parents had a store that sold seltzer and crepes, you know, 'cause every Jewish family had seltzer they spritzed in their drinks and the other families and other cultures didn't use that.  So when the Jewish families moved away, my friends moved away because they--their parents were going.  But I remember them being away for a while and we saw this sign on this store framed in black and it was in Yiddish so I couldn't read it.  But I asked them what happened and they said their mother--grandmother had died and said they had to go sit shiva.  So I didn't understand what that was, so I said mom, to my mother, "Did you know that when Jewish people died they had to sit and shiver."  My mother said, "No.  That isn't what it means."  She explained to me that was a process of memorial and people would come and go and visit for seven days.
Speaker 1: Sit and shiver.
Speaker 2: How do you do that?
Speaker 1: But your mother did tell you since you had a Jewish heritage, okay?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know, I've heard DeWitt Clinton High School [Bronx, New York] mentioned a lot in biographies of Jewish people.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, prominent place.
Story_ID: 646659
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about the Frederick Douglass Society, you know--?
Speaker 2: Well it was interesting because it was named after this great emancipator figure in, in American history and such a strong faith in person.  And I don't know who picked the name, I think it was Lewis Allen [Abel Meeropol], yeah.  And we would meet once a week, I forget where--after school [DeWitt Clinton High School, Bronx, New York].  And we would plan projects and things we would do.  And I learned about black history.  And then I went to a library, we had a children's library and I found every book that I could and I soon exhausted that.  So he sent me down to the Schomburg Collection [Schomburg Collection of Negro Literature, History and Prints; Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York], he says, "You'll find that there."
Speaker 1: I was gonna ask you about that, and so you would've been, while you were, you know, Mr. Schomburg [Arturo Alfonso Schomburg] would've been deceased by then I guess.
Speaker 2: He wasn't around that long.
Speaker 1: He died in '37 [sic. 1938] I believe, but did you ever go to Lewis Michaux bookstore [African National Memorial Bookstore] at 125th [Street] and Lenox [sic. 7th Avenue; Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I've seen pictures of it in the '70s [1970s] with all the pictures of the African heads of state around it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was later on, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you know anything about J.A. Rogers [Joel Augustus Rogers]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: The Jamaica historian?
Speaker 2: I knew about Marcus Garvey, yeah and the Garveyites, and we all--when we dress in white.  And they had special places in different stores which were the Marcus Garvey church [African Orthodox Church].  And then we would have special events where family would come and they would put--at the Polo Grounds [New York, New York], which is just outside.  There was a green and we'd spread blankets on the ground and my father [Philip McKayle, Sr.] and his friends would play cricket (laughter), and that was definitely a West Indian pasttime 'cause it was not a game Americans knew anything about.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Cricket was a big, big deal growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh yes in--in Jamaica because of the English heritage there.
Speaker 1: Now I know later on you would write--I know you would choreograph--graph a piece in honor of Harriet Tubman ['They Called Her Moses,' Donald McKayle]?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, that was--I did that in '52 [1952].
Speaker 1: And was that influenced by your--
Speaker 2: By my reading, yeah.  And I just found her and she was like a heroine for me.  And I mean those nineteen journeys she went back to the South and brought slaves all the way, finally up to Canada because they passed the fugitive slave law [Fugitive Slave Act of 1850].  She lived in Auburn, New York for a while.  But, I think, think there's--one of the posters in my office has that on it.
Speaker 1: Right, I think I saw it before we started.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, we're gonna pause here again.
Story_ID: 646660
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're just talking about the gifts of Harriet Tubman, you know?
Speaker 2: Well this was--it was called--I wrote the song too, it was called 'To da Darling Day.' It was--that was the refrain. (Singing), "It was my third trip back to Masta Georgfield to da darling day, and many a lad was waiting for me, to da darling day.  And I went to South Road Mark, bought a scrawny hist- rooster and a lame foot hen and I band ta-da and (unclear) old and gray, oh hey, hey, hey." And it--it was a wonderful piece.  And a little girl--child that she was taking said and, "He didn't even know that you (unclear) don't call that name."  You were never to call her name (unclear).  "On my Underground Railroad I never ran a train off the track and I never lost a passenger."  It was really a fun, fun section.  It was a nice dance.  I promised to redo it again, but I don't know.  It's on my I think part of it, yes, is on my piece I did for public television, 'Heartbeats of a Dance Maker' ['Donald McKayle: Heartbeats of a Dance Maker'].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Arthur Mitchell was in it; Alvin Ailey at one point.
Story_ID: 646661
Speaker 1: So high school [DeWitt Clinton High School, Bronx, New York], you were learning, you know, things outside of the classroom that have influenced you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, yeah and I avid reader so I would seek out information.
Speaker 1: Now, what did you do as president of the class?  Did you have a special (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh we did so much, we had dances and things like that, you know, and I always made sure that the music was really what the kids liked, you know.
Speaker 1: What was the popular music then on the high school level?
Speaker 2: It was pop music, I don't know.
Speaker 1: It'd be 1948 or '47 [1947]?
Speaker 2: Forty-seven [1947], '48 [1948] yeah.  And 'Don't Get Around Much Anymore' I think was one of them.  (Singing), "Missed Saturday dance, heard they crowded the floor.  Couldn't bear it without you, don't get around much anymore."  And I later worked with him--I worked with Duke Ellington, a lot of great experiences.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's like big band music I guess?
Speaker 2: Big band, very much so.  Artie Shaw, Tommy Dorsey.
Speaker 1: So this is the era right after the war [World War II, WWII].  Now do you, now, how did the war affect you?
Speaker 2: Well, I was too young to go into the war, but I remember, you know, drives to save, rationing and collect things.  And I remember soldiers coming home, things like that.
Speaker 1: Did you listen to the radio much growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That was it.  You know, if my father [Philip McKayle, Sr.] wasn't listening to the ballgame (laughter), we could get to the radio.
Speaker 1: That's right because he probably was a Dodgers [Brooklyn Dodgers; Los Angeles Dodgers] fan?
Speaker 2: Oh Yankees [New York Yankees].
Speaker 1: Yankees?
Speaker 2: Yankees.
Speaker 1: Even despite the fact that Jackie Robinson is with the Dodgers?
Speaker 2: Oh when Jackie Robinson came in he--he followed the Dodgers, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, it seems as though, I mean, you had a lot of information when you were growing up, you know, with your father working at the news movie theater [Trans-Lux, New York, New York] and just, you know, with the influence of radio and other, you know, some of the teachers you had.  So were you aware of, how aware were you of the arts community?
Speaker 2: Not that much aware, other than my friends.  Within this we had the Frederick Douglass Society and then outside we had Club L'Ouverture, which was like a club, a social club that I was part of.
Speaker 1: That was named for Toussaint L'Ouverture?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And I met some of my friends that stayed with me like Robert Nemiroff who was the producer of 'Raisin' [Robert Nemiroff and Charlotte Zaltzberg] married to Lorraine Hansberry.  So I began to grow up in an artistic community.
Story_ID: 646662
Speaker 1: It was in high school [DeWitt Clinton High School, Bronx, New York] that you saw a performance of Pearl Primus?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell--tell us about that?
Speaker 2: My--I had a friend who was taking dance lessons at the New Dance Group; and one of her teachers was Pearl Primus, who had won a Rosenwald scholarship [Julius Rosenwald Fund] to go to Africa and study West African dance.  And she came back and was teaching and so she was giving a concert at the High School of Performing Arts [Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts] in the Garment District [New York, New York].  And my friend took me down there to see the performance and I was just blown away by what that woman did on stage.  And then she also danced to music that she brought back and composed from what she'd seen in Africa.  She did dances to Josh White's 'Hard Time Blues' about the Depression [Great Depression].  There was one where she would run and jump, and she could jump high as any man.  She could run across the air with her feet moving in the space and come down and land so soft you didn't even know she had jumped.  I became just--I brought her here to the university [University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California] before she died and she was always--wore African clothes.  She stopped wearing Western clothes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the photos of her always show her in midflight.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, just fly through the air.  (Singing), "Great God Almighty, folks were singing bad, lost everything they ever had."  And she'd run (gesture) and she'd land.  Landlord coming round the break of day, a-ho.  Just marvelous.
Speaker 1: Pearl Primus was an anthropologist?
Speaker 2: That's what she studied in NYU [New York University, New York, New York], yes, Dr. Primus.  She did her--and she did her thesis in dance and in--in writing.  And it was very hard because they didn't have people in university who knew anything about dance.
Speaker 1: She was a pioneer.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, very much so.
Speaker 1: So, Pearl Primus is part of the, you said, the new school, right?  The new--
Speaker 2: New Dance Group.
Speaker 1: Okay the?
Speaker 2: New Dance Group.
Speaker 1: New Dance Group, okay, all right.  And so your friend in high school was a mem- was a student there, right?
Speaker 2: He wasn't at our high school, he was at Music and Art [High School of Music and Art; Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York] that was Rob- Robert Nemiroff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we were both in the Club L'Ouverture together.
Story_ID: 646663
Speaker 1: When did you first consider--is this when you first considered dancing?
Speaker 2: After seeing Pearl Primus, yeah.  I, I formed a--I worked that next week and we had meetings at Club L'Ouverture, I said, "I saw this wonderful woman dance and we should have--we should make--have a dance group here."  And I asked other members of the club to come in to rehearsals.  I, I was rehearsing people.  Didn't know a thing, but (laughter) rehearsing people and making up dances, choreographing before I knew anything.
Speaker 1: That's something, so you just started, you know.
Speaker 2: (Makes sound), yeah.  And then I went to audition at the New Dance Group for the scholarship and I got it, although I was sure I would be eliminated 'cause I didn't know anything.  But they gave me a scholarship, they saw something.
Speaker 1: So what was the first thing--can you think of what you--what did you choreograph, I mean what did you--
Speaker 2: I choreographed a spiritual, 'Go Down Moses.' And I had all my fellow club members in a chain going around and they were bent over, things they could do, and I was improvising in the middle, breaking through trying to get out.  When I think of it, I smile.  It was so innocent and quite wonderful.
Speaker 1: So right after graduation [from DeWitt Clinton High School, Bronx, New York] or did you become a part of the New Dance Group before graduation or after?
Speaker 2: Before, 1947 was when I started the New Dance Group and I graduated about the same time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1947, all right.  She actually danced to 'Strange Fruit' too, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  (Singing), "Southern trees bare a strange fruit."  She danced to a poem though, it wasn't sung.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your early days with the New Dance Group?
Speaker 2: Well, I got a scholarship and I was--I was going at that time to college, to City College [City College of New York, New York, New York] and so I would go and take early morning classes, about eight o'clock classes, then I'd go down to the New Dance Group which was on 59th Street between 5th [Avenue] and Madison [Avenue] at the time.  And I would work with Sophie Maslow, Jane Dudley, William Bales, the New Dance Group company, and then I'd go back and finish more classes at CCNY, go home, have dinner, do homework, that was my life.  And I started choreographing with the company in '51 [1951].
Speaker 1: Now, was this when you performed 'Saturday's Child' [Donald McKayle]?
Speaker 2: I did that first at the Club Baron in Harlem [New York, New York].  And that was Paul Robeson was part of it, and [HistoryMaker] Leon Bibb, [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte.  I was a youngster in the group.  And I did 'Saturday's Child,' Countee Cullen's poem.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this was a part of a larger performance of?
Speaker 2: No I was, I, I made--I made it as a solo for me.  I spoke the poem and danced at the same time, which was unusual, people didn't do that, do that.  So it was a dramatic dance and I was a homeless person.
Speaker 1: It was in a program that included Paul Robeson, and--
Speaker 2: Well, Harry Belafonte gave a benefit for Paul because he couldn't work and he couldn't leave the country.  And I had done this dance and they asked me to do it at the Paul--and they said Paul would sing for me 'By 'n' Bye' and I said, "Okay I'd love to." I couldn't believe it.  And I went down to the Golden Gate Ballroom, which was on Lenox Avenue [Malcolm X Boulevard], a little bit down from the Savoy [Savoy Ballroom, New York, New York] in the 40s, yeah.  And I got there and there was no stage, just a bandstand with a piano, so it was large enough for a grand piano and then a few steps for the other instruments and it was carpeted.  And there was Paul in the nook of the piano and Lawrence Brown [Lawrence Benjamin Brown] was sitting at the keyboard and I said, "Well if he's gonna sing for me, I'm gonna dance up and down this carpeted steps, and I did."  But that was 'By 'n' Bye,' I didn't do 'Saturday's Child' at that particular performance.  But it was very important for me.  Big moment in my career.
Story_ID: 646664
Speaker 1: Who were the, some of the other African American dancers in the New Dance School [sic. New Dance Group] in those days?
Speaker 2: Let's see, Joe Nash, Jacqueline Hairston, it was before Ailey [Alvin Ailey] came to New York [New York].  Arthur [HistoryMaker Arthur Mitchell] was still in high school [High School of Performing Arts; Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York].  There were others, I don't remember their names.  Harold Pierson, Charles Moore.
Speaker 1: Well, was there any--was there a black male dancer that was considered the best dancer out here in those days, someone that you could--
Speaker 2: Talley Beatty.
Speaker 1: Talley Beatty, okay.
Speaker 2: Beautiful dancer.  And I remember him dancing in Maya Deren's film 'Jumping Through Walls' [sic. 'A Study in Choreography for Camera'] and things like that.
Speaker 1: Now when you were coming along in the '40s [1940s], [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham was--
Speaker 2: She was traveling all around the world with her company.
Speaker 1: Quite a few movies featured the Dunham dancers [Negro Dance Troupe; Katherine Dunham Company]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, 'Stormy Weather.'
Speaker 1: I can remember my mother telling me about Katherine Dunham when 'Stormy Weather' was on, I was about twelve.  Everybody around the country knew, you know, who she was.
Speaker 2: Beautiful woman.
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to layout the landscape of what's going on in terms of black people in the world of dance?
Speaker 2: Well Dunham was the main person known internationally and then pretty much started to travel and then Primus started to travel, but she never had a large company like Dunham.  'Cause I remember seeing Dunham in the--at the Belasco Theatre [New York, New York] and there are eight drummers, singers and all those dancers.  The costumes, she was something else.
Speaker 1: Now had you--at this stage in your life, had you seen any African dance other than dances performed by Pearl Primus?
Speaker 2: Pearl Primus, no.
Speaker 1: Based on what you?
Speaker 2: That was all.
Speaker 1: So none of the African dance troupes were touring?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: So well this benefit for Paul Robeson sounds like a really--
Speaker 2: It was a wonderful event.  And he had this really gorgeous voice, and he's a great, great speaker.
Speaker 1: So were you starting to really become known in the African American arts community--well the arts community period, I guess you could--
Speaker 2: Yeah in the dance community.  I made my name by these things that I did; and then my big first dance I did with the company was 'Games' [Donald McKayle], 1951.
Story_ID: 646665
Speaker 1: Now, what was the--your training like as a dancer?
Speaker 2: I studied at the New Dance Group (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now I think you just started doing it, you started dancing in high school.
Speaker 2: I started dancing and then when I auditioned at the New Dance Group and they chose me, it was wonderful because I just knew that I didn't know anything, I just had this big feeling about dance.  And my mother [Eva Cohen McKayle] always said, "If you get an opportunity always go back and say thanks."  In fact, as a little boy she used to put, before I go out, please in this pocket and thank you in the other, so we always had them to take out.  So I went back to thank them for letting me audition and there was my name they posted on the board as one.  Otherwise, I would've just gone away and never known.  So it was wonderful to have that.  And then in New York [New York] there was a little community of dancers, the New Dance Group was here at 59th Street, over here was the School of American Ballet [New York, New York] and down the street was Ethnologic Dance Center [New York, New York], all in walking distance from each other.  And so I had all of these other cultural things to look at in dance, classical ballet and then Ethnologic Dance Center, La Meri did dances from India and Indonesia.  And my good teacher at the New Dance Group, Hadassah taught me Indian dancing and I loved it.
Speaker 1: So did it--so were you always as a teenager like energetic, were you always doing physical activity?
Speaker 2: Well once I started dancing that was it.  I was dancing, dancing, dancing (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: In high school, were you involved in any other sports or athletic activity?
Speaker 2: No.  It was dancing.
Speaker 1: And you said earlier you were a good runner?
Speaker 2: I could run.  Yeah, but I would run in public in the--in hi- in DeWitt, DeWitt Clinton [DeWitt Clinton High School, Bronx, New York] I would run around the track and things like that.  I was never on a running team.
Speaker 1: So, who was your, I guess, first real dance instructor?
Speaker 2: The trio Jane Dudley, Sophie Maslow, William Bales.  And then other people, there's one woman out here who I met when I came out here, Eva Desca Garnet, and she--I don't know how old she is now, maybe a hundred, but she was one of my teachers.  And Hadassah is gone, I talked about her.  But that was mainly was the New Dance Group--that's where I learned.
Story_ID: 646666
Speaker 1: Who was the director of the New Dance Group?
Speaker 2: Well there was a board of directors and Sophie Maslow was one of the directors, Jane Dudley was one of the directors, William Bales--Muriel Manning was still alive and around; but it was a group of people who came together, and the gave lessons to people who worked in the union. Fifty cents you can get a dance lesson (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now you were with the New Dance Group in--were you with them until '51 [1951], is that about right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, in 1951 you joined the contemporary dance group, which was, was it led by Daniel?
Speaker 2: Daniel Nagrin was one of the--it was a cooperative group.  So, Daniel Nagrin was there, Pearl Lang, Annabelle Lyon.  These were different dancers from modern dance company like Pearl was from Martha Graham [Martha Graham Dance Company], Annabelle Lyon was from American Ballet Theatre, Daniel Nagrin was a Broadway dancer.  So there were many different fields in dancing that came together to make this.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you basically formed a company with these dancers?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was the first piece that you choreographed yourself?
Speaker 2: Well, the first was 'Saturday's Child' [Donald McKayle].
Speaker 1: Okay, now was that--
Speaker 2: That was a solo.
Speaker 1: Yeah, solo.
Speaker 2: But then I start--as far as group dancing it was 'Games' [Donald McKayle] which I did in '51 [1951].  About children's games.
Speaker 1: Now what was that like, tell us about it?
Speaker 2: Well, 'Games' was based on the idea that play is serious business of being a child.  And that is how children express themselves in play, and that was when there was, they didn't have computers or anything, that kind of thing or television, so a lot of us on the street sing song, and rope jumping and racing, and play parties, we would sing a song and do things to the song.  And so in a way I was doing a lot of that singing and moving and dancing as part of being a child.  And I used that for the first dance, part of the 'Games' called a "Play."  And you meet the ten children and then the second is "Hunger" which is about not having food or other things that children of more well to do parents have.  And this last part is "Terror" and that's to do with losing innocence, and it was based on--we were playing in the Bronx [New York] when I lived there and a policeman broke up our game.  And one of the kids was beaten.
Speaker 1: So contemporary issues of the day and you know, and some of the dangers of what happens when you go from childhood to adolescence?
Speaker 2: Yeah and I didn't grow up in--with fantasy world where we told fairy stories, you know.  It was--and I--this was my life and I put it on stage.
Speaker 1: Now, when was 'Games' first performed?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-one [1951].
Speaker 1: And where?
Speaker 2: I'd have to look in that book ['Transcending Boundaries: My Dancing Life,' Donald McKayle] to find out where it is.
Speaker 1: But was it a--
Speaker 2: A theater, yes.  We did it at the Y, 92nd Street Y [92nd Street Young Men's Hebrew Association; 92nd Street Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association, New York, New York].  I did Hunter Playhouse at Hunter College [Playhouse at Hunter College; Sylvia and Danny Kaye Playhouse, New York, New York].  Then it was done at a Broadway theater, the Mansfield Theatre [Brooks Atkinson Theatre, New York, New York].  But it's been part of the dance, the American dance repertory for years.  Many companies have it in their repertory.  Jeraldyne Blunden did it.  Alvin Ailey's company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] did it.
Story_ID: 646667
Speaker 1: In '51 [1951], now this is really moving fast, you, you decided to form your own company?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, (laughter) so you didn't waste any time?
Speaker 2: Not at all.  I--innocence was a great teacher because I just did things when I wanted to do them, and later on would find out that's not the way it's usually done.
Speaker 1: But were they successful most of the time?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I were--'Games' [Donald McKayle] was a big hit.  I did it on a program with Daniel Nagrin.  He said, "Remember that dance you were doing? I'm doing this dance concert and I don't have a full concert. Would you do it." And I said yes.  And I walked away with the program because it was such a big hit.
Speaker 1: So you got a hit and do you decided to form your company, Donald McKayle and Company, which you directed until 1969?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Where did you rehearse?
Speaker 2: At the New Dance Group.  See they gave me the, the space at the studios.  If I didn't have all these things that are so necessary I would never had had a company.  But they, they thought I was a talented young man and they gave me their help.
Speaker 1: Who else was--there's a list of names of people who were on the scene in those days I believe, from what I understand here, by this time Alvin Ailey was in--was in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was in my company, but he came with the Lester Horton company [Lester Horton Dancers] from California and I saw him dancing with [HistoryMaker] Carmen De Lavallade and James Truitt at the 92nd Street Y [92nd Street Young Men's Hebrew Association; 92nd Street Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association, New York, New York].  And then we were both in a show called 'House of Flowers' [Harold Arlen and Truman Capote] and [HistoryMaker] Arthur Mitchell, and Walter Nicks; what a group of dancers we had there, it was marvelous.  And I put them all in the company.
Story_ID: 646668
Speaker 1: We were talking about the formation of the Donald McKayle--
Speaker 2: Dance comp- Donald McKayle and Company (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and Company. And but, I might have to go back to 'House of Flowers' [Harold Arlen and Truman Capote] right now?
Speaker 2: 'House of Flowers' was in 1954.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's after your company.
Speaker 2: After my company.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so we'll wait 'til we get to that then on the timeline.  So, you formed a company, had you already identified the members, you know?
Speaker 2: No, it came together by need.  And at the New Dance Group fellow students would be there and I'd say, "Let's do this, do that and the other."  I bru- brought them together informally.  At that point, it wasn't like companies nowadays that have boards of directors and financing everything, you just pooled your wits and your means and you put on something.
Speaker 1: So when you were--as you were trying to create, you pulled your fellow dancers together?
Speaker 2: Yes, and things like I was living in West 70 [70th Street] I think in what was an old brownstone with must've been a one family house 'cause we were in the downstairs part of it.  And the living room was a big parlor with vitrines and marble and what have you, and around the top of the ceiling were baroque leaves, so it was a well to do family that lived there.  And my father [Philip McKayle, Sr.] built the set for 'Games' [Donald McKayle] in that living room, it was big enough to do that.
Speaker 1: Your father built the set for 'Games,' okay?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause when he came when it was--I put it on I said, "Dad how'd you like it?" He said, "My set looked very good," (laughter).  He talked about himself.  That was wonderful.
Speaker 1: That's great.
Speaker 2: And my brother [Philip McKayle, Jr.] said, "You should've seen mom [Eva Cohen McKayle] when you came out to take your bow. She turned around and bowed."
Speaker 1: Okay, so your family was all for you being a dancer?
Speaker 2: Oh they, well at that point they were very happy.  My mother wasn't happy at first, she said, "Donald [HistoryMaker Donald McKayle] you're too intelligent of a boy to be a dancer."  Well that didn't work.  So she said, "Dancing is a short life, what are you gonna do when it's over?"  And I remember bringing her to a performance here to see Ailey [Alvin Ailey] doing 'Rainbow Round My Shoulder' [Donald McKayle], and it was here in Hollywood, Pantages Theatre [Hollywood Pantages Theatre, Los Angeles, California].  And she said, "I remember that, you haven't changed it much have you," (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, that's great, that's great, so they were there all the time--
Speaker 2: Yeah they got very much involved in it.
Speaker 1: --and working on it.  So you were talking about some of the people in the group in the early days.  So was [HistoryMaker] Carmen De Lavallade in your?
Speaker 2: She was in my group, but not in the very first group because she wasn't here yet, she was still in California--she wasn't in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Was Alvin Ailey in the first group?
Speaker 2: No. [HistoryMaker] Arthur Mitchell was in it before Alvin.
Speaker 1: Okay so the group consisted of Arthur Mitchell, who else?
Speaker 2: Joe Nash, I don't think you would know any of the other people that were in it.
Speaker 1: Well, Arthur Mitchell went on to found Dance Theatre of Harlem?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And Joe Nash?
Speaker 2: Joe Nash was with Pearl Primus and her company.  He was a historian.
Speaker 1: Did he write any books or did he--was he teaching?
Speaker 2: Yes, and he had a great collection.  I think they're at the Lincoln Center library [New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, New York, New York] now.
Speaker 1: Was he a historian of dance, itself or?
Speaker 2: Of dance.  Everywhere we went he would gather all the programs that people left behind.  His house was full of stuff.
Speaker 1: All right, so, who else was--was Eleo Pop- Pomare [HistoryMaker Eleo Pomare] in town then?
Speaker 2: No, he, he started later.
Speaker 1: I've been told that actors would--at least would all get together in New York at--they would--they would eat at Sidney Poitier's barbeque restaurant [Ribs in the Ruff].  Do you know anything about that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Yeah he had--maybe before he had it, I don't know, I think it maybe before he--
Speaker 2: Would be before he had it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  There was Frankie Dee [Frank Dee Brown] who was married to [HistoryMaker] Ruby Dee had a lot of parties (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I knew Ruby very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Was she dancing as well as acting?
Speaker 2: No, she was an actress.
Story_ID: 646669
Speaker 1: Was there like a society of the black artists sort of, or did it make any--?
Speaker 2: It was informally together, you know, it wasn't a society.  And the dance artists were sort of separate from the others, except in this Committee for the Negro in the Arts.  And that had, I was in it, Paul Robeson, [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte, Ernie Crichlow [Ernest Crichlow], Charles White [Charles Wilbert White], and that was a mixture of all different art forms.  So, that was and I was around eighteen when I was in that.
Speaker 1: So this is 1947?
Speaker 2: Forty-eight [1948].
Speaker 1: Forty-eight [1948], yeah.  So this is, okay.  So how long did that committee last?
Speaker 2: I don't remember, a few years.
Speaker 1: It's interesting to me that a lot of organizations that people think they need to form anew have already been formed at one time or another.  So the idea of organizing is--
Speaker 2: Yes, you do--I mean, well you're the history gatherers now so you'll pu- document all of this.  People will know we're not the first (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, right.  I'm sure there's someone trying to form a group now thinking it's the first time.
Speaker 2: Very first, yeah, has never had this before.
Story_ID: 646670
Speaker 1: Okay, so the Committee for the Negro in the Arts, CNA, that's, that's like 1948?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is--so your, your dance company [Donald McKayle and Company], what was your first, I guess, production?
Speaker 2: 'Games' [Donald McKayle].  That was my first one, then 'Her Name was Moses' [sic. 'Her Name was Harriet'; 'They Called Her Moses,' Donald McKayle].  I did, 'Nocturne' [Donald McKayle] to Moondog's music, who was a street musician, blind street musician that I heard playing in the doorways of 6th Avenue in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Well tell us a little bit about, is there a background on him or how much do you know?
Speaker 2: Yes, Louis Hardin was his name, but he was known as Moondog and the ca- the viking and he dressed in blankets which he made clothes out of.  And he made his own instruments, they were all percussion instruments.  The old melodious sound just beautiful.  And he would sing in a doorway and a street, and you'd see this, whi- should say store doorway and play his instruments at night.
Speaker 1: So what gave you the idea to create a dance around his music?
Speaker 2: I just loved it, it was beautiful.  And he, he was very respected among musicians because the musicians playing on it all in the symphony.  The suite of cannons for cellos and the violas, and percussion instruments.
Speaker 1: Now was he part of the production?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he played for us.  He played for us a few times.  When we did it in Central Park [New York, New York] he played at the--where the--Shakespeare festival park [Shakespeare in the Park] in New York, we played that.  And he--he, himself, was a show.  You know, look and see who is that playing.
Speaker 1: What did he look like?
Speaker 2: Well, he's in blankets, all brown blankets and covered.  And the head, one came like this across his face, 'cause he was blind, but he'd been in an accident so he sort of covered up his eyes.  His wife was a Japanese woman and she would play also.  And there was some--he would make pegs in a resounding board, it'd go (makes musical sound).  You know, she'd slide her fingers across it.  So it was a show to watch just because it was so intriguing.
Speaker 1: Yeah that sounds interesting.  'Cause I assumed when you mentioned him he was homeless or something, but he was married?
Speaker 2: He was married.  He lived in the Hotel (Unclear), area of the hotel.
Speaker 1: And had he always been blind?
Speaker 2: From his childhood.  And he was recorded, so he made money from the recordings too.  Basically when he was playing the doorways, people would give him money for him, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so 'Games' was the first, then?
Speaker 2: 'Nocturne' and then other, other little dances between those.  But the next big one was 'They Called Her Moses' or 'Her Name was Harriet' was the first title of it and then I called it 'They Called Her Moses' afterwards.
Speaker 1: And this is the one we were talking about that's inspired by your historical research?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And it's endured over the years, other companies have performed it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: As, well as 'Games,' and--
Speaker 2: 'Games' and 'Rainbow Round My Shoulder' [Donald McKayle] was in '59 [1959], and that was a big hit and that had been performed different parts of the world as well.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did it in Israel, did it in Europe.
Story_ID: 646671
Speaker 1: Tell us about, now, now you're doing these productions, now is this paying all the--are these performances paying all the bills at this point?
Speaker 2: No, I was teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay. Had you finished City University of New York [sic. City College of New York, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: I didn't finish it completely.  I went into shows.  I did--what do they call the first show was, 'cause I'm trying to think back into that time, Helen Tamiris was the choreographer, 'Bless You All' [Harold J. Rome]; it was a revue.  And I was in that in '51 [1951].  And then 'House of Flowers' [Harold Arlen and Truman Capote] in '54 [1954].  But there were not many Negroes in the shows, two or three each show.  In 'Subways are for Sleeping' [Betty Comden and Adolph Green] I went down to audition for that, and they said, "We're not using any Negroes."  I said, "Is there anything wrong with my Equity card."  They said, "No."  I said, "Well then you will see me."  And I danced my butt off.  And (Unclear) White [ph.] came to rehearsals and said, "I wish I could use you."  So I went up to Equity building [Actors' Equity Association] and I complained that they had tried to stop me at the door.  So there was never--that never happened.  If you had Equity card just come in and audition.  So, I was reactive.
Speaker 1: So they would try, if you were black they would try to stop you at the door before you got in?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. So it didn't take a lot to crash through that. You just had to stand your ground?
Speaker 2: I--well I just stood my ground when they said you can't, we're not using, I said, "I will--I will dance."  Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about 'House of Flowers'?
Speaker 2: 'House of Flowers' was--I came in to replace Alvin Ailey.  He had come to the show and late, and didn't put on his knee pads and did a knee slide and hurt his knees, 'cause there was tracks on the stage for the scenery to move on.
Speaker 1: So he cut his knees on the tracks?
Speaker 2: And so he was in the hospital and I came in to take over for him.  And I danced a--the "Sleeping Bee" pas de deux with [HistoryMaker] Carmen De Lavallade.  And that was the first show for [HistoryMaker] Diahann Carroll, she was eighteen years old.  Sleeping--she sang the "Sleeping Bee" song ["A Sleeping Bee"] beautifully.  And Pearl Bailey was a star, Juanita Hall, so it was--it was--it was set in the French West Indies somewhere.
Speaker 1: What a cast, I mean I'm just thinking of these people, you know, Pearl Bailey?
Speaker 2: Pearl Bailey, Juanita Hall, Josephine Premice.  The dancers were fabulous, yeah.
Speaker 1: Juanita Hall was in 'South Pacific' [Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II]--
Speaker 2: 'South Pacific' yeah.
Speaker 1: --'Flower Drum Song.'
Speaker 2: Bloody Mary and all that yeah.  She played Asians.
Speaker 1: Yeah, played Asians, right.
Speaker 2: She was--and Pearl Bailey and her were always at each other.  It's wonderful for the show, because they're supposed to be warring madames.  So they could use all that animosity 'cause Pearl Bailey was the star, Juanita Hall was a star.  She was not gonna have somebody be the star (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting.  So Diahann Carroll, this is before she was in--
Speaker 2: It was her first show.
Speaker 1: Yeah, her first show.  Now you mentioned taking Alvin Ailey's place.  He's such an iconic figure in dance in this country, can you remember when you first met Alvin Ailey?
Speaker 2: In 'House of Flowers.'  Yeah, and he had been with the Lester Horton company [Lester Horton Dancers] when they came from California to New York [New York], and danced at the 92nd Street Y [92nd Street Young Men's Hebrew Association; 92nd Street Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association, New York, New York] and Carmen and Jimmy Truitt [James Truitt]. But he formed his own company, and everything else from there is legend, you know.  But he was in my company before he formed his own company.
Story_ID: 646672
Speaker 1: Now what about [HistoryMaker] Geoffrey Holder, was he around?
Speaker 2: Geoffrey Holder was in 'House of Flowers' [Harold Arlen and Truman Capote], yeah, from Trinidad.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.  Did he perform with the face paint on with the half and half?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Baron Samedi, the keeper of our faith, keeper of the keys of the cemetery gates.  He was wonderful in the show.  What a character.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And he's done that character ever since in one way or another.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah and he--he's a wonderful painter too.  In fact, there should be an exhibit of his work.  I wonder whether it's on now at the museum--African--African American Museum in Los Angeles [California African American Museum, Los Angeles, California]. Might be on now. Should call up and find out.
Speaker 1: We interviewed him in his studio, his art studio.  Basically he had like works of art strewn all over the place.
Speaker 2: All over the place yeah.
Speaker 1: Now did you continue to do any art work 'cause you were good at art.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: But you did, you were able to use your singing voice, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  I made some records, children's songs. They were very well thought of and sold very well.
Speaker 1: Did you make those in the early '50s [1950s] too, or was it later?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  My, my daughters [Gabrielle McKayle and Liane McKayle] were little girls then, so it was, yeah.
Story_ID: 646673
Speaker 1: Now we missed like when you got married.  When did you get married, and when did you meet your wife?
Speaker 2: Well I have two wives.  The first wife I met in--at the New Dance Group.  That's right and she was in 'Games' [Donald McKayle]. In this little book you'll see pictures of her dancing.  And then my second wife I met in Israel when I went there to do work for the Batsheva Company [Batsheva Dance Company].
Speaker 1: Okay. Now this would've been in what, in the?
Speaker 2: It was '60 [1960] something, yeah.  I went there.  There's a whole chapter about her in the book ['Transcending Boundaries: My Dancing Life,' Donald McKayle] and a big picture of her dancing, she was a flamenco dancer.
Speaker 1: Right, I saw that picture and I can't remember how to pronounce the name, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Lea Vivante.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  By 1954, did you have--how many children did you have?
Speaker 2: The first one [Gabrielle McKayle] was born in fifty--I think '56 [1956], the second one [Liane McKayle], '58 [1958], and our son [Guy McKayle] in '60 [1960].  So no one was born in '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you were still single then.  But you were married at that point in 'House of Flowers' [Harold Arlen and Truman Capote]?
Speaker 2: I should remember (laughter) when I got married.
Speaker 1: But she was in 'Games,' you know earlier, but that doesn't necessarily mean you all were married then by any means.
Speaker 2: Not yet, okay, got married after that.  She and her twin sister were in 'Games.'  She died, but her twin sister is still alive.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Lea--oh my--my first wife?  Esta, E-S-T-A, Beck, B-E-C-K [Esta Beck].
Story_ID: 646674
Speaker 1: Well tell us what happened after 'House of Flowers' [Harold Arlen and Truman Capote]; or are there any stories from--first of all are there any stories from the production that you wanna tell us about, or that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, it was colorful, colorful, colorful.  I mean that's the way I came into it with Alvin [Alvin Ailey] tearing open his knees.  And I remember my--to go into everybody's part, I was like the swing boy afterwards.  And Albert Popwell, I had to go on for him and his costume didn't really fit me.  It had a head piece which was a horse's head and a feather boa for the tail of the horse.  And I was on, Alvin was on, back by then and we made two files.  Alvin and Carmen [HistoryMaker Carmen De Lavallade] came down each file and met together, and Alvin hit me because I didn't get a rehearsal and I was where I thought I should be and Pearl Reynolds was saying (gesture).  So I started over towards her and he was coming down the same time hit me, caw, and I--horse's head went over my (covers eyes) and like that I spun off stage and never came back on.  I said, "I'm staying out of this," (laughter).  But it was--it was a wonderful show, it was very good.  Truman Capote did the book and he--Arnold Saint Subber was the producer.  You could always tell when they came to the theater.  They'd come in the stage door and I think they bathed in patchouli perfume (inhales), "They're here," (laughter). Before they got up--halfway up the stairs.  And the--I went in there for the original rehearsal, see you have to learn the show.  They came in to take over.  Walter Nicks was our dance captain and he spoke very slowly and pronounced everything very carefully.  And by the time he got a sentence out you can do a dance.  And he, he spoke many languages.  He would go to Europe and teach and perform.  He was with Dunham [Negro Dance Troupe; Katherine Dunham Company] originally, and he spoke Swedish and French and Spanish and Portuguese; and he was quite a linguist.  He passed on.
Story_ID: 646675
Speaker 1: Now in '55 [1955], from my notes here, [HistoryMaker] Arthur Mitchell joined the New York City Ballet?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was that the talk of the dance community?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  He was wonderful in the ballet company too.  It was interesting because they didn't have a black ballerina, because--George Balanchine had this idea like you put a beautiful diamond against velvet so it stands out.  So he had one of his very fair ballerinas against this black man to stand out.  And he was very good in the company.  And I remember he was a tap dancer.  And he went to the High School of Performing Arts [Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Now you were with Martha Graham [Martha Graham Dance Company], was that about the same time or?
Speaker 2: In the '50s [1950s], yeah.  We went on a tour of Asia, state department tour [U.S. Department of State], so '55 [1955], '56 [1956].
Speaker 1: Okay, so what works were you performing with Martha Graham?
Speaker 2: I performed 'Diversion of Angels' [Martha Graham] and there was a work called 'Ardent Song' [Martha Graham], which she put together in England and then she had left it and then she put it back together to feature me.  Alan Hovhaness music, and it was about the stages of the moon, three--three different sets.  It didn't last, she didn't keep it after I left the company.  But I realized that if I was gonna do my own work, I had have to get out of Graham, so I left.
Speaker 1: Was your tour with Graham the first time you toured outside of the country?
Speaker 2: First time I went around the world.  We started in Japan, when to the Philippines, throughout Southeast Asia and finished in Israel.  And I came back through Europe.
Speaker 1: This is '55 [1955], '56 [1956]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you notice anything significant about the audiences in other countries?
Speaker 2: Well, they in--in Japan, Graham was greeted with great praise.  She was revolutionary at some places, but as far as they were concerned she was wonderful and they could see Noguchi [Isamu Noguchi] sets that he had used the principles of Japanese gardening.  I mean they made comments that nobody else would make.  Just wonderful.  I enjoyed performing with the company very much.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So, '57 [1957], now so, so when you come, when you came back did you get immediately involved in 'West Side Story' [Arthur Laurents]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Jerome Robbins asked me to come in and be the dance captain.
Story_ID: 646676
Speaker 1: 'West Side Story' [Arthur Laurents], so you were the dance captain from 'West Side Story' on Broadway?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I wasn't the first 'cause I came in to the show and I forget his name, it was Harvey [ph.], I can't remember, but he was the dance captain.  He had a holiday for I came in to take over his place.  And Jerome Robbins had asked me to come in.  He came to see 'Games' [Donald McKayle] before he was going to Israel to do work there, and he and Anna Sokolow, they were gonna do work with Inbal Yemenite company [Inbal Dance Theater].  So they both came to see my work and he liked it very much.  So, that's how I got involved in all of these different things.
Speaker 1: Now, 'West Side Story' was--I mean, it was different in a lot of ways from a lot of previous Broadway shows?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was--it was broke the mold and it had a cast of dancers.  And there're a few people in it who were just actors, but it was mostly musical performers.  The director was a choreographer.
Speaker 1: Well, not that I could imagine anybody else doing it, but did it help to be from New York City [New York, New York] to work on that?
Speaker 2: Well, it was done in New York City and that's where dance was at the time.  I mean they were dancing other parts of the country, but the dance capital was New York City.
Speaker 1: Any stories from the 'West Side Story' production?
Speaker 2: Well, I went--I went on for a lot of the different characters.  I was the dance captain, but I also had swung the show.  And once the show is up, you don't get any real deep rehearsal you have to learn it on the sly.  And you go on and suddenly there's scenery there and we had to climb this fence for a rumble.  But the fence was in perspective and I was climbing and climbing and suddenly somebody went (makes sounds), but I was at the high part, had to go all the way up and come down.  And Chita Rivera was wonderful.  She was--played Anita, marvelous.  I had a party when we did it here and I invited all my former friends from the Broadway show out here, so Rita Moreno came 'cause she was taking over the role of Anita.  And George Chakiris came.  So I, I put the show on here in '92 [1992] I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you've had--well it's one thing about doing a Broadway show, if it's a good show it keeps coming back.
Speaker 2: It keeps going on, yes.
Speaker 1: So once you learn it you can always--
Speaker 2: You know, we--I, I restaged it here for the students and re-choreographed it.  I didn't want to use any of Jerry's choreography.
Speaker 1: So you worked on other stage productions too, including 'On the Town' [Betty Comden and Adolph Green], 'Peter Pan,' 'High Button Shoes' [Stephen Longstreet], 'King and I' ['The King and I,' Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II].
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't in those shows.  I saw those, but I wasn't in them.
Speaker 1: Oh something, you didn't work on any of these?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, somebody got this wrong (laughter).  I can scratch this part off.  So in, in '57 [1957], it was 'West Side Story' and how long did you stay with this show?
Speaker 2: About two years.
Story_ID: 646677
Speaker 1: All right, 'cause our next, next note is that in '59 [1959] you, you produced 'Rainbow Round My Shoulder' [Donald McKayle], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what is that about, and what--?
Speaker 2: 'Rainbow Round My Shoulder' is about prisoners on a chain gang in the Deep South and they're brought to work on the roads to break rock to make gravel to lay the rock--gravel bed and then they put macadam and tar, blacktop on it for the roads.  In fact the first song is, "Picks, rocks and gravel to make a solid road, but it wouldn't get done lessen captain had a gun.  'Cause is always being watched over by the overseer." And they're men that are prisoners and they dream of freedom and freedom comes to them in the guise of a woman.  So there's one woman and seven men in the dance.  And it's a--it's a huge success.  As I said I've done it for other companies, I did it for the Batsheva Company [Batsheva Dance Company] in Israel, and I did it in Paris [France], did it in Buenos Aires [Argentina].  So it's a--it's a lasting dance.
Speaker 1: So this is--there's a theme although you've conceived of it as being something that's particular to the United States or something?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's definitely an American dance and the music are chain gang songs, and I got--the ones that I use in the--in the actual production were gathered by John [John A. Lomax, Jr.] and Alan Lomax on location as the men were working.  There's one piece as a solo for the woman, it's called "Jinx Blues" and that was--she was heard a woman singing this song while she was washing clothes at the river and he recorded it on one of his field trips.  (Singing), "I had a gal she was long and tall and moved her body like a cannonball."  That's the female solo.  And the woman who did it first, Mary Hinkson, was a dancer with the Martha Graham Company [Martha Graham Dance Company].  And in fact, on YouTube you can see her and me and Matt Turney dancing in a jazz piece called 'On the Sound' sitting--Long Island Sound. And that was done in '62 [1962] so we stayed as a kind of nice knit group there.
Speaker 1: How would you characterize your dancing technique in those days?
Speaker 2: It was very fluid, athletic, but very sort of muscular rather than light.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. And what did dance critics say about you in those days?
Speaker 2: I got very good reviews from critics.  And 'Rainbow' was hailed as a masterpiece.
Speaker 1: And it resonated with audiences abroad as well?
Speaker 2: Oh very much.  I remember when we did it, well, I didn't do it, it was done by the Dayton Company, Dayton Contemporary [Dayton Contemporary Dance Company] in Russia.  At the end of the performance there was just silence and then suddenly applause.  And Charles Reinhart [Charles L. Reinhart] who was a director went out to the audience to see what was wrong. He said it was just like seeing your own history right in front of them in another form.  So they just couldn't believe what they were seeing.  And I did it, I went to Russia afterwards and I set it on Russian dancers. That was a wonderful experience.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, so this is--how long did you perform--I mean did it perform for a season and then you--
Speaker 2: Well it performed for many seasons, it's a classic piece that's brought back by a company.  And I'll--they'll call me to come in and restage it.
Story_ID: 646678
Speaker 1: In 1960 there's a live broadcast of three of your dances, right?  And, what network broadcast your dances?
Speaker 2: Well I did a special for public te- PBS [Public Broadcasting Service].  I don't know whether that's what you're talking about.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a note here that when it was on, when it was broadcast, Walter Cronkite--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --had to break in?
Speaker 2: No that was--it was--I have the recording of the show and at the end of it, we see Walter--we, we hear Wa- when I listen to the recording at the end there's Walter Cronkite giving the news.  So it get--it's interesting 'cause I have the actual date and time when it was happening.  I have it somewhere here or in my archives over in the library.
Speaker 1: Well, Cronkite broke in to say what?
Speaker 2: He didn't break in, it was just--
Speaker 1: It was at the end of the--
Speaker 2: --end of the show, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was he--what did he say?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think what was going on in the news at that time.  Don't remember.
Speaker 1: Did it have anything to do with the sit-ins in Greensboro [North Carolina], was it?
Speaker 2: Yes, it had to do with the sit-ins, yeah.
Speaker 1: North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University] students who sit-in in Greensboro.  It's the note I have here, but that's, okay I thought I'd ask you.  What three pieces did you perform on television that night?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I, I also did 'District Storyville' [HistoryMaker Donald McKayle].
Speaker 1: And what is that about?
Speaker 2: It's about the beginning of jazz in the brothels of New Orleans [Louisiana].  And I have a character loosely based on the young Louis Armstrong, Little Lou.  And the New Orleans funerals and the (unclear) strut at the end of the funeral, and then the--in the maison de joie, you know, in the houses and it's a colorful dance.  In fact, I think on my wall there's a picture of [HistoryMaker] Judith Jamison dressed as the Countess Willie Piazza.  She was wonderful in it.
Speaker 1: Was she with Alvin Ailey [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]?
Speaker 2: Ailey, I said Ailey.  I didn't--I, I made it in my own company [Donald McKayle and Company] and later I said starred Ailey.  The black and white version of Ailey's and my company.
Speaker 1: Is this the first--were you the first African American choreographer to have his work broadcast on network television?
Speaker 2: I know I created waves because the advertisers didn't like interracial companies.  And that was 'Games' [Donald McKayle] though.  We had no problem with doing 'District Storyville.' That was a few years later.  Things had moved a little bit.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. The 'District Storyville' was 1962, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Sixty-two [1962]?  Yeah, right, okay.
Story_ID: 646679
Speaker 1: What is 'On the Sound,' (unclear)?
Speaker 2: 'On the Sound' is a jazz dance that I did on television and the sound is Long Island Sound.  It was set on the Long Island Sound and, and the woods above it and where we run through the woods and I see these two girls dancing and we go down to the beach, and it's improvisation.  Gigi Gryce wrote the jazz score and you can see that on YouTube, just look for it, 1962 'On the Sound.'  And then I have in '69 [1969]--in '69 [1969], I'm dancing with Diana Ross in 'The Hollywood Palace.'
Speaker 1: We go next to '63 [1963].  Beginning at '63 [1963] it says here you began choreographing for television programs, so which ones?
Speaker 2: I did so many.  I must give you my resume.
Speaker 1: Okay, well we have it, that's why we got--that's where we got these questions, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well that's not the whole thing, that was just, you know, put together so it would be a sizeable thing.
Speaker 1: But you did choreography for 'The Ed Sullivan Show'?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Over the course of a couple of years?
Speaker 2: I did quite a few things for them.  And there were The Beatles too.
Speaker 1: So when The Beatles came there was choreography that accompanied their?
Speaker 2: I would--I would be choreographing the show and then they would be brought on as guest artists.  I did with Michael Jackson and I think 'Ed Sullivan Show' you would work and then he would come in and watch it and decide what was gonna stay and what was gonna be moved around.  He was--he wasn't there for the whole week, he just came in the last minute.
Speaker 1: But he was hands on when he showed up?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: So you wondered when you watch the show if Ed Sullivan is just the host or is he really?
Speaker 2: He's the host, but he has a lot to say.  It's his production.  I remember I was doing 'Bless You All' [Harold J. Rome] at the Martin--at the Mark Hellinger Theatre [New York, New York] and I would run up to wa- Ed Sullivan Theater [New York, New York] and do rehearsals for television and then run back and get back into the show at the Mark Hellinger.  In the winter that's pretty much.
Speaker 1: You did the Oscars [Academy Awards] too in 1970, right?
Speaker 2: I did the Oscars twice, yes.
Speaker 1: In 1970 was also--no '69 [1969], I'm sorry, well no 1970, you choreographed that--you're forty years old now in 1970, and you choreographed the Walt Disney movie 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks'?
Speaker 2: And Broomsticks, yeah.
Speaker 1: This is like a fantasy movie, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's fantasy.  And it was Disney's [Walt Disney Productions; The Walt Disney Company] sequel to 'Mary Poppins.'  Angela Lansbury was the star.  And we did animation and live action together.  There was a thing where we were under the water of the beautiful briny sea (laughter).  Fun thing to work on.  I worked on it for quite a number of months.
Speaker 1: So the dancers had to perform as if they were underwater?
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Lots of bubbles.  And then we're using our sodium process at the time to do the underwater scenes with the live action and animated character.  And I would do a certain number of studies and they'd look at them and they'd say well we need so much more minutes to make the animation look smooth.  So I'd change the dance to work for that.
Speaker 1: This is a complicated process I guess with animation and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, and at that point there were, you know, there were a lot of little ladies drawing, painting. It was before they got computers (laughter).
Speaker 1: So women had to paint every cell?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh and gloves.  A room full of them.
Speaker 1: So you saw the process of this (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I enjoyed learning that. It was very fascinating.
Story_ID: 646680
Speaker 1: Now, also that same year you be- became the head of the Inner City Repertory Dance Company [at the Inner City Cultural Center]?
Speaker 2: Yes, out here in California (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is this in--this in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: California.
Speaker 1: California?
Speaker 2: 'Cause I was out here doing a movie ['Bedknobs and Broomsticks'] and Disney [Walt Disney Productions; The Walt Disney Company], you see.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is in Los Angeles [California].  Is this in South Central L.A.?
Speaker 2: In Los--it was in, yeah--was in--where was it now.  It wasn't quite that far.  Trying to remember exactly where the Inner City was.
Speaker 1: Is this the group that [HistoryMaker] Marla Gibbs was part of?
Speaker 2: No, no.  C. Bernard Jackson was the director of it.  And we were middle of Los Angeles, but not in the South Central.
Speaker 1: So this was a new dance company or had it been around a while?
Speaker 2: It was Inner City Repertory Dance Company.
Speaker 1: You were the head of it from 1970 to '74 [1974], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what works did you do with Inner City?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness.  What works did I do.  I can look it up in the book ['Transcending Boundaries: My Dancing Life,' Donald McKayle] and tell you.
Speaker 1: I know but, any stories from the Los Angeles experience?  I know you had to remember?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  It was really fascinating working on movies.  When I first got here I was doing--I had classes, dance class.  They made me a wooden stage that was sprung 'cause they would usually have movies on the hard floor so the cameras would be smooth.  Remember, I was doing something and Nureyev was a dancer in the program.  And he came with Margot Fonteyn, and he says, "Where do we dance?" He says, "No I don't dance on that."  So they made him a floor and then they covered it with a towel so it would look like the rest of the studio.  And come and see what we've done, he said, "Very good, okay let's--we're ready to start.  Now it's time for my lunch," (laughter).  He was a character.  And that was here in Hollywood.
Speaker 1: Rudolf Nureyev?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So you were doing so many movies, was it that you just decided to stay out here for a while?
Speaker 2: I did one after another, yes.  I did movies, I did television shows.  A lot of specials.
Speaker 1: Now the film, 'The Great White Hope'--
Speaker 2: 'White Hope.'
Speaker 1: --you choreographed it?
Speaker 2: Yes, [HistoryMaker] James Earl Jones.
Speaker 1: It was a really physical role--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --for James Earl Jones?
Speaker 2: He was marvelous in it too.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's the thinnest I've ever seen James Earl Jones?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, he had to work (laughter).
Speaker 1: So did you choreograph the boxing scenes?
Speaker 2: No.  Those were ac- done in acting.  I choreographed the celebration when he was--won his championship, the celebration.  That was great.  We did it on 20th Century Fox [Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation].  They remade the 'Dolly' set for the movie.
Speaker 1: Oh the--
Speaker 2: They did--they, you know, they just redid some of the buildings and what have you.
Speaker 1: Oh, the 'Hello, Dolly!' set?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, I was trying to figure out what, okay.  The 'Hello, Dolly!' set they just redid it, they tweaked it for 'The Great White Hope'?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I worked at Disney, they would do that all the time, the back lots you know, they would have certain buildings that were there that they would redo them, add to and take away.
Speaker 1: It makes sense, you know, it's the same time period, time frame (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 646681
Speaker 1: Now in '74 [1974] you, you choreograph 'Raisin' [Robert Nemiroff and Charlotte Zaltzberg]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And now this is back in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: New York, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what scenes did you choreograph in 'Raisin'?
Speaker 2: Well, the whole show.  I directed it too.  And I had Debbie Allen and Joe Morton, Ernestine Jackson, great performers.  There was an opening that was all choreographed that wasn't in the play at all.  'Cause it was a hard scene to choreograph the way the play was written, it was all in one apartment.  You know, so we had to take it outside of that setting.  And that took imagination.  I'm going to work on the subway.  Joe Morton was terrific in it.  And Debbie, I found her, you know, she was a dancer and I had someone else doing her part, and it didn't work out with this other person.  I put Debbie and she was sensational.  Well this was when we were out of town, down in Washington, D.C.  Debbie was a producer from the beginning.  She was a former student down there at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and she called up all of her friends and said, "You call and--the theater and ask them whether that girl who was on last night is going to be on again tonight."  And she just made her own publicity.  And they said, "Damn it the phone's been ringing, everybody asking for that Debbie Allen."  So we were--at that time the show was running and Sher- Sherise Powell [ph.] was doing Beneatha [Beneatha Younger] and we came down and saw Debbie do it and gave her--I gave her the role for New York.
Story_ID: 646682
Speaker 1: You went to high school, or you knew the former husband of Lorraine Hansberry in high school (unclear)?  Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Robert Nemiroff, yeah.  We were in Club L'Ouverture together.  So I knew him for quite a while.  He went to Music and Art high school [High School of Music and Art; Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York] and I went to DeWitt Clinton [DeWitt Clinton High School, Bronx, New York], but we met at the club.  And I knew Lorraine from when they were married.
Speaker 1: So did you know--did you have conversations with her about the play when she was writing it or after you came in?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) No.  I remember seeing it.  I went to the theater to see it. I sat next to Lena Horne, lovely (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. But you had a feel for it and a sense?
Speaker 2: Well, the fact--making it into a musical and getting songs written, 'cause it was a dramatic play, 'Raisin in the Sun' ['A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry] and 'Raisin' [Robert Nemiroff and Charlotte Zaltzberg] became the name of the musical and from Langston Hughes' poem ['Harlem'], "What happened to a raisin in the sun" [sic.], you know.  It was--I, I remember it had Sidney Poitier and [HistoryMaker] Ruby Dee in it, in the Broadway play.  And Joe Morton played Walter Lee [Walter Lee Younger] and Ernestine Jackson played the wife [Ruth Younger].  It was a, it was a different thing 'cause we had to use musical performers.
Story_ID: 646683
Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe, I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, can you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Donald Cohen McKayle [HistoryMaker Donald McKayle].  D-O-N-A-L-D, C-O-H-E-N, M-C-K-A-Y-L-E.
Speaker 1: And sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: July 6th, 1930, and my date of birth, and I was born in New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: What is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a choreographer, a director.  I'm a professor of dance at the university.  Those are my occupations.
Speaker 1: You're at the University of California at Irvine [University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California], right?
Speaker 2: University of California at Irvine, yes.
Speaker 1: What is today's date?
Speaker 2: What is today's date, this is a trick question.  Today is the 28th of July.
Speaker 1: Twenty fourteen [2014], right?
Speaker 2: Twenty fourteen [2014], yes.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are at my apartment in 20--a 203 Gabrielino Drive.
Speaker 1: In Irvine, California.
Speaker 2: Irvine, California, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, we're gonna pick up in 1957, we're gonna backtrack a little bit.  We had talked about 'West Side Story' [Arthur Laurents] before, but I just wanna go back and cover it again.  Now, in '57 [1957], you join the cast of 'West Side Story.' Were you recruited or did you audition or how did it work?
Speaker 2: No, Jerome Robbins came and asked me to be--to be part of the cast and to be the person in charge of the choreography while he was away.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the production was already--
Speaker 2: Production was already on and running, yes, a big success.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you came on and so did you actually dance in the production too?
Speaker 2: I would dance if somebody was out in the shocks part of it. I would dance, yes.
Speaker 1: But your primary responsibility was to be the choreographer of the--I mean to oversee the choreography?
Speaker 2: Oversee the choreography, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, did you get a chance to add anything to the show yourself?
Speaker 2: I didn't add any choreography, no.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you would've added had you been allowed to?
Speaker 2: I can't think of it. Really quite a complete show.
Speaker 1: It was a good show, I mean it stands the test of time.  But I just wondered, you know, as a dancer, you know, watching it, if you would've done something different when--if you would've been in charge of it yourself?
Speaker 2: I would've done most of the things differently if I was in charge of it myself, but I wasn't.
Speaker 1: Now did you ever hear the rumor that 'West Side Story' was originally supposed to be about black and white in New York City?
Speaker 2: I heard there's a rumor, but I didn't know whether it was true or not.
Speaker 1: I hear this from time to time, but I, like you, I don't know how to confirm that.
Speaker 2: Do you think--I mean looking back on it, I mean this is 1957, the Montgomery Bus Boycott was going on or was just finishing up, and the country was really turning to some of the racial, you know, tensions, you know, in this country for the first time as a--I mean really looking at it.  Do you think that 'West Side Story' was a timely, you know, Broadway show in that regard?
Speaker 1: Yes, I think it was, a very timely one.  And the thing that came after, more timely, but it was wonderful (yawns) time and place.
Speaker 2: I know I heard something--I never saw 'Show Boat' [Oscar Hammerstein II], but I heard that 'Show Boat' had a theme of, you know, racial identity and conflict in the U.S. at the core of it as well?
Speaker 1: Yes it did.
Speaker 2: And that was the first Broadway musical, I believe, right?  The first modern (unclear)--
Speaker 1: I don't know if that was the first, but it did have that in it.
Story_ID: 646684
Speaker 1: Now in '59 [1959], you did one of your--what's been called one of your classic masterworks, 'Rainbow Round My Shoulder' [Donald McKayle]?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And what inspired you to produce 'Rainbow'?
Speaker 2: 'Rainbow Round My Shoulder' is one of my classic works and one of my works that's done all over the world.  And a number of things which inspired me.  The music, chain gang songs.  So, they're working as they're singing so there's an explosion of breath (singing), "I've got a rainbow, ha- tied around my shoulder ha- ," as the--as the hammer came down hit the rocks.  And so it made it very special music.
Speaker 1: You were telling me, I think previously, that the recordings of Alan Lomax, who is a professor, white man, who went down, went into the South with recording equipment during the '40s [1940s], I guess, who recorded, you know, the songs on chain gangs and the songs of the prisons and railroad gandy dancer songs and some of the folk music from the South.  Did you hear any of these in person or did you just hear them on record?
Speaker 2: Just on records.
Speaker 1: Okay, but--so, now what is the storyline for your piece and what, you know, what were you trying to do with it?
Speaker 2: Well 'Rainbow' is about men who are incarcerated.  And while they're in prison, they dream of (yawns) freedom and freedom comes to them in the guise of a woman.  So that's, that's my storyline.  And she co- she--this woman runs throughout the dance, keeps coming and going.
Speaker 1: Okay, now why was she depicted--why is freedom being depicted by a woman?
Speaker 2: Because they couldn't have a woman.  And so it was something that was in their minds.
Speaker 1: That makes sense (laughter).  It does make sense though.  So the spirit--she represents the spirit of freedom or actually freedom, itself?
Speaker 2: Freedom itself, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now this work was--now where did you open it--where did you open 'Rainbow Round My Shoulder'?
Speaker 2: I did it at the Kaufmann auditorium [Kaufmann Concert Hall], which is a Y [92nd Street Young Men's Hebrew Association; 92nd Street Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association, New York, New York] and it's on 92nd Street and Lexington Avenue.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA INTERUPTION)
Speaker 2: So you were saying that you staged 'Rainbow Round My Shoulder' first at the Kaufmann auditorium at 92nd and--
Speaker 1: And Lexington Avenue, New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Now this is a piece that was performed--how long did it run in New York before you took it on the road?
Speaker 1: Well, you do concerts at the Y, just concert engagements, and so it, it kept playing all over the place.  We took it all over the world.  It wasn't like a show that runs for a number of performances.
Story_ID: 646685
Speaker 1: Where are some of the places you played in the United States in the early days?
Speaker 2: Oh, we play- played in Connecticut, we played in Maryland, we played in all the New England states, and then we also played in some of the border states of the South.
Speaker 1: Now did you have an agent that managed, you know, your tour?
Speaker 2: Yes, we did have an agent, Charles Reinhart [Charles L. Reinhart].
Speaker 1: And who were some of the dancers in the show, in the original show?
Speaker 2: In the original show is myself, Alds- Alfred DeSio, Charles Moore, Harold Pierson, I'm gonna leave people out, but there were seven men and the woman was Mary Hinkson.
Speaker 1: Was she a regular part of your company [Donald McKayle and Company] or did she?
Speaker 2: No, she was a member of the Martha Graham Company [Martha Graham Dance Company].
Speaker 1: So when did you get your first invitation to go overseas, to take it abroad?
Speaker 2: Very quickly.  And we took it all over Europe.  It was a huge success.  And we took it all different parts of Europe too.
Speaker 1: Now this being 1959, did you have to--was there something special that you had to do to take it to Russia?  I mean, did you take it to Russia in '59 [1959] or was it later?
Speaker 2: We took it to Russia a little later I think, but there was nothing that we did to it.
Speaker 1: I mean did you have to get special permission from the government to go or anything?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Special visa or?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: This is the Cold War, you know, so I just wondered, you know, I didn't know maybe the Cold War (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was the Cold War, but this got through the Cold War.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were able to visit--in those days did the Bolshoi Ballet ever come to the United States?
Speaker 2: Yes, they had come.
Speaker 1: Did you know people in the Russian dance companies (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  I, I have met people since that time, I didn't know them at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you took 'Rainbow Round My Shoulder' [Donald McKayle] there, was this like '60 [1960] or '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, '61 [1961], yeah.
Speaker 1: Sixty-one [1961], okay.  And was there--I mean did the state department [U.S. Department of State] get involved in it in anyway or did they, was there any kind of cultural exchange worked out?
Speaker 2: We did many things with cultural exchange.  I'm not sure that going to Russia was one of them.
Speaker 1: So when you were there was there any--I guess there was informal interaction with the dancers in Russia, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, there were ac- interaction with different dancers as we met them, yeah.
Speaker 1: And were they eager to learn American dance or African American dance?
Speaker 2: Well, they just was blown away by the work, so it was that particular work that just caught their imagination.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think--yeah I think you said the last time that the idea of working on a chain gang in a situation in a unjust situation, there's a lot of people--a lot of people that worked in chain gangs in those days were there because of loitering and other specious reasons.  Did the Russian people identify with that kind of servitude?
Speaker 2: Well, the idea of being in prison and wanting freedom, we work just as well no matter what you were there for, and so that's why I did it that way.  It was wanting to be free, all people want to be free.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's a subject that resounded wherever you performed?
Speaker 2: No matter what the beginning of it was.
Speaker 1: Was your reception in the Soviet Union greater than the reception in other parts of Europe or about the same?
Speaker 2: It was amazing in the Soviet Union because it was so quiet and then suddenly there was a huge applause. They couldn't believe what they saw.
Speaker 1: So it was like they were stunned?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They were stunned, that's it.
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to meet any of the Russian heads of state?  Khrushchev, Nikita Khrushchev was the president?
Speaker 2: No I did not meet any of those people.
Speaker 1: I thought I'd ask.  How long did you tour with 'Rainbow Round My Shoulder'?
Speaker 2: Well it was part of my repertoire.  It's only eighteen minutes, so that's not a full evening, so I had other things that were on the program.
Story_ID: 646686
Speaker 1: Okay, what were the other?
Speaker 2: I had 'Games' [Donald McKayle], which was a dance I did early in my career about children playing in the ghetto streets.  Had 'Nocturne' [Donald McKayle], which is a lyric dance.  And I'm trying to remember what other ones we had.  I've done choreography for such a long time.
Speaker 1: So this was part of a full show of your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All dance.
Speaker 1: Now in 1960, you performed--this is one of the pieces from your repertoire, 'They Called Her Moses' [Donald McKayle], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: On 'Camera Three' on television, that's in 1960?  'Camera Three' was it CBS?
Speaker 2: CBS.
Speaker 1: Okay, right. All right. Was this the first time you performed--this wasn't the first time you performed on television, right?
Speaker 2: No, wasn't the first time.  'Camera Three' was the first time we did 'They Called Her Moses.'
Speaker 1: 'Camera Three' was, as I recall, a Sunday morning show, right?
Speaker 2: Yes it was, Sunday morning, CBS.
Speaker 1: This was before CBS invented 'CBS Sunday Morning,' the news magazine show.  So they had I think a 'Lamp Unto My Feet,' Camera Three,' and Meet--well not 'Meet the Press' but 'Face the Nation.' These would all be on Sunday morning.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So they had some culture, some study--some discussion about religion and theology, and then politics?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What kind of feedback did you get from 'They Called Her Moses'?
Speaker 2: Well it was a historical work about slavery in United States.  I used slave songs as its accompaniment and I think it was very powerful.  I got won- wonderful comments about it.
Speaker 1: Now this is something I didn't know, and I don't know if you remember this because you were performing and you probably--you weren't watching television and there's no videotape now, but the note I have here says that Walter Cronkite broke into the telecast to report that the sit-ins were being conducted in Greensboro, North Carolina?
Speaker 2: No.  What is was, was that I just left the television on and after we were finished, he came on and reported about that, but he didn't break into it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so it wasn't that dramatic where he'd broke into your dance.  But he came on right after--but still kind of significant juxtaposition (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's wonderful.
Speaker 1: --like you kind of set the table for that, you know?
Speaker 2: That it was--the actual dance was on and a- and some of the actual things were going on in the country.
Story_ID: 646687
Speaker 1: In 1962, you re- you choreographed and released 'District Storyville' [Donald McKayle], right?  This became part of your repertoire as well?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about 'District Storyville.' I think it's New Orleans [Louisiana] based?
Speaker 2: It's set in New Orleans--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA INTERUPTION)
Speaker 2: 'District Storyville' is set in New Orleans.  And it is about the birth of jazz and the fact that it was started in a red light district.  So it was a very interesting piece, all of this wonderful rich culture and then this debasement at the same time.
Speaker 1: Now the story, I believe, follows a character that's similar to Louis Armstrong, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I used Louis Armstrong as a starting point and I called him Little Lou in the dance.  And I used many things that were part of his life to build the dance.
Speaker 1: Now what kind of musical accompaniment did you have?
Speaker 2: I had a music that was written by Dorothea Freitag based on New Orleans music.  It was just wonderful.  It had a small combo, Clark Terry played trumpet.
Speaker 1: Clark Terry?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Clark Terry played trumpet.  And Dorothea Freitag was on piano.  We had drums and we had also some horn.  But that's it.
Speaker 1: That sounds really, really powerful (laughter).  What was the choreography like, what was your?
Speaker 2: Well, there was--there are two parts to it.  There was the funeral part because so much of the story was based around the tradition of going through the cemetery and the strut back home.  And then there was going into the actual brothel and what was going on there.
Speaker 1: Those are two places, those are the scenes of a lot of music in New Orleans, as everyone knows probably today.  But, did you--so all of the music was original music for this?
Speaker 2: It was all written by Dorothea Freitag and she used sources--original sources from New Orleans.
Speaker 1: Who danced the major roles, besides yourself?
Speaker 2: Well, William Louther danced Little Lou, he's no longer with us.  Pearl Reynolds danced the Countess Willie Piazza, which was the leading lady in the house, she's no longer with us.  Let me see, those were the leading characters.
Story_ID: 646688
Speaker 1: Now in '62 [1962], there's a short film produced about--that starred you--called 'On Sound'?  You remember that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'On the Sound.'
Speaker 1: 'On the Sound,' okay.
Speaker 2: Just because it was performed out on the sound on--the sound in terms of--
Speaker 1: Long Island Sound?
Speaker 2: --where it was done, Long Island Sound.
Speaker 1: Okay alright, and you know what was the?
Speaker 2: It was a jazz piece.  Gigi Gryce performed the music and--there were three of us, myself, Mary Hinkson, and Matt Turney dancing, and it was--it was a lot of freedom to it.  It was improvised.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So this film is probably still available in libraries today (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You can get it in the libraries, you can get it on your computer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  On YouTube?
Speaker 2: On YouTube, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 646689
Speaker 1: In '63 [1963], you're programming for--choreographing for television programs.  How did this come about and that you started choreographing television shows?
Speaker 2: Someone asked me and I said yes, (laughter).  Yeah, I did quite a number of television shows, one after the other.
Speaker 1: They include from what I have here, 'The Ed Sullivan Show.'
Speaker 2: 'Ed Sullivan.'
Speaker 1: The Oscars [Academy Awards] in 1970?
Speaker 2: I did the Oscars.
Speaker 1: What was the best picture of that--do you remember the best picture for 1970?
Speaker 2: I have no idea ['Midnight Cowboy'].
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy [1970], what was the--I can't think of it myself, but that's a big deal to choreograph Oscars.  I imagine they--did you get a good payday from that, from the Oscars?
Speaker 2: I thought it was good.  I wouldn't think it was good nowadays, but I thought it was good then.
Speaker 1: 'The Bill Cosby Special' in '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did 'Bill Cosby Special' and then I did his--his regular show ['The Cosby Show'] too.
Speaker 1: I know there was something.  I, I vaguely remember this 'Bill Cosby Special' when he had a special walk, this cool walk he would do, he do like this you know.  Was this--did you remember exactly what you choreographed for him?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't choreograph for him very much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He did his own shtick, you know.  But I chor- I had a dance company that was part of the show.
Story_ID: 646690
Speaker 1: Now '64 [1964], this is the first one of two Broadway shows about boxing that you were involved in, this was 'Golden Boy' [Clifford Odets and William Gibson]?
Speaker 2: 'Golden Boy,' yes.
Speaker 1: With Sammy Davis, Jr., right?
Speaker 2: Sammy Davis was the lead in it.  It was--it was an original story that I'd been transposed to have a black young man, I believe, because it was about--about an Italian man before.  And Sammy was marvelous in the show.  He was really--it was interesting because he was part of a whole Hollywood community there, and somehow they didn't want him to play this role, but he did.  And I remember that one after another they would come by, Elizabeth Taylor came by, she caused quite a sensation.
Speaker 1: Now this is--this is just before 'Cleopatra' comes out or right around the same--this is approaching--
Speaker 2: Before.
Speaker 1: Before, okay.
Speaker 2: And I think that he was--he was quite brave in what he did because he had a lot of trouble with people in this.  And he was--
Speaker 1: You mean in terms of what, I mean who was opposing him?
Speaker 2: He was opposed by his pack, the Rat Pack.
Speaker 1: So Frank Sinatra, Peter Lawford--
Speaker 2: I don't know why they didn't want him to do it.  I have no way of knowing that, but he did it anyway.
Story_ID: 646691
Speaker 1: We were talking about 'Golden Boy' [Clifford Odets and William Gibson] and you said that the Rat Pack, the group that--it's kind of a unofficial group of friends he [Sammy Davis, Jr.] had that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --included Frank Sinatra, Joey Bishop--
Speaker 2: Joey Bishop--
Speaker 1: Peter Lawford, I guess.
Speaker 2: Peter Lawford, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Am I missing anybody?  Frank Sinatra.
Speaker 2: We said him.
Speaker 1: We did, okay.  This group didn't want him in 'Golden Boy'?  Do you have any idea why not?
Speaker 2: (Raises hands) Don't know.
Speaker 1: I take it, you said he was wonderful in the part and he was, he got great reviews.  I mean was he easy for you to work with as a choreographer?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  He was having trouble with quite a few things.  And he was such a talent though.  He could sing.  He was a good actor.  So, it's just whether--how his mood was and he would be sometimes difficult.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's moody, but extremely talented?
Speaker 2: Extremely talented.
Speaker 1: Was there ever a time in the rehearsals where you thought it wasn't gonna work?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. Who else was in the show and what was--I guess what was the most satisfying, you know, part of the choreography as far as you're concerned?
Speaker 2: Well there were some great numbers like "127th Street" ["Don't Forget 127th Street"] (singing), "Don't forget 127th Street, don't forget my happy Harlem home."  That was a great number.  And then Lola Falana was in it and she was terrific.  It was her first show on Broadway and she was a knockout.  Theresa Merritt was in it and she was wonderful.  Billy Daniels, he was very different, you know, he was (unclear) let's say it like that, he was quite something.  And Ken--Hollywood people, Ken Tobey [Kenneth Tobey], he played the manager and he was good, really good.  It was a great cast.
Story_ID: 646692
Speaker 1: Now you choreographed for 'The Ed Sullivan Show' and you, you were choreographing some material the night in 1964 when The Beatles made their debut, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I, I choreographed on and off for 'The Ed Sullivan Show.'  He didn't have any regular choreographer.  So he asked me many times to come and choreograph something for them.
Speaker 1: Now most of the big variety shows, did they have a--did most of them have a regular choreographer?  I know Jackie Gleason had June Taylor.
Speaker 2: Yes, Jackie Gleason had June Taylor, that was very regular and ra- it was--it made it a particular look to that show, the June Taylor Dancers.  But, 'Ed Sullivan' didn't have anything like that.  A very different kind of a show.
Speaker 1: Did like most of the dance pieces on 'Ed Sullivan' come directly from Broadway, from the shows that they were in?
Speaker 2: No.  No I would do completely original things.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what your choreography was about on that day, on that particular night?
Speaker 2: Which night are you talking about?
Speaker 1: The night that The Beatles were on stage?
Speaker 2: I didn't have a big piece that night.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so it's not a memorable--not for--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --well it may have been memorable but not for--you don't remember it?  Okay.
Story_ID: 646693
Speaker 1: I'm jumping ahead to 1970.  You choreographed for the Disney film 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now was the first film you had choreographed?
Speaker 2: I think so.  I may be wrong, my memory may be not that good.  But it was a big film.  It was like a kind of successor to 'Mary Poppins.' It was a big film.
Speaker 1: Now this is an important assignment because one of the strengths of the film 'Mary Poppins' was the choreography.
Speaker 2: Yes it was.
Speaker 1: Dick Van Dyke with the chimney sweeps dancing in this big production.  So this is quite a plum then to get this job?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was wonderful.
Speaker 1: Did you have a seg- did you have to choreograph chimney sweeps too or other?
Speaker 2: No, there's nothing like chimney sweeps in 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks.'  But I had to choreograph fishes on the sea whereby.
Speaker 1: Fishes in the sea, were they portrayed by humans, I guess?
Speaker 2: I--they we--no they were animation and live action together.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is interesting.  So you had to choreograph live action with animation added?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you would have to choreograph what the fishes--they had to be fish (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I loved it, I enjoyed it, it was wonderful.
Speaker 1: How long does it take to do a project like that, like 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks,' a major film?
Speaker 2: It took quite a few months.  Because it was, we had a second unit too when we had some of the war scenes because it was set in the real--in the real war.  And it was a different kind of feeling from the other things.  It was--it was a good job, very good job.
Story_ID: 646694
Speaker 1: You also in 1970 became the head of the Inner City Repertory Dance Company, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I moved here to Los Angeles [California] in order to do films, such as 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks.'  And so I was--I, I became a choreographer with Inner City company because the director of Inner City [Inner City Cultural Center, Los Angeles, California] was a former colleague of mine in New York [New York] and we had worked together, Clarence Jackson [C. Bernard Jackson].
Speaker 1: Okay, now was it difficult to leave New York after being involved in New York for so long?
Speaker 2: I didn't find it difficult.  Most people found it very difficult, but I just said, "Hey something new." And I wanted to do it.
Speaker 1: Now you were married at the time, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, so was it hard to convince your wife [Lea Vivante] to come to California?
Speaker 2: No, she came.
Speaker 1: And did you have children by that time?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I had two children [Gabrielle McKayle and Liane McKayle] by my first wife [Esta Beck], and then my, my present wife had a son [Guy McKayle].  So there's three children involved all together.
Speaker 1: So at this time in 1970, were you married to your first wife or your second wife?
Speaker 2: Second wife?
Speaker 1: Second wife, okay, all right.  How did you meet?
Speaker 2: We met in Israel.  I went to Israel to do choreography for the Batsheva Company [Batsheva Dance Company] and that's where we met, she was a dancer with the company.
Speaker 1: And when was this?
Speaker 2: Dates, dates, dates, I think it was just about--it was around the time of me doing the Disney film.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was just a year before I guess, or so before, the same year, 1970, is that right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So Inner City Repertory Dance Company, you were the head of it for four years from 1970 to 1974?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did you basically do the choreography and the repertoire you did in New York?
Speaker 2: I set up a company here in Los Angeles, modern dance company, and it was very successful.  And I built a repertoire.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right you--did--so then you continued to build on what you already started?
Speaker 2: I started--I, I used some of the repertoire that I had in New York, yes.
Story_ID: 646695
Speaker 1: In '72 [1972], you created what one writer called, your fourth masterwork, 'Songs of the Disinherited' [Donald McKayle].  Tell us about this work, what inspired you to create this and what was the, what was it like visually and what were you doing?
Speaker 2: 'Songs of the Disinherited' were songs that belonged to different peoples who had been disinherited in life.
Speaker 1: What do you mean by disinherited?
Speaker 2: Well they had been cut off.  There's one beautiful solo that's absolutely a work that stands by itself almost, it's called 'Angelitos Negros' and Roberta Flack sings it in Spanish.  This means in English black angels.  And she said, "Even though the virgin may be white, paint me little black angels for they too go to heaven."  And I remember that--at the end of that dance, it was a long solo, it wasn't short.  She's spinning and revolving around herself and the skirt is going out in a wide circle, and the audience is going crazy.  It's one of those solos that will live forever.
Speaker 1: I was, the title reminded me of the book 'Jesus of the Disinherited' [sic. 'Jesus and the Disinherited'] by Howard Thurman.  Were you inspired by that at all?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't know anything about it.
Speaker 1: Now he had a similar theme in his book about those who have as much right to the world as anybody else, but that right has been removed by someone or somehow.  So, what was the reception to 'Songs of the Disinherited'?
Speaker 2: It was a success, huge success.  And it started with a scene that was going forward, pressing forward like the people trek and they have to make, I'm on my way to the point and that was--my feeling was that had to do with dealing with slavery.  And then there was a scene that had to do with the Depression [Great Depression] where you couldn't get work.  "Upon the mountain Julia called, can't make a dollar, save my soul."  And then 'Angelitos Negros' and they are finished with sort of uplifting, swinging gospel--urban gospel and that was (singing), "Run, shake alive, run life eternal, shake it out of me all that is carnal."  Wonderful, wonderful.  The music was marvelous.  I enjoyed doing it so much.  It's one of those dances that just poured out of me.
Story_ID: 646696
Speaker 1: So this is, this is 1972, and that same year you had time to choreograph the film, 'The Great White Hope'?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So was the choreography that you did much different from the--well when you choreograph a film it's gonna be different from the stage?
Speaker 2: Completely different.  And it was--it had a, you know, a narrative story and [HistoryMaker] James Earl Jones was the boxer.  And he was excellent in it.  And I enjoyed the change from one thing to another, the challenge of one medium to another, very much.
Speaker 1: So when you choreograph a film, what other considerations that are different from choreographing for the stage?
Speaker 2: Well you have, you know, angle can be from anywhere, you know, you're not against a background.  And it was--it was a boxing scene that I choreographed and he won and that was, yeah, a big thing in those days, a black boxer wins.
Speaker 1: This is in the age of Muhammad Ali?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Muhammad Ali was the heavyweight champion.  I don't--I'm trying to remember if Ali was on hiatus--if he was suspended during this period of time?
Speaker 2: No he was fighting.
Speaker 1: He was back, okay, so he was back again.  And I know his first fight back, he lost to Joe Frazier didn't he, I believe?  I believe he lost that first fight to Joe Frazier?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think he lost the first one and he subsequently beat him, you know, twice.  'The Great White Hope' is about, I guess harkens back to Jack Johnson, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  They wanted him to win because they didn't want a black man to be the champion.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they had a great white hope--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that was supposed to beat the black champion.
Story_ID: 646697
Speaker 1: In '74 [1974], you directed and choreographed 'Raisin' [Robert Nemiroff and Charlotte Zaltzberg], this is a musical on Broadway, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I choreographed 'Raisin' on Broadway.
Speaker 1: Now did you direct the show as well or?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you directed the show and did the choreography?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did both.
Speaker 1: Is this your first time directing actors in a Broadway show?
Speaker 2: I think so, yes. Big assignment.
Speaker 1: Well, who was in 'Raisin,' who did you have to direct?
Speaker 2: I had--he played--I had--Virginia Capers played Mama [Lena Younger].  I had--played--I don't why his name just went out of my head, very good actor who played--
Speaker 1: Walter Lee [Walter Lee Younger]?
Speaker 2: Walter Lee.  And Ernestine Jackson played his wife [Ruth Younger].  Ralph--Ralph Carter was Travis [Travis Younger].
Speaker 1: Debbie Allen was in it right?
Speaker 2: Debbie Allen came in and played Beneatha [Beneatha Younger].
Speaker 1: I saw the show a long time ago in Cincinnati [Ohio], and I remember there's a big dance number that Beneatha had, sort of an African dance number right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was when they were teasing her--teasing the Beneatha character about her going back to Africa and things like that, and the mother says, "I don't know anything about Africa," you know, she wasn't that--she wasn't at all aligned with Africa.  And Debbie was fabulous in it.
Speaker 1: Now when did you first meet Debbie Allen?
Speaker 2: I met her in Connecticut, New London, Connecticut just streamed to mind, when.
Speaker 1: Is she a high school student at that time or was she in Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: She was--she was at Howard I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, and she's somebody that you kept in touch with as?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, we've stayed very good friends.
Speaker 1: Could it be said that you've been her mentor, I guess, in terms of dance and choreography?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, she says that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well that's good.  Right, she's now a powerful force in her own right?
Speaker 2: She is very powerful.  She always had a sense of being a producer, as well as a choreographer and dancer.  She put things together and made sure she had her way about things.  She was quite, quite a force.
Speaker 1: Now she's been engaged in theatrical directing too, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, was it difficult for you to direct actors in a Broadway show?
Speaker 2: No.  It was different.
Speaker 1: So were you satisfied with the results?
Speaker 2: Usually, yes.
Speaker 1: So I just wondered, it seems to be they would be very extremely--
Speaker 2: Joe Morton, that was--
Speaker 1: Joe Morton, okay.
Speaker 2: --he was the--
Speaker 1: He was Walter Lee?
Speaker 2: He was Walter Lee.
Speaker 1: Right.  A lot of people know him from the movie 'Brother from Another Plant' ['The Brother from Another Planet'].  He was in there.  Yeah, Joe Morton, right.  I imagine, I was getting ready to say that I imagine it would be difficult for or impossible for a theatrical--I mean a theater director to direct this choreography?
Speaker 2: Well, yes it is.  I don't think most of them ever done it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think it moves that in that direction?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But as a choreographer you can go to (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now this of course is a big hit, tours the country, plays on Broadway, tours the country.  It's still probably touring someplace?
Speaker 2: It's always being--being played somewhere.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1974 is 'Raisin.'
Speaker 2: It won the Tony Award [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre].
Story_ID: 646698
Speaker 1: Now you received an Emmy nomination in '74 [1974] for a television special which was also an album and a book called 'Free to Be... You and Me'?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about that project?
Speaker 2: 'Free to Be... You and Me' was about children, and their songs and their games.  I love children so I love to do that kind of work.  We had quite a great time putting that together.  It was set in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: The cast on the album and the songs were sung and recited by Alan Alda, Rosey Grier, Cicely Tyson, Carol Channing, Michael Jackson, Shirley Jones, Jack Cassidy, Diana Ross, Marlo Thomas, [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte, Mel Brooks, Rita Coolidge, Billy De Wolfe, Roberta Flack, that's quite an assemblage there of talent?
Speaker 2: Quite a wonderful group, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you received an Emmy nomination, but it would seem like with a cast like that you all would've won the (laughter)?
Speaker 2: They didn't give it to us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah I know with Dustin Hoffman was in it too. I didn't--there's even more.
Speaker 2: I don't remember him.
Speaker 1: Maybe he was on the album or something but--

Speaker 1: In 1975 you were appointed artistic director of the School of Dance [Sharon Disney Lund School of Dance] of the, of the California Institute for the Arts [sic. California Institute of the Arts, Valencia, California]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you--at this time you're like forty-five years old.  Were you still dancing?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there an expiration date for a dancer?
Speaker 2: Different. You know, dates and I kept dancing longer than most dancers do.
Speaker 1: How long did you keep dancing?
Speaker 2: I kept dancing--
Speaker 1: I mean professionally, where you would go out on the stage and dance?
Speaker 2: I danced right around seven, eight years after that.
Speaker 1: So you were in your fifties before you stopped actually dancing?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Did you have any--was there anything wrong with you when you stopped or did you just think it was time to?
Speaker 2: I stopped because I was too busy doing choreography.  And the thing about most dancers when they stop dancing it's like you're taking your life away from them.  But I was busy doing choreography, it wasn't the same with me.  I had already gone to another stage in my career.  Although I started with choreography.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.
Speaker 2: I went--I didn't start usu- the usual way.  I started choreographing right from the get go.
Story_ID: 646700
Speaker 1: So at CalArts [California Institute of the Arts, Valencia, California], now you were there--while you were there, you choreographed the film the 'Minstrel Man.' It was a 1976 [sic. 1977] film starring Glynn Turman.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And for what I remember it was based on minstrel shows, black (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and old minstrel shows?
Speaker 2: And it was a good project, very good project.  And I had known Glynn from when he was--played Travis [Travis Younger] in the original 'Raisin' [Robert Nemiroff and Charlotte Zaltzberg].  He was an actor playing and now he's grown up.
Speaker 1: Did you have, this is--the minstrel show was, I guess, it was one of the original forms of American entertainment that started, you know, during slavery by white people imitating black people, and then later, black people imitating white people imitating black people.  Does it have like any shred of authenticity in terms of African carryover or black dance in it?
Speaker 2: No, it's something all in itself.  And the minstrel show it took a long time to get rid of it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so kind of discuss--is it a, I mean, it's something that needs to be gotten rid of on one hand, but then again does it have any value?
Speaker 2: All of these things have some value.  And you know, they have their time and place.  So, yes it has a value, but you didn't need to have minstrel shows when you had these great actors who could play anything.
Speaker 1: Okay, it was something that was--its demise was--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was dismissive.
Speaker 1: Right, so it reduced black people rather than--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it wasn't anything that--there wasn't any truth in it.
Speaker 1: Okay, you're still teaching at CalArts when you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: When you choreograph this film?  And so was that the relationship, I mean at CalArts they gave you the latitude to, you know, you had enough latitude to work on film projects?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Story_ID: 646701
Speaker 1: Interesting, as I remember in 1976 and '77 [1977], people had rediscovered Scott Joplin's ragtime piano playing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes.
Speaker 1: And there was a look back at the turn of the century--of the 19th century, you know, where the 20th century began, there was a lot of looking back at that, it seems in the '70s [1870s]?
Speaker 2: Yes, there was and I'm glad that happened because Scott Joplin was wonderful.
Speaker 1: Was 'Shuffle Along' produced around the same time, I know?
Speaker 2: 'Shuffle Along' was much earlier.
Speaker 1: Earlier, okay.  I mean, I know the original one was much earlier, but the revival on Broadway was--
Speaker 2: They didn't revive it.
Speaker 1: Wasn't Eubie Blake part of some kind of revival?
Speaker 2: He's in the original.
Speaker 1: In '81 [1981], you became responsible for the entire concept, staging and choreography of 'Sophisticated Ladies'?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right now, what is--I mean the entire concept, staging and choreography, what does all that entail?
Speaker 2: Well, it was--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA INTERUPTION)
Speaker 2: 'Sophisticated Ladies' was a show about Duke Ellington and so they wanted to use his music and his life.  Well you have to have a concept of doing that.  And so I worked for a year addressing the concept.
Speaker 1: Okay, how's the concept different from, I guess, the libretto I guess?
Speaker 2: We didn't have libretto as such.  We did have scenes, but we did have libretto which was like a book show which went all the way through.  And I, I forgo- it was gonna be about his music, then we should encapsulate every stage of his music.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the show consisted of production numbers I guess, rather than--
Speaker 2: Production numbers and there were, you know, solos and duets and things like that.  But it was all about the music.  It wasn't about the times, if you paid attention to the times with costuming and things like that.
Speaker 1: So it wasn't a story about a particular person or character, okay.  So you didn't need a libretto then and such.  So you basically, this show is something that you conceived of and staged and choreographed?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you are responsible for 'Sophisticated Ladies'?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Except for the Duke Ellington music (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I didn't do the Duke Ellington music, no (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well you're the one that, that (unclear) this show.  So this is a tremendous--it was a tremendous success, won a lot of awards.  Is there any--what's the most memorable thing about the show for you?
Speaker 2: The working with the music, I guess that was wonderful.  I had worked with June [ph.] before, you know, in television, I had done things, but just have his whole library to work with was marvelous.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite number, you know, of Duke Ellington's?
Speaker 2: I had a lot of favorites.
Speaker 1: They're all in the show I guess (laughter).  So who is--did you pick--hand pick the cast?
Speaker 2: I picked the cast, yes.
Speaker 1: So who was in it, give us some idea of who's in it?
Speaker 2: It's Gregory Hines, Phyllis, Phyllis what's her last name, she just died.
Speaker 1: Hyman?
Speaker 2: Hyman.  Phyllis Hyman, oh what a talent that is.  Ernestine Baker [sic.], Ralph Carter [sic.], Debbie Allen [sic.], (pause) I'm sure I've left out about three people.
Story_ID: 646702
Speaker 1: I think I asked you this, but I don't think you--did, did you have a favorite aspect of the show?  That you know, part of the show?  I know you created the whole thing, but, but was there a favorite part of the show?
Speaker 2: No.  It was, you know, it was doing the whole thing that was my favorite, yes that was wonderful.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So the show ran on Broadway, right?
Speaker 2: Yes and then toured.
Speaker 1: How long a Broadway run did it have?
Speaker 2: About a year.
Speaker 1: I know it toured the entire world, right, the United States included?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Did you accompany the show on some of the tours?
Speaker 2: No I didn't go.
Speaker 1: Who directed the show initially?  Did you direct it initially?
Speaker 2: I directed it.
Speaker 1: Who directed it on the road?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: Okay. You don't know (laughter) okay, oh well.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Probably lots of different people I guess.  I mean by this time anyway.  So now in '89 [1989], you joined the--oh let's go back to 'Sophisticated Ladies' for a minute.  Do you remember some of the awards you won for 'Sophisticated Ladies'?
Speaker 2: Lots of them.  It won the Tony [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre] and then there were various awards for different parts of the show.  Choreography, there's (unclear) number for that show.
Story_ID: 646703
Speaker 1: Now in 1989 you join the faculty of the University of California at Ir- Irvine [University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California] here, close to where we are right now. Well, what was the deal that, you know, brought you to the University of California at Irvine?
Speaker 2: They wanted me and they wanted me very badly.  And so I said, "Well why should I come?"  So they made me a good offer and I came.
Speaker 1: Now there's a dance facility--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --that's--no, go ahead tell us about it?
Speaker 2: There is a dance--there's a dance major there.  And so that's something that I was very interested in.
Speaker 1: Now the University of California at Irvine is also the home for your archives.  Is that part of the deal too?
Speaker 2: That came along with it.  Not that it didn't begin with me making that deal.  My archives are there now.
Speaker 1: Okay. What's in the archives, can you give us an idea?
Speaker 2: Everything I've done in some way.  And if you wanna find out something about me, go to the archives.
Speaker 1: Okay. So that includes like photographs, for instance, letters?
Speaker 2: Letters--
Speaker 1: Playbills I guess?
Speaker 2: All that.
Speaker 1: All that, okay.  Any film in the archives?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You also taught at Bennington [Bennington College, Bennington, Vermont], Juilliard [The Juilliard School, New York, New York], American Dance Festival [Durham, North Carolina] and I guess there are other places too, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, well I've been a professor of dance of quite a while, and I taught at Bennington fr- and Bard College [Annandale-on-Hudson, New York] first; and then I went to the other places.
Story_ID: 646704
Speaker 1: Now did you still have Inner City Dance Company [Inner City Repertory Dance Company]?  No, no you left there in '74 [1974], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You left there in '74 [1974].  But in '95 [1995], you became the choreographer for the Limon Dance Company?
Speaker 2: I was chor- choreographing mentor.
Speaker 1: And that's a dance company in the Los Angeles [California] area here?
Speaker 2: It's in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: In New York, okay.  It's an old dance company founded by Jose (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Jose Limon.
Speaker 1: --Limon in 1946.  Now in '99 [1999], you choreographed 'It Ain't Nothin' But the Blues' and it earned a Tony [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre] nomination.  Tell us about that project?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a--it was I, I love the blues.  I love everything that had to do with the blues.  And this was--some of the people that I worked with in Denver [Colorado] which did the show with me there created it and I, I just came along with it with great collaborators.
Speaker 1: Now this is, so those people would be Charles Bevel, Lita Gaithers, Randal Myler, Ron Taylor and Dan Wheetman, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Went all over the country.
Speaker 1: It received a Tony nomination for best musical in 1999.  Do you remember working with Buddy Butler at all in Denver?
Speaker 2: I--we never worked together.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I know he was involved in some blues revues at one time, but nothing on this kind of scale I don't think.  So you've also choreographed stage acts for singers?
Speaker 2: A lot of those, I've done things for Rita Moreno, Aretha Franklin, Belafonte [HistoryMaker Harry Belafonte].  A lot of very different kind of performers.
Story_ID: 646705
Speaker 1: In 2001 though, this is a tremendous--I don't know how much dancing is in this, but the--this monumental ten hour production of 'Tantalus' [Peter Hall]?
Speaker 2: 'Tantalus' was--'Tantalus' was a tremendous show.  It was based on the Greek tragedy and it was a ten hour show.  So you could see it on one day by kind of like just staying there or you could come in two days to see it.  But it was--it was basically a Greek tragedy.  It was quite something, I don't think I've ever done anything like that before.
Speaker 1: I can't remember ever attending a show that lasted longer than five--than three hours actually.
Speaker 2: It was ten hours.
Speaker 1: Ten hours.  Well what were the audiences like for instance?
Speaker 2: They would go to have some of the meals and come back.
Speaker 1: So they would stay there for five hours and go and come back for the rest of this?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's a long time to sit for a show.  Was there a lot of dancing in the show or was this significant?
Speaker 2: No.  It was mostly drama.
Speaker 1: So it didn't take a huge block of your time to be a part of I guess?
Speaker 2: Well, yes it did, but not, not because there wasn't any dancing, because there were a lot of other things that I had to do.
Speaker 1: So this is produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company in collaboration with the Denver Center Theatre Company?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so this is produced in Denver [Colorado]?
Speaker 2: In Denver.
Speaker 1: Is this the longest play ever produced in the United States as far as you know?
Speaker 2: It's pretty long, I think so, (laughter) I don't know for sure.
Story_ID: 646706
Speaker 1: Now in 2002, you published your autobiography 'Transcending Boundaries: My Dancing Life' [Donald McKayle].  Now this is--how long did it take you to write your autobiography?
Speaker 2: Two years.  I worked on it from six to eight every morning because I know nobody would call me then.  And I had a publisher and the publisher said, "Don't make it too long or else students won't be able to buy it."  So I stopped, but there's still a lot more to say.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So are you gonna get back to it at some point, and write a second part?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Now there's a story--one of the stories that catches reviewers is a story about Bill Robinson [Bill "Bojangles" Robinson].  You might've told it earlier when we started, but can you tell us again?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I, I, I loved Bill Robinson in the movies and I would hang--he was living at the Dunbar Apartments [New York, New York] just close to us and I'd go there and wait for him with my friend.  And if we'd catch him coming home we pretty much--we said, said, "Bill dance a couple steps for us." And he would do it.  He'd tip his hat and he'd go upstairs.
Speaker 1: That's something, I mean to have that kind of access to a great star like that.
Speaker 2: He was wonderful.
Speaker 1: For him to just dance on demand.
Speaker 2: Well there were only around three steps there.  So he didn't have to go up a whole lot of stairs.  But he was wonderful.
Speaker 1: So what was the public reception to your book, I mean did the?
Speaker 2: My book did very well.  It won a--it won an award.  So I think I should go on with the second part of it.
Speaker 1: You know it was honored by the Society of Dance History Scholars?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have any help writing the book?
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: None, okay.
Speaker 2: All my--all my own work.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's unique these days that you didn't have any help at all.
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: That's something.  So did you, were you inspired by other autobiographies in terms of your style, or?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 646707
Speaker 1: Two thousand four [2004], there's a television doct- documentary created about your life and work called Heart- 'Heartbeats of a DanceMaker' ['Donald McKayle: Heartbeats of a DanceMaker'].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And this, this aired on public television stations throughout the United States?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Well, that I used the Limon Company [Limon Dance Company] for that.  And it was an extremely successful documentary.  And I don't know when I've ever seen one like that before.
Speaker 1: Now the documentary was narrated by Della Reese [HistoryMaker Della Reese-Lett], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She--narration came after the thing was done.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte did some narration too, right?
Speaker 2: He was in it, yeah.
Speaker 1: And now it's available as a DVD?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now you received lots of honors from Juilliard [The Juilliard School, New York, New York], from the Cal Institute for the Arts [sic. California Institute of the Arts, Valencia, California].  Is, is there any particular honor that you are the most pleased with?
Speaker 2: I'm just happy I've got so many.
Story_ID: 646708
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, and all, you know, through even through all the awards, is there anything you would do differently if you could go back and change something?
Speaker 2: You can't.  So I don't think that way.  I think of the future.
Speaker 1: Was there ever a time that you--there was some problem that you couldn't solve in choreography that you just felt, I don't wanna do this (laughter) or I wanna give up?
Speaker 2: No, I was always very determined about my work.
Speaker 1: What's the most difficult aspect of working in theater? Is it the actual artistic work or the people or does it ma- is it not a problem at all?
Speaker 2: Mostly, you have trouble with people.
Speaker 1: You think you have a good personality for dealing with people with issues and things?
Speaker 2: I think so, otherwise I wouldn't be doing it so long (laughter).
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you--one of the aspects, of I guess interpersonal relationship that you have to remember in dealing with artistic people?
Speaker 2: I think (pause) I've got it so much, so much, so much, so much, and I have had a good reputation amongst show people.  I don't know how to answer that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you just approach, you know, people as they come to you?
Speaker 2: Well, I try not to come to them with an, with an approach; I let them to bring things to me.
Story_ID: 646709
Speaker 1: Of all your works, do you have a favorite?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. (Pause) I think I like 'Rainbow Round My Shoulders' [Donald McKayle] best.
Speaker 1: Okay. And, and how would you, how would you I guess summarize or--your choreography, what is it like as opposed to--what it is like?  What was your choreography like?
Speaker 2: Well, it always dealt with human beings rather than fantasy.  And I think I'm at a point where my choreography is changing, so you should come back and see me in a year.
Story_ID: 646710
Speaker 1: So what are you working on today?  I mean (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I--I'm going to be doing a new dance and I'm looking for music, thoughts and ideas, you know.  I build it up from a base.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you don't envision a time where you'll have--do you envision a time when you'll stop doing choreography?
Speaker 2: I don't envision a time, but I'm sure I'll stop (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now what is it about choreography that, you know, motivates you?
Speaker 2: I love working with people.  And you get very intimate and personal when you work with choreography, that's talent.  So, I love it.
Speaker 1: Now do you have a favorite dancer?  Or who are some of your favorites, there's probably more than one?
Speaker 2: There are a lot of people I love their dancing.  And some of them I never worked with.  If so, that might be something that would happen, I would work with someone--one, one of those people.  Who knows.
Speaker 1: Is there anyone you would particularly wanna work with that's out here today that's?
Speaker 2: Well, I love to--I worked with--I'd like to rework with some of the people I've worked with.  Work with them again, now at a different stage in my career and a stage of their career.  I'd like to work with Hinton Battle again.
Speaker 1: Have you ever worked with--have you worked with Debbie Allen recently or?
Speaker 2: I've not worked--actually worked with her, I've worked on projects with her.  But not worked with her as a performer.
Speaker 1: Are there any, I guess could you--do you have like--I don't like to ask these kind of questions, who would you rank as the top five African American dancers in our history that you know of?
Speaker 2: That's a very hard question to answer.  Because some of them come in all different genres, like apples and oranges.
Speaker 1: When you look back on your whole body of work, what today would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: You've went over my personal legacy in this interview (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And these works do, do stand up, so.
Speaker 2: Yes, and they're being done all over the world.
Story_ID: 646711
Speaker 1: Well tell us about your family.  You, you have two biological children [Gabrielle McKayle and Liane McKayle], you're married now, you've got another child?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And my wife's child [Guy McKayle], which I sort of brought up since he was five has children that have children.  So that's nice.
Speaker 1: So you got grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did your--how did your parents [Eva Cohen McKayle and Philip McKayle, Sr.]--they were around to see the beginnings of your dance career, I know that?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  I remember my mother saying, "Dancing is a short life Donald [HistoryMaker Donald McKayle]. What are you gonna do when it's over" (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Well that speaks to the career possibilities in dance, right?
Speaker 2: Well I--
Speaker 1: I think very few people see--think that a dancer can have a--
Speaker 2: You have to be, you know, young and lively.  And I have liked all aspects of dance, so there isn't anything that has happened or will happen I won't love to be part of.
Story_ID: 646712
Speaker 1: What do you think about the dance forms of today?  I mean there are new, there are some new dance forms being produced in the streets, you know, here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and other urban areas, and?
Speaker 2: I think all the urban dances that are being done are important and they'll be a part of our legacy.
Speaker 1: Do you have any comments about break dancing or flexing and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Could you imagine using any of those forms in your dances?
Speaker 2: Sure.  If it fit.
Story_ID: 646713
Speaker 1: Now is there, is there anything that I haven't asked about that we ought to mention or talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I can't think of what that would be, so give me your last question.
Speaker 1: Yes sir.  The last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I want to be remembered as a choreographer.  And that's what I really spent my life doing.  And hopefully as a good father, good husband.
Speaker 1: Okay, sounds good to me.  Thank you very much for spending time with us.
Speaker 2: You're welcome, thank you.
