Speaker 1: All right.  My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm the interviewer today with The History Makers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, can you please give us your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: James Irvin Gadsden, J-A-M-E-S, I-R-V-I-N, G-A-D-S-D-E-N.
Speaker 1: And sir is there a story behind your name?
Speaker 2: If there is I don't know it.  The only story I like to tell is that I am from Charleston, South Carolina.  There was a James Gadsden who in 1853 was sent to negotiate the Gadsden Purchase, and if I find out that there is a connection, I think I'll go and collect me some territory.  But I don't know that there is a story behind my name per se.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your date of birth and place, well you said it was Charleston, South Carolina, we know the place of birth but what, what is your date of birth?
Speaker 2: March 12, 1948.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: Currently, my title and occupation are Senior Counselor for International Affairs at the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation in Princeton, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is March 11, 2013.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in Princeton, New Jersey--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at the DoubleTree Hotel.
Story_ID: 117271
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five light weight, kind of 'People' magazine-ish type questions we ask as a warm up, and they only require a short answer.  First one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Many (laughter).  I prefer many, many, many ethnic foods, starting with Charleston's ethnic food or regional food for that matter.  I also love Asian cuisine, and I love Latin American cuisine, Indian cuisine, and European cuisine, partial to fish and seafood.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Usually autumn colors, warm, rust, greens, browns, the colors of changing leaves, the colors of changing grass.  Very, very warm and inviting colors are my favorites.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: It's fall.
Speaker 1: I would guess that (laughter).
Speaker 2: Precisely because of the colors, the cool crisp air, it's very refreshing, and the whole nation, the whole notion of change is one that I find very, very refreshing, change and renewal.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Having traveled so much, believe it or not, at this point, my favorite vacation destination is around the U.S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: "We can do that".
Story_ID: 117272
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, and we'll start with your mother's side and then we'll put them together.
Speaker 2: (Nodding)
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's fall name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Hazel Gaines Gadsden, H-A-Z-E-L, G-A-I-N-E-S, G-A-D-S-D-E-N.
Speaker 1: And what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: September 26, 1923, Charleston, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family in terms of how far back you can trace them, and what were the stories that have passed down on that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Not a lot because nothing was written down, and I unfortunately did not take the time to try to do oral interviews before the, the older relatives passed on.  But I can at least remember my mother's, mother, my grandmother, Elizabeth Gaines, who was very important in my life from the earliest I can remember until she died in 1958.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you know what her date of birth and place of birth is?
Speaker 2: I don't.  I'd have to look that up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your mother was born in '23 [1923], will you suppose that your grandmother was born around the turn of the century or something--
Speaker 2: A little before.
Speaker 1: A little before?
Speaker 2: If I have to guess, I'm--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --I'm trying to remember now from death certificates and I think it's around 1890-something.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's good, circa 1890.  And was, was she from Charleston (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Not Charleston the city per se but outside of Charleston, the Summerville [South Carolina] area.  We had a lot of relatives who lived there that I can remember visiting when I was a young child.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay.  So did, did you learn much about your family history from your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Not really.  The closest relatives we had were cousins who, on my mother's side, who lived in Charleston and whom we visited from time to time for dinner, to spend an afternoon with them.  They were elderly and the eldest that I can remember was very old at the time that, and I'm thinking now between the ages of, the earliest that I can remember until about ten or twelve years old.  And the only thing I remember about her is that she was very, very light and had long, long hair, and, and had European Caucasian features.  A very, very sweet lady.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: But I don't know her history.
Speaker 1: So she was very, very light and, and now was she, I don't know how you say like a second or third cousin, you said she's a, she's a older lady; right?
Speaker 2: She was my grandmother's first cousin.
Speaker 1: Your grandmother's first cousin, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, yeah, she'd be, I guess a, what they call that a third cousin [sic, first cousin twice removed]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was there a, a story behind how she was that color or what?
Speaker 2: Don't know it.  I'm sure there's a story but I was too young for them to have shared it with me and she died when I was around ten.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --I don't know it.
Story_ID: 117273
Speaker 1: Okay.  And well, well tell us about your grandmother [Elizabeth Gaines].  Now did she, what did she do for a living then?
Speaker 2: Well, at the time that I was aware of her existence, she was not working.  She was at home.  My, my, my mother [Hazel Gaines Gadsden] was working at the time.  And my father [James David Gadsden] was working in a separate city.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she wasn't--
Speaker 2: My grandmother was not working at that time.
Speaker 1: So did she spend, so, why, I suppose she spent a lot of time with you as a little boy--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --when you, you were small?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She was the first person to take me to kindergarten.  And, and, of course, to take care of me during the day when, when I returned home from elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you know if your, your grandmother had a chance to go to school and or, or college?
Speaker 2: I think she may have made it to about the third grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She could read, haltingly.
Speaker 1: So what do you remember about her in terms of, you say she's a special person to you?
Speaker 2: Well I remember that she was small.  I remember that she had beautiful long, wavy hair that I used to braid.  My, my mother taught me how to braid her hair and so I used to do that.  And she had two long braids coming down the back which she would sometimes wrap around, wrap, wrap them around one another.  I do remember that she loved going to church, that she loved listening to religious ceremonies at the end of the afternoon.  Her favorite hymn was 'I Come to the Garden of Prayer.'  And I hadn't thought about that in a long time but I can remember it now.  And she loved listening to the afternoon broadcast on the radio of Mahalia Jackson's hymns, or the hymns that she sang.  She was also a very gentle person, very wise, and took on the role of counseling me and giving me sort of words of wisdom now and then.  And, of course, while my mom was working, she took me to school activities and, and was just very, very warm person.  I remember sitting on her lap and being rocked to sleep in the afternoon when I took a nap when I was very small, that is, yeah.  Just very positive and warm memories.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And she died in '58 [1958]?
Speaker 2: 1958.
Speaker 1: So you were, you were about ten years old, I guess--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --when your mother passed, your grandmother passed?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So but she didn't tell, tell you any stories about the family history or anything really that you remember?  (Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: No, and again I was, you know, one to ten years old--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --or zero to ten years old.  So even if she did, they wouldn't have stuck.
Story_ID: 117274
Speaker 1: Now, did you know anything about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: No.  I only knew that his last name was Gaines but I don't know where he was from.  He was, he had been dead, you know, years before I came along.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And I, I haven't looked up his funeral records, I do have my grandmother's funeral records, but I haven't looked up his.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you don't know what he did for a living or anything?
Speaker 2: No idea, none.
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Hazel Gaines Gadsden] say about growing up?  Did, did she talk about what it was like to grow up in, did, did, did she grow up in Charleston [South Carolina] or no?
Speaker 2: She grew up in Charleston.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother didn't really say a lot about what it was like to grow up in Charleston.  She did talk about, a bit about her adult years.  And she left high school in ninth grade to take care of my grandmother who had become ill, and so she started working at that point, working as a maid.  And in, as a domestic in the homes of fairly well-to-do whites who lived in Charleston.  And she didn't have a lot to say about that.  When she left that work and went to work under the title of maid in a dress shop in downtown Charleston, she did have a few things to say about that.  They were more observations than points of anger, if you will.  And she always talked about how limited her bosses were, and how even though she was working as a maid, she did the accounting for the store, she did the inventories.  And a lot of the sort of managerial responsibilities because her bosses couldn't count.  They, they didn't have enough basic education to be able to do that.  And she also did the cleaning, you know, the, the polishing of the windows and the sweeping and mopping of the floors and so forth and so on.  So I think there was a little resentment there, not anger, because she felt she was far more capable of doing the things that her bosses were supposed to do that they were not capable of doing, so she was kind of carrying the whole show.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: She made a number of observations along those lines but again never in anger, it was though she kind of understood what the social regime was--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --in Charleston at the time, and that she had no power to change it, even though she knew it was unfair and that she was capable of far more.
Speaker 1: Now did, in terms of her capabilities and talents did she have an aspiration or did she have, did she entertain an aspiration at one time to do something else other than be a maid that she shared with you?
Speaker 2: If she did, she didn't share that with me.  I know she wanted to finish high school but she couldn't.  And she, she mentioned that a number of times, and stressed to me the importance of finishing high school, and did all she could to make sure that I had the advantages.  You know, she spent a lot of time reading to me, going over news articles with me, talking with me about various things, making sure that I was enrolled in Sunday school classes or, you know, we had a lot of, certainly bible lessons but in a way those were educational experiences as well because you were required to read the lessons and then answer questions and talk about them during the, the classes.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: So, her aspiration, I think she transposed from herself to me.
Story_ID: 117275
Speaker 1: Now, let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: James David Gadsden, J-A-M-E-S, D-A-V-I-D, G-A-D-S-D-E-N.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: December 23, 1923, Charleston, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Same question.  How, how far back can you go on your father's side, and what are the stories about your father's people?
Speaker 2: Again, not very much.  I know he grew up on the east side of Charleston which was considered the bad neighborhood, may still be considered the bad neighborhood except for the gentrification efforts underway.  My mother [Hazel Gaines Gadsden] grew up on the west side.  He grew up in, in fact, the projects, if you will.  I remember, like my mother, he loved school but couldn't finish.  He too had to stop and work and he, he worked as a delivery boy for a drug store.  And it was in that setting that he met my mother when he was delivering drug store products to one of the families in the downtown area where she worked.  He then went off to the [U.S.] Army and I can't remember when he went to Army.
Speaker 1: Was it during the World War II period?
Speaker 2: It was, yes it was during World War II.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And was sent off to Europe, France in particular.  And during the war, the story goes, and I don't know that it's, it's absolutely accurate, and by the way he, he had two brothers and a sister.  The two brothers as far back as I know, lived, moved away and lived in New York.  And the sister stayed in Charleston with his mother [Charlotte Morgan], and he was off in the war, and as the story goes from his side, sent money back home to be put away so that he could get started in some fashion once he got back and so on.  And at some point along the line after he got back he discovered that the money had disappeared, had just gone away.  No telling where or how or by whom taken, you know, but it just wasn't there.
Speaker 1: Now, to whom did he send it?
Speaker 2: He sent it back to his sister who was taking care of his mother at the time.  And somehow or other the money just disappeared, and it's not clear whether it was the sister's fault or I don't, we don't know, yeah.  So he tried getting work, and by the way when he was in the Army he was trained as an electrician.  And when he came back he tried to get work as an electrician but at that point you had to be a member of an electricians' union in order to be licensed to work, and blacks were not accepted into the electricians' unions at the time.  So not being able to find work he decided to go to New York [New York], and there he got a job as a, a cook in the Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center (HHC)] and worked at that for quite some time, and then returned to Charleston in 1958, 1957, I believe it was, yeah.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And there, took up a job as a, as a janitor which he kept until he retired in the 1980s.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, okay.  And where did he work as a janitor, do you know?
Speaker 2: University of South Carolina Medical College dormitory [University of South Carolina School of Medicine, Columbia, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 117276
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  Now well, are there any stories, do you know anything about your, your grandparents on your father's [James David Gadsden's] side?
Speaker 2: Only, only memories of being around my grandmother, Charlotte [Morgan], a very elegant lady, a very quiet, soft-spoken.  She too was quite old when I was a, a child.  And I believe she died in 1956 but to this day I can remember her voice, I can remember her stature.  I don't know anything about her, I don't know whether she worked at some point or another, I don't think she, she went very far in school.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: And was your grandfather around at all?
Speaker 2: Not on that side, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Don't know anything about him, don't even know his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So once again, there are no stories passed down about (unclear) Charleston, South Carolina is a historic city, lots of history in that place.  A lot of activities went on, and I'm sure all of your ancestors had something to do with it but did they tell you, did anybody pass any stories down?
Speaker 2: Nope.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Nope.  I'm the eldest of my siblings and most of the old folks had passed on before I was old enough to understand the importance of this and to try to do something about it and try to get some oral histories from them.  And, and, of course, they didn't write anything down.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, it's such a, I've never been to Charleston, it is, it's strange we've never been there as a, as a organization--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --to interview anyone but it's such a rich--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --place.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And, in a lot of good ways and in a lot of bad ways--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --you know, so.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: You just--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: So, so nobody ever, okay.
Speaker 2: Don't know very much about my family.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the sad thing is, I'm now being told by my siblings and others roughly my age that I'm the patriarch and whatever I remember is it, because now everybody else is much younger (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's, that's something.  Well, there may be some surprising things if you ever do some genealogy 'cause there's just so much--(Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: There might be.
Speaker 1: --history there and--
Speaker 2: There might be, yeah.
Story_ID: 117277
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now is there a story about how your parents, well I'm, I say I didn't ask you if you, your, your father [James David Gadsden] went to, did he finish high school?  Was he able to finish high school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Probably left around ninth or tenth grade as well.
Speaker 1: So he was working doing drugstore deliveries--
Speaker 2: (Nodding)
Speaker 1: --until the start of the war--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and then went to the war.  Did he have any stories about the, the war?  Say things going on over there?
Speaker 2: Very few that he would share because of the horrors of what he saw.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: One thing that he made a very, very, very strong point of, is how surprising it was to him that people in France, the French, treated him far more as an equal and far better than his own countrymen.  He developed quite a fondness for France and for the French.  And, and he got, he got down to the Marseille area as well, and always talked about how much he liked what he called the French Moroccans, that, that kind of blending of French culture and North African culture that he saw there, he, he really admired that.  And he talked so much about that, that I actually was inspired to start studying French from the stories that he had to tell.  And in fact, that's, that's what motivated me to start studying it when I was in ninth grade (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  Okay.  Any other stories or about the war?  Did, did he talk about the segregated [U.S.] Army or about, you said he, he wouldn't have or what you, and for there now to be horrors do you, he told--
Speaker 2: Oh, just, just battle, not, not racial kinds of antagonisms but just, you know, people dying you know, bayonet wounds, you know, you, you can imagine some of the gory side of, of that.
Speaker 1: Do you know what kind of unit he was in, whether he was in the Quartermaster Corps or--
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: --Motor Corps or--
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One of the things I, I, hope to do at some point or other is to, is to go to the Defense Department [U.S. Department of Defense] and see if I can track down through his dog tag which I remember, I've never forgotten that number, what it is that he actually did and where he was and when he was there and so on, I just haven't had time to do that yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Again, you know, he was delivering drugs--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: I shouldn't put it that way, he was delivering pharmaceuticals (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to one of the families where she [Hazel Gaines Gadsden] was working and--
Speaker 1: Legitimate pharmaceuticals.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).  And, and they struck up a conversation and I assume a friendship developed from that and, and, and I don't know all of the, all the stages at which their relationship developed but I think that was, that was basically it.
Speaker 1: Now, in what point in his chronology did they meet?  Before the war or--
Speaker 2: I would assume this was before the war.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And they were married before, before--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But they met rather in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, are you the, the oldest in the family?
Speaker 2: I am, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were born in '48 [1948] so--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --that's after the war.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: But they met before the war started--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so maybe 1941--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or so.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then he's away for--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --four years and then coming back--(Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: And then he was gone for a while.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --and then in New York [New York].  And then my next younger brother was born in 1961--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --and my sister in '62 [1962], my brother in '64 [1964], and the youngest brother in '66 [1966].
Story_ID: 117278
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their sense of humor, how they walked, how they talked, how they interacted with people--
Speaker 2: (Nodding)
Speaker 1: --and what they thought, who, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: A blend.  I think a real blend.  My mother [Hazel Gaines Gadsden] was extremely patient, very patient, an excellent listener.  A deliberate speaker, very few words wasted but usually a point made.  She didn't have a lot of tolerance for things that she considered to be silly but she was never impolite about it.  And she was somewhat reserved.  My father [James David Gadsden] was a very loving, I mean family was high priority for him, almost to the point where he had very few friends.  I mean his idea of what to do after work and on the weekend was to come home and spend time with the family (unclear).  He was studious but a lot of his effort was placed in studying the bible, not so much in, in academic studies.  And he read a lot of religious materials but he didn't try to push religion down anybody's throat.  He loved a good discussion, you know, a good debate.  He had a great sense of humor, wonderful sense of humor, always kidding my mother and not to mention the, the kids.  And after I got married my wife and, and our kids.  Just a wonderful smile, always warm and welcoming and, and so on.  And probably a lot more outgoing than, than my mother was.  And I can recall at the time that, I assume, I assume we'll talk about this later, at the time that I got the opportunity to go away to school, my mother was truly worried.  My father on the other hand, had had the experience overseas, knew how valuable it was to be exposed to other places, other people, and other cultures, and so he was a lot less worried than my mother although he had a lot of questions (laughter).
Story_ID: 113882
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory is of going to church and standing up during hymn and not being able to see over the pew in front of me.  And when I became a little restless being able to get a charm candy from my mom [Hazel Gaines Gadsden].
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: I remember a cousin, in fact, the daughter of the lady who is very light that I told you about, having what I would call a Model T Ford, it may not have been a Model T Ford, but it was one of these old things that, excuse me, had on open carriage and a long stick shift that attached to the floor.  And, and the other thing I remember is the first day that my grandmother [Elizabeth Gaines] took me to kindergarten, and holding on to the fence not wanting to go into the yard of the kindergarten because I did not want to leave her.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And, of course, at age four or five I had no understanding whatsoever that this was the beginning of a very long path.  I just did not want to leave my grandmother.  Those are my earliest memories.
Story_ID: 113883
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So can, can you describe the, the neighborhood did, now did you live in west Charleston [South Carolina] or in east Charleston?
Speaker 2: On the west side.
Speaker 1: West side, okay.
Speaker 2: However, that didn't mean a whole lot (laughter).  You wanted to know the circumstances?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, and the, what the neighborhood was like, what the circumstances were.  Now this is a black community we know it was segregated.
Speaker 2: Actually, it was an integrated community.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes it was, yeah.
Speaker 1: Explain, please.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, in Charleston, Charleston's a different kind of place.  You know, it, it had a rough history.  Particularly after the Denmark Vesey Rebellion, where that rebellion was put down fairly brutally, and where the Citadel [The Military College of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina] was created specifically to put down any slave uprising that might develop afterwards.
Speaker 1: Now, wait a minute this is important business you're talking about here.  Now, now the Denmark Vesey Rebellion this is 1822.  This is a slave revolt that he had plotted but it never really happened 'cause somebody told on him.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's exactly right.
Speaker 1: It was really highly organized amongst the black middle class--
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: --the, you, you can explain, you go on and explain.
Speaker 2: No, no, you've, you've give it the high points.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was, it was turned in by a black household servant, and it was put down very brutally.  And the Citadel was created to make sure that no other slave rebellion would get very far.  That said, Charleston, you know, before that had, had a number of blacks who were craftsmen and who were involved in the trades including Denmark Vesey, I think he was a printer [sic, carpenter] if I remember well.  And he didn't live in the black neighborhood, he lived on Bull Street which is kind of in the middle of a very exclusive area of town, and I'm told that there were other blacks who were involved in commerce who actually lived down by East Bay and so on.
Speaker 1: Yeah, just to embellish this a little bit, Vesey won the lottery.
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: And with that lottery ticket he bought his freedom--
Speaker 2: He bought his freedom.
Speaker 1: --and he had this excess money to buy a house and to fund his slavery revolt--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --you know, too.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right. And he was also a fairly self-educated man.  He spoke French because he had traveled on a slave traders ship, it may have been trading other things as well.  He had been to Africa.  I believe he knew a little Arabic.  He knew the history of Haiti and that rebellion.  So he was, he was, you know, quite a knowledgeable person, plus he had a skill that could earn some money.

Speaker 1: But anyway my, my point was that Charleston [South Carolina] had been a fairly mixed society all along and there was kind of a balance there even knew what the rules were.  Well, after that rebellion was put down, Charleston remained kind of mixed, there were whites living in neighborhoods where blacks were living.  That was true of the area where we lived, 125 Smith Street in Charleston.  Across the street from our house was a very large, by Charleston standards we're not talking skyscrapers, apartment building where whites lived.  And all along the, the street that that apartment building was on, which was perpendicular to Smith Street, there were whites living in with quite diverse socioeconomic spectrum there, including a very sizable mansion on the corner of Vanderhorst and Thomas Streets.  So, but the area, the place where we lived at 125 Smith Street, was really a kind of a complex.  We lived in the front house that had the narrow side on Smith Street.  And there was a yard too, if you were facing it, to the left of our house, that went back, oh, I would say maybe five hundred feet, maybe a little more than that, five hundred yards maybe.  And off to the right side next to our house, was another house in a different kind of formation, it, it sort of, it had a, an apartment on the right side and then a little porch area, and then a little deeper into the yard an apartment on the left side.  And there were a couple of others like that.  And then there were some smaller places going back into the yard that, that were kind of one or two bedroom places.  Now, at the end of our house as you went back in that yard, was a hydrant.  And that's where we got our water in pails that we kept in the house.  And if you went all the way back in the yard and to the right, there was a tool shed and then behind that there was an outhouse.  And so there were no indoor facilities in, in our two bedroom house which had an upstairs apartment that was also a two bedroom house.  So you had to get your water in a pail and bring it in and use a face basin.  And then, of course, you had your, your waste jar which you kept under the bed and then when that was, when that was full you had to take it back, to the back of the yard and dump it and clean it and so forth and so on.  And there were lots of holes in the walls that you'd patch the best way you could, sometimes with wood, sometimes with newspaper, sometimes with tape.  There were holes in the floor, and there were, the plaster was crumbling.  And from time to time we had floods, Charleston's famous for floods.  And the floods would sometimes come into the house, and so we had to throw out a lot of things, get rid of a lot of moldy materials and, and do a lot of scrubbing with Clorox and so on.  And because there was no central heating, we used oil stoves.  And you'd go to the corner store, get a five gallon can of oil, and then fill up the tank on the back of the stove in the living room, fill up the tank in back of the stove in the bedroom, and fill up the tank in your kitchen stove, you know.  And, of course, there was no sink or running water in the kitchen, you had to heat the water on the stove and use a, use it for a big cleaning basin and, and so on.  And, of course, there was no air conditioning so in the summer time, you had to use fans after we got electricity.  I think I was in about oh, well, it was 1953, roughly '52 [1952], '53 [1953], that we got electricity in the house, before that we used kerosene lanterns at night.
Story_ID: 113885
Speaker 1: Now, from time to time--(Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: This is in the city, in the city of Charleston [South Carolina]?
Speaker 1: In the city of Charleston.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Which is why I say, you know, on the west, you know, on the west side it didn't really make a lot of difference (laughter).  From time to time, the oil stoves would fail, and you'd have a fire.  And, of course, the primary effort was to get people out and then to take care of the fire.  So those were the circumstances under which we, we lived.  And we lived in that house until my mother's mother died in 1958, and then we moved to another in the middle of town that, in fact, was a three or four bedroom apartment with running water, with facilities, and that was structurally a lot, a lot more sound and in a, a neighborhood that was primarily black but there were whites living there as well and had businesses there and, and so on.  And people were respectful and, you know, they exchanged the, the greetings of the day.  And there was a shopkeeper one block away who told my parents that when my little brothers and sisters were going to school, tell them to wait on the corner until he sees them, he would come across the street, get them across the traffic and then send them on their way.  And that when they were coming home, they should come to the store, he will see them and go, so, you know, I mean people got along very well and everyone sort of knew what the limits were and, and so the, the race problems there didn't really get as violent as they were in some other places.  There were the occasional cross burnings but I don't remember in my time living there lynchings and, you know, beatings and that kind of thing, even during the height of the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: There may have been some isolated incidents but--(Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wonder about (unclear) ancient history of Charleston with as a urban center with black people and white people in it.  I, I think it sort of accounts for the proximity in the neighborhoods in some way.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Blacks were servants at first--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --to white people.  So they were in the neighborhoods--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in one of the oldest urban centers in the South, this is a--
Speaker 1: Richmond [Virginia].
Speaker 2: If not the oldest--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --urban centers.
Speaker 1: And, and it gets complicated.  I remember when I was in France people were sort of saying, oh, you're from Charleston, you must have been so oppressed racially.  Well, no.  I mean whites and blacks didn't associate very much socially.  And to this day, I think only once in my life have I had dinner with a, a white person in Charleston (laughter).  But, you know, it didn't really seem to matter very much because the black community was so strong and so supportive that we never felt we were missing anything very much.  And, of course, you know, during demonstrations we protested for equal opportunities but very frankly, I wouldn't eat in Woolworth's.  I had much better food at home, at my parents' house, but it was the right to eat in Woolworth's that was the key thing.  Anyway, so the neighborhoods were mixed and people got along reasonably well.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I mean were, were black people expected to, you know, take low to white people most of the time or--
Speaker 1: To--
Speaker 2: Take low, I mean it's, you know, kind of--
Speaker 1: Move out of the way?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: And not speak your mind and all that sort of thing or--
Speaker 1: I think, I think if there were that it was probably self-imposed.  But unlike in, in some places where, you know, blacks would move aside on the sidewalk for whites to come through no, I think, you know, people kind of would politely move out of the way and, you know, but there was no kind of kowtowing, if you will.
Story_ID: 113886
Speaker 1: Say, say in a city like Birmingham [Alabama] where you had like white waiting rooms and black waiting rooms.
Speaker 2: We had that.
Speaker 1: You had that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And certainly on the buses at the time, white water fountains, black or colored water fountains and bathrooms and so forth and so on, until the height of the Civil Rights Movement when a lot of that just kind of went away, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you were growing up did you basically see the, the, the was the moving take, the [Civil Rights] Movement taking place when you were a kid growing up?  I'm, I'm, I'm thinking that must have occurred when you were--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --maybe ten or (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Actually--
Speaker 1: --twelve years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right in the early '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --in particular.  One of my very, very dear friends in Charleston [South Carolina], [sociologist] Dr. Millicent Brown, who's now at Claflin [University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], her father, Joe Arthur Brown [Joseph Arthur Brown] was a state chairman of the NAACP, state chairman or state president, and a lot of civil rights activities were organized in the churches.  And I and a number of friends went to the meetings and took part in the demonstrations and, and so on.  I can't remember any instance of violence, at least when I was taking part in them.  And by the way my friend Millicent Brown filed the first suit to test the '54 [1954] decision ['Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka'] and won.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And was among the first blacks to integrate the schools in Charleston.  And if you wanna talk about that later, I'll tell you how that unfolded.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: I will, well, you know, well let's get to it maybe a little later and but, but this is interesting 'cause I've now, I really can't recall ever reading about the movement in Charleston.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm
Speaker 1: Now I've interviewed people from Orangeburg [South Carolina]--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and heard about what happened there but Charleston now it just seems a mystery--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --to me now.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Story_ID: 113887
Speaker 1: Now, well this, as a little kid and you all lived, I mean did, did, did you live in the same place the whole time you, you grew up in Charleston [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: No.  We lived on 125 Smith Street--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --until about 1958.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then we moved to 249 Coming Street, a little more uptown and a little more towards the east.  Which then put me right in the direct path to be a student at the C. A. Brown High School--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --on the east side.
Speaker 1: C. A. Brown High School.
Speaker 2: Charles A. Brown High School [Charleston, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now, what was the school that you started in, your first school, the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: The elementary school?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Simonton, S-I-M-O-N-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: Simonton Elementary School [Charleston, South Carolina].  And this is where you started kindergarten?
Speaker 2: No, kindergarten was at the Ried House of Christian Service.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Ried?
Speaker 2: R-I-E-D.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Of Christian Service.  Now was that associated with your church?
Speaker 2: No.  I'm not sure what denomination it was affiliated with.  But my church, a Baptist church, set up right after the emancipation [1965], was just around the corner, you know, literally about a block and a half away from the Ried Center.
Speaker 1: But what, what, what was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Morris Street Baptist Church [Charleston, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Marsh?
Speaker 2: Morris, M-O-R-R-I-S.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Morris Street Baptist Church, okay.  So it had, it dated back to the--
Speaker 2: The 1860s.
Speaker 1: 1860s, okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: All right.  And then so Simonton Elementary School you, you were there from first grade through the--
Speaker 2: Well, first through third.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: And then the school was closed for renovations and so all the students went then to Beuist [Elementary School, Charleston, South Carolina], B-E-U-I-S-T, more towards the east for one year.  And then after that year I went to Courtney Elementary School, C-O-U-R-T-N-E-Y, on Meeting Street in Charleston.  And from Courtney, came back to Simonton which was then a junior high school.
Speaker 1: So how long were you, okay.  All right.  So that (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, Beuist for fourth--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --well, Simonton first to third, Beuist for fourth, Courtney for fifth and sixth and seventh.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: And then Simonton for eighth and then Charles A. Brown for ninth and tenth.
Story_ID: 113888
Speaker 1: Now in elementary school, I take it you liked school?
Speaker 2: Loved school, still do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And well did you have a favorite subject?
Speaker 2: All of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what, what about teachers?  Did you have good teachers?
Speaker 2: (Unclear) excellent, outstanding teachers.  Can't remember one that I thought was bad.
Speaker 1: Were there any special ones that were really just, you had a special bond with or really looked after you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  In fact, there were a few.  Mrs. Barbara (ph.) Massey at, at Charles A. Brown [High School, Charleston, South Carolina], and she was the biology teacher.  Very, very smart lady, very smart.
Speaker 1: M-A-S-S--
Speaker 2: M-A-S-S-E-Y.
Speaker 1: E-Y.
Speaker 2: Massey.  She's still alive and still wonderful.  Mrs. Vera McKinnick (ph.), who was my math teacher.  And with her school was never over.  She lived around the corner from us when we lived on Coming Street.  And the end of the school year, she would give me some experimental math projects to work on.  And when I was done, I had to bring them to her house.  And that was fine because she always had ice cream and cake, you know.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And when I thought I was done with that project, she had another.  And that was my summer.  That's how my summers went.  There were two others.  My specialized physics teacher, whom I always viewed as genius material.  I thought she was just incredibly brilliant.  Very young, right out of South Carolina State [University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] and by the way we're still great friends.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: She visited me in Iceland.  And then my world--
Speaker 1: What was her, I'm sorry, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Joyce Houston (ph.).
Speaker 1: Joyce (ph.)--
Speaker 2: It's now Joyce Houston Moore (ph.).  We'll see some photos of her later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And who else now?
Speaker 2: And then my world history teacher, who just brought fire into the classroom.  And that was the person who literally got me interested in things beyond our borders.  And when I was sworn in, I made sure that he was there along with my physics teacher as my guests of honor.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: His name is James E. Clyburn [HM James Clyburn].
Speaker 1: James E. Clyburn.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now this is--
Speaker 2: And, of course, he is the former [U.S.] House [of Representatives] Majority Whip, in the first--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --administration of President Obama.  And is now the Deputy Minority Leader in the House.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  That's something.  Okay.  So he was then a, a history teacher?
Speaker 2: World history.
Speaker 1: World history.  All right.
Speaker 2: And he has not lost his passion to teach.  He's extremely good at it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So this is well, we, we kind of sped to high school, but I didn't, were, any teachers on the elementary level that you remember that were--
Speaker 2: I do remember my fourth grade teacher--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --very well, Mrs. Capers (ph.).  And I'm sure she passed on a long time ago.  She introduced the class to the 'Weekly Reader.'
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Which was a student newspaper.  I'm not sure who produced it [American Education Press] but that was the first time that I had actually gotten world news that we talked about in class.  And the story in the first issue was Sputnik.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Which really got my imagination.
Speaker 1: Yeah this was a, a, pulp, a tabloid style newspaper for kids.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was distributed all over the country.  I got it and they know how, well we're about the same age.
Speaker 2: The 'Weekly Reader.'
Speaker 1: Our 'Weekly Reader.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: When you would get it and you would see in the social studies class, you could read about what was going on--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the world.
Speaker 2: Fascinating.  The other thing she introduced, which you know makes her stick out in my mind, is the People to People Program.  Supposedly started by President Eisenhower but where you could have pen pals all over the world.  And I got a bunch of 'em, you know.  And we exchanged letters, of course, and birthday cards and, and I kept one pen pal until I was in graduate school, pen pal in Lyon, France.  And when I lived in France, I tried my best to find her, I'm still trying to find her and I can't.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: But I have books that she sent me and, you know, some other gifts and so on.  Very nice relationship.
Speaker 1: It sounds like you had wonderful teachers that--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Story_ID: 113889
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: So would, now in the home you said that your mother [Hazel Gaines Gadsden] would read--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to you from the newspapers.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now this is, so, so, she would read the, from the Charleston [South Carolina] paper that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was there?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And how many different kinds of publications did you get at home when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I only remember the paper.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: There may have been, oh, no, I take it back.  We also got, she got the yearly editions of 'Funk and Wagnalls Encyclopedia.'  And I remember the '53 [1953] and the '52 [1952] editions.  One of them, I think it might have been the '52 [1952] was a salmon-colored yearbook, and on the inside, on the front cover starting with the hard, the inside hard cover and going over on to the first soft page, there was a sepia picture of a little child on, sitting on a railroad track in Manchuria [China], with bombs going off in the background, and the, the camera was behind the child, and the child was looking as though he wanted to look back but looking to the side and crying.  And I remember being very disturbed by that picture that this child was in danger.  That was kind of my first, my first impressions looking at that picture.  So anyway, the, the yearbooks which we would flip through and, and kind of read some portions of.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: 'Funk and Wagnalls Encyclopedia Yearbook.'
Speaker 1: So you got it every year?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So it was kind of like a catch it, catch-up on the news from the international news for what was going on over the past year?
Speaker 2: I think she was thinking more of kind of a year in review.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, oh, yes, this happened.  Oh, yes I remember when that happened, that kind of thing, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you all have a television at that point?
Speaker 2: Not until about 1954 or '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: You didn't have electricity, that's right?  (Unclear)
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah.  And, and after we got electricity, we would listen to stories on the radio.  We would also, if you can believe this, watch the fights on the radio.  We'd all sit around and listen to Archie Moore and, you know, the reports of Archie Moore's fighting someone I don't know who.  But, you know, it was such a, a way of stimulating the imagination.  We couldn't afford a television but my, my mother's brother who was in the [U.S.] Navy, would come home from time to time and he was always amazed at how far behind we were on so many things, and so he just took us out and bought a television and brought it back and that kind of changed our lives in many ways, you know.  We could watch the evening news, we could see some of their favorite programs, 'Ozzie and Harriet' and 'The Lawrence Welk Show' and that kind of thing which, you know, weren't particularly interesting to me but, (laughter) but it was, it was a change, I mean it was a big change, yeah.
Story_ID: 115449
Speaker 1: Yeah, with regard to the Civil Rights Movement, just to give you an idea of the flavor of antagonism we might have faced, I remember one hot day, we were out demonstrating at a key intersection in Charleston [South Carolina], kind of the midpoint of Charleston, if you will.
Speaker 2: You said "we," just give us the, who was it and what year and, you know.
Speaker 1: Oh, this would have been roughly 1963.  And when I say "we," I'm talking about basically church leaders, younger people in the church, high school kids, and so on.  Mostly black--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --not necessarily completely black.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you were about fourteen--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --or, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But, you know, normally we would meet at a church and then march downtown to the point where we were going to demonstrate and then we'd demonstrate.  So when we were on the corner of King and Calhoun Street and just kind of marching in an orderly fashion around the four corners of the intersection and singing, you know, either 'We Shall Overcome' or some other hymn of the movement at that time.  And I can remember the police being assembled with their motorcycles and sweating and taking their helmets off and putting them back on and, and I can remember one policeman sort of saying, you know, "How long are you kids gonna be out here doing this?"  And we would sort of say "Oh, until we got our rights."  And so he said, "Well, please hurry it up; it's hot and we wanna go home," (laughter) you know.  But I have no memory of skulls being cracked and dogs being, you know, unleashed and water hoses being--in, in Charleston, now maybe that happened after I left and in 1964 but I don't remember hearing about it.
Speaker 2: Now were you in the NAACP Youth, was that the group that were demonstrating or--
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know that the group had an organizational name, and I certainly wasn't a member of a group.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: It's just that the state chair or state president of the NAACP, Joseph Arthur Brown, J. Arthur Brown, tended to preside over the meetings at different churches and I would go to those meetings and take part in, not all, but some of the demonstrations.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so usually the, in those days if it was the NAACP involved in any demonstrations, the NAACP Youth--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --usually, I don't know, why--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --whether they, they had sit-ins going on--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in the '50s--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --you know, before even the one in North Carolina--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --A. and T. [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] They were doing it at Wichita [Kansas] and other places.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, okay.  So, but it was J. Arthur Brown--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Who again--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: And whose daughter has written a lot about the movement and about him.  And again her name is Dr. Millicent Brown, and she's a professor at Claflin [University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].
Speaker 2: That's in Orangeburg, right?
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 115450
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, okay.  So, I take it in high school, you, you, go on to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], so I'm sure in high school you were burning up the (laughter) track.  So when you, you had to be what, what leadership roles did you have in high school and what, what were you doing, how, how were your grades?
Speaker 2: I brought along some materials for you but they in effect were the highest averages in the school.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: And I was editor-in-chief of the newspaper.  And we had a, a social club, and, of course, if you had a social club you had to have a faculty advisor--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --to be recognized as a legitimate club around the school.  And there were ten guys who really enjoyed one another's company and who enjoyed talking about things, politics, you know, civil rights, our aspirations, you know.  And, and we had a queen.  And, of course, everyone tried to find the loveliest lady on campus to be their queen, and we did (laughter).  Our advisor was Jim Clyburn [HM The Honorable James Clyburn].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The group's name was the Corsairs. And today we are still very close, those of us who are still alive.  But at the time, I was editor in chief of the paper and president of the Corsairs.  I, another young man was captain of the football team, by the way his name is Charles Foster, he was the first to integrate The Citadel [The Military College of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina].  And the movie the Lords--the book and the movie, 'The Lords of Discipline' are based on Charlie Foster's experience at The Citadel.  Another young man, [labor lawyer] Ralph Dawson, was head of the Latin Club.  And well, you see the pattern (laughter).
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And gonna jump a little bit ahead, to this day, Congressman Clyburn has the school yearbook picture, '64 [1964] school yearbook picture, of the Corsairs enlarged in his office, and it's near him most of the time, even when he goes on a trip, you know.  And he will tell people that my greatest achievement in life was not politics, it was these ten young men, who if the statistics were right, would never be where they are today.  They are my greatest achievement.
Speaker 1: So that was a great time for him as well as for you.
Speaker 2: Yep.  Yeah.  So in the two years' time, that's kind of what I did, at least in terms of leadership role, to top the honor roll, to carry the paper, and to be president of the Corsairs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: At, at that school [Charles A. Brown High School, Charleston, South Carolina] (laughter).
Story_ID: 115451
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you went to private school--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: For your senior year, right?
Speaker 2: Junior and senior year.
Speaker 1: Junior and senior year, okay.  So junior and senior year.  And now how is this, how did this come about?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it came about, I think there were two things driving it.  One, we had a principal, a very fiery gentleman who really liked to move kids forward, who felt that I needed to be in another setting.  Two, we had teachers, I had teachers, Mrs. Massey, Mrs. Simpson, the guidance counselor, Mrs. McKinnick (ph.), Ms. Houston, the physics teacher, who wanted to see me move on, they didn't feel that I was gonna be challenged enough and that I could do a lot more somewhere else.  And then there were some others who decided that they didn't like some of the things that I was saying and sometimes writing about, and that is that teachers should stop telling students that they're I-, their IQ is not high enough to do this or they'll never amount to anything or they'll never have any culture and refinement, you know, and so forth and so on.  And--
Speaker 1: So, so, was that an issue at the school?
Speaker 2: Not a major one.
Speaker 1: Is the school, okay.
Speaker 2: Not a major one.  But--
Speaker 1: So teachers would, would berate the students in that way?
Speaker 2: A few.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Not most--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A few.
Speaker 1: Some would.
Speaker 2: And, you know, one of the things I read about was how that kind of commentary spirals kids downward at a time when the teachers need to be opening doors that were not open for them so that the kids could move forward.  But the reason why they were doing this is because the white power structure had pretty much defined what their upper limit, of their upper limits could be, mainly to be doctors or teachers or lawyers or barbers or undertakers serving the black community.  That was our upper ceiling.  And the natural tendency is to want to move up, and with an upper ceiling the only way you can really feel that you're moving up, is if you push others down.  But the sad thing is, when you push the future generations down, we can see how that progression's gonna go.
Story_ID: 115452
Speaker 1: It's going in the wrong direction.  Well, there were some teachers who didn't like that, and one of them came up to me and said to me directly in my face, the chemistry teacher, "I'm gonna get you in my class and I'm gonna destroy your record.  I'm gonna destroy you."  I never took chemistry but I did take the new physics course.  And then another thing that drove it was I got into a, a slight disagreement with one of the teachers.  During a homeroom period, I went by to do some club business and I was respectfully asked the teacher in the class where my friend was, "May I speak with" so-and-so.  And the teacher said, "No, get out of my class."  Well, I didn't think there was any reason for that, I didn't do anything that should trigger that kind of a response, so I ignored him.  And I went and conducted my business and he was yelling and screaming, "You think you're this, you're think you're that."  And I ignored him.  And when I finished the business I was walking out of class, he grabbed me by the arms swung me around and said, "Don't you walk away from me when I'm talking to you, boy."  And I don't remember very clearly what happened except that friends pulled me away from him because I apparently had pushed him so hard that he went flying across a couple of rows of chairs and landed on the floor and I was walking towards him with a raised fist.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: And my friends decided that that was not a good idea.  So they took me out of the classroom and I went back to my homeroom and waited to be called by the principal.  He called me and I went down and he asked me what happened.  And I explained to him what happened.  And he said, "Okay, that accords with what the teacher told me."  And then he asked me, "Do you understand what's happening here?  So I said yes, they're upset about the article."  So he says, "Yes.  I think you oughta leave the school."  And I thought by that he meant that he was throwing me out.  And I asked him, "Are you throwing me out?"  And he laughed and he said "No, I really think you need to go to another school.  I don't think your interests are gonna be served well here.  And I don't think you should be held back because of people who don't really understand things very well."  I'm being very diplomatic in my terminology here.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so I said, "Well what do you have in mind?"  And so he said, "Well, I have some friends with the American Friends Service Committee [AFSC] in New York [New York] and I believe that I might be able to get them down here [Charleston, South Carolina] so that they can look at possibilities for you to finish your junior and senior years at a private school in New York living with a family up there."  So he called his friend down and they looked through my records, they talked to my teachers, not the ones who, you know, were fairly negatively disposed, and, and he met with me and he said that "I can offer you three possibilities in New York."  One would be New York Friends [Seminary] and he described that on the East Side 23rd Street [sic, 16th Street], I think, East 23rd.  And Brooklyn Friends [School (BFS), New York, New York], and he described that.  And the third was the Elisabeth Irwin High School in Greenwich Village.  It's a part of the, well the corporation is the Little Red Schoolhouse, Incorporated [LRSI, New York, New York] and Elisabeth Irwin is the, you know, the high school component of that.  And when he described that school that it was progressive, that teachers, you know, reached students at their level and took them forward.  And everybody calls everybody by the first name.  There are trips incorporated into the curriculum.  The French teachers are from France and Belgium, very, very, rigorous and successful French program.  That the school was largely artistic, you know, Mary Travers went there, of Peter, Paul, and Mary.  Leon Bibb, do you remember him?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: His children, the twins, were there.  [Singer-songwriter] Janis Ian's father was the music director.  Bobby Miller, [playwright] Arthur Miller's kid was there.  [Businessman] Jack Gifford's kid was there, you know, on and on and on and on.  And I said, "That's the one for me."  And so I went there.  And shortly before that, the guidance counselor had, had really gotten my interest piqued in doing a summer program in '64 [1964] at Yale University [New Haven, Connecticut].  So we went there and did intensive math and intensive English, a writing course.  And came back to Charleston after that, and in September of '64 [1964], went up to New York, lived with a family in Brooklyn-
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well, I don't wanna speed by--
Story_ID: 115453
Speaker 1: Well, I don't wanna speed by too fast.  This summer writing course, now this is in--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Now what, what, well this, this, let's go back and let's dwell on that a second.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, okay.
Speaker 1: So you go away from the summer?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Of your, I guess, this is after your sophomore year of high school?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you go to--
Speaker 2: Yale.
Speaker 1: Where, where did you go?
Speaker 2: Yale University [New Haven, Connecticut].
Speaker 1: You went to Yale.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you go to Yale University?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now, what, what you think of Yale?
Speaker 2: Loved it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely loved it.
Speaker 1: And what did you, how did they, what did they have you writing about or did you, could you choose what you wrote about or what?
Speaker 2: No, it was, well, first of all, it was math and English.  And the math--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --involved set theory basically, advanced algebra.  And the English was literature, excuse me.  And the writing was in connection with the literature that we were reading, analytic pieces that we wrote and so on.  And we were also asked to write short stories that we created--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --you know.  Which is something that we, we never did in Charleston at all.  It was just a, a wonderful, wonderful experience.  And I was taught how to swim in the Payne Whitney Gymnasium by one of the masters up there that trains the Olympic champions, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, here from, you were from Charleston, South Carolina--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --on the sea--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --surrounded by water--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --but you didn't know how to swim?
Speaker 2: You don't wanna swim in the ocean around Charleston.  The ripcords and the tide, the undercurrents, that is not a good idea, you know.  You go and enjoy the beach, you go in, you walk in as far as your waist but you don't try swimming in that ocean, even if you are a, an accomplished swimmer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You just respect that ocean, that's all (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I didn't, I didn't realize that.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  We lose a lot of young people every summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, were there any memorable moments through there, for that summer, you know--
Speaker 2: Many.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Realization, we got exposure to Yale students.  There were a number of grad students who were the teaching assistants along with the professors.  And it was at a level that I had never operated at before.  And, it took a little while to get to the level that they wanted but when I did, and I, I worked hard, really worked hard, but when I did, it was one of the most satisfying experiences ever, and it helped me to realize that, you know what?  I can do this.  Going back to our theme.  I can do this.  And that was just an incredible realization.  An incredible realization.  And I felt ready for the private school in the summer, in the fall of 1964, and had been cautioned that that's gonna be very difficult.  We're gonna have tutors standing by to help you get up to speed and succeed.  Tutors in French because again it was taught by native speakers as opposed to in Charleston where the teachers had learned French in college but had never been to a French speaking country, and in physics.
Story_ID: 115454
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Well, as it turns out when I got to the school [Little Red Schoolhouse, Incorporated (LRSI), New York, New York], had a little difficulty with speaking French because that was at a completely different level.  No difficulty reading it and writing it because the concentration in Charleston was on the grammar.  And my physics was far ahead of the physics that they were teaching in, in, at the school, and I wound up tutoring (laughter) the students there in physics.  And the same was true of math.  My math was way beyond theirs.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Literature, on the other hand, they were way ahead, and they had done this since first grade, if not kindergarten.  And so there was a lot of catching up there to do.  And that, that took a little while, that took an effort.
Speaker 1: So in liberal arts they were, they were way ahead but in math and science they were--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --dragging.
Speaker 2: We were stronger--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --in South Carolina, in a segregated school [Charles A. Brown High School, Charleston, South Carolina], I might note.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So you said something about culture, and I'm trying to sort it out in my head, but I just--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --had this feeling, you had said something about the culture of how things are taught in a, you know, I mean and that, that seems to be the strength of a southern school is teaching in math and science.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And even now--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --scientists we, who're funded by the National Science Foundation--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) scientists.  And so many of the best scientists come out of HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you have great instruction in those areas.
Speaker 2: I think that's right.  I, I like you, I don't quite understand how or why that dynamic works that way.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: But I think that's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And the teachers generally at HBCUs are very strong in that, in those areas and--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --have, you know.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: I don't know it's, (unclear) it's different.  I don't know how we ever sorted that out.  But okay, so the, what was the school's name again?  Let's see the--
Speaker 2: Well, the high, the corporation is The Little Red Schoolhouse--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --Incorporated.  It goes by the acronym LRSI. And I, I brought along some, some materials on that as well.  And the high school component is called The Elisabeth Irwin, I-R-W-I-N, and it's E-L-I-S-A-B-E-T-H.  And it's at 40 Charlton Street in, in Manhattan, in the Village [Greenwich Village].  And the--
Speaker 1: In the Village.  Now see, I here you're there, now this is a, a pretty exciting time in the--
Speaker 2: You bet.
Speaker 1: --country in terms of liberal ideas--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --that were thought and action.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Summer of '64 [1964] when you're at Yale is, is Freedom Summer.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And Bob Moses was (unclear) in Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And the aftermath was a Democratic [National] Convention [Atlantic City, New Jersey] of, you know, where--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --you know, Fannie Lou Hamer, you know, made her presentation.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Did you, did you check that out on television in those days?
Speaker 2: I saw it on television, I didn't follow it closely--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --but I was aware of it--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  Very much so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And a lot of, you know, activity, volunteerism was at its peak and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --on these campuses.  And--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --people were doing things that they had never done before.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I believe my friend Millicent Brown, whom I mentioned to you, I believe she was actually in Mississippi at the time, working on some of that.  I can't remember the dates very well but I do remember she was there in Mississippi (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Was she in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordination Committee], you know?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Was she a member of SNCC?
Speaker 2: Probably.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Probably.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 115455
Speaker 1: So, so back in the, so, in the fall, that fall you're, you're, you're at the, at Elisabeth Irwin School [Little Red Schoolhouse, Incorporated (LRSI), New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: All right.  And so, so how was the rest of that experience, the next two years--
Speaker 2: Wonderful.
Speaker 1: --there?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Eye openers, both in terms of what we studied, how we studied, where we traveled, to Pennsylvania Dutch country, for example.  Stayed with the families on farms there for about a week, and literally incorporated into their families' activities and getting to know a little bit of that.  And then senior year to New England, basically looking at the early history of the United States, you know.  Going to Concord Bridge [Concord, Massachusetts] and having our teachers read to us things that were written about the Battle at Concord Bridge at that time.  Going to Walden Pond [Concord, Massachusetts] and just lying down, in the fall, the colors, you know, maybe this is why I like fall, and having the, the teacher read portions of [Ralph Waldo] Emerson's 'Walden Pond' [sic, 'Walden' by Henry David Thoreau] and, of course, sitting around with guitars and singing Beatles Songs and, you know, that kind of thing.  Just--
Speaker 1: It is a folk song--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The, the age of the--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --'Hootenanny' TV Show--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and a lot of, you know, folk songs in the message songs.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Um--
Speaker 2: That's right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, were there any other African-American students in the school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'll show you a picture later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My class of thirty-two had five or six African Americans, six, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That percentage was pretty good for that time.  And the school has moved way beyond that since.  And I think the other experience that was wonderful for me there was the French language training.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: I love languages, they come easily for reasons I don't understand.  And the teacher who was most severe, when I say severe I mean most demanding, took a special liking to me.  And the more I did, the more she gave me, you know.  And she gave me a number of books which she wrote in hand, you know, to Jacque (ph.), my gifted student.  And 'til today, I have those books in my library at home on what I call my precious book shelf, on my shelf of precious books, if you will.  But she took me to a level of French that I didn't even realize until years later.  Except that, in the senior year, to show you the difference between the mechanics of learning French which we did in Charleston and did very well, and French at another level, conversation and literature, by the end of 12th grade, we had done a lot of the works of the major 20th century French authors, including Albert Camus and Andre Gide and, you know, Andre Malraux and, and the history behind things that they were talking about in different parts of the world, you know, Malraux with China and so on and.  And at the end of the year when we took our, our SAT IIs, the specialized things in physics and chemistry, and so on.  I took it in French and to my great surprise, came out with a 685 which exempted me from language, foreign language requirements in college.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And then many years later, or maybe I'll wait until we get to that part, I'll tell you about a foreign service experience that involved my high school French.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we'll keep that--
Speaker 2: We'll get to that, you know, (laughter).
Speaker 1: File that away right now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 115456
Speaker 1: But, so, so did you, did you have any leadership roles in this school [Little Red Schoolhouse, Incorporated (LRSI), New York, New York] or (unclear)
Speaker 2: Actually no, I, I did run for president of the student body but, but lost that.  But there were a number of people who were urging me to run and I did.  So I can't say that I really exerted a leadership role there.
Speaker 1: Now, what did you, I, I know you must have, you know, what did you, I guess think of this new group of people?  You know, because you're, you had been in South Carolina all your life--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you're in New York City now--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --which is a very, eclectic, eccentric group--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --of people but basically.  What, what, were you thinking, what did, what was your opinion?
Speaker 2: Well, I thought they were fascinating, and I also came to the conclusion that, that they were not my world, and that I was a visitor in this world, and that my real objective there was to get a, the best education I could get.  And so that was my focus.  So I didn't really delve into a lot of the interpersonal dynamics that were going on there at the time.  There were very few people that I chose to develop a friendship with because we had, you know, interests in common and we just liked one another.  People I could not identify with were people who were always talking about how much they hated their parents, you know, and how they couldn't wait to get away from home, and how lonely they felt and so forth and so on.  Well, I never felt any of those things, and I certainly couldn't even consider hating my parents.  So I just chose to kind of observe and try to understand passively why they felt that way.  But, you know, kind of told myself that this is a different world that I'm not really a member of.  I'm an observer doing what I've chosen to do, get a good education and, and didn't really worry too much about some of the anxieties that I, that I saw there among others because they were not mine.  And, and the few people with whom I developed friendship, those friendships have lasted until today.  And I get together for dinner every once in a while and we visit back and forth and we meet in different places.  They come to visit me in my foreign posts, you know, and so on.  But those are very few, very few.
Story_ID: 116300
Speaker 1: So you were just saying over the break, that, you know, you had, you had kids there that really had a lot of means, their parents would be out of the country skiing while they were at school or--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --doing other things that, you know, things that you wouldn't, you just didn't--
Speaker 2: No.  And so, quite naturally I could understand why they might feel somewhat alone, but again this was not my experience and so I, you know, didn't have that to worry about.  But the few people with whom I did have a rapport and really liked, we are still in touch today, quite frequently and, and get together whenever we can.  In fact, we don't even remember high school anymore, we just enjoy one another (laughter), and always have, you know.
Story_ID: 116301
Speaker 1: Now when you were a senior, what kind of counseling did you have about college?
Speaker 2: I'll tell you how that went, I had a guidance counselor who was Canadian and very forceful man.  You know, he had a big mane of white hair and a square face, he could have been a football player in an American context, and he always had a cigarette.  So he called me in one day and he asked me, "So what are your plans for college?"  And so I said, "Well, I'm planning on applying to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], and Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland], and maybe Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia]."  He took a deep puff out of his cigarette and he said, "The hell you are."  And so I said, "Excuse me?"  So he said, "You're not gonna apply there."  And I said, "Really?"  He said really.  I said, "Well, where am I going to apply?"  He said, "You're gonna apply to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]."  And I laughed.  And I said, "I can't get into Harvard."  He said, "Yes you can."  And I said, "Well, even if I got in, I can't afford to pay to for it."  And his response was, "If they let you in, they will make sure that you have the resources to pay for your college education."  He said, "You're going to Harvard.  And I want you to go, I want you to go and request an interview.  And I want you to go up there for a visit."  And at that point we had a student who was a year ahead of me, who was also a good friend and we never agreed on anything politically but we always enjoyed one another's country, uh company, same is true today.  By the way his name is Elliot Abrams, he's a, you know, (laughter) been in, in the forefront of politics in Washington for a while.  So I went up and Elliot, you know, picked me up, showed me all around, and took me to some classes.  I really liked what I saw and I had the interview and went ahead and applied and again, to my amazement, got in, you know.  And I, I reflect on that because if Bob Leicester [ph.], L-E-I-S-C-H-E-S-T-E-R [sic], I think, I have to check that, it's spelled like Leicester Square in, in London, if he had not said to me, "No, you're not gonna do what you have in mind, you're gonna do what I have in mind, and yes you can do this," it never would have occurred to me that I could go to Harvard.  I mean that was something that someone else did, you know, but not me, that was not a part of my horizon field, you know.  He made me think that it was.  And lo and behold, it happened.  Well, that too was another step for me personally in my growth, in realizing that I can do this.  I can do this, you know.  And then of course, once I got there and started taking the courses and it was tough at first, because in the classrooms, you know, when the teacher would make a point, some of the students would sort of, sort of say "Well, you know, when, when I traveled in Europe and stopped through India on my way to China, I observed something completely different, you know, the Minister of Health told my dad that, you know," so and so and so and so, "I don't understand how what you say fits with the reality."  And it occurred to me that, oh, my goodness, I'm gonna have to do a lot more reading because I can't draw on that experience base.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.  So this is 1966, fall of '66 [1966]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  That's when I decided I had to travel--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --you know, and then worked that into the later years of college.
Story_ID: 116302
Speaker 1: Now what, had you chosen a major at this point?
Speaker 2: At the time, my first year, I chose astrophysics because I had taken this, we had a science requirement and I took a course that was titled 'the History of Science from the Astronomical Perspective.'  There were a lot of guest lecturers coming in, including Harlow Shapley who discovered the size of our galaxy.  And what was the gentleman's name who wrote 'Cosmos'?
Speaker 1: Carl Sagan.
Speaker 2: Carl Sagan.  Who gave three lectures on the probabilities for extra-terrestrial intelligence as opposed to extra-terrestrial life.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --the capability to reason and act accordingly, even if the reasoning is done by a beam of energy instead of a carbon-based life form.  That, to me, was just fascinating.  I decided I wanted to do this.  So I worked out a program and took it to my advisor who was a kind of a staunch Harvard guy.  And he looked at it and sort of said to me, in a very Harvard way, "Perhaps you oughta consider science fiction in the English Department"--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: Who is your, I mean, I'm tempted to ask you and was [HM] Archie [C.] Epps [III] there [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] when you--
Speaker 2: Archie Epps was--
Speaker 1: Was he the--
Speaker 2: Dean of Students or Dean of Admissions or dean of something, I can't remember--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --exactly what it was.  I never interacted very much with Archie Epps.  I kind of got the feeling, that that we were from different generations.  You know, he spoke in, in a fashion that I thought was kind of exaggerated and was trying to project an image that I didn't think was real.  That he thought that was, that he thought was necessary at the time--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --and I tended to like to be around people who were a little more natural and comfortable with who they were.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, Archie Epps (unclear) when we interviewed him, he wore a Harvard blazer, you know, with the insignia--
Speaker 2: That's Archie.
Speaker 1: --spoke with a very English-style accent.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) from Lake Charles, Louisiana--
Speaker 2: Yep, that's Archie.
Speaker 1: But yet he's a, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He was very bright and (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Oh sure, yes.  But it was more the style--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --that, you know, I, I didn't really care to be around.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: So I never really had any interactions with him.  The only interaction I had was (laughter) I went with a friend to a Boston Pops [Orchestra] symphony once, and, and I heard behind me, [exaggerated British accent] "Oh, wasn't that a marvelous performance?"  And I turned around and sort of said, "Hi, Dean Epps, how are you?"  "Oh, just, just wonderful, enjoying-" you know, on and on and on.  That's the only interaction I--but in terms of a serious academic program or the plan, I wouldn't go to him, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I wouldn't have gone to him let me put it that way.
Speaker 1: Not (unclear) he was quite helpful to students.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sure he was but it's just, you know, chemistry.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: I don't think we'd--
Speaker 1: I, I--
Speaker 2: --have meshed very well, you know.
Story_ID: 116303
Speaker 1: Now, now who was, who was your advisor here [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] that you went (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Well, it was a freshman dorm advisor, the, the what do we call them?  The RA the res, you know the, I think they're called RAs, residential assistant--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --or something.  But he also was the guy who signed the start, the, the course, the course plan.  And I can't remember his--
Speaker 1: So he advised you to take science fiction instead of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.  Well, I really wasn't interested in science fiction but since he, I, I thought maybe he might have had a point but I wasn't sure, but anyway I, I wound up doing economics because to me that had a good mix of the technical side, and at the time I was becoming very much more interested in social problems and thought that economics might give me some tools for being able to understand social problems and try to figure out what were at the roots of these problems and then how they could be addressed.  So I wound up going into doing a degree in economics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Until, the senior year (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, economics now you can't speak of Harvard economics without talking about John Kenneth Galbraith.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Now he was there then, a giant of, and in fact he was about 6 foot 5; right?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: About--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And well, did you have any interaction with him?
Speaker 2: No.  I enjoyed reading his books but I always thought of them as soft economics.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And I thought they were very good but I wanted a little more rigor--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --in the economics that I did.  And so I never actually took one of his courses.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, who, who did you, who advised you in economics of, you know, that you, that you remember that, you know--
Speaker 2: That was very good?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was Edward Tower.  And I don't know if he's retired yet but he was a professor at Duke.  But Ed was fantastic and he was my advisor in economics for three years until I graduated, actually.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So what did you, what were you learning about economics from Dr. Tower and others that--
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't so much what I was learning from him because he served more as kind of a tutor, you know, a resource in economics, but I veered off from the basic macro and micro theory and went into more applied economics.  So, you know, I wound up doing things like the economics of the draft, you know.  How can we move to a more, a more efficient draft, and I don't remember what I wrote (laughter) to tell you the truth but that's the idea.  And, and I did my thesis on homeownership among black families in Boston [Massachusetts] and a sort of a comparison between income levels and wealth and so on among home owners in areas near Boston and home, and renters in the black community and how wealth was, how homes were used to, you know, to generate more wealth and made arguments that in order to address some of the problems that blacks are facing in the Roxbury area we needed to figure out ways of, of expanding homeownership, you know, among them so they had a growing asset base and so on.  And then talked about some mechanisms for doing that.  So I was more interested in the applied side of economics than, than, than the theory.
Story_ID: 116304
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  All right.  So Harvard life (unclear) that's a, a lot of really fascinating people come and go, come through Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  What was the sense of, what was your sense of your experience at Harvard for four years?
Speaker 2: Well, for me it was one of the most wonderful experiences I ever had.  Largely, I think, due to my roommates, with whom I'm also still very close.  I mean we, well we spend a lot of time together even today.  And, and they were just fascinating people to talk to, to talk with, to think through things with, and that's still true today as a matter of fact.  And yes there were a lot of very interesting people coming through, speakers all the time.  I was very touched that [pastor and politician] Adam Clayton Powell came through and gave a talk, and afterwards had a very straight up and open and engaging Q and A session, talking about all kinds of issues.  And we also had [foreign policy expert] McGeorge Bundy come through, you know.  Just so many public figures.  What was the guy's name who headed SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]?
Speaker 1: Stokely Carmichael [later Kwame Ture]?
Speaker 2: Stokely Carmichael came through and gave a very, very powerful speech and did a great job on Qs and As.  And then a number of artists, you know, [HM] Dionne Warwick, you know, and it was, it was just, it was just really great.  And not to mention some of the professors on campus.  One of the things that impressed so much and that I decided that I was gonna try to develop that style.  Ernest R. May, who I think is still up at Harvard [sic, May died 2009], was a professor in government and he taught the course on foreign policy.  What impressed me was that for one whole semester, Professor May paced from one side of the stage to the next in the lecture hall, not a single note anywhere in sight, and delivered a flawless lecture, every single time.  That was one thing that impressed me.  The other thing that impressed me was his exams inevitably would begin with, "You are the National Security Advisor to the president. The Koreans are moving south, the North Koreans are moving south," blah, blah, blah.  "Advise the president of the options before him with pros and cons for each," you know.  Well, I never thought of myself before as the National Security Advisor to the president but can you imagine if you hear this for four years, in different courses around Harvard, you are, it's your job to, to provide the options and justify them.  Can you imagine after four years what that does to the psyche?  So I'm thinking to myself can we transpose just this mechanism to schools in inner areas, in inner city areas, or the HBCUs, you know, or smaller colleges in the Midwest, you know.  That you are in this position and you're advising the President, what are you gonna tell him, you know.  That to me is a powerful tool and it was one of the best experiences I ever had at Harvard because it reinforced this idea, oh, yeah, you can do this.  You really can do this.
Story_ID: 116305
Speaker 1: Was one of the papers you cited your capstone paper for economics?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, there was many (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Well the cap, I suppose the capstone was the thesis 'cause that correlates--
Speaker 1: The one on homeownership--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Boston [Massachusetts], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's what I was thinking.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now the other impressive thing that, that that experience left on my mind, is that it is in the permanent collection in Widener Library (laughter) at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I mean that something that I did is in Widener Library (laughter) at Harvard?  Wow (laughter).  You know, but that, that also builds the psyche over time and helps one develop an ever more mature image of one's own capabilities and kind of, a spirit of wanting to defy the limits, you know, wanting to go beyond the limits.  If I did that, then I should be able to do the next one, you know.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) you know, I get the impression, well it's self-evident probably, but at Harvard students are being trained to--
Speaker 2: Lead.
Speaker 1: --lead the rest of the country?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, right.
Speaker 1: If not--
Speaker 2: Different (unclear) then the world, you know.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so, this is what you're being trained, trained to do?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --are this, you are that.  This is the position you're gonna have so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm thinking like--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.  I just wish we could transpose that to a lot of different places.
Speaker 1: So I think some places are actually teaching in some ways you are not--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --going to be a leader.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: So, and you're gonna be the guy that--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --that stacks his papers and selling them (laughter).
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And it makes a big difference in terms of how kids see their horizons.  It makes a huge difference, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Unclear) you are learning these things and you might get a job at it if you're--
Speaker 2: (Nodding)
Speaker 1: If you try hard enough or--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Not you're gonna be the leader--
Speaker 2: Exactly, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is, this is a, it's, it's a difference.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So by the time that you're a senior now, I'm, I'm pretty, now, you know, you're going to graduate school, right but you don't--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And what did you plan to do, I mean what was your, what were your options or how did you chose?
Speaker 2: Well, I came to a realization that my education to date had been a little too Europe-focused.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: And the context was the civil rights period and identification and so forth and so on.  And what really did it for me was, I was traveling in Peru and I was coming up on a little village where there was some music being played that was just giving me a headache, you know, just kind of grating, it was, you know, dissonant sounds, if you will.  And I was just, just anxious to get passed that so I didn't hear it anymore.  But I noticed everybody else was enjoying it, the people in the village.  And I was wondering, why are they enjoying this and I'm not?  And then it occurred to me oh, my goodness, the reason I'm not is because I've been pretty much trained in a Euro-American music tradition.  What are the other music traditions all around the world?  And then I leapt from that to think to myself, you know what?  Christopher Columbus didn't discover America, he just traveled there and he met indigenous people.  Why is it that we should only think of things existing when Europeans or Euro-Americans, say they do?  What were the Indians doing here before Columbus visited?  And what were the Aztecs doing before the Spanish got there?  And what were the Incans doing before?  And what were the, yeah, on and on and on and on.  So I decided in Peru that I need to do something really different for my purposes, my own understanding of things.  That what I needed to do, was to come back and learn something else about the world from a different perspective.  And I figured that since Chinese were one-quarter of humanity at that time, that what I needed to do was to start studying Chinese and getting to know Chinese history and culture for starters.  And if I could figure out a way to include some aspects of African studies in that as well, I should do that.  Well when I came back and did some exploring, it was too much and there was no program that combined the two, so I figured, okay, well let me go with numbers.  And, I'll, I'll study Chinese.  So I started studying Chinese my senior year in college, which is why I say economics until my senior year.  I actually did the degree in economics but I started Chinese senior year in college.  Loved the language.  It came easily, and I decided half way through that year that I was gonna do graduate work in Chinese studies.
Story_ID: 116306
Speaker 1: And so I wound up going to Stanford [University, Stanford, California] for graduate school, a program that included half the studies in language and half the studies in anything else you wanted.
Speaker 2: Now was that the best place to go to study Chinese culture in the United States?
Speaker 1: Depends on what you want.  No, there were lots of places to go.  You could go to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], Columbia [University, New York, New York], [University of] Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], [University of California-] Berkeley, lots of places, University of Hawaii [Honolulu, Hawaii].
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: Stanford was huge.  It had a fine language studies department and, and a very good history department.  And I decided to do language and history.  And a little bit of economics but not, not a lot.
Speaker 2: So this is 1970, right?
Speaker 1: That's 1970, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: That I started out at Stanford, fall of '70 [1970].
Speaker 2: All right.  East Palo Alto [sic], California and here we go.
Speaker 1: Palo Alto.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And so did the two-year masters out there.  And in February of 1972, Nixon went to China as the culmination of the Kissinger secret trips, and signed the Shanghai Communique, which literally changed the U.S. relationship with China, February of 1972.
Speaker 2: And this was big because it was on television almost 24/7--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --7, and we only had so many networks, pre-cable, so if you turned on TV or read the paper at all--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: 'Nixon in China.'
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: And he was definitely there with (unclear) and--
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: --it was a big, a really big deal.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 1: And it was around that time, I, I took the Foreign Service Exam my senior year in college, and passed the written, and postponed the oral.  Went out to Stanford, and between the first and second years of the masters' program came back to the State Department [U.S. Department of State] to do an internship, took the oral, passed it and was being offered a job in the Foreign Service.
Speaker 2: Now, before we get too far passed, when did you, you said the language came easily?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Did the history, you know, was that easy?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, yes, yes.  Yeah.  No, problem there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So that's, that's, you know, I'm, yeah, I was wondering because it's so, there's so little Chinese history taught here.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: You know.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And because there was, and because I didn't know it, it was just all the more fascinating to me.  And there were such fine writers of Chinese history, there's a gentleman who used to be at Berkeley, Jonathan Spence,     S-P-E-N-C-E, who writes in such an easy and reader-friendly style.  It's not this kind of rigid, cold, kind of scholarly writing, it's more like a story.  And you pick up one of his books and you just cannot put them down, you know, and, and the more you read, the more you wanna read.  So, so we did that.
Speaker 2: So in terms of your teachers and advisors there [Stanford University, Stanford, California], were any, any particular teacher, advisor that stands out and--
Speaker 1: Sure, yeah.  Lyman Van Slyke for history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He's now emeritus.  Harold Kahn, K-A-H-N, also for history.  And John Lewis, L-E-W-I-S for Chinese politics.  All of them are emeritus at this point.  Oh, and there's another for language, there's, there's he is deceased, but his name and I'll spell it for you, it was  K-A-O, G-U-N-G [sic], and Y-I.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Kao Kung-yi?
Speaker 1: Kao Kung-yi [Richard Kung-yi Kao].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The K is pronounced as a hard G.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Okay.  Kao, Kao Kung-yi. And would he be Mr. Kao?
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yep.  But he taught classical Chinese which is the equivalent of Latin in the romance languages.  And, but its, it's the, it's the language of the literary world.  And, you know, we had our classes on the lawn, on a pleasant day where he would sing Tang dynastry [sic], Tang dynasty poetry and, it, it was just an incredible experience but it, it gave depth to the study of modern Chinese because you began to understand why things were the way, were written the way that they, that they were, and how the language evolved over time.  It was a very deep and rich experience.
Story_ID: 113905
Speaker 1: All right.  Stanford [University, Stanford, California].
Speaker 2: Yep.  So those were the teachers who were most influential on me.  There was one other gentleman, who was not a teacher, he was a State Department [U.S. Department of State] Foreign Service Officer [FSO], senior Foreign Service Officer, who was the diplomat-in-residence at Stanford at the time.  And he sat in on a number of classes that I took, and he knew that I had been accepted into the Foreign Service and that my plan was to leave graduate school and go directly to begin my Foreign Service career.  And so he came to me one day and he said, "I'm going to be the deputy director in the East Asian bureau's [Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs] Office of Regional Affairs.  I would very much like to have you come work in my office.  Would you be willing to do that?"  And I said, "Absolutely."  'Cause I liked him and we had talked a lot together.  So he said, "Okay.  Now, you're gonna go through the basic training course for the Foreign Service when you go back to Washington [D.C.].  The normal pattern is, when you finish that, you're gonna be assigned to an embassy overseas to do consular work.  I'm going to intervene in that process and I'm gonna bring you directly out of your basic training into my office."  So I said, "Great, wonderful."  Okay.  So this was the spring of 1972, after the February Shanghai [China] trip that the president [Richard Nixon] made, that changed our relationship with China.  So here I was with economics training, with Chinese language and history training, and going into the Foreign Service three, what four months after Nixon changed the relationship, and just happened to be black.  And there weren't a lot of people around who kind of were bringing that set to the State Department.  So, you know, I, I came in and started working in this gentleman's office, Mr. Nethercutt's (ph.) office, and within a few months asked for the advanced language training in Taiwan, one year later.  And it was agreed that in 1973 I would go to Taichung, Taiwan to our training facility, to try to move toward interpreter level.  Unfortunately, I became ill and couldn't go for a year, even though my goods were sitting in the school, my belongings were sitting in the school waiting for me.   And--
Speaker 1: So what happened to you when--
Speaker 2: Oh, I had a series of internal infections that--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --could not be cleared easily.  You know, ears, stomach, intestinal system, the eyes, everything.  And it took a year to work all of that out.  And at the end of that year, got married, and then left for Taiwan, not for the language school but for a job at the trade center.  The new [U.S.] Trade Center [Taipei] that was established there.
Speaker 1: So this is 1974, now?
Speaker 2: 1974--
Story_ID: 113906
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you got well, now tell, tell, us how you met your wife and--
Speaker 2: Ahh.  It was 1970 and towards the end of my senior year in college [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I'd applied for two jobs.  One was as an intern in the State Department [U.S. Department of State], and the other was with the [National] Urban League in a program that they had to send black students to different cities to do community service work.  And the State Department job was held up because the security people wanted to know more about a trip that I took from Arequipa, from Arequipa, Peru, where I spent two summers, down to Arica, Chile, and returned to Arequipa in twenty-four hours.  And I explained to them that I went to a party.  And they found that a little difficult to believe so they had to check it out and it took time.  The Urban League really wanted me to do the job for them.  And I tried to delay it until I could hear about the security clearance but finally the Urban League said, "If you wanna make a hundred bucks a week"--and in 1970 that was good money for a student-"you're gonna take this job right now, and if you don't take it now, it's going to somebody else."  So I figured, you know, I'll go for the hundred bucks.  And I asked them to send me to San Francisco [California], and my plan there was to have my transportation paid for, and after I worked I'd just go to Stanford [University, Stanford, California], (laughter) you know.  They said, "No, we want you to go to Youngstown, Ohio."  And I asked them, "What's in Youngstown?  Where is that?"  And they explained to me and I said, "Well, never heard of it."  They said, "Well, think steel, think tires" and so on.  And so I said, "No, what about Washington [D.C.]?"  They said, "No, Youngstown."  "Okay.  Atlanta [Georgia]?"  "Nope, Youngstown."  "Okay, I'll stay in Boston [Massachusetts]."  "No, Youngstown.  It's either Youngstown or nothing."  So kicking and screaming I went to Youngstown, Ohio, completely against my will.  I had no interest in going to Youngstown, Ohio.  And when I got there I wound up living in a Y[MCA] that was in very poor shape, very poor lighting, you know, beds that were like prison beds and the, you know, sagged in the middle and all that.  And I just went to work and came back, and then we finally got an apartment, there were three other guys who went and I've got a little article on them as well.  And so we finally got an apartment, a house really, and I just came home and read.  So one day someone said, "There's a party, let's go."  I said, "No I'll stay and read."  And they said, "They have good food there."  I said, "Okay, I'll go, just to eat."  I went, met some people, got a plate and sat on the floor concentrating only on the dinner and getting out of there, you know.  And at the time, this tiny little person came out sort of yelling, you know, like, "You people are so boring, you're all sitting around, this is a party, you should be up dancing!" And I thought, she's funny.  And I went back to eating.  And another record played and she said, "Look, I'm gonna pull you up on the floor," since nobody got up and danced, "I'm gonna pull you." And she was tiny and she tried to pulling people and you just got the skid marks on the floor and I, and I thought (unclear) really interesting.  And nobody got up.  So finally she said, "I'm gonna put on another record and if nobody comes to dance, I'm gonna dance by myself."  So sure enough, she was on the floor dancing by herself.  Nobody else on the floor.  So I thought that takes guts.  And I went over and introduced myself, I said, you know, "Hello I'm Jim Gadsden." So she said, "Hello.  I'm Sally Freeman, it's very nice to meet you, even if it is for the second time."  And I said, "I don't think we met before."  She said, "Yes we did."  I said, "Where?"  She said, "In the kitchen, but of course you were too busy feeding your face."  That was the beginning of a marvelous relationship and we spent a lot of time together that summer with her family and with her younger sisters, you know, going out, doing things, amusement parks, rowing in the park, and talking and debating about everything.  And everything that I came up with, she had a counter for it.  Very difficult.  I don't think I won a single argument with her that summer, and I haven't ever since.  And so as I was leaving, I said to her, got out of the car, I, I was half way in the car, got out, and I said to her, "Oh, by the way, you don't know this yet but you're gonna marry me."  And she said, "Sure buddy, have a nice life" and slammed the door.  And I got in the car and I asked the fellows taking me, "Did I just-" And they said, "Yes you did" (laughter).  It's not the way I do things, you know, I kind of think things through methodically and then wait a while and then come to my conclusions after a very deliberate process.  This was on the spot.  I just knew that this was the love of my life.  And four years later we married and we're now looking at our 39th anniversary coming up in July [2013].
Story_ID: 113907
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, that's, that's, you can't, can't get any better than that.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So, okay, so.  You all get married in '74 [1974]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so, you stayed in touch I guess and--
Speaker 2: In between?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I was actually in graduate school [Stanford University, Stanford, California] after we met, tried very hard to get her to come out to marry me, and then move out to California while I was doing my work.  And her response was no.  You need to concentrate on finishing your degree and doing that well.  We'll talk about marriage at some point later.  And then as I was finishing my degree, her father was suffering from cancer and so she really couldn't talk about marriage at that point.  And, and her father died very shortly before I was going to Taiwan.  And in fact, I bothered her so much about marrying me, that she finally said, "Look, stop asking me.  If I'm ready, and when I'm ready, I'll ask you."  So I said, "Okay, that's original" (laughter).  And so, you know, I, I didn't ask her anymore.  And finally when I was getting ready to go to Taiwan I said to her, "If you decide that you'd like to get married, just let me know and I'll be on the first plane back here."  And she said, "Well, will you marry me now?"  And I did a double take, you know, and that was it.  Yeah, so we got married before we left.
Story_ID: 113908
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So 1974 you're, you're on your way to Taiwan; right?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now Taiwan then, and well is now I guess, a, well in those days it was a more, I think it was more emphasis on it being the recognized Chinese government (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: We recognized them as the Republic of China.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, we had established a liaison office in Beijing [People's Republic of China] but it was not a full blown embassy and we did not have diplomatic relations there until 1978.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that was part of the contention that the U.S. had with the, with Red China was the, whether to recognize, you know, Taiwan as the Republic of China; right?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  And as a, and you could not have diplomatic relations with Beijing and still have or even call Taiwan the Republic of China.  It was one or the other.  And so, you know, when we decided to recognize, that was it.  And we now have an American institute in Taipei [Taiwan] but not an embassy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, in the Shanghai Communique we agreed with the Chinese that there was only one China, and Taiwan is a part of China and it's up to the People's Republic of China and Taiwan to settle their differences peaceably.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And for the record the, Taiwan, the government of Taiwan was, the government of mainland China at one time in exile.
Speaker 2: That's what they consider themselves.
Speaker 1: Before, that's what they considered themselves, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But so much time had passed by then that, it was, you know.
Speaker 2: Well they, yeah.  That's kind of a vague notion at this point.  I don't think I've, I haven't seen their proclaiming that they still are the government of all of China.
Speaker 1: So that even then so much time had passed--
Speaker 2: It wasn't reality--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in reality.
Speaker 1: That the reality (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Never.
Speaker 1: That there was a government in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --mainland China--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that they had nothing to do with.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was a, it was, it had no basis in reality.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Yeah. -131728 Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.  So, so well, well how did things go in Taiwan for you, you know?
Speaker 1: Well, it was a booming economy.  Very, very industrious group of people.  They were on the move and you knew it.  You just knew it.  And we had very, very fine relations both with the government and with the people and with the business community, very heavy American business presence there and a lot of expats [expatriates].  We had at the time that we were there, a good size military presence, which of course, diminished over time.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: Excuse me, we certainly were treated very well.  We lived in a Chinese community, you know, up near the Cultural University [Chinese Culture University, Taipei, Taiwan] on, on the hill [Yang Ming Mountain].  And in that Chinese community we, you know, had good relations with, with people up there.  It was a very pleasant time for us, it really was.  And my wife started working at the consular section.  It was a good experience.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And your duties day to day were to?
Speaker 1: Well, I was the, at the U.S. Trade Center [Taipei, Taiwan].  And I was the Market Research Officer at that point.  And my job was to do the research on the market potential for American products in an area that we were considering for a trade exhibition.  So, for example, construction equipment.  What's the size of the market?  What exactly are the kinds of equipment that could sell well?  Who are potential agents or distributors or business partners that American companies could work with?
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: That kind of thing.
Story_ID: 113909
Speaker 1: Now, the, the government, the American government's kind of in turmoil during this period of time 'cause of the Watergate [scandal], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that didn't have too much of an effect on what we were doing in Taiwan.  In fact, the day we flew out, to go to Taiwan, was the day that [President Richard] Nixon flew out of the White House [August 9, 1974], flew out of the White House, the White House grounds, you know, going to San Clemente [California], I guess, wherever he was going after he left.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that didn't have an impact.
Speaker 1: Henry Kissinger was the Secretary of State, right?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And (unclear) and he remained even though Nixon--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --left.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And the President then was Gerald Ford--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --going forward.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: I just wanna make that, okay.  So, so you were the Market Research Officer in Taiwan--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: From '74 [1974] to '76 [1976]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And that was about the time when Jimmy Carter took office.  Now did, did the Carter administration's change have anything to do with your job?
Speaker 2: No, not at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: So, in '76 [1976], well what happened, you changed jobs and you become the Commercial Officer of--
Speaker 2: Well, that was because I went to a different embassy--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --after, after Taiwan.  And--
Speaker 1: Now this, well I have a question here that--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --when I first wrote the outline and stuff I was really intrigued, I said well, you, you really never come back to China do you?  I mean, or the, or--
Speaker 2: No, not really.
Speaker 1: --Taiwan, you never go (unclear) and come back?
Speaker 2: Never made it.
Speaker 1: And then so all the hours of studying to become, you know, expert on East Asia and Chinese, and Chinese studies, I mean, your, your next assignment is Budapest [Hungary].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, did you think that you would go back at some point to China?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: My wife [Sally Freeman Gadsden] was not inclined to at that time.  And, and the Budapest assignment was a, a fascinating one for us because, (a), it was in Europe and we felt we need, you know, to be in that kind of a more comfortable setting after Taiwan.  (B), it was centrally located in Europe and our assumption was if we got one Europe assignment, we'll probably never get another one, so let's do this now.  And because of its location, we can drive to all the other places that we want to see since we'll never get to Europe again (laughter).  That was our assumption.  And, of course, it was just completely wrong.  So, so we did that.  Also the Budapest assignment brought us back to the [United] States for a year for language training.  And Taiwan was the first time my wife had been away from home, you know.  I mean when we married she was still living with her family.  So she wanted to be closer to her family to be able to see them and, and interact with them once again before we took off.  So one year of studying allowed us that opportunity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is in 1976, latter part of '76 [1976] or--
Speaker 2: '76 [1976] to '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Hungarian language training.
Speaker 1: And where did you take training now?
Speaker 2: At the Foreign Service Institute, it's our State Department's [U.S. Department of State] university.
Speaker 1: In [Washington] D.C.?
Speaker 2: It's actually in, in Arlington, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In Arlington?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And it does hundreds of languages and economics and consular affairs, all the skill sets that are needed for Foreign Service work, are taught at the Foreign Service Institute.
Speaker 1: So did you study Hungarian?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ten months, eight hours a day.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And my wife did as well.
Story_ID: 113910
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what, what's your wife's [Sally Freeman Gadsden's] background in, you know?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: In college, what, what, what was she--
Speaker 2: She started in criminology but did not finish.  She too had to kind of help support her family so she, she went full time for a while, then took courses at night, and I think she was still taking courses when we got married on a slower, longer trajectory.  And then, of course, when we got married and went away, you know.  She still, I think, at some point when she retires would like to do some more coursework, maybe even finish a degree but it just wasn't possible once we, launched off on the, the Foreign Service career and then the kids came along and now she's got her own career and so, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, the wives of people in Foreign Service, are, they have a job, too, but--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --that, you know, it's, can you kind, can you kind of tell us about what the things your, I mean the, the types of duties your wife would have--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --just being the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, first of all, there are no formal duties.  I mean there's no contractual arrangement, and she certainly isn't paid for what she does.  However, in terms of, of support particularly, if the spouse has representational responsibilities to entertain at home, it, you, the spouse can't do it without the support of the wife.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And even before we had children, in Budapest [Hungary], for example, the first time, I would normally take my Hungarian counterparts out to lunch to conduct business over lunch from time to time.  Now that was very expensive.  And my wife, who was not working at the time, said to me, "Well why are you doing that?  Why don't you bring them to the house, and I will make Chinese lunch," because when she was in Taiwan she took a lot of Chinese cooking courses.  And I thought well, "Wow, thank you".  And she did, at a lot less cost to the U.S. government.  And I think certainly the food was much better and it was much more, I think pleasant to be able to bring people into an American home.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Your counterparts.  Now, here's how we know that worked.  The first time she did this, and it was a fabulous lunch, and she, she prepared it, she served it, we didn't have any help in the house.  And she's got a great sense of humor and she was kidding with the guests and so on.  And they were feeling very relaxed, this was not a stiff formal diplomatic meeting, this is the way my wife and I conduct diplomacy, you know.  Come to our home, yeah.  About 3:30 in the afternoon, you know, I said to the guests, people from the foreign ministry, the trade ministry and so on, "Well, thank you so much for coming.  We've had a wonderful discussion.  We've gone over a number of issues.  We kind of know what the work plan is from here."  And, and we certainly had an enjoyable conversation.  "I know you all have to get back to work and so do I, so we'll, we'll do this again and hopefully very soon."  You know what they said?  "So you have to go back to work, Jim?"  And I said yes.  They said, "Okay.  See you later, we're gonna stay here with Sally" (laughter).  These are my official counterparts in a hard Communist country, right.  And I left and went to work and they, they stayed and talked to Sally.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, I say that to say this: it's the little things like this that build a rapport with your official contacts in diplomacy, where the spouse can play, the wife in particular, if the, if the husband is working, can play just an incredible role even without trying to do so.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: But it's the atmosphere that she creates, for which she gets no compensation whatsoever, and that, that can make the difference when it comes to an emergency and you need to pick up the phone and call somebody in that foreign government to get something done--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --in the interest of an American citizen or a business or a company or whatever, that makes the difference.  And my wife, you know, just excelled at that.  I mean she just does that supremely well.
Story_ID: 113911
Speaker 1: Now, we, I know we interviewed [HM] Horace [G.] Dawson--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and we actually interviewed his wife, [HM] Lula [Cole] Dawson--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who is the wife of an ambassador but basically and, and she talked about that is a career.  (Unclear) you know, 'cause that's what it was.  She did, did so many things with, with him all over, in all his assignments.  So I knew it was an important--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you can look at it that way.  I think we sort of saw it as, well this is what our family does and we enjoy it, you know.  Welcome to our home.  And there were times much later when we had kids in Budapest [Hungary], the second time, where the kids would barbecue, you know, and, and, and, and help serve the, the goodies at Christmas parties and, and so on.  And it, it just makes for, I think, a better type of diplomacy than just a fairly stiff formal interaction.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let, let me ask you this.  What, what were some of the issues in Hungary in, between 1977 and '79 [1979]?
Speaker 2: The biggest issue was the Jackson-Vanik amendment.  That was the amendment that tied, you know, non-preferential trade, or MFN [most favoured nation] trade as we might call it, to immigration, of in particular Jews from, from Hungary.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: And that was a, a, an amendment that had to be renewed every year after an evaluation of whether or not Jews were allowed to emigrate freely from Hungary.  That by far was the toughest issue to, trying to get the Hungarians to--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --you know, to do what would help facilitate, you know, renewal of that, of that amendment which allowed trade to take place.
Speaker 1: Now had the Hungarians, I can't remember now, but the, had the Hungarians kind of broken away from Eastern Bloc at that point, were, were they--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --in the process of breaking away?
Speaker 2: No.  That was kind of a, a very tricky type of relationship.  '56 [the Hungarian Revolution of 1956] pretty much impressed upon the Hungarians that there was a Soviet presence there--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Yeah, they tried to--
Speaker 2: --and it was dominant.
Speaker 1: --push the Soviets out in '56 [1956] and were crushed, right?
Speaker 2: And they thought that we were going to come to their aid.  And, of course, there was no American leader who was going to risk a war with the Soviet Union, you know, to come to Hungary's aid, that wasn't gonna happen.  Many in Hungary believed that it would.  So it was a little bit of ill feeling there or there was at that time, over that.  The Soviet presence was not visible in '77 [1977].  There was this great big Soviet statue--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --you know, over the city on the highest mountain, the Gellert Mountain, kind of a reminder that we are here, let's not do anything that's going to--but here are the two things that were the key, the Hungarians could not challenge the preeminence of the [Communist] Party in Hungarian society.  That was a no-no.  That would trigger a bad reaction from the Soviets.  The Hungarians could not challenge Soviet foreign policy; that would cause a very bad reaction.  So they shied away from those things, and as long as they did, the Soviets really didn't care whether the enterprises, the state trading enterprises, were making money, or whether the people were getting rich, or whether they were buying Mercedes-Benzes and Gucci shoes, they didn't care. Just don't challenge the party and don't challenge Soviet foreign policy.  And so they were able to maintain a lot of Hungarian culture, a lot of the way Hungarians liked to live without interference from the Soviets.
Story_ID: 113912
Speaker 1: So, that's, that's Hungary and in 19--I guess you returned in '79 [1979] to the United States?
Speaker 2: Yes, '79 [1979] to '80 [1980].  Well, actually '79 [1979] to '85 [1985], pretty much.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so I know you served as staff assistant to the Assistant Secretary of State for Economics and Business Affairs.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that was in, in [Washington] D.C.?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And this is during the beginning years of the [Ronald] Reagan administration?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And now who was the Secretary of State at that juncture?
Speaker 2: Ooh.
Speaker 1: Was that (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: James Baker [sic, Alexander Haig]?  I think it was Baker, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You, you, (laughter), you know, better than I do, but I--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) well you know my memory fades (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: I think it was (unclear) but you see you got out before I did but it probably, it probably is then.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: James Baker.
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: So, so what was your role in that position?
Speaker 2: As staff assistant?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Fundamentally, the conduit for three types of papers coming to the Assistant Secretary, and more than likely moving on to the Undersecretaries and the Secretary of State, action memos which required decisions, you know.  Issue, essential points, recommendation, approve, disapprove.  Briefing memos which were basically used particularly for meetings with visiting senior officials to basically say, "Here are major issues with this country, your visitor is going to wanna talk about X, Y, and Z.  From you, your visitor will want, you know, you to agree to do P, Q, and R.  And you should respond by advising that A, B and C," you know.  Just kind of a scene setter, if you will.  And then third was just information on something that's not critical, not for a meeting, not require any decision but something that the, the Secretary or the Assistant Secretary should know about.  My job was to look at these fifty, sixty, seventy, maybe or more memos coming in a day, making sure that they were written in a clear, coherent, logical manner.  That a recommendation was absolutely crystal clear.  That the memo was in absolutely perfect condition, you know, grammatically and so on.  And that it was concise and short, if it weren't, I'd send it back to be redone.  So that was it.  I was the conduit for the papers--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now this is an, an important role, I mean, because I, I would imagine a misunderstanding on any of these memos would be, could result in--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --a big problem.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And my advice to the drafters was it's better for me to tell you this than for the Assistant Secretary to (laughter).  So, you know, please help yourself (laughter).
Story_ID: 113913
Speaker 1: Now had, had, had there been another African American in your role before you, I mean, I, I, well I would just, let me put it this way--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I would just expect for a lot of people involved in the State Department [U.S. Department of State] they hadn't interacted with an African American before in that kind of role?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  That's a, that's a fascinating question.  I'm gonna have to check.  I honestly don't know the answer to that.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any sense of, you know, how did you, I mean do you have sense of push, push back against things like, you know, your--
Speaker 2: My being an African American?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: And being in that position?
Speaker 2: Nope, absolutely none.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No.  No, not at all.
Speaker 1: There is, there is a, I guess, you know, in some circles it's been said, and even Mark Twain said there was nothing more agitating to certain elements of white society than a, than an educated black person who is able to correct things and (unclear)-
Speaker 2: I think that's true.  I think that's still true, you know, less so with the younger generations but, yeah.  I think that's true.  That said I, I learned a lesson in that job.  My boss was from Alabama, a very smart man with a very thick and heavy southern accent.  And he was all business and never play and never joking but all business, very efficient and very good at what he did.  And I assumed that, you know, he's from Alabama, I'm from South Carolina, I'm black, oh no, no, this,  this isn't gonna work well, you know.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  This man wrote one of the most incredible evaluations on me that I could ever have dreamed about.  And then he counseled me and he sort of said, you're gonna go far in this business, you've got all the traits that you need to go forward, and I hope this evaluation helps you along that way.  I got promoted out of a staff job based on his evaluation.  Not many promotions come out of a staff job, you know.  And I just told myself right then, I don't care what accent I hear, I don't care where people are from, I don't care what color they are, I don't care what religion they are, I am not gonna draw any conclusions about anybody, anymore.  That was my lesson to myself, you know.  I was so wrong.
Speaker 1: Who was your boss anyway?
Speaker 2: His name was Ernest [B. Johnston], oh, what is the name, Ernie? Oh, I can see him, I can hear him.  Ernie, Ernie, can't remember his last name.
Speaker 1: Oh, we'll get, we'll think about it later but--
Story_ID: 113914
Speaker 1: That gets us in the discussion.  Now, now you went from that position to, European Communities Desk Officer, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, what, what did you do in that role?
Speaker 2: In that office, and if you're interested in another lesson that came from that, in that office I was basically one of two people responsible for the relationship between the United States and what was called then the European Communities.  It's now the EU [European Union].  And I was also responsible for relations with the European Parliament, which is a part of the European Communities.  And, and the Council of Europe which is a larger body of European countries that works on a number of things, basically trying to bring more democracy to more countries in Europe at that time.  And also on things that we don't normally think about like international road signs, you know, so that a red triangle means yield, no matter where it is in the world, and, you know, things like that.  There's an octagonal shape to a stop sign, you know.  So if you can't read the language, you know, it means stop (laughter).  Also conventions on any number of things, including on the exchange of prisoners.  And while we were not members of the Council of Europe, we were parties to these conventions and we adhere to them.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: So that was kind of my portfolio.  I also had missile control technology and law of the sea as issues in my portfolio.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What, what, do you mean by missile control?
Speaker 2: Well, we have international regimes to prevent the proliferation of missile technology.  For example, how shall we put it?  Restrictions on components that could have dual use capabilities where, you know, some, some components might be used in a, a paint mixer but they also could serve as kind of a, of a, of a motor part for a missile with a warhead on top of it.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Well, if somebody wants to export that to Iran, we're gonna wanna know answers to a lot of questions.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: And we may decide to deny that export (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: And we, we were told this a couple days ago by an engineer who worked on the, the hydrogen bomb [HM Oliver Baker], that, that the delivery of it, is crucial, you know.  Even if somebody made one, they wouldn't be able to, to deliver it, it is--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --it's harder than it is to actually make it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean so--
Speaker 2: Right, 'cause you've got powering systems, you've got guidance systems, you've got accuracy, so forth and so on.  So, I mean we know that the [North] Koreans have developed a nuclear capability.  We also know that trying to develop, to develop a, a missile capability, we would be very, very concerned about any kind of export that might be going from any of our countries, our, you know, allies and friends, that might give the North Koreans an edge on moving towards a missile capability that would extend their delivery range beyond what it is right now, or their accuracy beyond what it is right now.  So the idea was how do we work with our friends and allies to develop lists of the kinds of technologies that could have dual use that could be applied on a missile, not just North Korea, but to any kind of question, country that has questionable intentions?  How do we work together to present, to prevent the proliferation of missile technology that could deliver warheads?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 113915
Speaker 1: So you were there [U.S. Department of State European Community desk] from 1981 to '84 [1984], was there anything we need to talk about in that position before we move on to the next?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't think so.  Just maybe one lesson learned.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was through lunch with a China buddy, complaining about wanting to get out of his job in that office, that the idea came up of whether or not I might wanna take his job.  First he asked me, and I told him, "Well, I got a commitment right now."  Then when I went back to my office after lunch, his boss called me and invited me down for a conversation.  We talked for two hours, didn't talk about the job once but everything else.  And he was an elderly gentleman, and he asked me, "So young man, do you want this job on the European Communities desk?"  And the lesson I learned was how to answer a question, you know.  Instead of saying, "Yes, sir," what I said was, "Well, you know, I'm not really not a Europe expert, I studied China.  And I had one assignment in Europe in Budapest [Hungary] and," and on and on and on about what I didn't have.  This gentleman took his glasses off, leaned across the desk and said, "Young man, I don't give a good"--expletive deleted-"what you know about Europe, whether you studied Europe, whether you've been to Europe, I don't even care whether you like Europe.  My question to you was, do you want this job because I want you in it."
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And, of course, my response was yes.  My lesson, don't talk about what you can't do because, you can do it, you know.  You can do it.
Story_ID: 113916
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in '85 [1985], now you're the Economic and Political Officer for the U.S. Mission to the European Communities?
Speaker 2: Right.  In Brussels.
Speaker 1: In Brussels, Belgium.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about that, what, what were your duties (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I started out working on development affairs.  And at that point, there was a big problem in the Sahel [Africa], drought, food shortages, and so on.  We had a big effort with the European Communities to try to figure out how to get food to people who needed it and food in remote places.  And so we were working with AID [United States Agency for International Development (USAID)] and with the European Union and with our military, where the Europeans had the food but they couldn't deliver it, they didn't have the capability.  So we worked with the [U.S. Navy] Sixth Fleet to be able to ferry helicopters into some remote places and so on.  That's how we started out.  I had a boss who was an ultraconservative Republican, very wealthy, a protege of [Senator] Jesse Helms [R-North Carolina].  And he didn't know a lot about foreign affairs.  He was a political appointee.  And there were several times when I wrote messages back to Washington [D.C.] that he didn't think I oughta send because they didn't quite, they went against the grain.  And we had to have country team meetings where the rest of the staff at the embassy persuaded him that I was right and that the message needed to go.  And that happened twice.  And then there was a, I got a call into his office for some reason or other and I thought what have I done now.  And he told me that there are a lot of things that are gonna be happening, and he wanted someone on the job that he knew who was gonna get it right to try to explain to Washington what was happening and recommend what we should do when our interests were affected.  And he told me that he wanted me to do that job.  And I said, "Well, but I have a job." That was another mistake, right.  And he said, "Yes, but I want you to do this job."  And so I said, "Well what about the job I came here to do?"  And he said, "Don't worry about that, we've got our eyes on someone in Washington that we wanna come out to replace you.  But it's not gonna be right away because she has to pass the French language requirement.  So if you can do both jobs for a while until we can get her in, you know, then, you know, we'll be okay but I want you on that job."  So I said okay.  Now, when that person finally, well I started doing both.  And that was basically following the decision-making mechanisms, the European summit leaders, the heads of government, the foreign ministers, the finance ministers, and then as a side portfolio, relations between European Communities and Russia [the Soviet Union] and the European communities, and the countries of the East Bloc Central European.  So finally--and that's a completely different story I won't tell you about that now, but if later, if you're interested I'll tell you--finally we got this person out and I concentrate fully on that job.  I did a lot of reporting about the changes that were coming through.  One of which--Washington reacted badly when I told them that Germany was gonna unite, and explained why.  And Washington said, "Well, interesting story, even if completely far-fetched, slap on the wrist," and that ambassador was embarrassed and he didn't like that.  A year later Germany was united in exactly the fashion that I said it was gonna happen.  And congratulatory cables came out from Washington and the ambassador loved that, you know.  So that's basically what I did.  Relations with the East, a lot of aspects of European integration which were all occurring in that '85 [1985] to '89 [1989] period, at exactly the time that the Soviet Union was falling apart, the Eastern European countries were breaking away from the East Bloc and they were all rushing to join the EU [European Union] and to join NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization].  That was a critical period.  And one of the most fascinating periods of my career for being able to, to analyze and interpret what was going on, and to try to explain what American interests were affected there, and what we should be doing to advance our interests.
Story_ID: 113917
Speaker 1: So moving on to 1993, I guess; right?  Is it a good time to move, I mean, as far (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Well, there was '89 [1989] to '93 [1993].
Speaker 1: '89 [1989] to '93 [1993]
Speaker 2: In Paris [France].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, well, no, we, we, we haven't covered that I guess, right or, or have we?
Speaker 2: We've haven't covered Paris.
Speaker 1: We haven't covered that.
Speaker 2: Paris.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, so '89 [1989] to '93 [1993] you were the Counselor for Economic Affairs, the deputy head of the embassy's economic section?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: American Embassy in Paris, France?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So 1989, two hundred years after 1789 [the French Revolution].
Speaker 2: Very important.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: Very important.  In fact, it was the point where the French were taking the presidency of what had now become the European Union.  You know, they had integrated economically, they had integrated politically, and they were moving forward to deepen the integration, and the French were gonna take them there.  What never happens in the Foreign Service, or if it does it's very rare, is that the embassy in Paris called me in Brussels and said, "Listen, the French are gonna be doing this and it's gonna be very important for the United States.  We have no one in this embassy among our five hundred Americans who knows anything about the European Union.  Would you be willing to come to Paris to be the Deputy Head of the Economic Section for four years?"  And I told them, "Well, I, I need to check my schedule and see if I can do that."  No, I told them, "Yes" (laughter), "absolutely," you know.  And so we, we went to Paris, and we had a big economic section there, that, of course, included a big State Department [U.S. Department of State] component, about ten people, the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration], the Agriculture Department [U.S. Department of Agriculture], the Commerce Department [U.S. Department of Commerce], and, and the Treasury [U.S. Department of the Treasury], big component, it's a big relationship, huge relationship.  A lot of issues to work on.  All the way from subsidies to steel production, to subsidies to Airbus production, to subsidies to Agriculture, to efforts to put our law firms in Paris out of business, you know, broadcast directors restricting American broadcasts of American programming.  The list is endless.  And so we had a very, very, very busy time in Paris; so much so, that I easily forgot that I was in Paris 'cause I'd go to work in the dark, leave in the dark, and, of course, when you're in the embassy, it looks like any other government building in Washington [D.C.].  And there were times when I just forgot I was in Paris 'cause we were working so hard on these issues, yeah.  But that too was a fascinating assignment.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Really, tough issues and very important issues too.
Story_ID: 113918
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So you were, you were there through 1993?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This is the administration of George Herbert Walker Bush [President George H.W. Bush]?
Speaker 2: No, actually, that was [President] Bill Clinton.
Speaker 1: Well, starting in '92 [1992], I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In '89 [1989], you know, the latter part of well, the latter part of George Bush--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: [Operation] Desert Storm was going on--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at this time also.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did that affect anything you were doing?
Speaker 2: Yes, it did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was, again, the sanctions regime against Iraq.  A lot of coordination with the French foreign ministry, particularly when we, when we thought that there were violations on the part of French companies, we would bring it to the attention of, of the French government, and they took the appropriate action.  And, and it would happen in the reverse direction as well.  We, we worked together very closely with them on that.  And, and the French were, of course, very supportive.  The first aircraft carrier, not aircraft carrier but I guess helicopter gun ship carrier that arrived, excuse me, off the coast of Iraq to help the Americans was not a British ship, it was a French ship, you know.  Of course, it was also at that time that we discovered that, that there was a capabilities gap, a wide one, between ourselves and the French and a number of others who were helping us there in terms of the ability to, to fly and conduct operations at night, tank operations at night, communications, interoperability between communications.  And, and that became an issue that NATO later took up to try to--
Speaker 1: And I'm assuming the U.S. is, is, is leading in capacity--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: In this (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Absolutely, oh, yeah.  No question.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But we just got so far out in front that, and I guess nobody was focusing on this until we actually had a combat situation that we needed to, where we needed to operate together--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And there were some, some difficulties.
Speaker 1: Now, there's another thing that's going on, on a world scene that requires some coordination worldwide and that was the, that was the boycott of South Africa, the, [United States] Congress voted sanctions against South Africa.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And Ron Dellums [HM Ronald Dellums] and others got legislation passed--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --this is vetoed by [President] Ronald Reagan at one point but it was upheld by a Congressional vote and--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and they were law--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --you know, after the Senate and the Congress [sic] got together.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: So, did, did you, did, so then, the U.S. allies, you know, were involved in this and I think (unclear) in terms of sanctioning South Africa?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The Europeans were way ahead of us on this.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that became a part of my work as well.  And I think it was in 1986, as a matter of fact, that--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: --this, that this happened.  Where part of my job was to actually go to the Council [of Europe] meetings, EU [European Union] council meetings but remain outside in the press, I couldn't sit in on the meetings, had to remain outside with the press.  Not to ask questions but to listen.  And there was intense interest on the part of the White House at that point because of the action in Congress, where the White House wanted to kind of stay ahead of the game or at least keep up, so what the White House wanted from me was a report right on the spot on what the European decisions were on sanctions, so that they then could come as close as they could in the Executive Branch to the Europeans in order to be able to take the position, "We and the Europeans together are doing X, Y, and Z," and to try to do that before the Congress went, I suppose, too far in the view of the Reagan administration towards whatever they were going to do on sanctions.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And it was interesting to see that interplay, you know, come to the fore.  Very interesting to see.  It was a kind of one-upmanship going on between the, the Executive Branch and the Congress on those issues.
Speaker 1: International embarrassment played, does play, plays a major role in a lot of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --civil rights issues around the world.
Speaker 2: Yeah, very much so.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: And, and we use that from time to time to embarrass regimes that we think are oppressive in that regard.
Speaker 1: And it's been used against us.
Speaker 2: Sure, and why not?  If we're, if we're, you know, if we're not doing what we say we intend to do, why not?
Story_ID: 113919
Speaker 1: Okay 1993 there's a new [presidential] administration, Bill Clinton's in office and you're in a new assignment I get, well, in, in '94 [1994] you go to Budapest [Hungary], right?  (Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Again.
Speaker 1: Again.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And this time as Deputy Chief of Mission?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're there for three years?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now, what were the issues in Budapest at that point?
Speaker 2: The biggest issue was transitioning, completing really, the transition of the Hungarian economy and body politic, to democracy and market economy.  We had a huge aid component in Hungary at the time to help with exactly that, developing banking regulations, developing--helping the Hungarians develop a stock market, you know, developing fact-based journalism, trying, developing a police force that was responsible to the people as opposed to exploiting the people, you know.  Smash--smash the tail light and then charge someone for having a broken tail light.  There was so much of this old Communist behavior that needed to be changed, and we worked very carefully, very systematically and cooperatively with the Hungarian government, through AID [U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)] and NGOs [Nongovernmental Organizations] and retired experts from the Treasury Department [U.S. Department of the Treasury] to try to help them complete that transition.  That by far was the biggest, you know, the biggest challenge and the biggest effort.
Story_ID: 113920
Speaker 1: Budapest, Hungary.  We were talking about the transition--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --of the Hungarian economy.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And they did quite well at the time.  Some enormous percentage of the American investment coming into eastern, all of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union [sic] at the time, or Russia at the time, Russian Federation at the time, was going to Hungary because the transitions that they made were very deep and very real.  Where in some other countries some of the transition basically involved transfers of state-owned assets to cronies--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --you know, with no real deep change in the way the firm was managed and products were distributed and, and so on.  Very different experience in Hungary, lots of money coming in, and at one point I think towards the end of my tour there in '97 [1997], they had one of the best performing stock markets in the world.  Things have changed since then though.  The other major effort was to prepare Hungary for accession to NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization], which given that the criteria for NATO membership and for EU [European Union] criteria are so similar, it also meant that they were clearing themselves for membership in the EU.  So we worked very hard on that.  I headed up an interagency team from the [U.S.] embassy that met, I think maybe once a month with a Hungarian counterpart team to talk about, you know, what had been accomplished since our last meeting and what more is to go, to be accomplished in order to move them closer towards NATO membership.  And one of the great satisfactions that I had was when I left Hungary, and I left the day after they had been invited by a NATO summit to join NATO.  And that was a tremendously good feeling.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause you just knew that their world was changing dramatically.
Speaker 1: Now, you managed two visits to Hungary by President [Bill] Clinton?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And a separate visit, some visits by the First Lady--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Hillary Clinton.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And a separate visit by the secretary of, of Defense and other-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --high U.S. officials.
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: That was a time, because Hungary was doing so many things that were successful and really making very substantial changes in the direction that we thought was the right one, it was appropriate that they be recognized.  And one of the key ways you can do that is through high-level visits.  It's encouragement to keep going, keep moving, keep moving forward.  And it, it worked.  It worked.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were generally the supervisor of section chiefs and heads of nine U.S. government agencies and organizations assigned to the embassy, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the DCM, the Deputy Chief of Mission, is in effect the CEO of the embassy, the alter ego for the ambassador, and the, the person who is responsible operationally for all substantive matters of every agency there.  And, and also for all operational matters including budget and, you know, logistics and transportation and so forth and so on.  That's the go-to person to get things done.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 113921
Speaker 1: So in '97 [1997] you were back in the U.S. as a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And who was Secretary of State at that point now?
Speaker 2: That was Madeleine Albright.
Speaker 1: Madeleine Albright, right.
Speaker 2: And the Assistant Secretary [of State for European Affairs] was Marc Grossman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so you're back in the States after you had been away for what?
Speaker 2: Three years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And now, so you're, you're back in, well what were, were the issues in that office at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, let me, let me mention that that was the first time any person of color had ever been assigned to that position.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Second point I want to make is that since then there has not been a single person of color assigned to that position.  In terms of the responsibilities, mine were first and foremost to manage the bilateral relations, the country-to-country relations with about twenty-five European countries, including the major powers of Europe.  The multilateral relations were handled by another Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs.  So it was a huge portfolio, a very busy portfolio, a very demanding portfolio, very long hours, a lot of travel.  And the issues ranged from economic issues, if you will, relations with the Soviet Union [sic], questions of access for American companies to European markets, the whole issue of freedom of religion, where in some cases some groups were considered by, let's say European governments to be, not real religions like the Scientologists for example.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: They saw, the Europeans in some countries tend to see them as organizations that just want to advantage of tax laws.
Speaker 1: Yes, I, I think the French tried to ban the Scientologists.
Speaker 2: That's quite possible.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's quite possible, oh, yeah.  And, of course, the Americans are gonna come to the State Department to ask that the government do what it can to protect freedom of religion for members of their groups.  There were also questions of [military] basing issues.  Particularly with Spain where we might have wanted to expand capabilities to be able to conduct operations, you know, in closer to the Middle East.  There were also questions of base closings.  There were questions of the conduct of some of our troops.  There were cases, there was one case [1998 Cavalese cable car disaster] at least in Rome where, not in Rome but in, I think in Italy, where some of our pilots in training for whatever reason, decided that they wanted to kind of go hot-dogging and so they flew at high speeds, low altitudes under a ski lift and the tail snagged the cable and people died, you know.  So there are all sorts of issues like this that, you know, that, that came up that we had to deal with.
Speaker 1: And that's a heck of an issue, that's gee.
Speaker 2: Oh, my, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, who has jurisdiction and--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --you know, even if their tried in the military court and the sentence is thought by the local population not to have been severe enough, it just goes on and on and on.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I don't, do you remember how that was resolved?
Speaker 2: I, I don't.  No, no, I don't.
Speaker 1: That's a sticky one.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now had the, now this is, have we talked about the [1992-1995] war in Bosnia?
Speaker 2: We hadn't.  I wasn't involved with that.  There was another Deputy Assistant Secretary who worked full time on that.  And the countries that I worked with, we didn't really, we didn't really have active wars.  There were occasional upsets, if you will, where Greece and Turkey were in my portfolio, for example, where Turkish pilots might come too close to Greek fighter aircraft in disputed air space, you know, where there might been, there might have been overlapping claims, you know, these kinds of things would, would come to my attention but I, I didn't really work on the Bosnia War.
Story_ID: 113922
Speaker 1: So in 2001, you are the Special Negotiator for Agricultural Biotechnology?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now, that this seems like a departure from what, from the track that you were on for some reason to me but explain how, yeah.
Speaker 2: How that came about?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I had finished my four years as [U.S.] Deputy Assistant Secretary [of State for European Affairs] and was actually quite tired and I didn't have time to really think about an onward assignment, and so I didn't really spend time looking for one.  I just wanted to rest.  And so I took six weeks off and went home and my intention, quite frankly, was to grow basil, make pesto, and read comic books.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)
Speaker 2: And as I was resting, the Assistant Secretary [of State] for Economic and Business Affairs called and said that he'd really like me to work on a biotechnology issue, namely to try to get governments around the world, (unclear) around the world, to work with us to establish scientific criteria for approaching the whole question of agricultural biotechnology that would facilitate international study of these, of the issues surrounding this, and that would set up the basis for scientific evaluation of bio, agricultural biotechnology products meaning GMO [genetically-modified organisms] products, if you will.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: That would help facilitate the trade in these products on the basis of the science.  And at the time, the Europeans were reacting somewhat emotionally and frankly irresponsibly on this matter.  They had had so many problems with, with food issues, you know, what with contaminated Coca-Cola, what with mad cow disease, you know, hoof-and-mouth disease, contaminated wine, on and on and on, and contaminated blood, you know.  And these cases were not handled all that well, but they were politically sensitive, and so when it came to GMO foods, the reaction on the part of leaders in Europe was to shut them out and ban them, period, rather than to try to explain to their, their populations that here's what we know about these foods, here's what we don't know, here's what we still need to learn and here are the mechanisms we're going to set up to try to assess on the basis of science whether or not these will be, these foods will be allowed on the market.  A very different approach than the emotional approach.  Very different approach from what we do in the United States where we have the, the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] evaluating.  We also have the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] evaluating.  And we have Afis [sic], the agricultural, plant--Food Safety Inspection Service [FSIS].
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Evaluating.  Any one of these three turns in a negative report, that product doesn't get to market.  When all three do [sic], then there's no reason not to, you know, put the food on the market.  Okay, my job was to try to get agreement to approach internationally these questions on the basis of science.  So the first thing I did was to say to the Assistant Secretary, "I need some time to learn about this issue, particularly the science and who are the, who are the stakeholders and what issues they have.  Once I take a month to do that, then I'd be happy to go and try to, to, to bring this about, but I don't wanna waste time talking to the Europeans.  I'd rather go to countries that we know have an interest but maybe not the science base to be able to make judgments for societies."  So I deliberately chose to spend time working with the Canadians, the Mexicans, the Indians, the Indonesians, the Malaysians, the Thais, the Egyptians, and the Kenyans, and the South Africans, and traveled and talked, and there was pretty wide spread agreement on how to proceed on the basis of science.  I didn't get very far in that work because I got another phone call from the Deputy Secretary saying that he and the Secretary had been talking with the White House and they'd like me to be the next ambassador to Iceland, what did I think about that.  Well I hadn't really thought about it (laughter) but, you know, I, I asked if I could talk with my wife and, 'cause we had schooling concerns and her career and all that.  And, and we decided as a family that, that I should accept that and that I would go by myself, and my family would stay behind.  So the Agricultural Biotechnology job came to a close because I had to start preparing for the ambassadorship.
Story_ID: 113923
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, once again you had to be, you had to go to a training and learn how to--now what language, I guess, I, well what do they call the language of Iceland?
Speaker 2: Icelandic.
Speaker 1: Icelandic.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: More difficult than Hungarian.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Which is more difficult than Chinese.
Speaker 1: Now this is a Scandinavian language?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: It, well, yes it is.  It's, it's based on old Norse.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And in written form you can recognize a lot of Icelandic in Old Norse manuscripts--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --but in spoken form, if you spoke Icelandic to a Norwegian, there's no, there would be no communication.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause Iceland was settled by the Norsemen back in the Middle Ages; right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, around 8-something actually.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was a long time ago.
Speaker 2: Long time ago.  And, and they remain pretty isolated and the, the language didn't really evolve in the way that Norse, Norwegian did, you know.  So, but it really doesn't matter because they all speak American English better than we do.  There's no British accents, an American accent.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: They use the language better than we do.
Speaker 1: How, how, can, well, well how so?
Speaker 2: By choice.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: You know, they, unlike the French who kind of really exalt their culture--and there's good reason for them to do it--the Icelanders take what they wish, that is useful for them, anywhere that they can get it, in any part of the world.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And they choose to speak English the way that the Americans do.  Yes, we did have a big military presence there since the war but that wasn't really the dominant influence, it was television, it was--you know, schooling because--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --many of them came to the state-, most people who have higher degrees got them in the U.S.  Some in Britain but mostly in the U.S.  And a lot of their interactions in business and in the sciences, certainly the arts, are with Americans in American English or, excuse me, with others around the world like the Japanese, who speak English.  So, you know, among themselves and for most of their internal affairs they will use Icelandic but English to them, they can operate in it as well as we can, if not better.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That interesting, I, I didn't realize that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 113924
Speaker 1: And so, what was, I had read that the strategic importance of Iceland had sort of diminished after the breakup of the Soviet Union, is that true or is that?
Speaker 2: That is the impression that a lot of strategic analyses, a lot of strategic analysts would have that because they are no longer Soviet submarines or even Russian submarines, coming out of, into the North Atlantic, either towards the U.S. or, you know, around towards NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] countries, there's no need to track them anymore, therefore there's no need to have a big presence there.  And because the Russian military is not seen as being aggressive and, and kind of poised against the United States and the rest of NATO, there's a question among strategic analysts in the U.S. as to why would we have a presence in Iceland anyway?  The Icelanders look at it somewhat differently.  That is that they are a NATO country, they have no defense department, no defense forces, no military forces.  NATO is their defense and the U.S. has a treaty arrangement with the Icelanders to where they are the military protectors of Iceland on behalf of NATO.  And the Icelanders have felt that a military presence on the island is far better, far more effective than a remote capability from Scotland or from the United States to come to Iceland's defense, if that defense is needed.  They are not comfortable with that.  They were not comfortable with that.  So one of the big issues, I spent an enormous amount of time on, was what should be the structure of the American treaty defense commitment with Iceland?  And the central issue revolved around the presence of U.S. forces on Iceland, which the Icelanders wanted, which the U.S. slowly came to the conclusion was not necessary, and therein was the issue.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: A lot negotiations went on, on that issue.  It appeared that at one point, at the point where I was about to leave, we were moving towards having the Icelanders share more of the costs of the American presence there, while moving out some capabilities that were needed in other parts of the European theater, like the combat search and rescue helicopters, there were five of 'em there.  And that's the only place where they were located in all of the European command area which extended from the North Atlantic all the way down to the tip of South Africa and, you know, almost from, from Greenland over into a good part of, of, of Europe.  But there was no reason to have those helicopters there when there were so many needs for them in other parts of the European theater.  So, anyway, at the time that I left that was kind of where the discussion was focused, reducing the costs, taking away the urgently needed military capacity--capabilities, if you will.  And at some point after I left, Secretary [of Defense Donald] Rumsfeld apparently zeroed out the budget for military presence in Iceland which made everything else moot (laughter), you know.  And so the base had to close and the forces had to depart.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: There is no military presence there now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As I understand it--and I have not kept up with this, so I'm not, you know, absolutely current--but as I understand it, there is a kind of a rotating fighter presence from NATO countries that comes in and, and goes out from time to time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the commitment, the defense commitment is intact.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: How you do it, is, is what's different now.
Story_ID: 113925
Speaker 1: Now, what sort of stories do you have about Iceland, you know, (unclear) I almost think that'd be the last place I'd send a, a black ambassador to Iceland but, you know, that but, but I don't know a lot about Iceland, so (unclear)
Speaker 2: Well, I don't really have a lot of stories about Iceland.  I don't know what, what went into the conclusion by our leadership in the State Department [U.S. Department of State] that I should go.  I certainly had no problem with, with going.  It was perfectly fine with me, and, and it was a wonderful assignment.  And I was certainly honored to have been considered for, for that post.  It's not very often that a career person gets an assignment in a modern, advanced, and developed European country.  Usually it's a political appointee who will get it.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So I, I certainly felt privileged.  There are lots of stories that at some point around World War II and maybe afterwards that the Icelanders did not want people of color, particularly blacks, to be among the U.S. military forces in Iceland.  I couldn't find anybody who would confirm that, at least among Icelanders today.  Maybe, maybe they're embarrassed by it, maybe it's not true, I have no basis of judging, but I did hear that, you know.  And I did meet one of the Tuskegee Airmen who was invited back to be the keynote speaker on Air Force Day at the base in Iceland.  And he was sitting next to me and at dinner and he sort of said, "You know, when they invited me to come here, my first question was are they gone let me off the airplane" (laughter).  And he told me about what he had heard about the Icelanders preferences that no people of color land, come to Iceland.  That's not what you hear today.  Icelanders both in the government and in society will say that their objective is to have a multiethnic, multicultural society.  And they will talk about the ways in which they are making that happen for people who come to Iceland from East Asia, from Africa, from Eastern Europe, you know, Latin America, in some cases.  The first thing they want to do is to make sure that they get language training.  The next thing they wanna do is to make sure that they get a college education.  And, and they want and they have, you know, government offices setup to deal, or to address questions on a voluntary basis of the appreciation of cultures from different parts of the world.  There are private efforts along these lines as well, and not just in Reykjavik [Iceland], the capital, but in different places.  And I asked both the government people and the private folks who are working in this, why do you do this?  And they said well, the answer is very simple to that question.  It's because we don't wanna get to the point where you are in the [United] States.  Where we have racial problems.  We want everybody to be contributing productively to this society and enjoying the benefits of this society.  So we provide them the tools to be able to do so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's something that, it's hard for a lot of the politicians here to understand.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They don't want the problems that we've had.
Story_ID: 113926
Speaker 1: Now, so, any more reflections on your tour as ambassador with Iceland?  Now, well, let me ask this question though, now, when you're, you have been ambassador somewhere it affords you a status, right, in the U.S., I guess, in, in terms of, I mean you're, you're a, you're a former ambassador forever--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) basically.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But I mean it, there are no special privileges that come with that.  I mean you gotta pay your parking tickets and you gotta pay your taxes and so on but it is an honor to be able to use the title for life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a very special honor, a very special privilege to be able to serve the United States in that capacity overseas.  But it also brings with it a lot of responsibilities, you know, or at least in, in my view, and that is, even when you retire, you have an obligation to still try to contribute to advancing American interests even though you're not working for the State Department [U.S. Department of State] anymore.  And there are thousands of ways in which to do that.
Story_ID: 113927
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you, basically left Foreign Service after that [2005], right? 'Cause I guess, is, is a--
Speaker 2: No.  My last Foreign Service assignment was first as faculty advisor at the National War College [National Defense University, Washington, D.C.] where I basically joined the faculty and taught in the set series of courses the, the students who would come to the War College.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And these are, you know, colonel- and captain-level people in the military and their equivalents in the civilian government agencies.  In my second year at the War College, I was selected to be the Deputy Commandant and International Affairs Advisor.  That's a tradition that goes back to 1946 when the War College was first established to address questions of, of grand strategy, pulling together all of the capabilities of the U.S. government in a coordinated and coherent fashion to address the national security challenges before us.  And when it was started in 1946 there was a two-star general who was the commandant, and the Foreign Service equivalent [Minister Counselor] as the Deputy Commandant.  And that first Deputy Commandant was George [F.] Kennan--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --you know.  And it is said that it was in his office at the National War College that he worked on the 'Mr. X Papers' that fundamentally was the design for the containment policy for the Soviet Union until the Soviet Union fell apart.  So a tradition of Foreign Service officers serving there as the Deputy Commandant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was, when I walked into that office in the morning, a certain chill went through my spine, you know, the sense of history went through, went through my, went through my mind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you in this office, you, you know, taught strategic thought and basically to American military leaders and, and to foreign military leaders; right?
Speaker 2: And U.S. government agency colonel equivalents--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --who were just about at the threshold to cross into the, the senior service if they were civilian or into the rank of Brigadier General or Admiral, if they were in the, in the military.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And yes.  And there was a set series of courses, that were the core curriculum, and everybody took strategic thought for two or three weeks and then the nature, conduct, and character of war for two or three, for six weeks, and then security, national security decision making in the global security arena, and a whole, a set series of courses all 230 something odd students would do those courses in that sequence.  And, and then that group would break down into smaller classes to go further into the readings and the lectures and, and discuss issues.  And then there were a series of elective courses in the afternoon.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is, the existence of this on some level seems encouraging that there's a some sort of, well there seems to be a nonpartisan, you know, in terms of political partisanship training that military people get about, you know, how the world is organized?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's completely nonpartisan.  And the objective there is, first of all, as a commissioned officer in the military or in the federal civilian service, you are restricted from any partisan behavior.  No matter what your private association or affiliation might be.  Your job is to provide the best professional advise you can to the President of the United States, no matter whether that president is a Republican or a Democrat.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: So yeah, that's fully within that context.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 113928
Speaker 1: So, all right.  So any stories from your position as Deputy Commandant [of the National War College, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: It was a fascinating position to hold.  First because my boss at that time, General [Teresa] Marne Peterson, was one of the first ladies to graduate from the [U.S.] Air Force Academy's pilot training.  And she commanded a tanker, I'm, sorry, a transport squadron in Saudi [Arabia] during the first Gulf War.  And I think a transport, a transport squadron at, at other times in, in her career.  Just a fascinating leader.  Very decisive.  I learned a lot from her and I worked very well with her.  And until today we're both retired now, and we're still very, very good friends, you know.  Secondly, because of the people who came through as guest lecturers, you know, colonel, well, General [HM Colin] Powell, Secretary of State Powell, [general and news commentator] Barry McCaffrey, and certainly [Congressman] Newt Gingrich [R-Georgia], (laughter) Tom freeden-[journalist Thomas] Friedman.  Just a, a bunch of really stellar thinkers.  Controversial authors, if you will, to give lectures that were not necessarily in line with whatever administration was in at the time.  They gave their own thoughts.  And the whole idea was to present these thoughts in the open forum to be debated, tested, contested, if you will, as a part of the learning experience. When General Powell was there, he made a comment that was very instructive to the students.  He said, "You know, when I was a student here sitting in that top row up there, fast asleep most of the time, if anybody had ever told me at that time that I was going to be, you know, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Security Advisor to the president, and the Secretary of State, I would have laughed in their face.  The likelihood of that was so remote.  I wouldn't even think about it.  It was not on my horizon."  And he said, "Because you were chosen to be here, you know, is, is a comment on the expectations in your career.  You have no idea what you're going to be doing in ten or twenty years, so prepare yourselves now to lead."  I thought that was one of the most fascinating commentaries I ever heard from someone who's held in such high esteem.  And I could literally see him as a colonel, kind of bored and sleeping, (laughter) and not knowing how his future was going to unfold.  And when he said that I kind of looked around the room and just kind of wondering to myself where these really talented people are going to be in five or ten or twenty years.  I had a whole bunch of folks who came through whose names are household words, you know.  [National Security Advisor to Barack Obama] General Jim [L.] Jones, you know, and a whole string of military leaders, not to mention State Department [U.S. Department of State] people who have been students at the National War College, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were there two years?
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: Two years.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 113929
Speaker 1: I guess your last, last assignment was, was with the U.S. State Department, right, with the--
Speaker 2: Well, after the [National] War College [Washington, D.C.], I retired.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In September 2000, September 29, 2007.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) okay, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Resume backwards that I'm (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.
Speaker 1: --I'm giving, that's why I, I'm, you know, I'm baffling myself.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  However--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --at my retirement party, the young man who was the number two in the European Bureau [U.S. Department of State Bureau of European Affairs] where I spent virtually all of my career except for Taiwan, and this young man was my political military officer in Budapest [Hungary] when we were working on the NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] accession for Hungary.  As the number two in the bureau and a friend, he came over to me at retirement party and asked me what are my plans from here on.  And so I said, "I've been overworked, underpaid for a very long time; I have no plans and I don't want any plans."  And he shook his head and he said, "Is that your plan until Christmas?"  And I said, "Yes it is.  Why are you asking?"  So he said, "Because we need you in New York [New York] to be our Senior Advisor on European Affairs in our mission to the EU [European Union].  We need to twist the arms of some, some of our European friends to get them to get go along with some things that we really wanna get done and we want you to do it."  I said, "Oh, when do you want me to do this?"  And he said, "Two weeks ago."  So I was rehired the Monday after that Friday.  And the Tuesday after that my wife was depositing me in a, in an apartment in New York, and I spent three months there at the U.S. Mission to the UN [United Nations].
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And then retired again (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now while, while at the UN you, let's see, you lobbied European ambassadors for UN support for the U.S. positions on priority UN General Assembly, right?
Speaker 2: Resolutions.
Speaker 1: And I (unclear) one was the result of, or result of that the adoption of Human Rights Resolutions on Iran, Burma, Belarus, and North Korea.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And a resolution condemning rape as an instrument to achieve military and political objective.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Which is, that's sound like a, it's really high sounding thing but did, did, how does it, I suppose that everybody would agree to say that--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --you know, was there any mechanism to enforce it isn't working?
Speaker 2: That's always the key with UN resolutions.  No, there is no mechanism to enforce.  There are no troops that are gonna go in, there are no international police forces that are gonna go in.  The expectation is that when a country's leadership signs on to one of these resolutions as a UN member, that they will feel the weight of the moral obligation to uphold those resolutions, and that they will themselves do what's necessary within their political systems to enforce them.  Now can we prove that this is being done?  No.  We can only expect that the moral weight of their commitment to that resolution as a UN member will cause them to act in the right way.
Story_ID: 113930
Speaker 1: Now did you have any interaction with the World Court [International Court of Justice (ICJ)]--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --I guess in your--
Speaker 2: I did not, no, no.
Speaker 1: I think the U.S. opted out, then, then the U.S. kind of opted on dealing with it, right, you know?
Speaker 2: Yes, it did.  And there's little attention paid to the reasons why.  We are called upon frequently as kind of the, probably one of the, the few countries with the capabilities to intervene where necessary for a humanitarian situation or for a crisis where there is evidence of genocide or some other very horrible activity taking place.  There's no one else that has the capabilities that we do.  If we're called upon to do these kinds of things and we do them, and other countries under the World Court believes that we were acting in violation of, you know, international rules and principles and so on, and if they feel that they should exercise their right to arrest American soldiers who may be passing through or vacationing in their countries, the problem for us is that they would then be subjected to a judicial process that has less provisions for their protection than would the judicial process in the United States.  There is no appeal process.  Our Congress would never agree to put our military folks or our civilian officials in that kind of a situation.  Would never agree to it.  There is no way that our Congress is going to agree to subject our citizens to judicial process that is less protective of our citizens' rights than the American judicial process.  It's not going to happen.  Either there are going to be changes to make the systems equivalent so that there is the same protection that an American would have under the international system as in the U.S. or we're not gonna sign on it.  And, and we're not going to--if we're going to be the key force acting in these kinds of situations, we're not going to take the risk that those who act in that situation will then be arbitrarily brought into a World Court process by, by countries or individuals or organizations that may have other objectives in mind.

Speaker 1: Princeton University [Princeton, New Jersey], 2008.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Now how is this, I mean I don't, I can see where Princeton would want you (laughter) but well, how, how did this happen?  Why didn't you go to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or some other place?
Speaker 2: Well, I was invited to Princeton to give a lecture, and by the way, I was a student at the Woodrow Wilson School [of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University], '84 [1984] to '85 [1985], and so they, they know me.  And I was invited back from time to time to give a lecture.  In 2008 I was invited to give a lecture and I did it on U.S.-European relations.  And there were some good questions, really good questions, I mean a good kind of back-and-forth on some of the issues.  After the lecture, a young man came up to me and asked if we could, if we could talk for a little bit.  I said sure.  And so the, one of the assistant deans who invited me followed.  And we went to an office and, and we were talking, and I was thinking to myself, boy students really live well these days.  And after we talked for a bit, he said, "You know, we from time to time invite retired ambassadors to come to Princeton for a year to teach a course, to do some public speaking, and to be a resource to students interested in international affairs.  Is this something that would be of interest to you?"  Well, I said, "Well, yes I think it would.  How do I apply?"  And then he laughed and said, "No, no, no we, we're recruiting you" (laughter).  So then I realized he was offering me a job and that he was not a student, he was the acting dean of the Woodrow Wilson School but he looked so young, you know, I thought that I didn't realize who he was.  So I accepted that job and it was a one year appointment.  Taught courses on U.S. European relations.  And at the end of that year, I was invited to stay for a second year.  And at the end of the second year, I was invited to stay for a third year.  The dean just sort of said, "We don't want you to go."  So but the third year was the limit for a non-tenured faculty member.  However, in the summers I've been teaching courses in the Junior Summer Institute, bringing kids from underrepresented groups and areas to Princeton for intensive economics, quantitative analyses, and a policy workshop, either with a foreign relations focus, or a domestic focus and I've done them on, on foreign policy issues.  And they've invited me to come back again this summer and I've agreed to do it, so that's the connection with Princeton.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, do you think you'll, do you wanna teach, do more teaching or--
Speaker 2: Aside from Princeton?
Speaker 1: --anywhere else (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: No, not at this point.  I'm really happy working with the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation now, trying to interest kids from underrepresented areas to join the Foreign Service and to take advantage of some of the fellowship opportunities that will allow them to work towards a master's degree with internships included that will open up a path for them for a career in the Foreign Service.  I, I like that very much.  I like seeing the kids realize that there are opportunities that they haven't even thought about that are open to them.  And that they can do this.  They can do it.  That's the fascinating thing for me now, is getting them to see what I saw years and years ago when someone just pointed the way a little bit, the way that I didn't see.  So I wanna do that.  I'll continue teaching the summer program as long as they would like me to do it but I don't think I wanna teach full-time anymore.  I really wanna work on the, you know, the motivating side of things.
Story_ID: 113932
Speaker 1: Now have, I know you've, you've done some writing but are you considering writing a book?
Speaker 2: There is tremendous pressure on me from my family, from friends, my college roommates, whose opinions I really respect.  And believe it or not, my Euro pals.  My, my friends in Europe and former, you know, counterparts and so on, they want me to write my story, you know.  But I just, I'm not ready yet.  I wanna do a little, a few more things and then take the time out and try to do that.  But I am thinking about it.  I'm really thinking about it.
Speaker 1: Now, if you look back at your career and in Foreign Service, is there any major thing that you would do differently, if you could?
Speaker 2: I think I probably would have gone to at least one developing country to live and work.  It was completely, if I had tried to design the career that I had, it would never work.  It's just circumstance and what I happened to know that nobody else did at the time that was needed at the place where I went.  But I think I would have wanted to do a developing country at some point in the career to kind of balance things out, to balance my own perspectives out, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that's about the only thing.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And likewise if you look back at everything, what today would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: I hadn't really thought about that (laughter).  I suppose motivating young folks to step beyond what they see as their immediate limits.  And I'm told that I've inspired a lot of people to do a lot of things.  Like this young lady who sort of said, you know, "I remember what you told me."  When we were in Budapest [Hungary] the second time and the First Lady was coming through, I chose a junior officer to be her control officer, you know, to plan out the visit, and I always let him know that I would be there to back him up if he needed my advice and I gave him some guiding points, but I wanted him to do it.  Well as it turns out, they developed quite a good relationship, and at one point, you know, she threw a cap and a jacket on him and they went out on a walk all by themselves, you know, and there are no guards, no anything, and she was in disguise and whatever, and they just talked.  And this young man came back and thanked me so much for assigning him to do this, and he explained to me what happened and he said, "I just, I spent a whole afternoon with the First Lady of the United States and I'm a junior officer and she was just talking to me like a, another person."  I says, "Well, you are another person."  And he said, "You cannot imagine what this has done to, for me," you know.  Anyway years went by, he's now a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Affairs, and every once in a while I get a note from him and sort of saying, "If you hadn't trusted me to do that job, I don't think I would ever have been as confident as I am now that I can do much, much more than I've actually done," you know.  So, I, I think if there is a legacy and this is what I hear from people, maybe it's inspiring young people to reach that extra step, beyond what they think they can do.
Story_ID: 113933
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, we always ask this question, too.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I'd say there are two.  The first is, we've got to energize ourselves and start thinking that we're gonna take charge of our lives and stop feeling that we are under the boulder of the legacy of slavery.  While that may be a fact, we need to do something about it.  We need to act and move that boulder.  We need to do more.  We need to get more energy.  We need to start thinking more sharply, thinking more strategically about how to get that boulder out of the way, or if we can't get it out of the way, how to walk over it, or if we can't walk over it, then how to walk around it.  Second thing I would want to see, is for African Americans to see themselves as having as much right as anybody else in this country or as much right as anybody else on the planet, to not only have a say about what happens in global affairs because everything that happens in global affairs affects their lives, but to come to the realization that they can take leadership to act on what happens in global affairs just as much as anybody else, anywhere in the country, and anywhere on the planet can do so.  We need to take charge.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell us something about, now, now you have children right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 117279
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us about your children.
Speaker 2: I have two, we have two sons.  One is thirty-two, the other is twenty-eight.  The older graduated from Brandeis [University, Waltham, Massachusetts] in 2003.  And then the other graduated from Elmira College [Elmira, New York] in 2007.  The older is interested in international business, marketing.  And he's now working with a, an international investment holding company with an office in Bethesda [Maryland] near our home, and wants to go back to business school to, to prepare to go into a career in international marketing.  Needless to say, the economy right now is not offering a lot of opportunities, and he was working for the corporate executive board until they folded the division that was doing best practices studies which is what he was working on.  Our younger son is a stage actor, by preference drama, but he also does music, he does dance.  And he did a lot of performances in Washington [D.C.] before he went to college at the Source Theatre and at American University [Washington, D.C.] and I think at the Studio Theatre as well.  And I've never seen this young man pick up a script or rehearse a score but when he walks on the stage, he commands it.  And he's had lead roles, both in plays that were not school plays, he was in 'Quilt,' he was in 'Pippin,' he was in 'Wait Until Dark,' he was in, I think it's called 'Rashomon,' 'Othello,' just a long list of, of plays both in school and out of school.  And he never told us anything about what he was going to do or, or what have you.  We were always surprised at the performance, you know.  Just, and my wife and I would look at one another and say, "Did you know he could do that?" (laughter) you know.  Anyway, very difficult after 2007 to find work in stage productions, so he and some friends organized a rock band and he's the lead singer in the rock band that performs around town in Washington and for private parties.  And he works for a lighting company that keeps him involved at least in stage technology, and they do the lighting for big exhibitions or banquets or what have you around the Washington area, yeah.  But he wants to get back to stage and then wants to go back to grad school in theater arts to do a master's [degree].
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: That's what they're doing.  They're both living at home with us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there anything I need to ask you about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Can't think of anything.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as someone who helped.  And in particular who helped young people to think beyond their horizons that they see.  'Cause in my view, when you see a horizon and you move towards it, when you get to it, there's another one.  It changes.  That's how I would like to be remembered.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.

Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Go ahead and tell us about that photograph?
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's my college graduation picture in 1970.
Speaker 1: Here he comes with our portable scanner here.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: That's my first Foreign Service assignment 1974 to '76 [1976] at the U.S. Trade Center in Taipei, that's it.
Speaker 2: It seems to be the same here.
Speaker 1: It's the same one, yeah.
Speaker 2: We'll go on to this one.  And this is a--
Speaker 1: Yeah, also at the Trade Center in Taipei, '74 [1974] to '76 [1976].
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear)
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: That's at our home in Budapest, Hungary, 1977 to '79 [1979].  And on the left is the actor Moses Gunn--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: --who was in Budapest shooting a picture with Stacy Keach at the time.  And the gentleman standing up in the middle is a Danish diplomat, my counterpart commercial officer at the Danish embassy.  And seated on the left in the red is Carl Seclinski (ph.), who was the head of the Marine security guard at the embassy.  And sitting next to him is the wife of the gentleman standing up, the Danish diplomat.  And, and then sitting near my left arm is a young lady who was visiting from Denmark, a friend of the Danish couple.
Speaker 1: That is the Christmas party at embassy Budapest in 1977.  And I'm playing Santa Claus and there are American embassy staff and their children and Hungarian staff who work at the embassy.  Now the nice story behind this picture that was another lesson learned for me about assumptions is after I had finished my Santa Claus duties, I went upstairs and changed clothes, came back down to join the party and a little kid with big round glasses came up to me with a very determined look on his face and he said to me, "You're Santa Claus, and I know it."
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  (Laughter)
Speaker 1: So I said, "Well, how do you know that?"  And I was expecting one answer and his response was, "Because Santa Claus was wearing glasses and you're wearing glasses too."
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  (Laughter)
Speaker 1: And after he made his declaration he walked away.  That was fascinating.
Speaker 2: This is a [U.S.] Marine Corps ball in Paris at one of the hotels and some of our colleagues from the embassies seated around the table for dinner.
Speaker 1: That's a different Marine Corps ball.  I think this was in, in Budapest in the '90's [1990s], as a matter of fact.
Speaker 2: This is in our library at home after my swearing in earlier in the day, my wife invited a number of people for dinner.  To the right is, at that time, the House Majority Whip Congressman [HM] James Clyburn from Charleston, South Carolina.  And in the middle is Ms. Joyce Houston Moore (ph.), my physics teacher from high school in Charleston.
Speaker 1: This is a joint meeting of selected students from the National War College [Washington, D.C.], meeting with their counterparts at the French Military School of Advanced Studies [Institut des hautes etudes de defense nationale] in Paris [France] in 2007.
Speaker 2: And while at the Military School, Ecole nationale d'administration [sic, ENA is a civil service academy] it's called, I had to do a little bit of work and asked for a place where I could kind of sit and do it, and I was taken to this office and that desk, and I was kind of taken back at the office and at the view and I asked, "What is this?"  And the commander, the commandant of the school who was taking me there said, "This is Napoleon Bonaparte's office."
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And that is his desk.  That's a view of the Champs-Elysees looking out, and the Eiffel Tower, of course, was not there at the time that Napoleon was sitting at that desk but the Champs-Elysees certainly was.
Speaker 1: There, that's 2007.  I took one of my War College classes to Romania and we were there at the Romanian Foreign Ministry.
Speaker 2: Those are our sons, James on the right and Jonathan on the left, we're standing, or they're standing in front of the, or on the side of the Martin Luther King monument in Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: This was taken at the installment of Majority Whip [HM James] Clyburn's ceremony when he took that office, and he asked me to be the keynote speaker there and, of course, I agreed.  And behind him is his picture of the Corsairs, our high school group which he feels was his greatest achievement in his life.  And on the right is Ralph Dawson, one of the young men who was also a member of the Corsairs Club.  Congressman Clyburn was our advisor in high school.
Speaker 2: That is January 2008 in Machu Picchu, Peru.  I had promised my wife that we would be on honeymoon until I could take her to Peru, and thirty-something-odd years later, we actually got to Machu Picchu as I had promised her.
