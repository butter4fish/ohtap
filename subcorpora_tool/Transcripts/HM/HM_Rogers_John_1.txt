Story_ID: 12517
Speaker 1: My father [Hon. John W. Rogers, Sr.] was born in 1918 in Knoxville, Tennessee.  His father was a barber, and my parents--my father's parents [John W. Rogers and Mary Turner] had both passed away by the time he was twelve.  So he moved to Chicago [Illinois] to live with kindly uncle [Henry Tanner].  And that's how we ended up being here in Chicago.
Speaker 2: And did he ever share with you about his growing up, anything else more about his growing up?  Or was there any messaging that your father was sort of big on, John, that you remember?
Speaker 1: Well, he grew up in a very difficult time.  He grew up in the Depression.  Family didn't have a lot of money.  And he was able to be able to go off to World War II and become a fighter pilot there and be able to go to law school on the GI Bill.  So he really constantly reinforced over time how, tough life had been for him growing up and how he had had to really make his own way.  And that was one of the things that he talked a lot about.  He also talked about the values of being truthful, telling the truth all the time and always living up to your commitments, were some of the values that he, that were instilled in him as he was growing up.  And let's talk about your mother.
Speaker 2: Can you give her name and what you know about her family and her background?
Speaker 1: My mother's name is Jewel Stradford Lafontant [MANkarious].  She was born here in Chicago and grew up here in Chicago. Her father [C. Francis Stradford] was a lawyer also, and she became a lawyer.  She went to Oberlin College [Oberlin, Ohio] and the University of Chicago Law School [Chicago, Illinois] where she met my father and spent most of her career practicing law.
Speaker 2: And just a little bit about your family.  You have, on your mother's side, you have--there's a lot of history that is tied with Oklahoma.  If you would just share a little bit of that.
Speaker 1: Well, my mother's grandfather had a hotel in Tulsa, Oklahoma called the Stratford Hotel.  And it was burned down during the Tulsa race riots in the '20s [1920s].  And it was a very, very extraordinarily difficult time for our family because it was really one of the larger hotels in Tulsa.  It had been very, very successful.  And my, my great, great grandfather had been a real leader in Tulsa and been a real leader in the African American community.  And so once these race riots happened, he was--a lot of blame was placed on him for maybe being possibly one of the instigators of helping to have this riot start.  And so, therefore, he was prosecuted.  And he was able to slip out of town before he was jailed in Tulsa.  And my grandfather ultimately was able to use his legal skills to fight his extradition, extradiction [sic] back to Tulsa.  And he was able to live out the rest of his life in Chicago as I understand it.
Speaker 2: Did you ever--do you remember your grandfather?
Speaker 1: I remember my grandfather a little bit.
Speaker 2: Okay, but nothing that would have influenced you in any way.
Speaker 1: No.
Story_ID: 12518
Speaker 1: Okay, what is your earliest memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory?
Speaker 1: Your earliest memory.
Speaker 2: I remember cutting my hand when I was living on 50th Street [Chicago, Illinois] so it must have been three years old or something.  But that's probably my earliest memory.
Speaker 1: You were an only child--you are an only child, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I'd like you just to talk about, you know, the early years here in Chicago.  A lot of times when I've been even asking people-and this interview is different from what you thought. (laughter)
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Everyone says it so don't worry.  You know, James Compton, he would get this little look on his face.  And I said, "What do you think, I'm the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency)?"  And he said, "Yes." (laughter)  So don't worry.  It's all a matter of exploration.  But anyway, I, I've been asking people, you know, just to sort of take them back to their childhood, you know, and their growing up, what sights, smells or sounds remind them--you know, what sights, smells or sound really remind you of growing up here?
Speaker 2: I don't think I have any, don't think any that I can remember.
Speaker 1: Well, let me also ask you, what type of child do you think you were, John?  Were you a quiet child?  Were you introspective?  Were you a ponderer?  Were you outgoing?  Were you mischievous?  I mean what type of child were you?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was younger, I was very energetic.  You know, I--as my cousin, Laurel would say, I was always tumbling down the stairs and running all, throughout the house, and you know, this extraordinary bundle of energy.  That was part of it.  And I also spent a lot of time alone because I was an only child.  And my mother [Jewel Stradford] worked and my father [John W. Rogers, Sr.] worked.  And everybody was off doing the things that they did.  So I was often alone watching TV and having time on my own to sort of think about things.  And I was extremely competitive.  Those are the things that I think jump to mind.
Speaker 1: Even as a young person you were competitive?
Speaker 2: I loved to, yeah I loved sports.  And I can remember Harvard St. George [Chicago, Illinois] where I went to grade school, all the different games you played in gym class and how important it was for me to win and do well.  And it was kind of nice.  I was, you know, I think, I was pretty athletic.  So it helped a lot.
Speaker 1: And you said, you were also, you know, you would spend time alone.  Were you a ponderer, what did you think about when you were sort of alone and you had thoughts or watching TV or, would you sort of dream about, you know, doing something, or being or, you know?
Speaker 2: No, I just did things.  I, like I, I collected pictures of sports figures and I had them all over my room and throughout my part of the house.  And, you know, it was collect-it was a, it was massive collection that I spent years to build.  And I had a lot of sort of things like that that I did where I would build things and take a lot of time at it, and take a lot of energy, from jigsaw puzzles to other kind of sort of games I'd make up for myself.
Speaker 1: And so would you-did you have a train set or anything?  That was sort of big, but you weren't a train collector, a train person?
Speaker 2: I wasn't big on it, but I know I had one of those at my father's house.  My parents got divorced when I was three.  So every weekend I'd go to his house and I know we had a train set there.
Speaker 1: So you weren't really conscious when they were divorced.  So, you were really sort of young, I mean that's not a very--although you say your first memory is at three, that's not really a conscious state.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 12519
Speaker 1: What was sort of family life growing up that you remember?  You know, I was struck that day, the day of the street naming, you know, when you were saying, you know, this is where I'd lived, and you know.  You know, it sort of gave a sense of, you know, what environment you came out of, you know.  And so I'm just wondering if you could sort of describe home life and what it was like, and you know, the things, the people, your good friends, or you know, whatever influenced you in those early years.
Speaker 2: Well, the home life, I think, was two things.  I had a housekeeper, Mrs. Shelby, who was kind of like a caretaker.  And she was there to pick me up from school and stay with me when my mom [Jewel Stradford Lafontant] was out somewhere and giving speeches or traveling or what have you.  And so I spent a lot of time with Mrs. Shelby during my growing-up years.  And it was an important relationship.  And we did a lot of things together.  The other part of the neighborhood that was important was that I had friends on the block that I spent a lot of time with athletically.  You know, some people had basketball courts in the backyard, and others had room for a baseball game or a football game.  And so I was always in someone's backyard or my own backyard, practicing sports or competing against other kids.  And that was so central to my life.  And then I also, I used to bowl a lot.  So sports were, were real central to everything that I was doing or that I cared about.
Speaker 1: And what sports?  Did you have a favorite sport at that time or you were just all around, no matter what it was or?
Speaker 2: I was sort of--I played baseball.  I played basketball, and I bowled.  Those were the sort of three things that I did a lot of and up until, I--probably like, the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth grade, bowling was probably like number one.  I loved to bowl.  And I'd go bowling two or three times a week.  But then as I got to be seventh and eighth grade, I realized I had to make a choice.  And I sort of would, was--I loved playing basketball too.  And so I decided basketball was sort of tied to the school and part of the community.  And so I decided I would just focus on basketball and forget about the bowling and just sort do the baseball part time.
Speaker 1: And I want to go back to Mrs. Shelby since she was so central.  What was she--was she like a big mother figure, and was she--and what kind of messaging was she, you know, did she do or was she not that type of person?
Speaker 2: She wasn't a messaging.  She was a-- kind of like a buddy, you know.  She helped get me everywhere I needed to go and was always there.  And we'd watch TV together and it was like, during the summers and, you know, I'd watch the shows she liked to watch and she'd watch the shows I liked to watch and just hang out together.
Story_ID: 12520
Speaker 1: At what point did you or did you have a sense that you were from a privileged background or did you have that sense at any time in that--?
Speaker 2: I don't think I had a--I don't know if I had a sense of it.  I mean I think that--well, I mean I don't how to think about that.  My father [Hon. John W. Rogers, Sr.] lived in a studio apartment in Prairie Shores [apartment complex, Chicago, Illinois], which is a very sort of middle-class, kind of environment.  A lot of the nurses from the Michael Reese Hospital lived there and very--and, you know, it was studio when we first moved there and ultimately he got a one bedroom, and as the years went on, a little larger.  And Mom had a large house in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois neighborhood].  And so you got a sense that things were going well for her financially.  And she got remarried, and I had a stepfather.  And so but, I was always kind of in these two worlds, you know.  And it was a very unique kind of environment.  But I probably didn't figure out till high school that, you know, my mother was doing pretty well and my stepfather was doing pretty well.  And, you know, it's something you didn't think about as a kid growing up.
Speaker 1: But you did have, what I hear you describing, is a great sort of sense of community, you know, with people in different, you know, you were playing around with them in the backyards and things like that, you know.  Who were the kids that you were growing up with then, you know, were your buddies or friends?
Speaker 2: Well, the Rahaas (ph.) lived next door.  They had a big house and several kids.  And then down the block were the Lerners.  There were a lot of kids who were from Harvard St. George [Chicago, Illinois], which was three blocks away, between 47th [Street] and 48th [Street] and Ellis [Avenue].  A lot of African American families sent their kids there.  John Johnson's son, John, went there.  Earl Neal's son, Langdon, went there.  And Al Johnson's son, Donald, etc.  Ramsey Lewis's son.  So, you know, there was, it was, it was a place where you saw a lot of, you know, those sort of families from the community sent their kids there.  But ultimately, my friends were the folks that were really right there on the block.  As I got a little older, across the street Mercer Cook lived, and we also spent a lot of time together.
Story_ID: 12521
Speaker 1: At Harvard St. George [School, Chicago, Illinois], did you have a favorite teacher or people who, you know, you sort of liked or were you gravitating to any subjects then, early or was it--?
Speaker 2: No, no.  It was, sports.  There was some really good basketball players there as I got older, that I sort of emulated, you know, or wanted to be like.  But did Harvard St. George, did it go up, it didn't, you went--it went up to eighth grade?
Speaker 1: It went to twelfth grade.
Speaker 2: It went--you went to it to twelfth grade? You went to lab--.
Speaker 1: No, I went to, I went to the University of Chicago Lab[oratory] School starting in ninth grade.  But up until eighth grade, I went to Harvard St. George.  And so I had a chance to observe those players and those--you know, I can remember the Friday-night games and going to the gym and seeing these really great players play, cause I thought they were great.  You know, Darnell Bush and Elvin Tobias and Larry Williams and that's who you wanted to be.  You know, that's pretty much all I cared about, you know.
Speaker 2: (Off-camera discussion)
Speaker 1: --aware that you were from a privileged background where, you know, and the people that you associate, whether it-- you know, you mentioned John Johnson's, you know, son, and Ramsey Lewis's son, and you know, all these people were your neighbors.
Speaker 2: No, they were, sometimes they were neighbors or, or classmates or they were at Harvard St. George.  But you didn't really didn't realize they came from very successful African American families.  We were just all kids together.  But as I got older I realized that they were successful, they were well-known, but with, but that most of them really didn't have real wealth.  You know, you realize that, the difference between being a small--having your own small black law firm, where you can make a good living, be upper, middle-class maybe, but you're not making the same kind of money back then that the white partner in a major downtown law firm was making, that was doing the legal work for, you know, the big corporate, you know, giants.  We were often doing legal work, you know, for real estate and divorces or bankruptcies and that kind of business.  And so you made a living, but you didn't really accumulate real wealth.  And there's a big difference too in this country around wealth versus having a decent income.  So we were doing okay, but it really wasn't the way it sometimes seems to outsiders that we were part of a real wealthy family.
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense that you came from a cultured environment even though it was, you know, you were heavily into sports, did you have a sense of that?
Speaker 2: No, I, I, I'm not a very, acculturated person.
Speaker 1: No but you are. (laughter)
Speaker 2: (laughter)
Speaker 1: John, you come from a--I mean obviously, but you know intellectual community is what I'm saying.  You came from an intellectual community, you know, it may be minus wealth.  You know, there are people that talk about, I was poor, but, you know, I was exposed to the museums early on, you know, I was exposed to the symphony and those--.
Speaker 2: Not our family.  I went to the zoo every once and a while.  That was about it, you know.
Story_ID: 12522
Speaker 1: Now, so, were your thoughts that you were gonna be like a basketball star?  Is that what you were really sort of aiming to be and, you know, what--because you said you--my love was sports.  So--,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --were you saying to your father, you know, I want to be, I want to go and, you know, play with the New York Knicks or--?
Speaker 2: I would have loved to, but I was, I went to a basketball camp growing up that was run by Coach Motta Dick Motta, who was the coach of the [Chicago] Bulls at the time.  And he was a great coach.  And he could tell that I had some ability.  And he told me when I was probably fifteen, sixteen years old that I could, I could probably play Division One basketball, major college, but that I wasn't gonna be able to play professionally.  And I think I kind of already knew that, but having a great coach tell you that made you realize, you know, don't even think about it.  And so then I sort of changed my views and said, maybe I'll be a coach.  That's because I really loved it so much.  So my idea was that I'd go to Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey], get on the basketball team, play for a great coach, and then I'd be a coach also.
Speaker 1: And, okay, but let's go back a little--okay, so you were thinking you could be a coach and, you know, and coach a team?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you went to Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] with that idea.
Speaker 2: Yep, yeah.
Story_ID: 12523
Speaker 1: Let's go back, a little further back because your father also had been somewhat instrumental in teaching you--your mother is teaching you what?  And your father was teaching you what?  Let me, let's first get that (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's-- you don't want me to get too simplified, but I think that the values that my father [Hon. John W. Rogers, Sr.] taught were clear, very clear.  He had thought about all of these things for a long time and the ideas that I talked about earlier, the importance of living up to your commitments, always do what you say you're gonna do, always telling the truth were very, very important values, to not think about yourself first, but, you know, be concerned about other people were also values that he instilled in me.  And then, of course, he's the one that exposed me to the stock market as a child.  And he thought it was very important for me to understand how the stock market worked because he realized that was what was happening around white dinner tables around the country.  And it should be happening around the African American dinner table where he'd have a chance to talk with his son about the stock market and how to save and invest.  And so that was an, also an important thing to him to make sure I understood that.  He had also had a lot of other disciplines.  He said when I was sixteen I had to have a summer job.  At a certain stage in my life, I had to have checking account and savings account, and I can remember him taking me to Independence Bank to open up the, the checking account, and to go to Illinois Federal top open up my savings account.  And, you know, taking me to meet Doug Larson who was--worked at White Sox park [Comiskey Park, Chicago, Illinois, home of the Chicago White Sox professional baseball team] to ask him could I get a job there as a vendor, you know.  So he had a certain set of things that were very, very important to me or, or to him, that he instilled in me that I think were very, very valuable.  My mom [Jewel Stradford Lafontant] on the other side, I think was very different.  She was more free flowing, didn't have all these sort of ideas all in place.  But I think that I learned a lot from her, that she was someone who was very ambitious, thought that anything was possible and instilled in me that, you know, the, the sky was the limit.  You can dream about anything.  I think I also realized from her that you always want to do things really well.  You know, if you're gonna have a party, do it well.  If you were going to go on vacation, make it nice.  If you can have a car, have a nice car, you know.  She wanted things to be special.  And she liked things to be special.  And so, things that we try to do always in my life, you always want to make them kind of special and exciting for people.  And so I think those were kind of the things that were really important to her that came across to me.  And the other thing I think too that, I probably learned from her--my father would say that it was--we lived in a diverse community, you know.  It wasn't an accident that both my parents decided to live in Hyde Park (Chicago, Illinois), but my mother had a very diverse group of friends, socio-economically, racially, you know.  So I learned a lot about the importance of getting along with everybody.  You know, that you didn't think differently about different people based upon what color they were or what have you.  Also from her, I think that she was an entrepreneur herself.  She had been a pioneer as a woman lawyer.  So the sense of, that you respected women and women's ability to lead was something that was just natural to me because that was what I grew up with.  So those are some of the things I think I learned from her.
Speaker 1: You know, John, I want to get back to your father a little bit.  I find it, you know, when I hear you talking about him, and what he taught you, and what he wanted you to experience, it was--it seems out of sync.  And the only reason I say that, you know, lawyers are not necessarily oriented towards money or the stocks, you know.  And he was, you know, he spent time as a juvenile judge.  You know, so I'm looking at that.  And then, and, you know, and he came from a modest background.  And you'd think, well that's very like with it, you know, for him to have said, you know, here, you know, let me introduce to this--even for him to know about the stock market cause a bunch of people, you know, my--so I'm just--where did he get that from?
Speaker 2: That part, I don't know.  That's an interesting question.  I never thought about where did he get the, the idea for himself to be comfortable in the markets and to know about it.  I don't know how he came to that.  I know that he had decided that his child needed to understand about it because he had talked to a white lawyer--and I'm pretty sure it was a white lawyer, who, they were having a discussion about, somehow, about how African Americans were not involved in the stock market, and we as a community were, you know, we didn't get it.  And out of this conversation the white gentleman told my father that, you know, African Americans should know as much about the stock market as my twelve year old son does.  And this gentleman told my father how he had got his child involved in the stock market by buying stock for his kid at twelve.  So my father said, I'm gonna do the same thing for my son.  When he's twelve, he's gonna have real stock.  And he'll be able to learn it just like that white family was able to teach their child about the importance of investing in the stock market.  So I kind of understand how he connected to me in that way.  I think the other thing was that he, he had--I don't, you know, I think that I came along late, maybe.  So my father was almost forty when I was born.  So I think he had a lot of chance to think about appropriate things that he thought were important for a young person to experience when they came along.  And so maybe, he was mature, and he'd had a chance to think about it.
Speaker 1: And how now, how receptive were you at the time, though, 'cause you're twelve.  I mean this is, it's one thing in legend now.  You know, it's legend, okay, John's father taught him (laughing) you know, and it's Ariel [Capital Managemnet Corporation], you know, but what, at that point in time, were you like, were you receptive as a child or did you think, oh, okay, whatever?
Speaker 2: I was receptive.  I think knowing that my father [Hon. John W. Rogers, Sr.] had good ideas, and it was like, well, you know, I, I would listen to it, give it a shot.  Like, you know--but I think it, it took some time for it to get really exciting because in the beginning, you know, it's reading the annual reports and quarterly reports.  It wasn't a lot of fun and reading the newsletters on the stock market.  But over time, you know--and he'd let me keep the dividend checks.  And so the dividend checks got larger as the years went on.  So the money was, you know, it was nice.  Every three months in the mail I'd get a check from General Motors or Commonwealth Edison or Jewel Foods or IBM (International Business Machine) or whatever.  And it, and that was kind of nice.  And then I started to like to read about those companies.  It was interesting to me.  And so, I kind of liked it.  And he tells people all the time, he got me a chemistry set and did other things, and those things didn't stick.  You know, I tried them for a couple of months and then lost interest.  This one grew and grew and grew.
Speaker 1: You're-are you saying--at what age were reading the reports, the annual reports and things?  What, not twelve, but maybe sixteen?
Speaker 2: No, no, right in the beginning, that was one of, that was also part of my father's genius, as I think about it now that I've got a twelve years old--twelve year old.  He insisted when I came over to visit, he would sit me down with the reports, the statements from the brokerage accounts and the--show me the stock certificate and show me where to read about it in the newspaper, and "Here's a quarterly report.  You need to read this and understand about it, what's going with your stock and your company."  So he was very disciplined about making sure that not only was I exposed, but that I really absorbed what I needed to absorb.  Same thing with the checking account and the savings account.  He made sure that I balanced my checking book, checking account, I mean balanced my checkbook, you know, every statement.  And it was very, very important to him that I did those things well and did them right.
Story_ID: 12524
Speaker 1: And your first job, you talked about, you know, that he [father, Hon. John W. Rogers, Sr.] took you down to, what--was it [White] Sox Park [aka Comiskey Park]or Wrigley [Field, Chicago, Illinois]--?
Speaker 2: It was White Sox park.
Speaker 1: White Sox park, right.  Okay.  And talk about that because that was a, that was sort of an exciting period for you too, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, he had told me that when I was sixteen, I would have to have a summer job.  And I'm being a good son, okay, you tell me I have to do, I'm gonna do it.  And, but he said, it could be any job I wanted, that I could get.  And so we had a chance--he knew this gentleman from the community who worked at White Sox park. I had gone to White Sox boys camp, and so I met him, I think over time.  And, I'm not sure if I, you know, sort of vaguely aware of this guy.  And we used to also go to the White Sox games on a regular basis every, every Sunday.  When they were in town, we would go and watch the White Sox play, and we had season tickets, and I liked baseball.  So this looked like it would be a great, you know, summer job, to be able to be in the ballpark, be around sports, and fulfill this obligation of my father.  It ended up being a great career for me.  I did it for six years.  I became a part of the union, Local 236, AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor - Congress of Industrial Unions], Service Employees International Union, and met lots of people from all walks of life.  And it was a career where you got paid based upon how much you sold.  So you had to be creative.  You had to know where to go and how to-when to hustle and when to really work hard.  And then you made more money, and the more money you made, the more successful you were, the better items you got to sell because the folks knew, you know, who was working hard.  And so they gave them the better items to sell and rewarded you for that.  So it was a great entrepreneurial kind of environment that you achieved if you worked hard, and you thought about it and you were creative.
Story_ID: 12525
Speaker 1: And when you were at the lab school [University of Chicago Laboratory High School, Chicago, Illinois], was that a different environment than Harvard St. George [School, Chicago, Illinois] or was it very similar?  Was there any sort of difference in, you know, white setting versus the other?
Speaker 2: Well, it's, it was a much different setting because you were pushed much, much harder.  Harvard St. George was a, a nice [elementary] school.  And, you know, you went along and you did fine.  I went to the Lab school, and all of a sudden, you know, you were competing with a much broader set of students.  A lot of the kids' parents were professors at the University of Chicago or physicians at the hospital.  The intellectual curiosity that comes with being affiliated with the University of Chicago was extraordinary.  You know, this a world-class institution with world-class minds and their kids and the teachers were all a part of that culture.  So all of a sudden, you said, "Whoa, I'm gonna have to work at a whole other level, I mean, and, and the effort I'm gonna have to put in to, to get decent grades and to be effective here is gonna be a pretty extraordinary effort."  So it was a big change from Harvard St. George to, to the Lab school.
Speaker 1: And did you find--I know your interest in sports stayed there, but did you find that your other interests were expanding or were there certain subjects that you gravitated to then or, you know, were there certain activities that you were involved in?
Speaker 2: The only thing that, I mean, part of it was a natural evolution.  I think I was always pretty good at math and so I did better at math at, at the Lab school than, being relative to other courses.  I didn't write especially well, and that was consistent as well.  I especially found that out when I got to the Lab school.  And I took theater, which was interesting.  And that, I learned an enormous amount and really enjoyed that.  And so maybe that's probably the one thing that was a little out of the ordinary.
Speaker 1: I'm surprised you took theater.  See, that's really a great--that's wonderful, John. (Laughs)  See what you learn about your friends, you don't know.  Anyway, when--but math, what did you like about math?  What sort of appealed to you about that?
Speaker 2: It was predicable, and I did well at it.  And I could sort of, you know, I could intuitively figure out, you know, kind of what would the right way to think about the problems were.  So when you like things, you do well at it.  That's kind of the natural thing.  I didn't enjoy english cause I didn't do well at it.

Speaker 1: Now, when you were looking at colleges, how did you end up, you know, what colleges did you actually look at, and, you know, how did you end up, you know, going where you did?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I remember when I visited Carleton College [Northfield, Minnesota].  I visited Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois], Georgetown [University, Washington, D.C.], University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut]] and Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey], that I can remember that I went to, to look at.  And I think the idea was then I wanted to play basketball at the highest level that I could play.  I'd played at University of Chicago Lab[oratory] School [High School, Chicago, Illinois].  It's a pretty, you know, it wasn't a great basketball school.  And so you, I, you sort of had gotten used to being a big fish, you know, in the small pond.  And I said, I want to go and see how--I want to get to the highest level that I can play at.  And so even if I don't get to be a big star there or what have you, I wanted to really experience what it was like to be in a big-time program with great coaches and, you know, have a great experience traveling around the country playing other great teams.  So pretty quickly it became clear that if I was gonna play Division One, that the Ivy League was my best shot.  And University of Pennsylvania and Princeton had the best reputations, the best teams. They had often won, they often, almost always win the Ivy League title.  They were often ranked in the top twenty if not the top ten in the country back in the early '70's [1970s].  They had a real history of real great players, both at the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton.  They had two great coaches, Chuck Daley was at Penn [University of Pennsylvania] at the time, and Pete Carril was at Princeton.  So pretty quickly I narrowed my choices down to, to Penn [University of Pennsylvania] and Princeton.  You'd get a good education and keep your parents [Hon. John W. Rogers, Sr. and Jewel Stradford Lafontant-MANkarious] happy, play big-time basketball with a team that could be ranked in the top twenty in the country that had a history of great players.  And I went to visit both schools and sort of thought Princeton was beautiful.  The gym was extraordinarily great.  It was a wonderful facility, Jadwin Gym, and I kind of liked Coach Carril.  He, he seemed to be genuinely interested in me, and I remember Chuck Daley was, you know, he was officious and he was a big-time coach, and made me feel like a small-time player, which I was.  But, (laughs) so at least Coach Carril pretended that I was, you know, important.  And when I got, got to Princeton, I realized that there were a lot of kids there coming who hoped to play and evidently there was gonna be more people hoping to play than could actually play.  But, but anyway, so I made the decision to go to Princeton because of the quality of the program, quality of the coaches, the quality of the facility, and the fact that you'd be able to play with, within a great program, with a great tradition, play against the best teams in the country, the best players in the country.  And that would be really terrific, and a team that won, you know.  It was so fun.  In sophomore year, I remember being on the varsity and being in 'Sports Illustrated' and having the article saying that we're the number twenty team in the country.  That was special, to feel like you were part of a top twenty team, and there were nice stories about our coach that year so expectations were really high.  And 'New York Times' did a big feature, and so it made you feel like you're, you were part of something special.  And interesting, one sideline, when I was a junior, Penn [University of Pennsylvania] went to the Final Four.  And so, I realized I was right.  They were really good.  But, you know, who knows whether, whether I would have even got a chance to play there.
Speaker 1: So you were on the varsity team when you first came in?
Speaker 2: Well, back in the old days, when I was there, you, you couldn't play varsity as a freshman.  So I was on the freshman team and then I played three years of varsity.
Speaker 1: So they had a freshman team, and then you were able to play varsity then?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you went off to school, this is really your first time East, I mean first time living East, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And it's your first time really outside of Chicago, in some respects--when I say that, I mean I'm not saying you didn't travel.
Speaker 2: Right,
Speaker 1: But this is your first time away from home, right, sort of?
Speaker 2: Well, I had traveled some with my mom and she had had jobs in New York and Washington [D.C.].  So eventually I had some extended, I've had some extended visits to New York and Washington with her because of her career.
Story_ID: 12527
Speaker 1: But what other things about the Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] experience, I guess, is what I'm trying to figure out influenced you?  You know, why did you sort of grow up during those years?
Speaker 2: Well, it was pretty much basketball-related.  I mean it's, I was desperate to make the basketball team.  And I had told my parents [Hon. John W. Rogers, Sr. and Jewel Stradford Lafontant-MANkarious] that if I didn't make the team sophomore year, I was coming home right after the first semester and transferring to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], most probably giving up because, you know, I, I didn't mind being a small fish in a big pond, but if I wasn't gonna even be in the pond at all, I was not gonna stay, you know.  So, so that was really clear.  And I barely made the team.  I mean I, it was, ultimately, there was, it started off, maybe there was five or six of us chasing two spots.  And there two guards positions that were open when I was a sophomore, and I got the second spot, the last guard position.  So I barely made it, and I cut it very close, you know, and just barely made it.  And [Princeton University Basketball] Coach [Pete] Carril said he kept me around because I worked so hard.  He could tell how much I wanted it and how much I cared about it.  And so that made a difference.  And he said I had a lot of trouble passing and dribbling, but I did some other things that were helpful.  And so I, and so I got to play, got to be on the team.  And it was also, I almost got cut the sophomore year cause after I got--I was there for a while and then he said, you know, you're having such a hard time playing, and basically saying, you know, you really don't know what you're doing.  So, even though I'd been an All-State basketball player and, you know, Class A, All-State here in Illinois.  I'd been All-Area, for the Chicagoland area, best player in the league where I'd played.  He basically said you have no idea what you're doing.  And I didn't 'cause I had never had a, played for a big-time coach. I mean they were using terms I'd never heard of [laughter].  And I was like, even the terminology was like learning a new language and things like that.  So he said, you know, "I'm not sure how long we can keep you here cause the other guys are gonna know what they're doing, and it's a problem playing with you."  And, but ultimately, he decided to keep me anyway.  And so as, as the years went on, I got to stay on the team junior year.  And at the end of junior year, I got to start, and I did well.  I got twenty points in one game, and fourteen points in another game.  And it was like this big surprise.  The press was like, where has he been all these--why haven't you played him?  And the coach said--they actually had it in the Trenton [New Jersey] paper, said, "If Johnny Rogers could pass or dribble a little bit, we would have been playing him a long time ago."  You know, this was in the paper (laughs).  And, and so I finished the senior--junior year really well.  And then senior year I got to start in the beginning and got to be captain and started against Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina], who was number two in the country, and Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] was the defending national champions.  And it was a wonderful experience.  I never will forget going to play at Duke and, you know, in that filled arena and what it was like.  But then after that, he said, "You know, it's not fair to have you on the court with players like that."  It ended up, basically, he never played me again.  It was [unclear] so I had this very odd career where I went from being the last guy on the team to being a starting captain senior year, like against all the odds.  And then went right back to where I'd been all along, you know.  So I kind of had this moment in the sun, and actually did well, you know, during my moment in the sun, which was kind of fun, you know.  And I, I played well and--but he [Coach Pete Carril] has a very strong system that he teaches.  And there were certain skills around passing and dribbling that were very, very important to him.  And if you didn't have those, it didn't matter if you did other things well, he felt that the whole team couldn't achieve if you had players there who didn't have these specific skills.  So I kind of understood what he was wrestling with because he could see some of the good things I was doing, how hard I worked, some of the kind of shots I could make and defense I could play, but these other things were bothersome to him.  So anyway, so I went back to the bench.  But the long answer to the question is, the other part that's very important was the values that I learned from Coach Carril were extraordinarily important.  And two or three things that are just, you know, were seared into everyone who ever played for him, and number one was teamwork.  When you came there, most players could come there, obviously, most of the players were the best player in their area, best player on their team, the best player in their league.  And people cared about their own personal statistics and, and the like.  He somehow had a magical way of getting people to forget about all of that and to play together and to think about what was best for the team first.  And pretty much you, everyone became believers.  You know, you got as much pleasure passing to an open teammate, setting a good screen, making the right cut that would help to open up something for someone else to do something great on defense.  And it became a wonderful lesson of the importance of care for your teammates and care for the team and to put yourself, you know, not front and center.  And so it was an extraordinarily valuable lesson to, to learn.  The second thing that he taught very well was precision.  He demanded, if you made a cut, it would have to be precise.  If you made a pass, it had to be perfect.  He would stop--if someone threw a pass six inches too low or too far to the right, he would stop, and that would be a reason for a long lecture.  You know, he demanded excellence and demanded precision.  And there was just no excuses for it, it being a little bit off.  And that was the extraordinarily important lesson.  Some other lessons he taught were life lessons.  So those were two, sort of basketball kind of lessons, but it also had a lot to do with life.  But then there were some specifically.  He talked a lot about the fact that you had to, he, he wanted us to understand that we--he didn't want to be--become part of, too much of the overall Princeton intellectual, sort of wealthy culture.  It was very, very important for him to, to not see us succumb to that because he thought that sort of softened you.  If you're gonna be a good player you had to be tough.  And if you sort of got too much exposure to the Princeton life it would in some way soften you.  And that was sort of the interesting--you know, he would talk about the other side of Washington Road, and don't become like those folks.  And, you know, he's a intellectually brilliant person.  He talked the, you know, he also talked about the importance of building relationships with your friends and the important, the social part of your life being important as well as the work you did together.  So he did a lot of things to get people together socially.  And those were also valuable lessons that I, I remember being important later on in my life.
Speaker 1: So in some respects, John, he was another, not an extension of your father, but in some of the lessons about discipline and, you know, hard work, he was as adamant about those in many ways.
Speaker 2: Well, one point that, you know, I didn't mention, it was exactly right on, was one that he--I was talking with, to one of our [Ariel Capital Management Company] summer interns who plays at Princeton now, about the fact that one of the things they teach you when you play at Princeton is the importance of telling the truth.  And so when you got Princeton, the coaches told you exactly what you did well and exactly what you didn't do well.  And he told you that in front of the entire team.  They were brutally honest.  And they kept telling you the importance of honesty, and to not mislead you.  And to say, you know, people have been telling you how good you are all of your life.  We're gonna tell you the truth.  And that was very consistent with my father's [Hon. John W. Rogers, Sr.] belief in telling the truth and being honest and being straightforward and not having hidden agendas somewhere.  And those were, those were two very consistent messages between Coach Carril and my father.
Story_ID: 12528
Speaker 1: And you also talked some about [Princeton University basketball] Coach [Pete] Carril, and he has a--and you've alluded to some of it, but he had a special--there's a special, there's a special way of playing that he had--was it, didn't you once say that, that there was a special mythology that he had, methodology?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No, he does, he does.  Princeton [University Princeton, New Jersey] basketball is known for a certain style of basketball.  And actually there was a nice story in the 'New York Times' just about two weeks ago that talks about the fact that, where he's now the assistant coach of Sacramento Kings [of the National Basketball Association], how the Sacramento Kings are playing with the same system that he taught at Princeton, and the amount of impact that it's having on their success, being one of the best teams in the NBA [National Basketball Association].  It also went on to say that two former assistant coaches from Sacramento who had rubbed shoulders with Coach Carril in Sacramento were now the head, were now coaching at the New Jersey Nets [of the National Basketball Association], and how the New Jersey Nets were using the Princeton system.  And they actually got to the NBA finals this year.  And so all of a sudden, there's sort of this national recognition that the system and the value and the way of playing that he taught at Princeton for twenty-nine years, has been embraced by two of the top, four teams in the NBA because it works so well.  And it revolves around including everybody in what you do, passing, cutting, sharing the ball, the team play, but also a sense of, you know, it takes precise cuts.  It takes precise passing.  It takes reading each other.  It takes, takes doing what's least expected which is another powerful lesson--there's so many lessons you know, from the things that he taught.  But he teaches you not to do the obvious.  So Princeton is known for the backdoor play, which means you cut behind your defender to get open. Most people are taught to cut in front to try to get advantage when they're playing.  We're taught the exact opposite, cut behind and force your team--and force the defensive player to try to find you.  And actually, there's some life lessons there too of, don't do what's expected, being able to do creative things that are out of the mainstreams often lead to great success.  And that was kind of the part of the system that he taught.
Story_ID: 12529
Speaker 1: Now, the other thing I find a little curious--so you have your--you know, here you are starting [on the Princeton University varsity basketball team], and, you know, you win this game by twenty point, you know, and you--.
Speaker 2: I scored twenty points (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: Your scored twenty points, I'm sorry, in a game.  And, which is a lot of points in a game, but you do that--sorry, I'm not a--,
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: Basketball player.  But anyway, but then he [Coach Pete Carril] puts you back on the bench.  And I'm just saying some people would be like totally pissed off, their hero would be like persona non-gratis at that point or they would think I really worked hard, and I did everything and how could you--why would you do this to me?
Speaker 2: Right.  I have a lot of friends who went through that experience and had came to the same conclusion that we just did. But I had a lot of respect for his intellectual understanding of the game.  I mean he, and already at that point, he had written [sic, written by Dan White] one very widely acclaimed book called 'Play to Win' ['Play to Win: A profile of Princeton basketball coach Pete Carril'].  He had had feature stories about him in 'Sports Illustrated' that went several pages, talking about how smart he was.  You knew he was a future hall of famer.  He is in the hall of fame now.  So here was this person who was just basically, to me it was like, if you had had a chance to learn to write, and, you know, being taught by Edgar Allen Poe or something or Shakespeare or if you were you were gonna be a musician, and you were being taught by Stevie Wonder, here's this true genius. And if he's telling me that I'm not this--that good at these certain things, I'm gonna believe him, you know.  I wouldn't try and say, oh, no, I--I got to know more about this than he does, which is an unusual way of looking--a lot of time people are gonna try and prove, you know.  It's like, well, I'm gonna keep working at it.  I'm not gonna quit.  But at the same, I've got to respect his judgment and his knowledge.
Speaker 1: So that time that you sat on the bench afterwards, that was okay by you?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't say it was always, not always perfect.  As the senior year went along and, you know, and it got a little--kept thinking that soon he'll, he'll bring me back in again, it'll be like it was the end of last year, you know. (Laughs)  But, you know, I, I enjoyed practice.  I enjoyed being part of the team.  I enjoyed competing in that way, and, and it was just fascinating.  You know, you're being, you know, you're sort of in this almost laboratory where you're hearing this person teach, you know, extraordinarily difficult things and seeing people absorb them.  And you say, this is fascinating.  It was interesting.  But it was, it was hard, it was very hard times too.  And I can't play and sure, you'd love to play.  The other part of it that was hard too was that you, he was a very tough person.  And if we didn't win, the, the tension was extraordinary.  If we weren't playing well, the tension was extraordinary.  And since I wasn't playing, it wasn't, it wasn't very often aimed at me.  But he was demanding to a level that is almost indescribable.  And that could create an enormous amount of tension.  And so it wasn't always pleasant.
Story_ID: 12530
Speaker 1: I have one question though, you know, 'cause, sports, they talk a lot about it, and you've talked about this here, about it being, you know, big in terms of sort of teambuilding.  But then, you know, you hear about this, you know, incredible pressure, you know, and he wasn't, you know, and things would get really tense.  And, you know, I liken it to, you know, I went to an art school, and, you know, and people were, you know, and the symp--the orchestra, there was a lot of backbiting.  It wasn't team building.  And I'm just wondering how is sports so good about teambuilding because you know, there would sabotage on the other end.  Like people ripping people's instruments or, you know, and I'm just wondering, you know, why do you think sports, you know, or that environment or done right, is such a good place for teaching?
Speaker 2: I don't think it's done right very often.  You know, I think a lot of--when you go to camps, they tell you the importance of teamwork.  And people have these clichés, there's no I in team and all of these kinds of things that go and on, and you know.  But at the end of the day, most kids were thinking about how many points did I score?  How can I beat out this person for a position or what have you?  And it's, it's very hard to get people in life to think about what's best for the group.  He [Princeton University Basketball Coach Pete Carril] had a special genius in the way that he was able to do that, in all kinds of ways.  And there's some examples that are just extraordinary where he, he would--there's one example, the player told me once who played there, that--it's hard to be able to explain this kind of a setting.  But he was a forward who was supposed to get a pass from the guard.  And the guard was struggling to dribble the ball up the court because he was being defended by a very good player.  And he was under pressure.  And the forward, who was out of the play was sort of, not working that hard to get open.  So it made life harder for the guard because now he didn't have an open release to get rid of the ball to take the pressure off of himself.  Well, Coach Carril stopped practice and told that forward, "Don't you see your teammate out there struggling.  If you care about him, you're gonna work extraordinarily hard to get an open to help to release the pressure and help your teammate out when he really needs the help."  And for that player, that's when the light bulb went off.  He realized that his concern for his teammate was--had to be first and foremost, and to be thinking about his teammate's interest, not his own at that moment.  And, but there was all kinds of other ways where you just loved to, to throw the right pass, or again, as I said earlier, make the right cut, and where he rewarded that.  But everyone rewarded it together and everyone appreciated it because, sort of a lot of things were subtle, the, how the right screen, set up the right way, would open up an opening for someone else later down that, during that sequence of plays.  And people in the stands or on TV wouldn't quite understand it.  Or if somebody threw a great pass, a bounce pass for someone open for a shot, people wouldn't understand how hard that pass was to throw, and the, and the common reading between the recipient of the pass and the person who's passing it to be able to understand it. And there was a certain appreciation of that, that grew over time.  But there had to be something in the way that he taught that made people feel so terrific about being a part of this collaborative effort that led to a, a good result for your teammate or the team overall.  Or it could also end up good for you too, individually, 'cause sometimes you did the unselfish act, and you ended up being the one who's open and--for an easy shot.  But he just had a unique way of really making you understand why it was important.  And you ultimately loved it, and you'd never want to play any other way, you know.  It's like you, you never, you could go, I could, you could days in practice and not score a basket and you were fine 'cause you were just happy to be a part of, of making the team better.
Story_ID: 12531
Speaker 1: And do you know how he [Princeton University Basketball Coach Pete Carril] actually came to, to being a coach, you know, and developing this philosophy or was it just sort of his thing?  How long had he been coaching at the point that you came?
Speaker 2: Oh, I know a lot of us have been thinking about that now 'cause--it's funny you think about how old that he was 'cause--he was there twenty-nine years.  So that means he started there thirty-five years ago, which would have been, what, 1967 or roughly '68 [1968], in that range.  And so when I got there in 1976, he had been there nine years.  He'd had, already had, had great success.  But he had grown up in the steel mill towns of Pennsylvania, you know.  His father had worked in furn-you know, in an open, in front of an open furnace, manufacturing steel.  And he'd really grown up the hard way, and had had a tough life.  He'd been a great high school player, a great college player at Lafayette [University, Easton, Pennsylvania].  And when he ultimately went to--started coaching in high school and moved up to coaching in college, and had a great opportunity to go to Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] where an opening came up.  And he'd been coaching Lehigh [University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania], and he had done well.  But he hadn't been there very long.  And Butch Van Breda Koff who was coaching  Princeton went, left Princeton and went to coach the [Los Angeles, California] Lakers [of the National Basketball Association].  And this was right after the Bill Bradley era.  And Butch Van Breda Koff convinced the people at Princeton that Coach Carril would be a, the right person.  [Unclear] Butch had coached coach Carril in college and knew how good he was going to be and, and understood how special he was.
Story_ID: 12532
Speaker 1: The relationships that you formed during that time [at Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], can you talk a little bit about those, you know, with your [basketball] teammates?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a really unfortunate thing, by the end of my senior year, I was the only one left from my, from the eight or nine of us that had been recruited as freshman.  They had, through cuts and one kid left school--I was the only one left on my team.  So I have some really good friends that are on, like our chief information officer [at Ariel Mutual Funds] played with me, was a year ahead of me at Princeton. And our lobbyist in Washington [D.C.] played three years with me there.  So I have some really good relationships, but I wasn't, I wasn't fortunate to have this kind of cadre and I went through the whole with, the way some of my teammates did.
Story_ID: 12533
Speaker 1: John, what else was--I know sports were, you know, front and center, but when you, you know, when it was time to sort of graduate were you thinking about what you wanted to do?  Did you want to--were you thinking still you wanted to coach [basketball] or did you think you wanted to do what?
Speaker 2: Well, senior year [at Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] evolved, I kind of, I was starting to finally, after a long time, I said, you know what, I've been doing this so long.  It's been such an obsession for so long, maybe it's, you know, it's a time to, to think, maybe there's a time to not keep going with basketball.  And it's, and it's also, when you thinking about coaching, it's an inexact process of how do you get going, you know, where do you go to start?  It's not like in a job where, you know, you go to interview at the big brokerage firms or whatever and there's a standard starting position and a training program and the like.  And so you, the, the assistant--my, my freshman coach had left the year before to go coach at Colgate [University, Hamilton, New York].  If had been a senior then, I probably would have followed him, you know, to Colgate 'cause we had a really good relationship.  But there wasn't one of those kind of natural opportunities when I graduated as a senior.  So I went to my second, you know, favorite hobby, which was the stock market.  By now, my father's [Hon. John W. Rogers, Sr.], you know, starting point had become really very, very important to me.  I had a stockbroker across the street from campus at, at Princeton.  I spent a lot of time in his office.  I had a broker back on LaSalle Street, which was my parents' broker, Stacey Adams, who had been the first African American stockbroker on LaSalle Street here in Chicago [Illinois].  And he worked for a company called Freehling & Company.  So when I was home for the summers, I would sit and watch the tape go by, and talk to Stacey [Adams] about the markets and hear him talking to his clients and see him meet with clients.  And so I had these two role models who were stockbrokers.  So I interviewed with Merrill Lynch when I got out of college for a program they had called their Corporate Intern Program and they didn't accept me.  And I interviewed here in town [Chicago, Illinois] with William Blair [& Company], which was the largest regional brokerage firm here in the, probably the Midwest, but definitely Chicago.  And the managing partner was a Princeton alumnus, Ned Jenada [ph.].  And I interviewed with him, and then Ned sent me to the folks in the brokerage part of the operation.  And I went through a series of interviews there and I got hired.  And it was interesting, the difference between [unclear] and Merrill Lynch where they had internship programs and, you know, training programs, but William Blair didn't.  They very rarely hired someone right out of college.  As far as I knew, there'd never been an African American professional there, and, but the firm had about four hundred people at the time.  So I was kind of an odd duck there.  I was a lot younger than everybody else, you know, the only person of color there, but it was a, it was a great place to start.  I tell people all the time, the people there were terrific to me, and being a regional brokerage firm, you learn all about the investment management business, the investment banking business, the trading part of the operations, the research part of the operations, as well as the stock brokerage part of the operations.  And so I quickly learned that all my role models before had been stockbrokers, the minute I got exposed to the rest of the industry at Blair, I realized that I wanted to in the money management and mutual fund part of the industry.  So I always kind of think Blair was a great place to start.

Speaker 1: Did you find that you, because you had been doing what you had been doing [playing the stock market] since, you know, for so, since being so young, did you find that you sort of head start on other people coming in.
Speaker 2: It was a good story to get hired in a place like [William] Blair [& Company] because, and since they had--I think they had, four years ago, they hired, four years earlier, they'd hired someone right out of college, you know.  And, you know, it'd been probably years, probably in ten years they had only hired two or three people right out of college.  So it was, it was very unusual.  So it was, it was very unusual.  So I think the fact that I had this history, and I could show that I loved the markets, made them, helped make them make the exception to give me a shot at it.  And since they didn't have a training program, maybe it also helped them feel comfortable that I knew something about the markets and how to, how to think about the market.  But other than that, I don't think it was anything that was that, really relevant.
Speaker 1: So you're saying, they didn't hire many people out of college.  Were they hiring people out of graduate school, MBA's [masters degree in business administration] or who were they hiring?
Speaker 2: Well, it depended what part of the shop you were working at.  If you were in the investment banking operation, they were typically hiring people right out of MBA school.  It was a great place to start to be an investment banker.  But to be a stockbroker, you typically wanted people who had had experience somewhere else.  That was the traditional route.  They just didn't start you fresh.  The big brokerage firms were the only places that often gave you a shot as a young person.
Speaker 1: And so within that environment, did you spend time in each area or it's just the nature of what you were doing that you were exposed to all these things?
Speaker 2: It was this, it was small enough, four hundred people, a few floors.  They had a weekly research meeting where everybody went. They had company outings, and so we had a chance to soak up the whole atmosphere.  But I was really on the one floor, which is called a private investor, you know, floor, private investor department, working with individual investors as stockbrokers typically do.  So I didn't go through any kind of rotation where you had a chance, the way a big investment bank would allow you to, to see how everything worked.  You sort of had to soak it up on your own and, you know, make time on your own to go and meet some of the colleague-your colleagues that were in the various different departments.
Speaker 1: And in that environment, John, were you--it's different--before you had been a client, and you were actually servicing people.  Were there things that were sort of surprising that you learned in sort of the mix in that process?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  It was pretty much like I thought.  You had to go out and find your own clients, and they told you that upfront.  So that wasn't a surprise.  And so it was probably pretty much like I thought.
Story_ID: 12535
Speaker 1: How are you sourcing your clients?
Speaker 2: Well, I found out pretty quickly I wasn't very good at cold calling, you know, which is what they like you to do, at every beginning, for every beginning stockbroker, get on the, you know, get a phone book and call people.  Get lists and call people.  I, I made about five calls like that and realized I couldn't do it [laughs].  So I, I networked.  I went to my friends from [University of Chicago] Lab School [Chicago, Illinois], were I, you know, University of Chicago Lab School, my friends from Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey], family friends.  I called on people I knew.  I gave talks.  I went--I'd give speeches anywhere to any sized group to talk about investing and the importance of getting involved in the stock market.  And I had about three different investment clubs that I--the African American-run investment clubs where young people were getting together to invest for the first time.  And I was their stockbroker.  And then after about a year, I actually started to try to get some press about what I was doing.  And I tried--I worked at that pretty hard.  I kind of felt, geez, well, there's--if I'm quoted in an article or if I'm on the channel 26 [Chicago, Illinois] '[The] Stock Market Observer' talking about the stock market or I'm on the radio talking about the stock market, maybe people are interested, will be interested in calling me and open up an account.  So, so that was the kind of things that I did.  But it was really a lot about networking, you know, getting out there.
Speaker 1: And so where were your, were your clients coming from all sources and did, were any people dismissive of you because you of your youth?
Speaker 2: I'm sure a lot of people were.  And I think what I didn't realize at that time was that, you had, you had a couple of challenges.  You know, as we talked about earlier, African Americans typically weren't comfortable in the market.  And so it was hard to get a lot of African Americans to invest with you.  I remember early on, Dr. James Bowman and his wife, Barbara, were early clients because I saw them at a cocktail party somewhere, and we started talking.  And they, they loved to invest and they said, "Geez, of course, I should do business with you."  You know, we grew up, you know, we're family friends and they gave, gave us a shot. But they were few and far between, people like that.  And then in the majority community, even though I was fortunate, you know, to be able, through the schools that I went to and the family friends to, to meet a lot of, you know, substantial, wealthy, you know, white executives and business leaders, they all have friends and cousins and sons and daughters and son-in-laws and other relationships that have been going on for twenty, thirty, forty, fifty years because there's a lot of stockbrokers out there.  So maybe somebody would give you a little business, just as a token.  But it was pretty impossible for you at age twenty-two and twenty-three to break through, you know, all, you know, all the other relationships that other people had and had been developing for years and year and years.  So that's where the youth really hurt.  And plus, you know, you didn't, you know, if you'd see them, you know, if you grown up in the country club and had known some of these folks for twenty-five or, twenty years or so, then maybe you'd have a shot to get a little more business.  Even then, it would still be hard.  But starting from scratch was really, really difficult.
Story_ID: 12536
Speaker 1: You know John, I have just one other question about, before we sort of go on, I--did your mother ever want you to go into law, your parents  [John W. Rogers, Sr. and Jewel Stradford Lafontant-MANkarious]?  There was no push to follow any of them in the legal career?
Speaker 2: Not a serious push.  I applied--I took the LSAT [Law School Admissions Test] and I applied to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] Law School, and they didn't accept me.  And so I said, well, if I can't go to Harvard, I'm not going [laughs].  No, I'm kidding.  I'm--I mean they didn't accept me, but I, I really did not want, I, I really wanted to be in the investment world.  And my parents, I think, understood that and so, reluctantly, didn't push me to apply to other schools and--cause I could have applied to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] and gone to law school right at home.  And they didn't push hard.  They really wanted me to get a graduate degree, but that was probably the real tension because unlike--most families were, can say, you know, we're moving on up.  I was, I was moving down.  I'm the least educated in my family (laughs), and it was like, what have we done wrong?  You know, he doesn't want to keep going.  But I was tired, you know.  I had, trying to get through Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] and play basketball, and, you know, I guess, I was just like I've had enough.
Speaker 1: See, that's why in many ways, you're, you know, you're sort of a boot strap story because people, you know, got their, you know, went to B-school [business school].  And that was the hot thing, go to B-school, you know, come out, you know, be an investment banker type, that type of thing.  And so you didn't follow that path, and I--but I'm just saying, why did--it was just that you were tired?  You're saying you were tired [laughs]--you're [unclear]--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had enough of that pressure.  I don't know, it was just, it was a lot of pressure, you know, being--trying to play major college basketball and get through an academically challenging institution.  It's hard.  And obviously, a lot of my peers went on to grad school, so I can't, you know, complain too much.  But I didn't feel--I've never felt the need to do what everyone else does.  And I remember having conversations with friends like that, saying, you know you've got to go to law school.  That's what everyone else is doing, and, you know, you at least got to go to business school, whatever, you know.  I wasn't interested so I wasn't gonna do it.
Story_ID: 12537
Speaker 1: You were what--with William Blair [& Company] how long?
Speaker 2: Two and a half years.
Speaker 1: So what made you even think that you would branch out on your own.  I mean what, what made you, one, decide that this environment was not as conducive as you would want or what made you see the opportunity?  It was one of the--.
Speaker 2: I think I, I--I think being here in Chicago [Illinois], you looked around.  You saw all these great entrepreneurs.  John Johnson with 'Ebony' [magazine] and 'JET' [magazine] and Johnson Publishing [Company], and George Johnson with Afro Sheen and, you know, Johnson Products [Co.].  Tom Burrell of Burrell Advertising [sic. Burrell Communications Group], Al Johnson, Al Johnson Cadillac.  You had this, all these role models.  And in each case, they were folks who had a, a particular niche that they were really good at and had built wonderful businesses around it, around them.  So I think I, I think I soaked that up.  And my parents [John W. Rogers, Sr. and Jewel Stradford Lafontant-MANkarious] were entrepreneurs.  And they were legal entrepreneurs. So I said, I've got this, you know, this love of the stock market.  Maybe I can build a business around it, having unique focus like these other folks have done, start early like they did.  If you look in the history of those entrepreneurs, they all started when they were young.  They got out ahead of the competition, ahead of the curve, you know, had the courage to sort of go against the grain in their generation.  So I said, well, I've got this expertise.  So I'll do this in the investment world.  So I think that was the role modeling that was there.  I thought there'd probably be some opportunities from some of the diversity initiatives going on in the, in the country and in the city, and maybe you could get in the door a little early, maybe get a shot, someone would give you a chance to manage money a little earlier.  So that was the--so I saw a little bit of the marketing niche there.  But at the end of the day, I had an investment strategy and philosophy of small and mid-cap value investing that I thought really would work.  And I wanted to test it against the big guys.  It's kind of like I wanted to go play basketball against the big guys and see where I, how I could do.  Well, I had an investment strategy that I was developing, and I wanted to go out and compete with the other firms that were out there.  And so I think put it together, you know.  And there's sort of this atmosphere of entrepreneurialism, this marketing opportunity was there and this competitive spirit around an investment strategy that I believed in deeply.  I think the three of them came together to help push me over the edge to start a firm.
Speaker 1: And who did you consult with when you were thinking about this?  Did you consult--you consulted with your mother, right?
Speaker 2: I consulted with both my parents, and my mom a lot because she was so encouraging.  And my father wasn't discouraging, but my mom was always like, again, everything's possible.  Go for it.  And so we talked a lot.  She had a dinner party where I met Floyd Brown, a well-known radio announcer.  And Floyd was on the board of a publicly traded mutual fund company, the Selected Funds.  And every few, even now, African Americans are on the board of mutual funds.  And at this dinner, we started talking about it.  And he said, "I'll take you to lunch and introduce you to all the legal counsel who could help show you some of the ropes of how to start a money management and mutual fund company."  And we went to lunch at the Palmer House [Hilton, Chicago, Illinois], and that was a real catalyst 'cause now I had sort of a, a real live person who had, who had done this who could help me.  And then Ned Genada (ph.) was great.  He helped me meet with the people at William Blair [& Company] to--they have a money management and mutual fund operation there.  And I met with those people.  And I met with a friend of Ned's who had a money management firm that was independent from Blair.  And he set up an interview there, and I went over and talked to him.  And so those were the folks that really helped give me some of the feel of how to, you could possibly do this, how you could set up a money management company and a mutual fund company.  It wasn't a lot of, I, I think I also talked to, I went to talk to John Johnson.  And I, and I had some discussion with him.  And, but there hadn't a minority, and there'd never been African-American owned money management and mutual fund company in the country.  So there wasn't a lot of precedent for one to be able to, to help.  But--.
Speaker 1: Or even more, maybe understand what you were talking about too.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean except starting your own thing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 12538
Speaker 1: I'm also curious--how did you identify the small cap [small market capitalization] area, you know?  How did you, say, you know, you said, I sort of saw this, but where were you seeing that within the scheme of William Blair [& Company] or in the scheme of the market?
Speaker 2: That's an important point.  I had two things that happened at the same time.  I, early in my career, I, you know, I was working at William Blair.  And they focused on smaller companies that could grow twelve to fifteen percent a year, often based in the Midwest.  And that was--and so I believe that there was a--Mr. Blair had made the case that smaller companies could grow consistently, more rapidly than larger companies that were too bureaucratic.  And so I bought into this sense that smaller was better.  The other part though that I did do, which was relatively unique at the time and different than where I was, what was called a value manager or a contrarian manager.  So I bought small stocks while they were out of favor, not small stocks while they were popular.  And I'd learned about value investing while I was at Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] through things that I had to read as part of, being an economics major and read a book called, 'The Random Walk Down Wall Street' by Burt Malkiel  who was a professor there at Princeton, and started reading everything I could on value investing and reading about the lives of value investors and contrary thinkers, the people who had made money by going against the grain, by buying things that everyone else had sold.  I remember reading a story about John Templeton when I was twenty-two, the great international investor, world-class international investor, who talked about the fact that he bought stocks right after World War II broke out, right after the fighting started.  He went in and started buying stock during the midst of the war scare and how well that paid off 'cause he had the courage to buy against the grain.  He went into Japan when Japan wasn't well and got in early and made a fortune.  He made the case that if you want to get above average returns, you couldn't do the same thing that average people were doing.  It was just common sense, John Templeton would say.  And then Warren Buffet was a, and learned about him, and Warren was a great value investor, a great contrary thinker.  And he bought American Express and Washington Post while they were out of favor and made a fortune and other great companies.  So what I try to do is blend the best of both worlds, find these good, small companies that were unrecognized, that could grow faster than big ones, and buy them when they were out of favor and create an investment strategy around that.  There were a few people trying to do that then, but not a whole lot.
Speaker 1: Who were those people?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a guy named Chuck Royce, who had The Royce Funds, a guy named 'Ab' [Albert] Nicholas up in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] who had the Nicholas Funds.  There was a guy named Charles Almond who writes a newsletter still called 'Growth Stock Outlook'.  Those were sort of the three most prominent small cap value managers of the day.  And actually, they're still all around.  And there was a guy, Ralph Wanger, in Chicago [Illinois] who ran the [Columbia] Acorn [Family of] Funds.  And these were all sort of world-class small cap value people that are still in existence, you know, twenty, twenty-five years later.  So they were, they were also kind of role models for what I was trying to do.
Speaker 1: Now, you didn't feel, and was that--this approach, was it contrary, you said some of that was being done with them, William Blair, but was it contrary?  Did you ever think about trying to do it within the context of that environment?
Speaker 2: If they had offered me an opportunity to, to move from being a stockbroker to being in their investment management or mutual fund area, I would have probably considered it.  But from the very beginning, I had a different approach.  I liked the small cap part, and what they, they were doing, but I was a contrary thinker.  I was a value person.  They were small cap growth.  So I was offering them my own original research.  You were supposed to work off the William Blair buy list and tell your clients about what William Blair liked.  I went out and found my stocks and did my own research and got on the plane and went to visit companies, you know, at twenty-two and twenty-three, that had nothing to do with Blair, but they were small companies that were out of favor.  So that was really un--unique, you know, for the young, for the young kid on the block to go out and create their own ideas totally different from what the firm was recommending.  That's kind of the way I was.  I was a sort of, independent that way.
Speaker 1: And let me--besides, you know, in terms of economic theorists, were there other people influencing you at the time, that would have, you know, would get you to that value investing?  Were there other people that you had studied that, you know--?
Speaker 2: There was, there were books out, actually just coincidentally when I was at the right time at the right place and there was a book called 'The Money Masters' by John Train that outlined the lives of great, like nine great investors or twelve great investors or whatever.  And most of those great investors were value people.  Benjamin Graham, who wrote a classic on value investing was featured in the book.  And a guy named Phil Fisher, who had a lot of influence on Warren Buffet's thinking, you know, he's little more growth oriented.  And the book just, it was just a classic.  It's so--and it's been reprinted several times.  Interestingly, both these books that had so much impact on my life are still very popular today.  Either they've updated or, you know, reissued and people still talk about them.  And I read them, read about them at that time.  David Dreman  wrote a book called 'The Contrarian Investment Strategist' or 'Contrary Investment Strategy' or what have you, and he's had his book reprinted several times.  And the the 'New Contrary Investment Strategy', you know [laugher].  And so during that time in my life when I was forming my values, it was a time when people were writing about these great value folks.  And they were all coming of age, and I just clicked with them. I think I'm a natural, independent thinker.  I'm a natural contrarian, and so I clicked with these things that I was reading.  As Warren Buffet says, "It's like an inoculation.  It either takes or it doesn't."  You can't, you can't make a growth person a value person, and a value person, a growth person.  You either are or you're not.
Story_ID: 12539
Speaker 1: Here's a young African American person looking at stock investment in the value area, I mean that's, you know, that's--it's like it's a mountain, you know, going up a mountaintop, especially when you're trying to look at developing a client base, you know, starting a firm and getting people to believe in you and what you, you know, want to do.  So, let me--so you go and you, you know, sort of test the idea.  And you say that, Mr. [Floyd] Brown, was also--you know, he was helpful--,
Speaker 2: Mh-hm.
Speaker 1: --and Ned Genada (ph.), so at what point do you, you know, your theme is, you know, sort--I mean how did you come up with the name of the company, John, you know, slow and steady and how did you come up with the theme?
Speaker 2: Well, the name of the company [Ariel Capital Management Company] is just a favorite name of mine.  It had no particular meaning.  It was a character on a television show from long ago, and I just liked the way Ariel sounded.  And I always told myself, if I have daughter, I'll name her Ariel.  But I had the company before I had my daughter and so I came up with the name Ariel.
Speaker 1: But this character, what character was this, from--you said it was a--.
Speaker 2: It was just a, just a--it wasn't, it has no relevance to anything, yeah.  But then the issue of the--we started a newsletters when we were trying to get the company rolling in 1983, we started a newsletter called 'The Patient Investor'.  And the idea, I think, was that I believed in long-term, patient investing.  And I kind of thought this was a good message to send out to the world, that patient investing works, but also, here I am, I'm young.  And people think that young people are gonna be real risky and gun slingers and out there, you know, trying to get rich quick, which is the natural, sort of way that people view young investors.  So I thought having this theme of patience would help to get people more comfortable, and it was true to my investment strategy.  And then I thought, well, let's have a logo.  I also, and I thought that would be good.  And so I thought the tortoise and the hare story really made sense and the slow and steady wins the race and would, would sort of maybe resonate with people and help to create this theme.  And I think it's actually worked really well.  The turtle has become I think, you know, central to what we do and the message that we're trying to deliver to, to potential clients and mutual fund shareholders and the like.
Speaker 1: But that's, you know, that's very purposeful for a twenty-two--I mean for a young person.  That's very purposeful, strategic positioning [laughter].
Speaker 2: Yeah, to--.
Speaker 1: I mean when you look at it in hindsight is what I'm saying.
Speaker 2: It's probably one of those things I am proud of is that the idea of the patient investor and the idea of the tortoise with the loving cup, will sort of show people that slow and steady does really win the raise.  The part--I do feel good about that 'cause it's the kind of thing, I just sort of created that idea, and I think it's, it seems like, it's stood the test of time.  But then every once in a while, you get an idea that seems to work, you know, it's like--.
Story_ID: 12540
Speaker 1: Who did you assemble as your original team [at Ariel Capital Management Company]?  And how did you go about recruiting?
Speaker 2: I had a good friend from the University of Chicago Lab School [Chicago, Illinois] who I knew had helped to start some other small businesses.  Her name is Jessica Burger.  She was a really good friend of mine.  She'd gone to Oberlin College [Oberlin, Ohio], and she just had this roll of two or three different places where she'd helped to get a small company started.  So I asked her to come and join me, and it was the two of us.  She was there to make sure that we got everything working, you know, that the phones worked, and we could send out the mail.  And we had an address and had office furniture and all that kind of thing.  She got all the details done for us.  And then while I was out trying to get clients and trying to research companies, she was there holding down the fort, that first, that first year because I had a real job in the beginning to--also I had to find investors to help, you know, capitalize the company.  And so it was a lot to do.  And so it was great having somebody you really trusted back there and having someone I knew from the Lab school.  It just was terrific.  I mean it's really important--I tell people all the time, if you're an entrepreneur, you need to not try to do too much yourself.  Have people you can lean on and that that really helps a lot.
Story_ID: 12541
Speaker 1: And during that initial, that first year period [of Ariel Capital Management Company], what were some of the, you think the important building blocks that happened in that first year.
Speaker 2: I think the most important thing was we got the theme going with the patient investor.  And then secondly, we got some money to manage.  It wasn't a lot.  Howard University [Washington, D.C.] gave us I think $100,000 to manage out of their endowment.  John Johnson and George Johnson gave us some money, out of their, different pots of money that they controlled.  A few other folks came through with money to invest.  So we actually had, I think at the end of the first year, we had $750,000 under management.  But the main thing is that I had something that was real that I was managing, that I could deliver a track record, that I can use to market the firm going forward.  So $750,000 sounds like a lot, but the fees on that were $7,500 a year, one percent is typically what we get paid in our business.  So I wasn't gonna pay the bills off of that, but I had established an ability to create a real, live track record, and that's what, I think those were the things that were accomplished, the brand name, The patient investor, and money to manage.
Speaker 1: And you did okay the first year too.  Well, this is 19, what?  What year is this?
Speaker 2: Started in January of '83 [1983].
Speaker 1: '83, okay.  Wasn't there--wasn't a recession--?
Speaker 2: The economy was just coming, in early, it was just ending and coming, starting to come out of it.  You know, it would have been perfect timing to start in the summer '82 [1982] if you'd been perfect because you'd already have six months of recovery, kind of by the time I got started.  The stock market, especially had recovered, and I think the economy right behind it.  You know, the market often goes up before the economy does, so the stock market was starting to creep up in the middle of '82 [1982], and then the economy followed right behind that.
Speaker 1: Now, so that first year, were you able with that, you know, that money that you got, were you able to prove the concept in the first year or was it holding [unclear]?
Speaker 2: It took three years before people took you seriously.  I mean you knew that.  So, I don't think I proved the concept.  But people could see, I think people can see when they're dealing with someone who's serious what they're doing in their business life.  And I think people could see, I believed, I was sincere, and, and the concept had some legitimacy.  But still they want to see some staying power, and you have to build a three-year track record before anyone gives you any serious money.  I often tell people that one thing to remember is that [ Illinois state senate president] Cecil Partee got the municipal employees of Chicago [Illinois] to give us a million dollars to manage in 1984.  And then [ Cook County Illinois Board president] John Stroger helped get the county to give us money in 1985.  So those were some of the accounts that were coming in year two and early in year three that helped give you some momentum after that first year was real slow, just as we anticipated.
Speaker 1: But that, even that, those were impression amounts given the time, though, a million dollars is no small--I mean it's play money for--in the whole scheme of things, but it's no small amount of money.
Speaker 2: No, it was a million dollars out of a, out of a billion dollar pension fund they had at the time.  And it was important to us.  And so it was a milestone.  So I always, always remembered that and always appreciated it.
Speaker 1: So you reached that in your second year, that milestone?
Speaker 2: My first million-dollar account.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But we, the main thing that didn't go so well is we spent money faster than we thought.  So our seed capital started to dissipate quicker than we anticipated.  And we had to go back to all of our original investors and ask for more capital to keep us in business that second year.
Speaker 1: How much were you seeding?  Oh, shoot, oh, we can't--how much we--okay, how much were seeding?  What was your initial pot that you raised?
Speaker 2: It was about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars or something.
Speaker 1: In what increments?
Speaker 2: Oh, we'd go, it was just, we went to people and asked for ten to twenty thousand dollars, and then we went again forty thousand dollars from--we'll do the research on that number.

Story_ID: 12570
Speaker 1: Now, last time when we stopped you had--you were actually in your first few years of operation [Ariel Capital Management Company], where you were, you know, you were talking actually about the first year where you, I think--or first couple of years where you raised a million dollars.  You had been able to get that under management.  And I want to talk to you about, or have you talk about still some of those early years and some of the things that happened, you know, or that were important building blocks to sort of build Ariel, if you could sort of go back to that.
Speaker 2: Okay. Well, in 1984 after we'd been in business for about eighteen months was when we had our first opportunity to make a presentation to the city pension fund here in Chicago [Illinois].  The largest city pension fund was the Municipal Employees of Chicago [Municipal Employees Annuity and Pension Fund of Chicago], and it was a five-person board of trustees representing employees and retirees and then some city officials.  The city treasurer at the time was an ex officio member of the board, and his name was Cecil Partee.  He was a famous, a very successful African American political leader in Chicago.  And he knew my family, knew me from growing up, watched me grow up.  And he gave us the opportunity to come in and make a presentation to the Municipal Employees of Chicago.  They gave us a million dollars to manage.  And they had about a billion-dollar pension fund.  So a million dollars wasn't a lot of money to them, but it was very, very significant to us.  It was a breakthrough account for us.  And so I always, have always valued the efforts that Cecil Partee made on our behalf to get in front of the right people, to get into the door to tell our story.
Speaker 1: And, John, what did that, I mean I know that he was a friend of the family, but did he give any instructions about, you know, what you should and should do in terms of the presentation and--well, his, you know, in his--was there any of that, any guidance along the way, you know, in terms of, you know, we're giving this, but, you know, this is, these are--not that there's quid pro--I wasn't talking about quid pro quo, but advice for you in terms of, you know, make sure you don't mess up with this money [laughter], that type of thing, even though it wasn't a small amount, but still a significant amount for a small firm and for a black firm.
Speaker 2: My recollection is that Treasurer Partee didn't give me any specific advice on how to make the presentation.  But I do recall the consultant, a man named Ed Burke, who was not the [Chicago] alderman Ed Burke, but a person who had a consulting firm that helped the municipal employees hire and fire portfolio management companies.  And I remember Ed Burke giving me advice before the meeting and then after the meeting on how I could have made the presentation differently.  I know also there that after the meeting, Treasurer Partee called my father [John W. Rogers, Sr.] and talked about how he could have cried because he was so proud and how thrilled he was to be able to open up this door for us.  He'd been waiting for someone like me to come along he said.  And so, it was really--it seemed like it was something that was meaningful to him at the time 'cause there finally was an African American firm that he could be helpful to, and to get the door open for.
Speaker 1: That's sort of amazing when you think about, you know, his background and even the fact that he couldn't go to law school in Arkansas, you know, and they had to ship him out of state.  So he went to Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois], you know. So--but what did Ed Burke, what did he--what advice did he have for you?
Speaker 2: I recall in those early years the main advice was just to keep things simple and to try to make sure that we kept people oriented in the presentation books.  It was very specific to making a presentation to a pension fund because you wanted to make sure that these were folks who were busy.  They're seeing lots and lots of portfolio managers, and you want to help them through the presentation book, to make sure they understood exactly where you were and to break it down to simplistic terms so they really understood what you were talking about, that you weren't using too much industry jargon and too much Wall Street jargon.
Speaker 1: And is that, has that advice stood you well over time?
Speaker 2: I often do think about Ed Burke's advice.  I've stayed in touch with him over the years, and he still is the consultant for the Municipal Employees which is still our largest account.  And it's some very, very valuable information.  It sort of fits with my own instincts to keep things simple, not make things too complicated.  But the idea of reinforcing it was very important and then also helping you to understand, you need to show people what page you're on in the book and what part of the page you're on in the book, and be very consistent with how you communicate ideas.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the role of consultants during those early years because a lot of times people don't necessarily think, they wouldn't think of hiring a consultant to make a presentation like that?
Speaker 2: Well, the consultant was hired by the municipal employees, so they--and back in the early '80's [1980s], most of the big public pension funds, and a lot of the big corporate pension funds started hiring pension fund consultants to help them evaluate whether to hire and fire a money management firm.  And so Ed was ahead of his time, one of the early ones, but now almost all big pension funds have outside consultants, especially public pension funds.  And actually university endowments almost always use consultants to help them pick which money managers to hire.
Speaker 1: And with--you say they're still your largest account.  How has it grown over the years?
Speaker 2: From that original million dollars, which they gave us to--gave it to us in three increments with three hundred thousand dollars or so in each increment.  Now, it's over four hundred and fifty million dollars the last, the last I looked.
Story_ID: 12571
Speaker 1: Are there any spurts along the way in Ariel's [Capital Management Company, Chicago, Illinois] growth in terms of how it went from a million [dollars] to four hundred and fifty million [dollars] which is very substantial.  But do you know, are there significant periods that it grew or did it grow gradually over time?
Speaker 2: Well, with the Municipal Employees [Annuity and Pension Fund of Chicago] account, it was like a lot of accounts were they gave us a small amount to start, to see how we did.  And then after we sort of showed that we could give good performance and good service and present the same way all the other firms did, they gave us pretty hefty increases, increases in those early years.  And then, now, the magic of compounding over having an account now eighteen years, it can become quite large because if you're growing money 15 percent a year over eighteen years, it can get to be a big number.  So those early years were when some clients gave us nice increases because all of a sudden we proved ourselves after they gave us an initial amount sort of as a starter account.
Speaker 1: Cecil Partee would be very proud.  He'd be really crying.  He would.
Story_ID: 12572
Speaker 1: What were the other important sort of, you know, building blocks in those first years, you know, or people that were helpful?
Speaker 2: I, also, I guess that, that in that same timeframe, we got a chance to make a presentation to John Stroger, who was at the time, the chairman of the finance committee for the Cook County [Illinois] Board.  He set up a meeting right away with the comptroller for the county pension fund and got us a presentation in front of the county pension fund.  And so president Stroger was helpful in getting us a second large public pension fund account, I think about a year after we got the Municipal Employees [of the city of Chicago, Illinois] account.  And I think that you, over time, it's, you know, as I think back, there are some African American leaders who really were very supportive of us.  John Johnson gave us a small amount of money to manage.  George Johnson gave us a small amount of money to manage out of the George E. Johnson Foundation, the community dollars that he was overseeing at the time.  And those were good names to have on your client list.  So even though the dollars might not have been huge, it was something that gave us momentum and some confidence that the future could be better.  And, and it gave you dollars to build a track record with.  So I'm always very, very appreciative of that.
Speaker 1: You know, I'm curious also about your--when, in keeping it simple, with Ed Burke's recommendation, did you describe really your contrarian view of investing or was that sort of the, you know, the--you know, cause you had said, I--my approach was a contrarian, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, was that explained or it wasn't explained in the whole thing of, you know, 'cause the other was slow and steady, you know, wins the race.  So what were you really, when you were presenting, what were you presenting?
Speaker 2: Back in those days, you were presenting a very brief track record, but a strong belief in value investing in small and mid-sized companies, same thing we do today.  And we did talk about the importance of being able to be contrary in your thinking 'cause that's what value investors do.  They buy when others are selling, and they sell when others are buying.  And they just have this natural instinct to go against the grain.  So I'm sure I, I talked about that in those early presentations, and talked about role models and examples of other great investors who had been successful by going against the grain.
Story_ID: 12573
Speaker 1: Now, who in the majority community was helpful to you during that time as well?
Speaker 2: Well, most--primarily, I always went back to Ned Genada (ph.), the managing partner at William Blair [& Company], who when I told him I was going to leave William Blair after two and a half years, spent quality time with me, helped give me advice and thoughts and really opened up the firm to anyone I wanted to go and talk to, to get advice of how they did things there at William Blair.  He was there for me.  He also set up a meeting with a guy named John Maibe (ph.) who had a money management firm that was small in town, and who had set it up and built the firm from scratch like I was gonna try to do.  So Ned set that meeting up.  And then Ned was always there along the way if I had--needed advice or, or questions addressed.  There were a few other people like that, Jim O'Connor, who at the time was the CEO [Chief Executive Officer] and chairman of Commonwealth Edison [Company].  He was always someone who you could go and talk to if you, if you needed advice.  And I got to know Jim being on the board of the Chicago Urban League, and he was just again, very, very helpful.
Story_ID: 12574
Speaker 1: What about your [Ariel Capital Management Company] board and the formation of your board and how that whole thing, you know, how it came about and, I mean who you went after?
Speaker 2: I went after, at the time, which you know you learn as time goes on, I went after, I guess a couple people.  I went after people who had invested in Ariel, who had helped giving us the seed capital to start the company.  So those folks that had written the larger checks and had been more generous with the support of starting the firm when I was starting the firm, I asked to join the board.  And friends, people that I had grown up with, who I knew I could, I thought I could trust, and who I thought would be also good ambassadors for the firm.  And so I went to some of those sort of younger entrepreneurs or friends that I had confidence in.
Speaker 1: So who was the initial board?
Speaker 2: Well, the initial board, I can't remember them all, but there's Dr.--people that were real active, Dr. Herbert Odom, who's a well-known dentist and boxer and entrepreneur and business leader and civil rights leader.  A man named Tony Davidson whose father had been a very successful investor and had invested a lot of money in helping us start the company.  Another very active member at the time was Howard Bond, who was related to Julian Bond, the head of a--was a very, a very good entrepreneur around in the Chicagoland [Illinois] area.  Also, I think at the time we had Linda Johnson Rice, who I'd gone to grade school with, was on the board for a while.  Eric Johnson who I knew well, had been on the board for a little while.  And Dr. Bowman, James E. Bowman, Valerie Jarrett's father has been on the board from the very beginning and, and still is.  And as the years have gone on, the board's evolved, but Dr. Bowman's probably the longest reigning board member that's still active on the board.
Story_ID: 12575
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your mother and her role that she, you know, she helped play.
Speaker 2: My mom [Jewel Stradford Lafontant-MANkarious] played probably four roles at least.  Number one, she was my lawyer.  Number two, she was a board member.  Number three, she was very active in opening up doors, you know, with places or people that she knew.  You know, as you know, half the battle in life, as Reverend [Jesse] Jackson [Sr.] says, you just got to get on the playing field.  And if you get on the playing field and have a chance to play, often good things will happen to you.  And so she was often good at getting a door opened for me.  And then of course, she was always there as a sounding board, as someone to get advice and thoughts on, and we would, you know, debate and argue and wrestle with, you know, some of the kind of decisions that I had to make.  And she was there to help me think through some of those strategic issues that I was facing as we built the firm.
Speaker 1: And I think she also, she probably also helped in relationship building during those years too, right, John, in some respects?
Speaker 2: Well, she opened up some of those early doors, and partly, you know, it's interesting--she, of course, was also one of our early investors, as well as my father [John W. Rogers, Sr.], but the other thing, you look at a person like [Illinois state senate president] Cecil Partee.  Well, my parents sent me to a grade school called Harvard St. George [Chicago, Illinois].  Well, I was in the same first grade class and second grade class with [Cecil Partee's daughter] Cecile Partee, who I went, you know.  So you spend eight years together growing, you know, you--I taught Cecile to walk when she was, you know, nine months old.  And so you had these long-term relationships based upon sometimes family and opportunities and you get sent to the right schools, and your parents sacrifice to send you to the right schools, and you happen to meet people along the way.  So those are the kind of doors that she opened, and my father opened by creating the opportunity for me to be at the right place at the right time, to meet the right people.  And have that long relationship where people knew that, you know, that they could, had the sense that I was gonna be a straight, straight arrow because my parents have been straight arrows and had been good at what they did.
Speaker 1: Now, you father, let's talk about him during this time.  What role was he playing and, you know, even thinking back to the fact that he's the one who actually got you started.
Speaker 2: His role, he was always a little more skeptical about the business idea than my fath--than my mother was.  He was always like thinking, oh, are you sure you want to do this, leave a good job at William Blair and start a company.  It's so hard.  And he just didn't quite get it, for sure.  You know, he was very skeptical, but he did invest in the company, and, of course, he was always generous with the doors that he could open up.  And, you know, and sometimes you got on the playing field and got the account and sometimes you didn't.  But I think one of the things, you do ride on the shoulders of our parents in ways because their reputation, you know, proceeds you.  And my father was always known for being very straightforward, being very honest, always living up to his commitments.  And so therefore, I think that people have an expectation, they could count on me.  And they could see that, you know, I meant what I said, and those things were important.  So he set the stage I think, in those kind of ways.
Story_ID: 12576
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask the question about what were the next sort, you know, next significant building block in Ariel's, you know, in the life of the company [Ariel Capital Management Company, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Well, I think as the years rolled forward from 1983 to 1984, we just sort of slowly but surely built, 1985 and '86 [1986].  I think the major next big shift came in 1987 when the market crashed in October of 1987.  We did what we were supposed to do.  We bought more on the way down because we're contrarians.  We're value folks.  And it was a way for us to show clients in real time what we were made of, that, instead of sitting on our hands and waiting for the dust to settle when the market was collapsing, we were in there buying.  We were in there calling clients and saying send us more money.  We have so many great bargains we want to buy.  And I think that set the stage where they could see that we did what we promised we were gonna do. And then that set up for good performance in 1987 and in 1988 because we had bought while others were selling.  And so this first test, we kind of passed it, had good performance and ended up being in the top ten in the country in performance in 1988, got to be Mutual Fund Manager of the Year in 'Sylvia Porter's [Personal Finance] Magazine' at the time, for the good performance in '88 [1988], after a good '87 [1987].  So I think that--people were waiting to see how you did.  And now, all of a sudden we've got a five-year track record that had gone through a major storm.  I think that was probably the key thing that was, gave us the leg up to--now, lots of people wanted to give us the chance to manage money.
Speaker 1: Now, 1987, was it the opportunity that you were really waiting for, I mean, in many ways?  Was there any pause, I'm saying, when, you know, when you saw, when the market was going, was there any pause about what direction and, but, or did you just immediately leap in?
Speaker 2: [Laughter] I'd like to say, that immediately leapt in, or jumped in, but you had to think, you know, and you had to pause and collect your thoughts.  But it was pretty clear to me that it, if you're a contrarian and everyone thinks the world's coming to an end, you, you're not get a brighter light than that, that was gonna, you know, a brighter signal than this was a time to buy.  And stocks that you liked the day before at sixteen, and they're now selling at eighteen--starting to sell at eight.  They had dropped 50 percent in a matter of hours, if you truly were a value person, you had to be in there buying.  So again, you paused for a moment, collected your thoughts and said, this is what we have to do.  There's no doubt about it, and I just wish we had done more.
Story_ID: 12577
Speaker 1: Now, your [Ariel Capital Management Company] team had also changed then too, John, some.  Weren't you on sort of a second reiteration of your staff or team in 1987?
Speaker 2: We were just, just getting there.  Eric McKissack, our vice chairman had started in 1986.  And we were starting to build a new level and quality of the organization.  And, and Eric was the springboard for that.
Speaker 1: And his coming on, you had, I think told some of the story, but his coming on was pretty significant in that, you know, here he was with a major, you know, institution and for him to take, you know, and here you are younger than he is, you know, and for him to sort of take the leap off, you know.  He saw opportunity, but it was a risk for him in his career, in hindsight.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.  Eric made a courageous decision and Eric was so well respected in the financial community and around Chicago [Illinois] broadly, but also in the African American community well liked.  It really helped to put us on the map and to get people to see, see that we were a serious firm, and we were gonna go out and build a team.  It wasn't just about me, but it was about building an organization to deliver good service and products and performance to our customers.
Speaker 1: And that really has been a theme of yours, John, in terms of, you know, you'll advise me, hire the best, you know, go take a risk, you know, make things happen, you know if you're-- in order to show that you're really serious about things.  Now, but what is this sort of second reiteration that he was the beginning of in terms of team building.
Speaker 2: Well, I just think that it was a time because now we'd been in business for five years.  Well, as, as we went from '86 [1986] to '88 [1988], all of a sudden you'd been in business for five years.  And so you could go out and try to attract a higher level of talent.  And people could see a track record there and that was demonstrated.  So we added, you know, Dorease Wright (ph.), who's our head of marketing.  We added, hired a trader, Nancy Harringer (ph.), who had been at William Blair [& Company, Chicago, Illinois].  We brought on people who were, could help us do the things we needed to do, whether that was research or portfolio, accounting or whether it was the, the finance and administration and the marketing side, all aspects of the business we had to build.
Speaker 1: And did he--the other thing I want to ask about Eric at the time, I'm sure you had a lot of discussions leading up to him coming on, but had he also shared your belief in value investing or was it something that you were, you know, explaining to him, and he had been sort of on the other side.
Speaker 2: I would--I think he got it.  I think he had been an analyst at First Chicago investment advisors working on food and consumer stocks, is my recollection.  And so he was, he was very focused on the industries and the companies that he followed, versus some overall philosophical set of beliefs.  But First Chicago had a value bend to what they, they did at the time, is my recollection.  And so Eric seemed to fit right in with it.
Story_ID: 12578
Speaker 1: And so in 1988 when you become Mutual Fund of the Year, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was ['Sylvia Porter's Personal Finance Magazine'] Mutual Fund Manager of the Year, and there's, there's, I was Co-Mutual Fund Manager of the Year.
Speaker 1: And so that's a big deal.  That sort of sets you up.  It validates your approach, you know, that you'd been taking.  It gives you heightened awareness because there are not many blacks actually out here.  This is a new area, right.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So what are the, what are the--I want to say the things that came out of that?  What developed out of that in terms of sort of your next sort of stretch of years?  1988, you still have--you were, at that time you were, you were always politically involved, right, in some respects?  But this is--was Harold--in 1988 Harold Washington [died 1987] was--well was he still mayor [of Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: He was still, probably--,
Speaker 1: I think he was--.
Speaker 2: --'cause Mayor [Richard M.] Daley was elected '89 [1989] and Gene Sawyer was elected, for how long was he the mayor ?
Speaker 1: For a year.
Speaker 2: For a year, so.  Maybe a little more [1987-1989].
Speaker 1: Maybe a little more.
Speaker 2: So Harold, probably--around that time?
Speaker 1: Mm-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you're still very much concentrating on your business, but I'm just trying to understand or have you articulate what other forces were sort of interacting--it's not the John of today.  You know, you are very civically involved, but you were--actually--had to be very hands-on with your business at this point, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But you're traveling around to different cities and making presentations, and so what are the other steps along the way because at one point, at some point there were other people who are wanting to emulate you and starting other John-like firms.
Speaker 1: Yeah,  I was thinking about it, actually, a lot of firms started around the period of '88 [1988], '89 [1989], a lot of other African American firms.  I think the, the first couple--Eddie Brown had started in 1983 right after we did, I think NCM Capital [Management Group], Maceo [K.] Sloan's firm, started in 1986.  Then there was a real rush of people coming in, in the late '80's [1980s].  And we all formed an organization called The National Association of Securities Professionals, and then Maceo had a spin-off group called NIMA, the National Investment Managers [sic, Manager] Association or something like that.  And so all of a sudden we're all meeting together regularly.  [Atlanta, Georgia mayor] Maynard Jackson was involved, and it was kind of a dynamic growth period for African Americans--African American money management firms.  I think it was also a time where a lot of people got in it because they thought it was a way to, to get rich quick, that it didn't have the risks and volatility of the brokerage industry or the public finance industry.  And so it was kind of fun being sort of the, the--as Maceo used to call me, the grandfather of the industry, even though I was, you know, pretty young in 1988 and '89 [1989] and seeing the industry really explode.  There were lots of conferences to go to, and you got to build relationships with trustees all around the country, and all the other portfolio management firms.  And so you're just busy.  You're visiting companies to do research.  You're out on the road seeing clients and prospects.  So it was a very, very, busy, busy time, that you're starting to building and had opportunities to grow.
Speaker 2: Who were the other people besides Maceo and Maynard Jackson who were important in that organization?
Speaker 1: The National Association of Security Professionals [NASP] was founded by Don Davidson, who's here in Chicago [Illinois], was a part of it.  And there was an African American woman named Joyce Johnson who was a broker at A.G. Edwards [& Sons, Inc.].  And there was a woman named Irene Elmore, who was a stockbroker and Travers [J.] Bell, you know, the, the great leader from the brokerage community.  And I remember those early meetings, Clark Burrus was very involved.  And so I was right there in the very beginning of it.  It was just, it was really quite exciting to see it all come together.  And there was a lot of discussions at the time about whether this was for minority firms or, or people of color in majority firms.  And there was a big debates about that.  And it came to--and Maynard [Jackson], using his political skills, got a compromise where every two years you'd have a new chairman who came from--you know, if the, if the current chairman was from African American firm, then the next chairman would come from a majority institution and then just rotate from there.  And it's still going strong.
Speaker 2: Was there a lot of networking during that time period 'cause also you have more people coming into leadership within cities or government, you know, that are controlling some of these funds, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And people, and, you know, and we've had a black mayor in Chicago [Illinois], but there are other, you know, other things like that happening around the country.  And your focus really too at that time was easier for firms like yourself to get government money, right?
Speaker 1: Well, it was an interesting dynamic because all of a sudden, at the same time we were having black mayors that were actively involved and they're appointing black trustees for the first time.  And the black trustees are starting to get empowered for the first time in public pension funds, you know, transit authorities, teachers, municipal workers, etc... At the same time, you had this proliferation of new competitors.  And everyone got into it, from Isaiah Thomas, the basketball player, to Henry Cisneros when he stopped being the mayor of San Antonio [Texas] to Federico Pena when he stopped being the mayor of Denver [Colorado].  You just had this explosion.  So these trustees were getting wined and dined by people of color, you know, from coast to coast.  So when you thought you might have a lot of opportunity, at the same time, you had a lot more competition.  And, you know, so there's pluses and minuses during that period.
Speaker 2: So did you ever think that I should have kept my little secret, my company secret [laughs] and I wouldn't spawned all these competitors?
Speaker 1: You think about it.  You know, maybe you shouldn't did that article, or be on the cover of 'Black Enterprise' or what have you cause everyone starts to think about it.
Speaker 2: And also, this was a new area for black people to get in and to excel.  I mean it was, it was even, the fact that even people were in the brokerage firms was, was a big deal.
Speaker 1: Yes.  In the beginning, you know, when the brokerage business started to boom in New York City [New York] in the late '60s [1960s] and the '70s [1970s], and there were several African Americans who got into the brokerage business.  And that evolved into public finance business.  So traditional broker dealers, there had been a history, but money management and mutual funds had been sort of last area that we hadn't touched.  And actually Maceo Sloan often talks about the fact that he went to his parent company, the people at North Carolina Mutual [Life Insurance Company] who were a long-time black insurance company and said well, here's John Rogers doing this, and he's with, you know, a little firm in Chicago [Illinois].  If he can gather all these assets, we should be doing this.  And I guess he'd been trying to pitch the idea for some time, and exactly as he said, as people saw that we were successful and Eddie Brown was being successful, it started to really ratchet up the interest around the country.
Speaker 2: So, how, John, were you able to differentiate yourself or was it just confusion for a little period of time with people, you know, using their own contacts, you know, within places and saying, well, you should do business with me, not with him.  He's in Chicago.  I mean how were you able to, you know, to sort of, you know, come above the crowd is what I'm saying?
Speaker 1: Well, at times during that time, it was hard sometimes to get above the crowd.  Sometimes you didn't you get the business you thought you deserved because it went to someone who had a better, deeper relationship, who had gotten to know the trustees better than you did.  But what we tried to do was we tried to show people that we were focused, that we cared deeply about small and mid-cap value investing.  And this is why we're in business.  So we were good at what we did, had a niche that we were getting better and better at.  And the second thing, you had performance.  We had a long enough track record, but that can go both ways.  So it's interesting.  When things are good, and you have a great track record, it's a wonderful selling tool.  If you go through a slump, and you have a bad year or period, then all of a sudden the firm that doesn't have a track record can sometimes have a leg up on you because they don't have any numbers and they can tell the story, you've got numbers, and they happen to be temporarily out of favor or not doing so well--you're not doing so well.  We've lost sometimes business to people who were fresh and new.  And that was kind of disturbing as we went into the early '90s [1990s].
Speaker 2: So that's what I'm saying cause you had really approached this, really from a substantive standpoint and a lot of times, with politics, you know, substance doesn't matter.  And so I was wondering in terms of what were you also learning about really being--fighting out there, I mean for business in many ways?
Speaker 1: Well, I think you learned--you learned, I think that--.
Speaker 2: To the victor goes the spoils [laughs], okay.
Speaker 1: You learn to be, to be disappointed a lot, you know, 'cause you find that sometimes people do see the substance that you were trying to build and understand what you were trying to do differently.  And that was disappointing.  It was all about the relationship at times.  And people didn't get it, that you were trying to build an organization, that you believed in what you were doing and you were gonna be in it for the long run.  And it wasn't just a, a new endeavor of a moment to try to figure out how to get rich as quickly as possible.  So it was just disappointing as you found that everyone didn't understand what you were trying to get accomplished.  But we weren't gonna change our stripes or do anything different, you know.  It just wasn't our culture.  It wasn't what we believed in.
Speaker 2: So who were you running neck and neck in competition with during those years?
Speaker 1: The firms came and went.  Some became very hot and then drifted away.  But the major player always was Maceo Sloan at NCM Capital during the late '80s [1980s], early '90s [1990s].  He was so aggressive.  He had this long, you know, history with North Carolina Mutual which his family had helped to be involved in and, and to run for a long period of time.  He broke sales--he had a sales operation that was national.  He put people on the ground, everywhere.  And so they had people who were just there getting to know the town, getting to know the people.  And that was hard to compete with.  And you'd come in and, you know, try to get--overcome that, it was very difficult.
Speaker 2: Did you ever think about merging during those years at all?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No, not at all.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No discussions.  Did anyone ever approach you during that time?
Speaker 1: People--well, Maceo every once in a while would come and talk [laughs].  And Maceo's very aggressive, and very strong and different times over the years, he suggested that we would have been good partners.
Story_ID: 12579
Speaker 1: This goes back to Ed Burke sort of, you know, with advice because as you, you know, grow and build things, sometimes you're learning important lessons along the way.  So I'm just wondering were there other things that you learned or that you found were sort of important?  And was this around the time that you were becoming a lot more civically active.  And I was wondering how that played vis-à-vis, you know, the growth of the firm or was that even conscious?
Speaker 2: The civic involvement, I'd been civically involved from the very beginning.  I joined the Urban League board in 1984 when I was--or, no, actually, 1982.  I was twenty-four years old when I got on the Urban League board.  I started working with, you know, [then Cook County Illinois State's Attorney] Rich [Richard M.] Daley in '82 [1982] and right around the same time, got to know [then Illinois state] senator Braun and [U.S. Senator] Bill Bradley.  And so a lot of my political, civic things that are really meaningful to me started around the same period.  And it was a part of the spirit of feeling that that's the way Chicago [Illinois] works.  And if you're gonna be involved in Chicago, that there's a connection between business and the civic life.  And it's expected of business leaders to be involved in the community and give back and, and help out.  And there are great role models, you know, if they were on the Urban League board, they were right there for you to look at, George Johnson was there, Ed Gardner was there, Jim O'Connor was there, Leo Mullen was there.  There were so many role models.  So that's how I got involved.  So it just sort of grew from there, but nothing really shifted as time went forward.
Speaker 1: But there are, there was a lot of, you know, bubbling act--activity around that time, and I'm just saying around the country.
Speaker 2: Well, an interesting thing happened You know, I started with these folks, as I mentioned earlier, and all of a sudden you get to the early '90s [1990s], late '80s [1980s] and then Rich Daley became the mayor [of Chicago] in 1989.  Well, I'd been helping him since '82 [1982].  And that was a, that was a good thing.  I--senator Braun became the [U.S.] Senator in 1992.  Well, I'd been a friend of hers for close to ten years at the time.  And Bill Bradley was in the [U.S.] Senate, and, you know, other leaders that I had been close to over the years, the John Strogers of the world, where you're gaining influence.  So there was a kind of a, a time in my life where everything seemed to be really clicking with my civic life and my business life and the, and the mayor being there was helpful because he ended up referring to the McCormick Place board and after that made me the president of the, of the park district here in Chicago [Illinois].  So I can see there was a sense that all of a sudden I was everywhere politically, but these were relationships that had gone back, often ten years or more, as you moved into the early '90s [1990s].
Story_ID: 12580
Speaker 1: Was there a strategy, you know, to say these are the funds or these are the markets that it's important for Ariel [Capital Management, Chicago, Illinois] to be present in?  You knew that you had significant presence here in Chicago.  But was New York on the game plan, you know, was Atlanta [Georgia], because [Atlanta,Georgia mayor] Maynard [Jackson] was there?  Was that important or was that--you know, what were the other places that you looked and said, you know, we need to be managing this fund or we need to be over here or we need to be there?  What were the key components that were discussed?
Speaker 2: I don't think we were as strategic as your question implies.  We went where the opportunities were.  And, at times, what would happen, once you got a beachhead in one city, you were there more often, so you stopped in to see more people, and good things happened.  So Detroit [Michigan] was one area for a while, but everything was terrific.  We had a couple of large public funds.  We had Ford Motor [Company].  We had Stroh Brewery [Company].  We had Chrysler [Corporation].  We were just, felt Detroit was our, you know, next to Chicago, was our best city.  For a while, we were doing great in Washington, D.C. and Maryland and similarly, sort of everything was really moving in the right direction.  But we just had gone where the opportunities are.  We've gone nationally and, but not really strategically to say we only go to one place or another.  But I do think that at different times in the firm's history, there seems to be a momentum that builds around a certain area.
Speaker 1: In 1989 though, when--how much were you managing in that year?  Do you remember? Hadn't you gotten up to--?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think.  I, I can't--.
Speaker 1: Was it later that you got to a billion dollars?  Was it after that?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.  It was, and we had a chart, but I don't have the chart in front of me.
Story_ID: 12581
Speaker 1: When you were elected to the [Chicago, Illinois] Park District Board, was that, was that an eye opening experience more than anything, you know, other civic involvement that you had?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a--it wasn't eye opening because I had been involved with government for a while, and I'd been on the board of a, what's called the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority, and I'd been on some other boards over time that were civic--city-connected.  But being president of a board was a whole new thing, you know, you're, 'cause you're in charge.  And it's a huge budget.  It's its own little government.  It had taxing authority.  There are nine museums on parkland that had partly a budget that came from the park district.  The Lincoln Park Zoo was a part of the park district, Soldier Field, your, your lakefront. I was a huge amount of responsibility.  And so you didn't worry a lot about it 'cause, you know, you wanted it to, to go well.  We would run into revelations where the, the--that there was a number of people who cared about the parks.  And there's so many civic groups and community groups who, you know, have real passionate beliefs about keeping the lakefront free and open and keeping the beaches clear and, you know, making sure that our front yard is--that no building goes on there and things like that.  There was also a sense that, you know, we went over there.  There was a history where the president of the board had a lot of responsibility and a lot of authority.  You'd walk in the door and everyone goes, "Hello, Mr. President.  How are you doing?"  They would, whatever you asked for, they got for you.  I remember once telling them, telling somebody that I wasn't pleased that I'd been to a park, and they didn't have a basket in it.  Next thing you know, the guy calls me back, and said, "Oh well we just built a basket there."  And things sort of jumped when you, you called.  And, and I started to realize that that wasn't the way that I felt the president of the board should operate.  I think you should have a, the chief executive officer should be running the park district full time, attracting the best talent, making the day-to-day decisions.  And the board president should be there to help ask the right questions, probe, make sure that the CEOs [Chief Executive Officer] doing their job effectively, but not get involved in the day-to-day running of the park district.  So that was a big change for me, going there when the prior predecessors had sometimes been there day after day.  For example, the park district board used to meet every week, either in committee or in a formal board meeting.  So every other week was a board meeting.  Every other week was committee meetings.  So every single week, the park district was in session.  And the meetings would go on for long periods of time, lots of give and take between the park board and the audience.  Well, I came in and said, we're gonna cut the number of board meetings in half.  We're gonna have the committee meetings cut in half.  There're gonna be less committees.  They're gonna--we're not gonna have dialogue, you know, with the public.  We'll take testimony, and then we'll take it under advisement and give it to our professional staff to work with, what's best for the citizens of Chicago and the community groups that care about the city so much.  But it's not for us to create this sense of we're running the place, you know, day-to-day as a board.  So that was a big shift in structure or leadership style or governance style that I brought to the park district.
Story_ID: 12582
Speaker 1: Okay, so the [Chicago, Illinois ] Park District, so you went and made these changes.  So in that, did it take some adjustment because you know, this--everything has its own mindset.  So the, I mean did it take adjustment, people to adjust to this style is what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, they didn't quite get it, and I think a lot of people thought it wasn't appropriate the way that I trusted the [Chicago Park District] management team and, you know, allowed them to write checks in larger levels and make decisions that in the past the, the president had made.  And when they--an example of that was with the [Lincoln Park] Zoo [Chicago, Illinois], we ultimately, in effect, worked to privatize the zoo, where the zoo became kind of like the museums in the park where the park district just gave them one big check in the year.  And then all the employees and everything became zoo employees.  And the board of the zoo was empowered to allow their chief executive to really run it as they saw fit.  In the past, when I got there, all the zoo employees were park district employees.  And people didn't realize that, you know.  Lester Fisher, the famous guy, you know, worked for the park district.  And so people were, what do we know about running a zoo?  You know, what do we know about, you know, animal care and getting the best zookeepers and the like.  So anyway, it was the spirit of that, of, you know, saying we trust that the, it'll--the zoo will stronger if they're out there on their own.  And so I'm sort of proud of that.
Speaker 1: Now, what other things are you proud of that you accomplished during that time 'cause you made some other, you know, there's south--you also--I mean there were some inequities that existed in the park district, right, historically?
Speaker 2: Historically, there'd been a sense that the South Side [of Chicago] parks were not getting the resources that the North Side parks were getting.  And actually, one of the things I was kind of proud of since you asked, was that I remember going on a tour--we went on lots of tours, we went to visit the golf facilities.  And there were several golf courses on the South Side, several on the North Side.  The North side park golf courses were better kept.  The golf clubhouses were much better kept, and so I remember going into the one at Jackson Park and seeing that the golf clubhouse was just absolutely a pig sty.  It was unbelievably unkempt.  And so we decided to renovate the Jackson Park, the South Side golf clubhouse and make it really first class and so it, you know, would meet the standards that we had city-wide.  And then we named it after Cecil Partee.  And it became the Cecil Partee Golf Clubhouse, and we have these wonderful pictures of Cecil and a lot of his memorabilia that's there.  And I think it's been something again, that I'm proud of that we were able to do and to have something substantially change there on the South Side of Chicago.
Story_ID: 12583
Speaker 1: When you said that it lasted too short, what do you mean by that then?  It went fast, you said, it went incredibly fast, the six years [as chairman of the Chicago Illinois Park District Board].
Speaker 2: I think the six years, you did go incredibly fast.  And I think that it reminds me, I'd, I'd never been a situation like this where, you know, you're--it's like in being in politics, you're in office.  And then all of a sudden you're, you're the ex-president.  And it was, what I mean is that people, that it went fast, is that I don't think it, it's hard to, I'm not sure people even remember you were there.  You know, they're on to whoever, and whoever's got the power, next.  And all you old folks are just out, and never to be talked to again [laughter] or followed up with or--and so you don't leave any footprints in those kind of positions, which was kind of a little bit sort of, so it was a revelation for me.  Unlike my company [Ariel Capital Management Company], I've been there nineteen years now, almost twenty years, and you feel like you can really build and leave a legacy of values and culture, even if something was to happen to you.  I find in some of these government roles, it's very hard to make meaningful change that lasts.  And so, it was sort of disappointing.
Speaker 1: So are you saying that the changes that you feel that you made, that they, that there have been changes since that changed what you did.  You don't feel that you institutionalized anything while you were there?
Speaker 2: I think that we--I think some things we did, the private--that's why I mentioned the privatization of the [Lincoln Park] Zoo and the golf clubhouses, and some other things that we did.  I was also there during the time where we, we moved Lake Shore Drive west of the Field Museum and created the Museum Campus which is a permanent change.  So I shouldn't be quite so--you know, some of the physical things that really were shifted.  But I think that then, after that's done, the day-to-day values, the teams, was just not--you know, people just all leave.  And the new regime comes in and creates a whole new culture.  And so I think you have to look to those things that you can point to that were, you know, getting the physical changes where we really moved the whole zoo to a private status to see where you've made permanent change.  But the, the idea you've really been able to change the cultural values, it's just, 'cause all the new people come in.  They bring in their team, and they're like, we're gonna do it our way.  And who cares what those guys did in the past.  So it's very disappointing.
Story_ID: 12584
Speaker 1: Were there any other things you learned during that experience [as chairman of the Chicago, Illinois Park District Board], just personally, you know, in dealing with people or running a large entity like that or, you know, interactions within a governmental body?  Were there any other things, you know, because life is about a series of lessons in many ways, and I'm just wondering if things that maybe you thought, turned out to be differently or, you know, interactions with people or expectations or--I'm just trying to--.
Speaker 2: I think there's a few lesson, there's probably a lot of lessons, but a couple of things.  I often thought that when I was in meetings, I was trying to always, in my view, represent the average citizen who was often not at the table in a lot of the kind of discussions that were going on.  So, for example, if you were in a discussion about parking at Soldier Field, you'll have all the--the planning types who have their engineering perspective on how the road should go and how the parking garage should be built.  Then you have all the community groups who don't want more concrete, and really want the Lake Shore Drive to be kind of like a nice pedestrian bike and pedestrian walkway, and get rid of the cars.  And so there's no one there thinking about what the average citizen who has to use those roads to get back and forth, day-to-day to their jobs, or to see their kids or their families or what have you, and, and sometimes the bureaucracy is influenced heavily by these community groups.  They were in there everyday pushing for their perspective.  So I learned that decisions are being made sometimes based upon who's got the, the ability to stay and push on an ongoing basis, and that often the people that are in the government, sometimes can get pushed so hard by those groups--more often, like they go off back and forth themselves from government to the community groups and back and forth again, there isn't anyone there speaking for the average citizen often.  And so I kind of learned that that was something that was a valuable lesson that I think I learned.  I also learned the importance of having a mayor who has a strong perspective and strong point of view.  A lot of the great things that happened in the parks, the new plants, the new trees, new flowers couldn't have been done if you didn't have a mayor who had clearly made that a mission and to empower everyone who worked for him [referring to mayor Richard M. Daley] to fight for that.  And, and I think I guess the other thing I would learn, had learned was that people do things the way they've been done because they've always been done that way.  And very few people think about ideas with a fresh perspective.  And so even though, you have a lot of very hardworking people in the government and at the park district, they come at it from a certain perspective that's been built up over time.  And it's hard to get people to look at things with a fresh view.  And so that was a lesson that I learned working for, in a larger bureaucracy than I'm used to, cause I might have had the same thing if I'd worked in a large corporate bureaucracy.  But it's working in a large bureaucracy, I sort of learned that.
Speaker 1: So, now, were you disappointed when you were sort of out, and a new person was in, Michael Scott was in?  Were you disappointed a little bit?
Speaker 2: Maybe a little bit, but not, you know, it was one of those things where I kind of realized six years was good.  We've getting out where we had done well.  There was a good spirit in the parks, a lot of good feeling and so, you know, there's a time to leave.  And in hindsight, it was the right time, you know.  I think in those types of jobs, you could hang on too long and not leave gracefully.

Speaker 1: Now, Ariel [Community] Academy [elementary school, Chicago, Illinois], when was that started, John?  It started--I mean that was Arne [Duncan], but when was that--?
Speaker 2: Well, the Ariel Community Academy was started; I think it would be like 1996.  That would be my understanding, and, with Arne Duncan and his sister, Sarah [Duncan], were the driving forces working for Ariel Education Initiative to make that happen.
Speaker 1: And you had--he came to you with the idea, right?
Speaker 2: Well, Arne worked, and Sarah, worked full time--Arne worked full time for Ariel, Ariel Capital Management and, and his sister worked full time for the Ariel Education Initiatives.  So we were in constant dialogue and contact about what we could be doing differently and new ideas to enhance our programs and community outreach.  So it wasn't like it was a--he was coming from the outside, and he was part of our, our internal team.  And they were thinking about what the next project because I, I Have a Dream [program] kids were getting ready to go off to college.  And so what's the--we were thinking about, what's the next project?  And the idea of creating a school came up.  It was just great timing 'cause the board of education had just gone out for an RFP [request for proposal] to create a handful of small schools in the city.  And we filled out this huge RFP, and we were luckily one of the few community groups that were selected to run one of those schools.
Speaker 1: And in that, but did it start with a foundation?  Did Ariel Academy start with a foundation?  The only reason I say, in the Donor's Forum Book, it's the only foundation that's listed--,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that's African American.  I just want to--I mean it's the only one.  And I was just wondering what precipitated--?
Speaker 2: Well, the Ariel Foundation was founded--I don't know exactly the year.  I think about 1989, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so around the same time that Mayor [Richard M.] Daley became--I mean that he became mayor [of Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yes, something, right--right around that timeframe.  And Arne and his sister Sarah were the first employees to make it work.  The only thing that occurred over time is we changed the name from the Ariel Foundation to the Ariel Education Initiative, partly because the name caused confusion.  But the idea was always to be a very focused community-based organization that we were the primary funder of.  As time went on, we did go outside and get some anonymous donors and other friends of the firm too, and friends of Arne and Sarah to help fund programs as our projects got larger.  We've always focused on the two projects, the--our first, I Have a Dream program, and then Ariel Community Academy school.  But to do those projects well, we learned we needed more people than we originally thought and more dollars than we originally thought.
Speaker 1: Do you think you were led into that by Arne Duncan or is, was education, was that something you had sort of grabbed onto, you know, to sort of make a difference?
Speaker 2: We--I tell people this all the time.  I had known Arne since I was fourteen.  And he's been someone I've had this immense amount of respect and admiration for.  So even though he was a lot younger than I was, I kind of watched his career develop.  And while he was playing professional basketball in Australia, he was thinking about what was next.  What was he going to do next with his career?  I knew he had this passion for inner-city education.  His mother had run an after-school tutoring program in the inner city for forty years, at that time, probably thirty years.  And we were at the point in our development, being in business for about ten years, where we were starting to think about how can we coordinate all of our philanthropic giving, all of our community work, make it more focused, and more effective.  So I said, here's this guy that I've got this great admiration for, who's terrific and understands this area.  I've got this need.  Let's see if he'll come on board and then do this full time.  So he ended up staying and playing another year or two than we originally thought.  And, and so his sister started first, full time, and Arne just worked during off-season.  And then as soon as he finished professionally, he joined his sister full time, and we were off and running.  And, and right away, we realized we wanted to be very focused, and the I Have a Dream program was our first project.
Speaker 1: I bet neither of you thought that he would be superintendent of [Chicago Public] Schools either, after that, you know, eventually.
Speaker 2: No, we all have dreams.
Story_ID: 12586
Speaker 1: Now, I want to go back a little bit to Ariel [Capital Management Company], and at what point in time was this separate fund set up, you know, with Eric [McKissack]--Eric's-- you had yours.  When did that come about?  Do you know what--?
Speaker 2: Yes, Eric's mutual fund I think was started in 1989.
Speaker 1: Oh, my good--okay, so soon, not that long after he had--.
Speaker 2: No, he joined in, say, 1986--.
Speaker 1: So that in--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was there much discussion--I'm sorry for the timing, but was there much discussion about him starting that fund?  Was there any--cause would you have said maybe we shouldn't start a separate fund.  We should keep with what we have or?
Speaker 2: Well, I think what happened was, we grew the first fund very rapidly in the late '80s [1980s] and, and for while the Ariel fund that I managed was closed for new investors.  So we thought about well, hey, let's, let's have another fund that can be opened.  And it'll be a different product cause most of the big fund groups, Fidelity and T. Rowe Price and all, they have more than one mutual fund.  So Ariel should have more than fund. So it's convenient to start it when one was closed, it would have naturally evolved one way or another.  And it was a way to create a career opportunity for Eric to have something that could truly be his own, and that he could be really proud of and do a great job with.  And so it just really fit.
Speaker 1: And out of that also, what other things sort of developed, and, you know, that Ariel has done or is within its portfolio?  That's what I'm saying.  You moved into the mutual funds--you were doing institutional investing at the beginning.  And then you had the relationship with--.
Speaker 2: Calvert Group.
Speaker 1: Calvert Group, okay.  And then you took over, right?
Speaker 2: Well, sort of.
Speaker 1: It was a confusing--.
Speaker 2: It's a very confusing [unclear], you know, if you're not in the fund industry.  And in 1986, when we got into the mutual fund industry, we did it as a joint venture with the Calvert Group.  Calvert would do the distribution and marketing of our, no-load mutual fund family--actually, it was a load mutual fund family at the time cause they incentivised brokers to sell the mutual fund by load commission.  We were the investment advisor to the fund.  We were picking the stocks and doing the research and, and I was the portfolio manager of the first fund and Eric was portfolio manager of the second fund.  So it was a pure partnership.  They were mostly marketing.  We were research and investment management.  It went fine for a while, but over time, we felt we were developing our own persona and identity and brand equity that was separate and distinct from Calvert's.  We thought it was causing confusion, confusion in the marketplace.  Calvert was known as a socially responsible investment firm.  We were known as the slow and steady value, patient approach to investing.  And so I guess it was a, I guess now, eight years ago, we went to Calvert and said we would like to do a marketing ourselves, and have all the brand to ourselves and we ended up paying them a lot of money for us at the time to, to agree that they could go their own way and we could go our own way with our mutual funds.  This never had any impact on our institutional business at all.
Speaker 1: So you had the funds.  They were just doing the marketing for it in many ways?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a partnership.
Story_ID: 12587
Speaker 1: You didn't explain how the partnership [with the Calvert Group] even came about?  I mean why were you, as a, you know, sort of strategic business decision, interested in mutual funds, the mutual fund industry?
Speaker 2: Well, in the beginning, as I mentioned in the very beginning, we had a small fund called the Ariel Fund that we started, that was, had individual investors in it.  But we wanted to have a publicly-traded mutual fund that you could find in the newspaper everyday, the way the big fund companies did, again, the Fidelities, the T. Rowe Prices and the Vanguards and Januses and things like that.  So in 1986, we hired a lawyer and a consultant in this case to help us figure out how do we get it, a no-load mutual fund in the newspaper where we can compete with the big guys?  They came back and said you're so small that the best way for you to become effective as a mutual fund company is to find a partner who will help you do the marketing and distribution because you're, you're too small to do it all yourself.  And so that's how we just, you know, decided we would, we would pick the stocks and do the research.  They would do the marketing and it was a way for us to quickly enough assets to be in the newspaper because today, you have to have fifty million dollars in assets to be in the newspaper.  It's a real barrier to entry, barrier to entry for a small firm to get into the newspaper.  If you're not in the newspaper, no one can find you.  Nobody's gonna add you to their 401(k) [retirement] plan if they can't see you, see the fund in the newspaper every day.  So it's important.  So that was how the partnership evolved.  And it went very well for a number of years.  We had, half the board were members were friends of ours, and half the board members were friends of Calvert people.  And everyone got along famously until we got this idea that we wanted to, you know, move off on our own.  And there was a little bit of a tense time for a while.  And that's how we ended up negotiating a price for us to be able to go away gracefully.  It was kind of like a divorce, you know.  You sort of pay for freedom.
Speaker 1: And at that same time that there was a lot of interest in mutual funds, right?  Wasn't there, wasn't--I mean in the whole area of mutual funds, hasn't there sort of been--became more popularized, is what I'm trying to say?
Speaker 2: Sure, the mutual fund industry has exploded since I started the firm in '83 [1983].  I started our funds in '86 [1986].  The '90s [1990s] were boom times for mutual funds as the bull market raged on.  So it was a, you know, everything's been good timing in that way.  And, you know, we're now--it's kind of neat that Eric and I have been running these funds for a long time as the portfolio managers, and it's rare to find the same portfolio manager running a public fund for, you know, in my case, more than fifteen years and in Eric's [McKissack] case, you know, more than ten years.  It's very unusual.
Story_ID: 12588
Speaker 1: Now, John, what other things do you think in the, you know, late '80s [1980s] or more like the '90s [1990s] that you think were important benchmarks for Ariel [Capital Management Company]?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, thing, you know, cause we are so, so slow and steady, there're not a lot of big benchmarks.  The only thing I would add is that we went through a period in the early '90s where we didn't perform very well.  And we lost a lot of clients.  And our assets went from two billion dollars to about one point one billion [dollars].  Every time you picked up a phone, someone was firing you.  They didn't really believe in you any longer.  So I think the other key test for us was that, how did you deal with adversity?  You know, we stuck to our knitting, stuck to our strategy and tried to learn from our mistakes cause I always think you can do better.  And we kept scrambling for new business and hustling for new business.  And I remember he was having dinner with you during a period where he got, finally we got a breakthrough, we got a new account in the midst of all the horrors of lost accounts, which gave him confidence that somebody out there is a contrary thinker, and we're gonna--and put faith in us and confidence in what we were building.  But it was a test and your, to your character because you, you found out the people you thought believed in you didn't.  And people you just thought would stick with you, just didn't do so.  But I think, you know, as you go through that, it makes you stronger.
Speaker 1: Now, you've gone up now to, aren't you managing, what ten billion [dollars], almost?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, we were well over ten billion [dollars] until this recent Stock Market [laugher] correction of the last few weeks.  But we've been growing quite rapidly in the last year.
Story_ID: 12589
Speaker 1: At this point, what do you want to see in the terms of growth?  I mean you, you're at a point where you have brought someone on as CEO, right?
Speaker 2: Well, I have a president.  I'm still the CEO [chief executive officer].
Speaker 1: President, I'm sorry.  You're still CEO, I'm sorry.  But you have brought Mellody Hopson as a president, and I'm just wondering what went into that decision and also, you know, where do you want to see Ariel [Capital Management Company] go?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that with Mellody's ascension to president, it was, it was deserved.  She worked so incredibly hard.  She's been an invaluable sounding board in all the major decisions we make or have made over the years, especially the decision to diversi--divorce ourselves from the Calvert Group.  And it was a way for us to recognize and for others to understand the outstanding leadership that she provided, and that she continues to provide for the company.  So we're--our leadership group now is that Mellody's our President, Eric McKissack is the vice chairman and the three of us are the three of us that are on the Board of Ariel Mutual Funds and Ariel Capital.  And the three of us are really, you know, leading the company together, as a group.  Going forward, we see that continuing in the same way.  We'd like to, to simply continue to build up our, our no-load mutual fund family to become a, at least half of the assets because right now, the ten billion dollars or so mutual funds, you know, less than three billion [dollars].  We'd love to see that someday it'd be a 50/50 split.  We'll think about over time, slowly but surely, if we can find the right people to execute it to develop more investment products for our customers.  And we have to do that carefully because we have to find products that we know will be really good and will add value for our customers.  And, but we also realize, we're gonna grow our organization, and you have to provide opportunities for those internally.  And so new products are a way for us to create more opportunities for people who work in the company, as well as provide, provide more stability for the overall organization because we are--'cause we've been so focused, that over time, that gives you some extra risk.  And we'd like to be able to diversify away some of that risks by, over time, thoughtfully, having a broader product line.
Story_ID: 12590
Speaker 1: I heard recently, discussed, that, by someone, you know, the pundits, on saying that they had never seen a market like we're seeing currently, that there was no history, you know, that this sort of broke--but do you, are you of that belief status?
Speaker 2: It's been a brutal, brutal, bear market.  It probably goes on now for more than two years.  But the last three weeks have been just extraordinary in the severity to the client.  But I would think that people who lived through '73 [1973] and '74 [1974], the last recession, the big recession this country had and the big downturn in the market, was somewhat similar.  I think that, of course, the [Great] Depression, you know, what happened in the stock market in the late '20's [1920s] and into the '30's [1930s], I don't think you could say that this is overall any worse than those two big declines in the market.
Story_ID: 12591
Speaker 1: What do you want to still do with your life, John, that you haven't done?  You've had a great interest in sports.  There have been some interest in maybe owning a team, but what do you want to do?  Have you--at one point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, I think that I'm very focused.  I want to build Ariel [Capital Management Company] into being the best small and mid-cap value shop in the country.  And, you know, over time, as I said earlier, make it more, more stable, larger, make sure that it can really last beyond me, and, and what I, I bring to the company day-to-day.  So I think it's something that I enjoy doing.  This is what I think I have a feel for.  And so I don't have any other mountains that I want to climb, you know.  This is, this one has been tough enough to climb and continues to be more than a challenge because it is a, it's a tough business to be in.  It's so volatile, changes every day, and, you know, you can never rest in this, in this industry.
Speaker 1: Do you like that?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think after twenty, almost twenty years, I kind of--sometimes I do wish it was a little less volatile and that you could not have the kind of craziness that you deal with in this market, but it is what it is.  And I think that we, again, the people in place and the, and the culture and the character to be able to, to weather those up's and down's.  So I think that helps, it helps, helps make us different and helps to make us good.
Speaker 1: What other areas are you wanting to sort of explore?  And I remembered this goes back to even your [Chicago] Park District day, where we didn't talk about this, but even the revelation about where, you know, public institutions were investing their money?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a--I think that one thing we are working really hard is one, trying to get more African Americans, people of color, to save and invest in the stock market and be comfortable doing so.  That's a big mission of ours.  And we've gone around and talked to a lot of the leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus and we spend a lot of time with Reverend [Jesse] Jackson and other civil rights leaders to help them understand that it's more important than ever for people of color to be comfortable in the Stock Market because you have to make your own choices these days in your 401k plans to prepare for your retirement some day down the road.  And I think some of these recent crises that have occurred with Enron and WorldComm makes it even more clear that you need to be able to make your right choices and understand what you're doing in your 401k plan than ever before.  So it's, industrial education initiative is a big thing for us, and we'll continue to do our survey every year with Charles Schwab and do as much as we can to go out and speak on this issue that we think is critically important for our community.  And we're gonna try and find creative ways to help inspire others to do the same thing.  And we think it's very, very important.
Story_ID: 12592
Speaker 1: Now, speaking of that, the survey, weren't there some interesting statistics that came out of the Charles Schwab survey and what, you know, what our investing patterns and were not?
Speaker 2: Well, it's show that as we've done this now for five or six years, that we've seen a tremendous increase in the comfort level that people of color have in investing in the stock market.  So the statistics have been very positive of late.  And, so we feel like hopefully, we played a small role in getting more people to, you know, feel comfortable in the Stock Market for the first time.  The other issue, the last issue we're working on too from a community standpoint, has really been pushing companies that we invest in with our customers' money, to talk to them about the diversity of their workforce and their board of directors and to be positive advocates for these corporations to do the right thing in realizing that most of their shareholders and other money managers are not asking them these types of questions.  And so we've been a real fierce advocate for using our, our proxy votes to advocate the right thing for the corporations that we [Ariel Capital Management Company] invest in.
Story_ID: 12593
Speaker 1: John, you started out squarely in the Republican camp, right?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: And now you are an independent.
Speaker 2: I'm a Democrat.
Speaker 1: Democrat.  But--okay, Democrat.
Speaker 2: I'm a registered Democrat.
Speaker 1: [Laughter]  I can't believe it. Okay, I thought we had talked about you being--okay, so I just want to know how does a Republican become a Democrat, and one who was a dye in the wool, true belief in the, you know, free market system and all of that, was Republican.  And I'm just wondering if you could encapsulate, you know, how that transition happened for you?
Speaker 2: I think the transition happened, three reasons.  One, was that I realized that my values of being concerned by the--about people that are less fortunate made me more of a Democrat, you know, the work that we are doing with Ariel Education Initiative, the work I was doing on the, being on the board of the Urban League, being involved in the community and being concerned for others, just seemed to fit more with being a Democrat.  Number two, my friendships that I was building over time were all Democrats, Bill Bradley, [U.S.] Senator [Carol Moseley] Braun, [Chicago, Illinois mayor Richard M.] Rich Daley, [Cook County, Illinois Board president] John Stroger, and others.  The political leaders that I see just naturally gravitate to and build real relationships with were Democrats.  And it was funny in those early years, Carol  and Rich would always, you know, introduce me as their Republican friend, you know.  And after a while, I realized I was spending all my time with these Democrats that I cared about.  And so that's where I felt at home, and they're friends I felt comfortable with.  And so I think that was important.  And the final last straw was when Clarence Thomas became the [U.S. ] Supreme Court pick of [President] George [H.W.] Bush, and I realized if he's the head of the African American Republican party, so to speak, I didn't want to be any--you know, he wasn't my leader.  I didn't want to be a part of it.  It just seemed so--I don't know what the word is, it just, it's, it just seemed so ridiculous the way George Bush appointed Clarence Thomas and tried to create a sense that he was the most qualified person.  And what he represented to get to that position was appalling to me.  And so I didn't want to be anything, I didn't want to be anywhere close to that party or to--and, and so that's how I changed.
Story_ID: 12594
Speaker 1: Do you feel that you have found your own voice, in your own, you know, sense of self because that's been a progression.  But would you point it-- would you say it occurred at any one point is what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: I think one thing that's evolved for me in the last ten years, now, that I've been so fortunate to be asked to be on some of these large corporate boards here in Chicago [Illinois]--I talked to Reverend [Jesse] Jackson [Sr.] a lot about this.  And, you know, sometimes you get in these positions and you're sort of happy to be there.  And you like--sometimes some people like the only person of color there.  And it makes them feel special.  When I looked around, I kind of felt like, you know, it just showed how unfair the world still was, that you could go to meeting after meeting and dinner and after dinner and event after event, in the elite corporate world of Chicago, which is supposed to be a very diverse city, and be the only person of color there out of twenty-five or thirty or forty people.  And so I started to say, you know, this isn't right, and that I should be trying to use this leadership role to push for real opportunities for people of color to be hired into senior positions and the opportunity to do business with these institutions because I kept noticing when they went out and hired an investment banking firm or a law firm or accounting firm or whatever, it was always a majority company.  And five white guys would come walking in the room to present their credentials and to start doing their business.  And there's no one to ask the question about, well, where are the people of color?  Where are the women?  You know, this isn't quite right.  So I kind of felt inspired to be that voice to help push for those kind of agendas that I thought were the right thing to do.  And I talked to Reverend [Jesse Jackson] about it because somebody says, you know, it's, he understands that often that isn't what occurs.  And some people will take those kinds of positions and think about it differently.  But it's just so clear to me how my role should evolve.  And I've become more impassioned about it as I get more of those types of great experiences.
Story_ID: 12595
Speaker 1: When you look at the black community, John, what are your hopes and concerns for that community?
Speaker 2: Well, my hopes for the black community is that we can be a part of the overall economic mainstream, you know, to own buildings downtown, to be senior partners in all the law firms and accounting firms and consulting firms and architectural firms, all the professional services, to go along with all the other businesses we've been involved in, you know, over the years.  So to be part of all parts of the economy is, is my dream and my vision that--'cause I think we've been locked out from leadership roles in so many parts of, of the business community around the country.  Now, my fears are that we still haven't figured out how to help each other enough.  A lot of us have sat on corporate boards, as I talked about earlier, but also have sat on college boards and university boards and hospital boards, where nothing's changed, where we've just been happy to be there and haven't pushed for each other, haven't fought for each other.  And I think that if we don't, you know, if we bring up these questions in the boardroom, who is?  You know, if we don't fight for each other, who's gonna lead those fights?  And I think sometimes we're forgetting about the sacrifices that, you know, that [U.S.] Congressman [John] Lewis and, and Reverend [Jesse] Jackson and Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and all the others made to help give us these opportunities to be in these rooms.  And so I'm sometimes worried that we're, as time gets further, we move from the demonstrations of the Civil Rights Movements, Movement, but we're less likely to fight and make people uncomfortable to, you know, force fairness to occur.  So that's what I worry about.
Story_ID: 12596
Speaker 1: And so what do you want your legacy to be, John?  I mean you're still young, but what--we ask that question.  What do you want it to be?
Speaker 2: I, I'd want my legacy to be that we, you know, we built an organization [Ariel Capital Management Company] that was based on, you know, values of teamwork, excellence in what we do, but also a sense that there's a requirement or an expectation to be involved in the community and to help others that haven't had all the opportunities that we've had.  And so to really have a legacy that you can build a great business and do meaningful community work at the same time.  And so that's what the Ariel Education Initiative is all about, the Ariel Community Academy School [Chicago, Illinois] and hopefully, the kind leadership roles that we can have in organizations around town because sometimes people think you can't do it both.  And I'd like our legacy to be that you can really do both well and make a difference.
Story_ID: 12597
Speaker 1: What do you think your, is it great-grandfather, what would he say if he could see you now?  He, he was--he was a businessman himself, wasn't he?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, he [C. Francis Stradford] had a hotel [Stradford Hotel] in Tulsa [Oklahoma] so, I think he'd probably I was a chip off the old block, being an entrepreneur, he say, it runs in the family, you know, and, and the ability and the willingness to sort of stand alone and be independent and, you know, I think that's something that goes throughout our family, that we're, we're willing to have a strong of point of view and not get swept up with whatever the common view happens to be at the time.
