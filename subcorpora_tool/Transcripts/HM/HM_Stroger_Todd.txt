Speaker 1: What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Lasagna.
Speaker 1: And your favorite time or season of the year?
Speaker 2: June.  I like the summer.
Speaker 1: And favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: And when you take a vacation, what's your favorite spot?
Speaker 2: New Orleans.  As you can see, we haven't been very many places.
Speaker 1: Why New Orleans?
Speaker 2: I went to school there.  My wife's family is there.  It's a nice place.  We can go there just to relax.
Story_ID: 50161
Speaker 1: Give me your wife's name.
Speaker 2: Jeanine. J-E-A-N-I-N-E.  She has a middle name too.  It's Marie.
Speaker 1: And her maiden?
Speaker 2: Maiden name is Baddoo, B-A-D-D-O-O.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, siblings?  Their birth order?
Speaker 2: Older sister Yonnie Lynn, Y-O-N-N-I-E L-Y-N-N.  Last name now is Clark C-L-A-R-K, and she is approximately 5 1/2 years older than I am.  And I had an older brother.  He died in '82 [1982].  His name was Hans Eric, H-A-N-S E-R-I-C.  He was born in '60 [1960], so he was about 2 1/2 years older.
Story_ID: 50162
Speaker 1: Okay.  And can you tell me what was it like growing up in the Stroger household?
Speaker 2: I guess it was like any old political household.  Father's going to a lot of events.  Didn't spend a lot of time in the home.  He took us to a lot of cocktail parties and things like that and depending on what he was running for at the time - when he was the County Commissioner he was very busy, but he was in and out of the house, kind of an old world father.  Like to come home for dinner and then he'd go back out.  Until he ran for Congress.  Congress, that took a lot of time and that was - I would say there was a time I didn't see him for like six months and I kind of forgot he was part of the household and then all of sudden he came back.  So being in a political household is - I guess it's like any father who works hard and at his own business, not there a lot.  Always running around talking to people.  It was interesting.  Got to know a little bit of the world.
Story_ID: 50163
Speaker 1: So your mother really had to run things well, the household?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's a great organizer, great handyman.  I tell my wife, "Call my mother.  She knows how to do it."  And I think she must have - she worked I believe when I got in eighth grade.  She took a part-time job.  But I think before then she didn't do anything else.  And since then she's worked on and off, but she was mostly around making sure that we were doing what we needed to do.
Speaker 1: In an individual sense, what do you remember of how your mother impressed you as an individual when you were a child?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd say - well, now that I've actually gotten older and I can look back, I'd say my mother was a good organizer of the house.  A matter of fact I think when I was three, we moved from an apartment to a house and she always says that she'd tell my dad, "We need to look for a house."  And he'd say, "We don't have any money."  And one day she said, "I found a house for us."  He said, "We don't have any money."  She said, "I saved enough money."  So, she saved the down payment and he has always been the one who goes out and works and not a guy to think about, you know, getting rich.  She was the one who thought about more practical things, in my opinion, at least for the household.  So she was a good organizer, saved money, made sure everybody had what they needed.  She planned for ahead for events.  He probably planned for school, but she planned for everything else.
Story_ID: 50164
Speaker 1: And what was one of the favorite things you used to like to do with your mother?
Speaker 2: We went to the movies a lot when I was very young.  I can't remember how young I was so young.  We'd put on our pajamas, we'd get in the car, we'd go to the drive-in movie, and I never was much for falling asleep so I'd watch the whole movie.  And as I got older, I think we went to the movies when I was in high school probably all the way up through college.
Story_ID: 50165
Speaker 1: And what kind of memories stand out for you as far as your father on a more personal level?
Speaker 2: Probably - let's see, what would I say?  Going to cocktail parties.  That was the kind of thing, you know.  He wanted to spend some time with us, so it would be like ok, we're going out - Tom Hynes [Thomas Hynes] affair or something like that.  So, we'd all get together and put our little suits on and we'd go out and shake a few hands.
Speaker 1: So that experience came in very useful when you ran?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was used to it by that time.
Speaker 1: Is there any experience that stands out for you in your mother's or father's life where you actually, now that you're an adult, you can look back and remember seeing things through their perspective?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  What would I say?
Speaker 1: Maybe a response to a challenging moment.
Story_ID: 50166
Speaker 1: Well, one thing with my father, when he was elected to the Board of County Commissioners in 1970 and I want to say it was 1987 he was going to be the Finance Chairman.  He was the choice of the President, George Dunne, at that time.  And a group of people got together and at this time I guess it was a fight with the Mayor and Vrdolyak [Edward Vrdolyak] and those.  So, the people who were, as they called them, independent at that time, said they were not going to follow George Dunne's edict and they decided they were going to elect someone else, unknowing to my father and George Dunne.  So the day of the election, they elected another guy who actually went to prison and there was a big court battle and my father was actually put into the Finance Chairman position.  But I thought he handled himself very well in that - I'm talking about people who knew him for probably as long as - probably from the '60s [1960s] at least.  And they all seemed to take some kind of pleasure in seeing him fall.  But he stood with his head up nice to the President of the County Board and - so, since I got the stage I'll say those are the same people who when they need something, they have to talk to him and had to talk to him before that happened.  Since he was more or less an insider, or as inside as you can get when you're black.  They had to talk to him to talk to the guys who had all the power.  Even though he was the conduit, they had no problem trying to knock him off his, I guess, perceived throne.  But he stood up and, you know, made no waves.  He didn't try to stop the program.  He did what he had to do and in the end, I think it served him well.
Speaker 2: How old were you at the time and what do you remember thinking and feeling about seeing that drama go down?
Speaker 1: Well, luckily I wasn't there.  I was in college.  So that was 19 - I believe, '87 [1987].  So I was still in school, but I know my mother is still bitter.  It's always good to have somebody in the family who has a long memory too I always say.  But you know I learned not to expect too much out of people and as they say, keep your friends, but your enemies closer.
Speaker 2: And your mother - you remember her being upset.
Speaker 1: Actually, just the opposite.  Keep your enemies close, your friends closer.  No, actually I take that back.  You can't tell who's your enemy, so you better keep everybody close.  Because I think that's what he found out in the end.  You never know who really likes you and who doesn't like you.  That's what it boils down to, so -
Speaker 2: And your mother - do you remember her being upset and frustrated?  Can you describe through your eyes what that period was like for her?
Speaker 1: I think she's never really liked politics and so she always was a little wary of anything that happened.  She doesn't believe, I believe, in trusting people too much.  If you give people too much rope, they're going to hang themselves.  So, I think she was very upset, but she knew the people that we were dealing with and you got to expect a bump every once in awhile.
Story_ID: 50167
Speaker 1: Your grandparents, what do you remember about them?
Speaker 2: Well, my father's side, literally nothing about my grandfather.  I think I had to be maybe four when he died, and he was a - probably a good 20 years older than his wife.  So he wasn't a young man.  I think he might have been in his 70s when he died.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: John.  And my grandmother, she died in '86 [1986], when I was in school.  She lived a pretty long life.  She was like 84, and always took good care of herself.  Very articulate.  I think she probably was the one who ran the household in a sense.  She was strong, but my father always says that his father - he made sure - I guess just like my father - he took care of the bills, went out and my grandmother took care of the house.  On my mother's side, the Batchlors, my grandmother is still alive and she's got to be about 84 now.  She has another birthday coming up in September.  Still gets around.  Still drives her car.  Comes over to see the baby as much as possible.  And her husband died when I was about, I want to say about 12, and she came in and moved in with us, I think, when I was 15.  What I remember about that, they lived in Chicago.  So we were over there an awful lot and I have some cousins probably about - they moved around a lot.  So, sometimes over here there three, four really ones that were close and hung around together.  And we'd be at our grandmother's house and my grandfather had a stroke so he had a wheel chair, and we'd be rolling around the wheel chair.  And I remember always playing on the floor.  He had a big set of checkers.  Good memories of that time.
Speaker 1: And your father's mother, what was her name and name your mother's.
Speaker 2: My father's mother's name was Ella, E-L-L-A.  And my mother's father's name was Grady Batchlor and my grandmother's name is Flora Batchlor.
Story_ID: 50168
Speaker 1: Where did you go to school, elementary school?
Speaker 2: I went to St. Felicitas which is at 84th and Blackstone, so it was only a block away from, well we lived at 85th and Blackstone.  And I went to high school at St. Ignatius College Prep.
Speaker 1: So a block away, you could sleep late and rush and go to school.
Speaker 2: I think everybody who lived within a block was always late.  That seemed to be the way.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite memory from elementary school?
Speaker 2: Hm, my favorite memory of elementary school.  I think it was really just that it was such close proximity.  It was easy to play with the kids there after school or especially during the summers, just go over to the school, play in the playground.  All the same people you saw in school you saw the whole year, so your community - you saw them for 12 months out of the year, and I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Tell us what kind of student you were.
Speaker 2: Can't get too much more average than I was probably.
Speaker 1: No favorite subjects?
Story_ID: 50169
Speaker 1: I like to read, so I read an awful lot and math.  I like math because that logic that's involved in math was very interesting.  So I got a math minor.
Speaker 2: And your reading took you in what direction mostly?  Biography?  Science?
Speaker 1: Let's see.  When I was younger, I'd read just a little bit of everything.  A lot of science fiction, but you know I had an older brother and sister and they'd bring things home and sometimes I'd read their books.  So, you get to read, you know, the autobiography of Malcolm X and but then they'll bring something else like the Princess Bride, and you read that.  So, I really enjoyed having siblings because they supplied me with a lot of reading material.
Story_ID: 50170
Speaker 1: So, then what was it like being "the baby?"  How did you like that position?
Speaker 2: That's a good position.  The only one I know.  I don't know what it's like being the first, but I think being the last it has some good things to it, if there's not too many of you.
Speaker 1: Tell us some of them.
Speaker 2: Just your parents, they've had a lot of experience by that time, so they treat you a little different and not worried about everything.  You have a little more freedom to choose.  At least that's how I saw it.  My sister, the oldest, she - let's see, did she choose - I know she didn't choose here high school.  I'm sure of that.  Did she choose college?  I don't think so.  And I know my brother didn't choose either.  I didn't choose my high school, but that was fine with me.  I was happy where I went, but I had a choice of my college by that time.  You know any place I said would have been fine.  So, by that time, they had enough of fighting I guess.
Story_ID: 50171
Speaker 1: I'm the youngest, too.  High school at St. Ignatius, tell us about that from the insider perspective.
Speaker 2: The best high school you could ever go to.  I'd tell anybody to send their children there.  Right off the top you're going to meet some people who are going to do things in this world.  I mean you're assured of that.
Speaker 1: Name the school for us, because years from now they won't know we're talking about St. Ignatius.  Okay.  You can start that response again and name the school for us.
Speaker 2: Okay.  At St. Ignatius you will meet people who are going to do things in the world and you're assured of that.  That's the kind of school where people will send their children because they want them to be some kind of leader.  They want them to have some kind of advantage.  And when I went to St. Ignatius in '77, it was all boys and relatively poor.  They were talking about moving to the suburbs and the president said no at that time, Father Bowen, and soon after than they decided to let in women and they came in in my junior year.  The school just changed.  All of sudden it was rich.  Money just seemed to come pouring in.  They did a big makeover.  It changed the whole atmosphere.  I think it's reflected.  I'm not sure if it's the greatest thing in the world that happened.  I mean there are good things, but now there is the sense that the school is an elite school.  You know like Latin and Francis Parker, which is what I generally consider what people think of elite schools.  People don't look at that school as somewhere they could just send their children, which is a shame.  One of my classmates actually is a teacher there and he says nowadays, you know, they offer you a scholarship of $5,000.  I believe tuition may be $8,000.  So they try to help, but a lot of people will never even look that way because they know the tuition is so high and they don't realize that there is financial aid out there.
Speaker 1: So, but St. Ignatius was always seen - even before it got richer - as a kind of elitist -
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I think what that is is the Jesuits.  Well, I wouldn't say - maybe people thought that the Catholic schools were semi-elite, but - no, St. Ignatius I think was always thought of as the smart kids go there and I think that's because the Jesuits, you know, through the ages, have been an order that have been -
Speaker 1: (Unclear). (Background discussion).
Speaker 2: I believe since St. Ignatius is a Jesuit institution, the Jesuits have always taught princes and royalty and so when they go somewhere, they automatically have the label of teaching the elite, but actually when I went there what they do is we all take a test.  And we all take the same test that they take at all the Catholic schools.  And they go and they take people - people who scored 99 all the way down to probably they travel down to about 70.  So, you really get a mixture of people.  I know some people don't like it, but they try to make the population diverse.  When I was there it was about 25% African American, 25% Irish, and after that it really breaks down into a lot of others, but I was happy to go to a school that I met people who were Croatian.  I didn't know what Croatia was, Ukrainian.  And so, it was a great experience.
Story_ID: 50172
Speaker 1: What do you remember most about your years, which were from where to where at St. Ignatius?
Speaker 2: From '77 [1977] to '81 [1981].  What do I remember most?  I would say just that the teachers were good, they expected something out of you.  There's a - make a lot of good friendships and basically you tend to run into those same people later on in life and the ones I run into have turned out to be pretty good.
Speaker 1: Seven minutes left on this tape. In this seven minutes, let's go - did you have any favorite teachers or who influenced you most in your high school?
Speaker 2: Um, did I have any favorite teachers?  No, I kind of like some of the more no-nonsense teachers.  Like we had a teacher, Mr. Connelly, who was a history teacher, used to be a Marine.  And actually I was a history major in college, so that maybe another thing.  And he laid it out for you and you read the stuff, paid attention, took some notes, took a test, and you were through.  And then right now they have a business manager named Mr. Chandler and I can't remember exactly what he taught for us, Social Studies.  But he made it very interesting.  He was friendly with the students, but he expected you to work.  I can say that about all the teachers there.  They - I just enjoyed going to class, if maybe not always reading my book.
Story_ID: 50173
Speaker 1: College.  Why did you pick the college you did?  Tell us which one it was and -
Speaker 2: The first school I went to was the University of Wisconsin at Madison.  And that choice came - I didn't apply to too many schools, maybe three.  They sent me a letter back saying you're accepted.  I said okay I'm going.  We have a summer - my parents have a summer house there and we probably spent - they probably had that since I was like nine so I spent probably ten years or so before I went to school in Wisconsin.  So, it was not a far - it was the kind of school I wanted to go to.  It was large.  You have a lot of things to do.  Probably too many things because eventually they asked me to leave.  So, I left Wisconsin, spent a semester at IIT [Illinois Institute of Technology] and then I went to my dad's Alma mater, Xavier [University] in New Orleans and enjoyed that school and graduated.
Story_ID: 50174
Speaker 1: What made you pick history as a major?
Speaker 2: I had a real interest in history and I was tired of going to school.  I wanted to get out. I figured I might as well do something I actually like.  So, I got a degree in history.
Speaker 1: So like a history major really helps you in your career, yes?
Speaker 2: I think in a sense when you are talking to people and, you know, they say something and you can actually respond with some kind of knowledge to it, it usually surprises them that you know anything besides what's going on today.  And, yeah, it kind of gives you an edge in the sense that people say, that guy must be smart.
Speaker 1: And in college is when you finally warmed up to it at Xavier [University].  Was there any special instructor that influenced you or any special experience?
Speaker 2: I can honestly say no.  No special instructors.  I mean there was some good teachers and I enjoyed a lot of the classes there, but no, there was no one who really made me just jump up and say yeah that's what I like.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're out of school.  You graduate.  Give us - track for us your early years out in the real world.
Story_ID: 50175
Speaker 1: When I got out of school, first came home, got a summer job at the water reclamation district.  Paid well.  Gave me a chance to pay off my bills and then I got a job with the Circuit Court of Cook County in Domestic Relations.  I was a statistician for Judge Mackoff [Benjamin S. Mackoff] who was the presiding judge of Domestic Relations.  That was very interesting.  You get to really know about people when you're dealing in divorce.  It drives home the fact that you can't hate anybody as much as somebody that you loved first, because there were a lot of case that you read about - the more money they have, the bigger they fight.  They fight with money and they fight with children and that was a learning experience.  And from there I went to a Jury Commission and I worked in their office for a while and then I became a Jury Comm--Supervisor.
Story_ID: 50176
Speaker 1: Okay, we were talking about when you were working in the Court and how domestic relations can shift people.  Give me an idea of the most - the case that had the most impact on you as a young man.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, sometimes when things got slow, I'd just go around and sit in the courtroom and listen to some of the cases, but you could see people fighting with their children, using them as a pawn as a way to get back at their spouse.  And that was - that was really a terrible thing to see.  The child generally - and I read a lot of books while I was there - the child generally thinks that there's something wrong with him or her and that they're the problem for the divorce.  And when one spouse leaves, they feel like they'll never coming back and some senses that's true, especially the male.  Once he leaves, he doesn't want to be around the woman and then they fight over money and he doesn't want to pay the money for child support because he thinks it's going to go to her, and he doesn't want to see her living a good life so the child actually has to suffer for it.  That can be very messy.
Story_ID: 50177
Speaker 1: So what is it about your experience in that particular position that - what did you take away from it that really helped you as you moved along your career path?
Speaker 2: I think if anything it helped my more thinking about marriage, but actually career wise that's become a very hot issue and that's how the male is treated when there is a divorce and what kind of custody rights he has.  And we've been seeing a lot of bills come up trying to give the father more rights and I can say I have a little insight from being in court and seeing how fathers are treated and sometimes they are pushed aside and the judge automatically assumes that the mother will be the best provider and that's not necessarily true.  And sometimes the mother gets a chance just to take the child so far away that the father never even has an opportunity to see him.  So, I'm glad I have some insight in some of those issues as they come up.
Story_ID: 50283
Speaker 1: Can you tell me, what significant events ahead shaped you as a young adult?
Speaker 2: I would say my--when my brother passed.  That was a very strange time, I guess, just to be--you never expect anyone who is so young to pass and, you know, you see your parents and parents never expect a child to die so they always seem a little different and since that time, a little more, I guess, introspective.
Speaker 1: Can you give me the circumstances of his death and tell us his name and how old he was?
Speaker 2: His name was Hans Eric.  He died in '82 [1982] so he was 22 and he had asthma and he died of an asthma attack.  My older sister has asthma too, but I don't know, somewhere I want to say when she was probably about 19 or 20 her attacks became less frequent, and she barely ever has any problem now.
Speaker 1: So, tell us, you know, what it was like for you at that time right after your brother.
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a terrible time because you never know what--that you're going to miss someone until there actually gone.  And in some ways, you feel like you're missing a leg or a foot.  It's always there and you always expect it to be there.  So, when they leave you in such a sudden manner, I think it's a shock that pretty much stays with you forever.
Story_ID: 50284
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was asking you, Mr. Stroger, about the period after your brother died and I wanted to know how long did it take you to really kind of absorb it and go on?
Speaker 2: I'd say for like six months, you're just kind of in a daze and hard to get it off your mind.  And after that, you know, it becomes easier to deal with.
Speaker 1: You were in college?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You had been in office since 1990?
Speaker 2: '93 [1993].
Speaker 1: '93. 1993.
Story_ID: 50285
Speaker 1: How would you characterize your own service in the Illinois State Legislature?
Speaker 2: I think I had a pretty good run.  Probably not extraordinary, but not bad either.  I enjoy carrying bills that help people across the state--little bills, like I had a bill for the city of Freeport and they needed to do something so they could build some streets and do some things and it's the kind of thing people don't jump up and say yeah, I want to do that.  But I think it makes you feel good to be able to help a group do something.  And the legislature is very top heavy.  The Speaker of the House has a tremendous amount of power, a lot of resources, money and people and in that sense the people who are elected generally will follow him.  I would say probably 97, 98 percent of the time if he suggests something, he's going to get enough votes to do whatever he wants.  And with that power, he generally will take heavy issues and the leaders get together, the Speaker, the Senate President, the Governor and the Minority Leaders, and they make pretty much all of the big decisions and the rest of us wait and say, okay that's what you think.  Maybe we'll tweak it here and there, but we don't have the same opportunity to really dive in.  And generally the people who do are just a select few, because the Speaker can't be everywhere.  And he may have a couple of favorite people who will handle negotiations and things of that nature.  So, I'm happy with being able to pass some legislation and do things in our district, like have job fairs and minority business development, pass money out to organizations that you know are really working hard and trying to do things.  You don't have the big fist of the Speaker, but you have some impact, and I think I've had some impact on our district.
Story_ID: 50286
Speaker 1: You had, I guess you had an advantage, a political advantage, knowing the process or observing the process of politics with your dad.  How did what you have observed from birth to even to today, how did that help you?
Speaker 2: You know, right off the top your advantages is name recognition.  You know, and we have a pretty different name.  There's not too many Strogers running around.  There's a few people I know who have been defeated and their name may be Williams or something like that and there's like two Williams in the race and they're splitting the vote.  I don't think I'm going to have that kind of problem.  But other than that, I think that I had been to a lot of County Board meetings and pretty much knew how the governmental process works.  So, I think when I got there it was easy for me to step in and be in committees and when I came--there's 118 members.  When I came, we had a class of 43, all new.  So, within two elections, I was a spokesman, well, no I was the Chairman.  Let's see.  The first year I got there I was the spokesman and then we lost the house, and you're not the Chairman, you're just--yeah, so I was the Spokesman at '95 [1995], '96 [1996] for a committee which was a pretty fast move, but since we had so many new members, we had the chance to move up quickly.  And I knew how Robert's Rules of Order and my father, he likes to make sure that you are involved in a lot of stuff.  So, I had been to a lot of little organizations and we used parliamentary procedure.  It makes it easy and yeah, people can tell right off that you have an idea how the process works, how to go about things and I think that made it easier for me to deal with lobbyists and legislatures.
Story_ID: 50287
Speaker 1: You seem to have a pretty low-key approach kind of overall basic to your personality.  How does that help or hinder you in politics?
Speaker 2: Well, I learned, I have learned that the squeaky wheel gets the grease, but the squeaky wheel isn't always as effective as the more quiet one.  I've--in politics, people realize it when you're paying attention to them, that you're listening and I think in my approach I try to listen to everybody's spiel and I tell them either I think you're right or I think you're wrong right off the top.  And if there's any in between, I tell them that and say, I'll study more about it ask some people who know about the issue and I'll get back to you and tell you what I think about it.  And I think it serves me well.  I know some of the louder people tend to immediately lose votes when they stand up because they're very combative and the more combative--and people think that when you're too combative all of a sudden you're really not talking about the issue, you're just trying to have a stage to say, look I'm making some noise, somebody recognize this.  So, I found that being low key helps.  But on the other hand, you also have to blow your own horn every once in a while because nobody else will and now you can do a lot of things, and nobody will know it if you don't at least go out there and tell the public that I have been able to accomplish this and that and the other thing.
Story_ID: 50288
Speaker 1: Can you give us--can you blow your horn a little bit for us on some things that you think you have accomplished and you are proud of?
Speaker 2: Well, I like to think that I've worked well with the city and we've done some little things to help the poor areas of the city, such as raise fees for fly dumping [illegal fly dumping].  At first the fly dumping fee was real--it was low.  It was like $500.  And it's hard to catch a guy who's dropping garbage and driving off.  So, they would do it whenever they got the opportunity.  Now we think we raised it to an amount of $3,000 for every offense.  If you get caught twice for the guys who drives these type of trucks, they're usually their own trucks, that's a lot of money and they could be put out of business is they're caught twice in six months or something.  So, one of my areas is South Chicago has been an area that they've targeted for years.  You know the steel mill is closed and there's a lot of vacant land and people are always dropping things there.  So, I was happy to sponsor that.  I also was able to sponsor a bill for the Chicago Public Schools that would raise their bond allocation for construction.  And it got through the House and was killed by the Senate.  Senate is republican controlled and you can say they have no real love for Cook County or the City of Chicago.  But I was happy to sponsor a bill like that and glad that they asked me to do it.  I've been able to sponsor some legislation to help people get scholarships, state scholarships.  We had a change, I believe it was right after I got there in '93, and that passed and was signed by the Governor.  So, these are the things you do in Springfield, but in the end I always felt that you can only do so much in Springfield.  The real work is really done in your district where you get to talk to the people.  You get to really see exactly what they need and I've been happy to direct funds to some groups that I think have really helped our community and sponsor some organizations that help children.  And I think the longer you're in Springfield, the more people you get to know and you get to find the ins and outs and where the money's hidden because there's--when I say hidden, I do mean hidden.  There's so many things that are going on and so many people and no one is really going to tell you everything.  I mean you get some friends and they may say, yeah, you do this, you do that.  But there's so many things that to tap into that you find out later, that I've just found out a few things just like this past year, and through those, I hope to help a lot more groups and organizations in our neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Can you give us an example of some of the things that you found out (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I don't want to tell you too much, because I want to be like the rest of the group.  I don't want to give out too many secrets.  But there's a lot of organizations who will donate money to individuals if you just ask them and say I think this is a good group.  I've discovered a few of those.
Story_ID: 50289
Speaker 1: Can you tell me--have you sought--well, you must have sought to some degree, your father's advice generally, not about specific dealings or policies, but have you sought your father's advice as to how to handle your political life?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, he's the political leader of our area, right?  He is the committeeman which means that, he's the Democratic committeeman, which means that his job is to promote the democrat and so in essence he promotes me, and I look at him as the leader and yeah, I call him on a lot of issues, since he's been involved, elected, for thirty years now and working with the county and being the president.  There's a lot of issues that he has to deal with that affect the county, the state, and the city.  So, I talk to him frequently.  I find it--it's also a good way to get the lobbyists off my back for a while.  I'll say, "Oh, let me ask my dad what he thinks.
Speaker 1: How would you compare your styles?
Speaker 2: He's [John Stroger] very aggressive.  He's a very--and politics is his life.  I mean if--he's a lawyer too.  But I think if he didn't have to feed the kids and pay the house note and the car note, he wouldn't have been a lawyer.  Politics is breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Well, for me it's breakfast and lunch.  I want to have dinner somewhere else.  I don't really want to spend my whole life, you know, being involved in politics and not being able to spend a lot of time at home with my wife and child.
Story_ID: 50290
Speaker 1: Now, one thing, you mentioned about your dad breakfast, lunch and dinner and politics and so on.  Would you say it takes that kind of dedication to withstand what you run into politically and personally if you're a career politician?
Speaker 2: It depends on, I guess, what you really strive for.  If you're running for certain jobs such as an executive and he's the President of the County Board, the Mayor's Office, the Governor, you're going to have to spend an unordinary amount of time being out in people's face and shaking hands.  Because those actually are full-time jobs.  But the other politicians, the locals, the alderman, the state legislators, water reclamation commissioners, all those jobs are part-time jobs.  The only people who decide to make them full time were people who were community activists at first and once they became an elected official, you're still a community activist, but you're not getting paid for it anymore.  So, you know, they ask for more money and it becomes more of a full-time job for them because that's what they were doing before.  But I prefer to keep my job as a part-time job, and I think it's possible for anybody who wants to.  You can run your office efficiently and still do other things outside.  It also keeps you abreast of what happens in the world as you govern because if everyone was just a full-time government official, I think you kind of lose contact of what's happening in the business world and you don't have the tie that you need to see when you pass a bill that's going to affect, you know, 25,000 people.
Story_ID: 50291
Speaker 1: How do you conduct yourself to make up for--within your family life--to make up for that having to be away like you saw and your mother had to kind of raise the kids single-handedly for periods?  How do you adjust that in your own life now that you have a five-month old?
Speaker 2: I'm not--I don't do the same things that my father did.  I go to the events that I need to and after that it's like any other business day.  I decide I'm going to do this, that and the other thing, and at this time I'm going home and spending it with my family.  And there are some days that I may say well, I'm going to spend the whole day with my family because in politics you never know and a lot of days your day may start at nine and go to 12 and then you don't have anything to do and then all of a sudden it starts again at six and goes 'til ten.  So you need to pick your moments.
Speaker 1: As you know, we're preparing a CD rom and video for schools.  Would you trace for us the route a bill takes as it goes through the Illinois Senate within the context of a school person?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, generally there will either be a specific organization that will have an idea, like we could say the insurance industry will say that they have an idea that will help lower rates.
Speaker 1: Can I get you to say--since this will probably be used in one piece, can I get you to say the route a bill takes through the State Legislature is, or something like that.
Story_ID: 50292
Speaker 1: The route that a bill takes through the legislature is first an idea either conceived by a special group, like the insurance group, who may want to have an insurance bill passed or you might even have like the organization, Mothers Against Drunk Driving [MADD], and they will have an idea and they will bring it to a legislator.  Or someone may say I think that--one of the legislators may say I think that we need to do something special about a certain thing that could be drunk driving or insurance and they'll go to the legislator, generally will go to the legislative research bureau and they will write a bill for you.  You state what you want in common language, and they'll write it out in the form that is acceptable.  In the insurance industry, they'll have their separate groups and they have lawyers that will write out the bill.  And Mothers for Drunken Driving [sic, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, MADD], such a big organization, they probably could do the same, but if they wanted to, they could just bring it to a legislator and say, this is our idea, could you have it written, and he could go down and have it written for him.  From there the bill is introduced to the clerk.  The clerk takes it, gives it a number and it will go to the Rules Committee, and the Rules Committee is a very small committee and it's, I believe, made up of three democrats and two republicans and they will send that bill to A specific committee that will deal with those type of issues and in this case, it would probably be the insurance committee.  And the insurance committee will have maybe sixteen members.  The majority will be democrats.  They will listen to the bill.  One of the legislators will sponsor the bill.  He'll be the lead sponsor.  Then you can put as many other sponsors as you want behind it, but the lead sponsor and we'll say the lead sponsor will be Representative Jones.  He will go the committee.  He will usually bring some experts.  Maybe he'll bring some people from MADD [Mothers Against Drunk Driving] or from one of the insurance industry's lobbying groups.  The legislators will have a chance to ask questions about the bill and after that they'll vote it up or down.  And a bill has two opportunities in any committee.  So if you fail the first time, you can go back, talk to the legislators individually, and try to change their mind, bring the bill back, pass it out of the House.  Once it passes out of the House, it goes over to the clerk's office in the Senate.  They will send it to their Rules Committee, and they will assign it to a committee.  I believe they have an insurance committee too.  And the--on that side--and a Senator will have to take up the sponsorship and he'll become the Chief Sponsor.  And he'll do the same thing the House member did, bring in some experts, discuss the bill, hopefully pass it out of the committee.  Then it will come to the full body.  In the Senate, there's 59 members.  So, you have to stand up, present the bill.  Generally, you'll have some legal experts standing next to you whispering in your ear telling you this is what it does and this is what the effects are and they'll have done all the research and basically tell you--try to answer any questions that anyone from the floor will have.  The sponsor will do the speaking, the legal expert whispers in his ear.  If it passes, then it will go to the Governor's office and the Governor has 90 days to pass the bill.  Now sometimes, a bill will get to a committee and they will amend the bill.  They'll say, well, we don't like a certain part.  They'll put something else on the bill and it will pass out of the committee, go to the floor, pass off the floor, but it will not go to the Governor, it will go to the clerk of the Senate and he will send it over to the clerk of the House.  The clerk of the House will send it back to the Rules Committee.  The Rules Committee will send it to, more than likely, they'll send it back to the insurance committee--no, I'm sorry.  That's not correct.  The clerk of the House sends it to the Rules Committee, and the Rules Committee will sent it directly to the floor at this time and you will have the opportunity for the sponsor to talk about the addition to the bill and either vote it up or down.  If they like the addition, it goes straight to the Governor, and he has 90 days.  And if they don't like the addition, it goes into what we call a Conference Committee Report.  And that's where you take so many members from the House and the same amount of members from the Senate.  They sit down and try to work out a deal that will make everyone happy and if they do, they bring the Conference Committee Report back to the floor, the House will vote on it, send it to the Senate, the Senate will vote on it, and if they pass it, it goes up to the Governor and he has ninety days.  It's a longer process than I even thought until I just started talking about it.
Speaker 2: And you've taken some things through this process yourself?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.  I'm sure everyone has had some bills that have gone back and forth.  Not that many bills go to Conference Committee though.  But usually they'll be amended, but both sides generally will agree.
Speaker 2: Did you ever get a bill that you never recognized--that's not what I started with?
Speaker 1: Well, sometimes they will take your bill and delete everything and just put a whole different language.  Yeah, you're right.  Not even the concept that you had in mind at all and it's up to you to decide well, do I want to handle this.  And generally people go along with the program because once your bill's dead, you'll still want to do something in the world.
Story_ID: 50293
Speaker 1: What do you say to young people as far as getting them a little more interested in State government?  Is seems that State legislators are the ones that people and especially young people never think of.
Speaker 2: I think you're right and I think that mostly has to do with your local official, which in our case is your alderman, is the bare bones person.  He's your garbage.  He's your streets.  That's something that you have to have.  You have to have your garbage can and you can't have big pot holes in your street.  So everyone knows their alderman, and they're going to call him up immediately if something's wrong.  In our case, we are more of a group that who will pass a law that may affect everyone, but everyone is not always aware of what the new laws are.  They don't pay attention because a lot of things that you pass are the kind of things that you only have to know about it if you get in trouble and all of a sudden, okay, so I'm paying $100 for this?  So people aren't really looking out for things like that.  Unless you belong to a specific interest group, you're not going to look out for any trouble coming down the pipeline.  But I think a major problem is--I went to a Catholic school, so I never was quite sure what they taught when it came to government in the public schools, but it seems as if they're missing something.  You're right, most people I talk to and even the older ones, they don't really realize what a State representative and or State Senator does.  They tend to confuse it with a Congressman.  You know Congressman get a lot of publicity because they're dealing with such a gigantic budget.  Even though in our state, our budget is $43 billion, but there's approximately 12 million people here and probably 48 percent of them will live above the I-80 line, which is the Interstate that runs pretty much through Will County, Frankfort and places like that.  We have the majority of the population up here and Chicago, which is about 3 million people, people don't realize that yeah, they're paying all these taxes and a lot of money goes down, and a whole bunch of it never comes back.  No one ever thinks about it.  They don't--people--it's hard to rally people around money that they don't actually, you know, see and it won't touch them unless it's a tax cut and so I think that's why we get lost in the shuffle.
Story_ID: 50294
Speaker 1: Just try for a minute to separate yourself from having a politically active father.  At what point, and I know it'll be hard, but I'm trying to see from the average student's perspective, at what point did you become aware of State legislators or do you think you may have become more aware if you had not grown up in it?
Speaker 2: That's a good question because I probably wouldn't have really paid much attention.  I would say that Carol Moseley Braun was our representative, and she had some notoriety and Dick Newhouse [Richard Newhouse, Jr.] was our Senator.  So, I had heard their names and knew a little bit about them, but I wouldn't say that if I wasn't from a political family, I probably wouldn't know much about the State rep and State Senator either.  Even though they send tons of children down to Springfield and they come and run through and go back up, but I think if you really want somebody to know something, you have to - every couple of months you have to bring the subject up.
Story_ID: 50295
Speaker 1: Do you think you're going to be a career politician?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: I think that eventually I'd like to retire early and do something that I would enjoy a little more.  I enjoy politics.  I enjoy being part of the process and helping people and knowing what's going on, but I'm probably more of a private person than, you know, like my father is.  I wouldn't think I would ever do anything past maybe the age of 55 at least.
Speaker 1: Did you unconsciously make adjustments and you don't really realize, you know, what may (unclear).
Speaker 2: I would say we needed more family members.  Seems I needed more siblings.
Speaker 1: To put it off on.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Let them do a little of this, a little of that. So, if maybe you won't be as long or as intense a career as your dad, what would you like when if at whatever point you decide you're going to step back from political life, what would you like to be remembered for?  What would you like for them to say about Todd Stroger, Jr.?
Story_ID: 50296
Speaker 1: I would say that I would like to be remembered as just someone who cared and tried to help people, got some things accomplished.  Maybe got a lot of things accomplished hopefully.  And you know you can't save the world, but there's a certain amount of people that you can reach out and touch and if you can help them, then they can help somebody else and that's what I'd like to be remembered for.
Speaker 2: Is there anything in our discussion today, and I have to apologize for the stop and starts, is there anything in our discussion today that I didn't ask you that perhaps I should have?
Story_ID: 50297
Speaker 1: No, I think we pretty much covered my whole life.  I would just probably say that growing up, you know, in a political family especially when your father is as high profile.  It's a different thing when you're in a black political family and a white family.  As I've realized the older I get and the more I see the different families, I can see that you have to be very aggressive when you're in a black political family because if you don't take everything immediately and make sure that you've helped a lot of people along the sides, you get into trouble, there won't be a lot of people throwing out buoys to help you.  And even as - when you're in a certain position, there's still people who will not give you a hundred percent.  They'll just give you what they can get and get away with and if you don't put your foot in their neck, they'll never do everything that you thing that they should do and that they would probably do if there were somebody else in that position.
Story_ID: 50298
Speaker 1: So what kind of safeguards have you put in place to kind of avoid being surprised as your father was when he ran into his challenge?
Speaker 2: Well, actually I'm working on that right now.  I'm working on my business plan.  I think every elected official ought to have their own business, unless they're a lawyer or, you know, an accountant or some kind of professional where they have something that they know they can always get a job.  I happen to be an investment banker, but you never know how that can go.  That's - because I do municipal bonds, things like that and it's the kind of thing you can be loved one day and hated the next.  So, you never know.  But I think every elected official should have their own thing especially since most of us are - or the majority of us are in a, what I would call a part-time position.  Because, you're right, you never know the public may say, "Well, I've had enough."  Or they may just forget you and as I said earlier, people run a candidate with the same name so there's two of you on the ballot and then some guy wins that nobody ever heard of but they split your vote right in two and you can be out of a job in a minute.  I've seen it happen just in the last election. So you're feeling like a little more comfortable perhaps with -
Speaker 1: Well, I think where I live, I'm pretty safe where I live because we've been there since 1960.  Well, we've been in that area since 1963, and I've been in that same house since 1966.  So, people know me and they know my father.  And if I tried to stay, you know, in pretty much the same job, I could probably stay in that job for the next 12 years, depending how the map comes out, but even then I don't think I'd have any problem unless I did something really, you know, crazy.  But that's not something that I'd like to do.  I wouldn't want to stay there forever.  You know, the more you're there, the more you get to know, but there's a ceiling and I think I'm coming mighty close to the ceiling of what you can do to help people.  So, I'll probably move on to something else within the next four years or so. Do you find yourself being careful how you handle your trust of individuals given what friends and foes did to your dad?
Speaker 2: Well, I've always - it's always been my opinion somewhere when you're about, oh I'd say about 20, you got all the friends you need.  You don't need any more.  And you know once you get out, you probably pick up two or three along the way, but once you really start working - I mean I've met some good people in Springfield who have similar interests and who I would trust doing a lot of things, but I can say there's two that I would really want to, you know, hang on and do things with them.  But after that, you don't need any more friends.  You need to basically get your own things started and make sure no matter what happens you'll be okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I'll just close it with this one question. I think you may want to get some things about your impressions of the history of African American legislators, some things that you've heard, maybe some things that inspired you about the history of African American in the State legislation and also what it's like being minority in State legislature.
Story_ID: 50299
Speaker 1: History of African American - my dad is a very well read, so every once in a while he'll throw somebody's name out and say, you know, he served in this time.  He just threw a man's name out - I can't remember - the other day.  I'll have to go home.  I have a booklet that shows all the African American legislators.  The people I know the best are people who have probably died in - we're in 2000, so they died somewhere in the last 15 years and I have some recollection of them such as Cecil Partee and Cornell Davis and Harold Washington.  I think as legislators - I'm lucky to serve for the guy named Arthur Turner from the West side and Arthur's been there since 1980 so he was there when a lot of the guys who had gotten there and couldn't sleep in a hotel, they had to sleep in people's houses because the hotels wouldn't allow blacks.  I enjoy talking to him because he can give you a little history about what the guys told him how life was when they first got there.  One of the things I learned that was, I thought, should be spread among the neighborhood, our community, is how the Senators stood up one year and forced the democrats to elect an African American as the Senate President, who it turned out to be Cecil Partee.  Cecil Partee was not the person they were pushing.  I can't remember exactly who that was now.  They were pushing someone else and they would not elect that person, but they did elect Partee and, of course, the people who pushed it were punished, but they accomplished their goal.  They didn't get all the goodies that people get at the end of the year and all that and chairmanships, but they accomplished their goal and they had an African American who was appointed as the Senate President.  And I think that should be played up more and the African American neighborhood has a sense of pride right there.
Story_ID: 50300
Speaker 1: Being in a body of 118 on the House side, I believe there's 22 minorities and that includes - no there's more than that actually.  I guess there's 25 and that would include 4 Hispanics and some of the Hispanics work with the black group and some don't.  I guess because just like the rest of America some blacks - some Hispanics are black, some Hispanics are white.  Our group tries to stick together, the Illinois Legislative Black Caucus, we try to stick together to push certain issues through the House.  And since we're such a large voting block, you know, we are generally able to put certain things on the table and have them actually pass.  I'm glad that we work together in that sense, even though, you know, once you get so many egos in one room, you're going to have a problem, but a lot of things that we can work on together that we have and it has generally panned out for us.  Sometimes you find that Governors will tell you, "Yeah, I'll do that."  And then they'll do half of what they tell you.  Once the budget's passed, you know, we'll come back to that later.  It never actually happens.  And sometimes you'll get that well, we'll do this and we'll come back to that later.  I think we've learned now that - well, let's just not pass the budget.  And we've gotten a lot of things accomplished.  And I'm happy to be a part of that.
Story_ID: 50301
Speaker 1: It's hard sometimes because the issues you have: poverty - I was just watching the news and they showed that not only are seniors growing, the number of seniors in America growing, but there's a great disparity among White seniors and African American seniors.  The average household income of White seniors, the median I should say, was $181,000 and for African Americans it was like $13,000.  So that's below the poverty level.  There is such poverty and a feeling of, I don't want to say that people are giving up, but I think there's such a great group that's never been anywhere to say, well, this is what I want.  They only know their neighborhood.  They may come downtown for a second, because sometimes you have to come.  But they don't have a real feel for what the whole world is, even with the communication we have now and all these channels.  People don't have a real feel of what they can accomplish and what they could do.  As a matter of fact, since I'm rambling, I can't remember is it was Thomas Cotton or Thomas Malthus, but he had a theory and it said that by a certain age, and I think we passed that age already, the world would be a much better place, people would have more.  And actually we do have more and people in America, even the poor, generally have more than anyplace else.  But he meant as the whole world there would be less poverty and you know we wouldn't have like India where you got a billion people starving because there would be more people who would come up with ideas.  But what has happened is you have more people, but we have more illiteracy.  There's fewer people who can get out of 12th grade.  You know when they're 16 they stop going.  So we have a billions of people who may have great ideas, but they'll never be able to bring them forth because they don't have the education to do it.
Story_ID: 50302
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me what up to this point in your life, whether it's personal or professional, has been the most influential event in your life.
Speaker 2: I think probably getting married.  You know once you have a partner and you feel some responsibility and making certain certain things are done and they have their part, and you have your part.  That changes your whole aspect on life and marriage is a partnership, so and it's just like a business.  There's some give and take.  I've learned to give some and I'm certain she's learned to give some.  I know I'm not perfect, and I think that has helped affect my whole life and business and dealing with other people.
Speaker 1: Supreme political move, am I right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your wife.  How did you meet?
Speaker 2: I met my wife in college, Xavier in New Orleans.  I want to say I probably met her the first week I was there.  She was one of the first people I met.  She stayed in New Orleans after we graduated and we didn't go out or anything.  We ran in some of the same circles and then she moved to Milwaukee to stay with her Aunt.  She decided she wanted to move out of New Orleans and see if she could get a job in the big city.  Worked in Milwaukee and then moved to the Trib and worked on the radio station.  That was a too tough a job because at the time she probably was, let's say, about 25 and they wanted you there at 4:30 and that's pretty tough for a woman.  So, she moved on and got a job at Jenny Jones and then a radio station and we had a baby almost six months ago and she's been taking a leave of absence.  She works for Jesse White and Secretary of State in labor negotiations, but she's going to go back in September because you can only have a good job so long.  I tell her work a few years then we'll have enough money you can just quit and take care of Hans.
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you want to just freely comment on?  Make a statement before -
Speaker 2: No, I think I made my - my universal statement already.
Story_ID: 50303
Speaker 1: And the baby's name?
Speaker 2: His name is Hans Eric.  I named him after my brother.
Speaker 1: Great.  Okay.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you. Just -
Speaker 1: Did I forget something? Just tell us an inspiration of why you named your son after your brother?  Just real quick for me.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My wife asked me what names do we want, and we made a whole list of names and I came up with like three male names.  Something a little different then what we usually have.  I had Hans on there.  And she came up with some female names.  And we didn't find out what the baby's sex was.  So when they delivered it and she said it was a boy they asked me, I felt Hans Eric was good enough for my brother, it's good enough for my son.  It's kind of a link and you know it helps me remember my brother better and it'll be a way for me to tell my son about him.
