Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's Alfred (laughter).  Alfred, A-L-F-R-E-D.
Speaker 1: When were you born and where?
Speaker 2: I was born March 12, 1935, in Louisiana, a little place called Plaisance, which was just outside of Opelousas [Louisiana], and since neither of those places are likely known, it was fifty miles from Baton Rouge [Louisiana] (laughter).
Speaker 1: What is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is March 22nd?
Speaker 1: Or June (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) March 22nd, see I--
Speaker 1: It's June twenty--
Speaker 2: --see I said, is it June 22--
Speaker 1: --fourth?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  June 23rd.
Speaker 1: June 23rd.
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  No, it's the 24th.
Speaker 2: Is it the 24th?  Okay.  June 24th.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  We all wrong.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Oh my gosh (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  We're in 'The Twilight Zone.'
Speaker 2: I'll ask you one more time.  What's today's date?
Speaker 1: June 24th, 2007 (laughter).
Speaker 2: Where are we conducting this interview?
Speaker 1: We're conducting it in Chapel Hill [North Carolina] at a place called Governors Club on 60140 Davie.
Speaker 2: And what is your profession?
Speaker 1: Well, I wear multiple hats simultaneously, and so I've had a number of professions.  At the moment, I'm a professor with the practice of public policy at Duke University [Durham, North Carolina], and I direct a center on leadership and public values which is a partnership with the University of Cape Town in South Africa [Cape Town, South Africa] where I also have an appointment at the business school.
Story_ID: 487404
Speaker 1: We're gonna get started with a few fun questions.
Speaker 2: Very well.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Gumbo (laughter).
Speaker 1: Nice and spicy?
Speaker 2: Nice and spicy.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite season?
Speaker 2: Anything but winter, and at the moment we've worked it out so that we are in the United States in the summer, and we're in South Africa in the summer because the seasons are reversed.  And so we've tried to go from summer to summer (laughter).
Speaker 1: What about a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue, probably.  Yeah, blue.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, a lot of people think we go to South Africa for vacation, but we actually go to work, and since we are there so long, we rarely take a, a, a normal kind of vacation.  My favorite vacation is to go to some place that I've not been and to be able to probe into the culture and to find out a little bit more about the people, and so that means my places of vacation have been diverse and there is no one place that I go back to all the time.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite saying or quote?
Speaker 2: Well, there is one in which I end most of my speeches (laughter).  It's from Vaclav Havel in which he says, "I'm not a, an optimist because I do not believe that everything ends well.  I am not a pessimist because I do not believe that everything ends badly.  But I could not accomplish anything if I did not have hope within me.  For the gift of hope is as big a gift as the gift of life itself."
Speaker 1: That's profound.
Story_ID: 487405
Speaker 1: Let's start delving into your family background.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: How far back can you go on your mother's side?  Great-grandparents?
Speaker 2: Not very far in terms of names.  I, I know my, both of my grandfathers' names [Leonce Jones and Albert Joseph], and my grandmother [Minerva Jones] on my mother's side was deceased when I was born so I never knew her, but she was a Native American.  My grandmother on my father's [Adam Joseph] side died very early so I knew her and I met, her but my great-grandfather on my father's side was German, and I knew that so.  But I can't go back much further than that.
Speaker 1: What is your mother's name?
Speaker 2: Julia, Julia Lee Jones Joseph [Julia Jones Joseph].
Speaker 1: Where was she born and where?
Speaker 2: She was born in Plaisance, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Do you know what year?
Speaker 2: No, I can't remember.  It seems to me it was 1914, but I, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: What was her profession?  Did she work?
Speaker 2: No, she did not.  My father was a minister and she was a full-time associate to my father and mother of my brother [John W. Joseph] and I.
Speaker 1: Tell me about her education.
Speaker 2: My mother dropped out of school in eighth grade.  She was living on a farm, and her parents needed her to help bring in the crops.  And she did not graduate from high school until after I had graduated from high school [St. Landry Parish Training School, Opelousas, Louisiana].  Then she went back and finished her high school education.
Speaker 1: Do you know what kind of farm she worked?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was one of those farms down in southwest Louisiana that probably did cotton and sweet potatoes, basically.
Story_ID: 487406
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father, his name.
Speaker 2: My father's name was Adam Joseph, and he was a Baptist minister.  He served the churches for more than fifty years before he passed away.  He lived in Plaisance [Louisiana], used to walk to high school in Opelousas [Louisiana] which was several miles every day, so he did finish high school.  And he finished college the year before my brother [John W. Joseph] and then my brother finished college, then I finished a year after, so for three years one of us was graduating from college.
Speaker 1: Did he attend Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: No, he went to Leland College [Baker, Louisiana] which was a Baptist college in Louisiana that no longer exists.
Speaker 1: Do you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My brother went to Leland College also.
Speaker 1: When was your father born and where?
Speaker 2: He was also born in Plaisance and I am sorry to say I don't know what year?
Speaker 1: Early 1900s?
Speaker 2: He was a few years older than my mother [Julia Jones Joseph] so probably about '10 [1910], a '11 [1911] or something.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1910.  And he was a Baptist minister throughout your life?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, he started out as a farmer, and I, I have a few memories of those days but not many.  So he, when I was in the second grade, he moved out of Plaisance into town.  Opelousas, of course, was not a very big city at the time but it was at least a city, and, and he moved because he had been called to serve a church.
Story_ID: 487407
Speaker 1: Now, you said your mother [Julia Jones Joseph], her mother, your maternal grandmother [Minerva Jones] was Native American.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You don't know her name?
Speaker 2: No, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: He was African American and I don't know what mixtures he might have had and--
Speaker 1: Do you know his name?
Speaker 2: Yes, Leonce [Leonce Jones], L-E-O-N-C-E.
Speaker 1: And what was, that was his first name?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was his last name?
Speaker 2: Jones.
Speaker 1: Do you have a sense of when he may have been born?
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: Late 1800s?
Speaker 2: Yeah, late 1800s.  I do have a sense that he was one of the most erudite people I ever knew.  I never could figure out why but he always was on top of what was going on.  I used to sit at his footsteps and he'd just tell me all this political intrigues and stuff that he somehow knew about.
Speaker 1: Where did his education end?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure that he even finished high school, but he is one of those people who would have been a great professional of some sort if he had had that opportunity.
Speaker 1: And he was a farmer?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you know your paternal grandmother's [Celestine Joseph] name?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Grandfather?
Speaker 2: Yes, his name was Albert Joseph.
Speaker 1: Where was he born?
Speaker 2: Plaisance [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: And was he a farmer as well?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was he born in the late 1800s?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 487408
Speaker 1: Did either of your parents [Julia Jones Joseph and Adam Joseph] tell you stories about their childhoods?
Speaker 2: My father used to talk--well, it wasn't so much about it--no, they didn't really tell us very much.  And as a matter of fact, my, my parents so much wanted us to be more successful than them that anything they thought might be a barrier or impediment, for instance, I always wished I had learned Creole.  My father spoke fluent Creole, but he never spoke it in front of me and he never taught me.  He never wanted anything that would affect my diction, ability to articulate English.
Speaker 1: Interesting.
Speaker 2: I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did--
Speaker 2: I knew he was a farmer, I knew as a kid that he walked miles to go to school and that's about all he, he told us.
Speaker 1: Did your father have siblings?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Sisters, brothers, how many?
Speaker 2: I think there were nine, and there were five boys and I think four girls.
Speaker 1: Do you know any of their names?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Uncle Mose [Moses Joseph] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Mose?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: M-O--
Speaker 2: S-E.  Paul [Paul Joseph], Albert, Jr. [Albert Joseph] Aunt Lee Anna [Lee Anna Joseph], Odele[Odele Joseph (ph.)], those are the ones that immediately come to mind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about your mother, siblings?
Speaker 2: Had almost the same size.  And I, you wanna know some of their names?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Uncle Wilkin, W-L-K-I-N [Wilkin Jones], Lee [Lee Jones], Leonce, Jr. [Leonce Jones, Jr.] and then the sisters, Lou Anna [Lou Anna Jones Young].  Those are the ones I immediately remember.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I left home a long time ago (laughter).
Speaker 1: Sure (laughter).
Story_ID: 487409
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your childhood.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well, my earliest childhood memory was, I, my grandfather, Albert [Albert Joseph], on my father's [Adam Joseph] side used to grow a garden in addition to farming.  And he had a tomato patch and he caught me out there once eating the tomatoes before they were ripe (laughter), and he scolded me and I, I remember that, now, why I remember that, I'm not sure.  Another early childhood memory, because this was all before school, so--and I went to school very early, so we're probably talking about three or four years old.  When we, we moved from Plaisance [Louisiana], one place we were living on my grandfather's farm, my father's dad, and my father then bought his own farm, a little farm, I remember the day we moved, and I remember my brother [John W. Joseph] and I sitting in the back of the wagon that was moving us, and I, I still sort of had visual images of us sort of looking out as we were going along a headland of a field and, and thinking how nice it was gonna be to have a, a real house (laughter).
Story_ID: 487410
Speaker 1: So what was it like when you had a real house?
Speaker 2: We--it was bigger.  We had a little more space though we both shared the same room as we had done before, but the room was a little bit bigger.  And we, we still were using kerosene lamps so we didn't get electricity until I moved to Opelousas [Louisiana] a few years later.  But I, I remember that I used to like to, to try and read anything I could at the, even at this early age and my mother [Julia Jones Joseph] used to, to make us, to turn off the kerosene lamps because we needed what little money we had for food, and therefore staying up trying to read under the kerosene lamps at night was burning the fuel.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what you read?
Speaker 2: Anything I could get.  They were usually hand-me-down books that I got from somebody.  My father [Adam Joseph] didn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was your favorite?  Did you have a favorite?
Speaker 2: At that time, I, I don't remember a favorite at that that early age 'cause I was just really learning to read (unclear).
Speaker 1: Who, who taught you to read?
Speaker 2: My mother.
Speaker 1: Do you remember that experience of learning how to read?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember too much about it, but I do remember that when I was four years old my brother [John W. Joseph] started school, first grade, and I cried so much, wanting to go to school that they let me go, and the teachers said it was okay.  And I was supposed to be just there as a sort of hanger-on 'cause, and they were nice enough to let me just hang on to my brother but it turns out I did the work and I was, then they accepted me in first grade and--
Speaker 1: Nice (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Were you four or five when you entered first grade?
Speaker 2: Well, I was really four at first and then I was five, yeah.
Story_ID: 487411
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned your brother.  What's your brother's name and when was he born?
Speaker 2: John Joseph [John W. Joseph], and he was born in 1933, September 29th.
Speaker 1: Were you close growing up?
Speaker 2: Very close and we still are.  He's still my best friend.
Speaker 1: What kinds of things did you do together growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, we used to love to ride our bicycles.  We did manage to have bicycles.  They were old beaten down bicycles that somebody had thrown away, but nevertheless we loved to ride our bicycles when we were little.  And one of the first things we did, we learned to ride when we were so little that we couldn't sit on the seat, and these were the frames and we'd stick our leg through the frame to get to the pedal, you know, 'cause we couldn't go over the frame but we could ride (laughter).  And when we moved from, from, in Plaisance [Louisiana] from the one place to another, you're talking about early childhood memories, I remember falling and cutting my lip and I still have a scar under there from that fall--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --off my bicycle.  I hit a rock when I fell, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you, was there a river (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's one of the things we used to do together but, yes?
Speaker 1: Was there a river or a pond nearby?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, we used to like to try and catch crawfish.  We were living near a, a rice field and at certain times of year they'd let the water out, and when they'd let the water out there would be all this crawfish, that, that, that I sort of remember, and we'd go out and catch crawfish.  But we used to like to just steal some sugarcane and cut that up.  In the summertime just being able to chew a piece of sugarcane was really pleasant (laughter).
Speaker 1: Where did you steal it from exactly?
Speaker 2: Oh my, usually my [paternal] grandfather's [Albert Joseph], yeah, 'cause my father [Adam Joseph] didn't grow sugarcane so my father had a big farm.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father's farm?  What do you remember (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I don't remember very much except one day, I, I remember my mother [Julia Jones Joseph] and my brother and I were out walking in the field and I looked down and my brother was standing on a curled up snake and (laughter) I tried to say snake, but it wasn't coming out that way, I was so terrified.  And then I started to run and then he finally realized he was on a snake and we ran and ran all the way back to the house but we, we evaded the snake, yeah.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite smell from early childhood?
Speaker 2: Hm, I don't know that I, I remember any particular smell that (unclear) any particular (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you have a--
Speaker 2: It, it probably the smell of gumbo cooking (laughter).  'Cause that has, I've retained all these years and--
Speaker 1: What did that smell like?
Speaker 2: Good food.
Speaker 1: Did your mother cook quite a bit?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she wasn't as great a cook as some of my aunts who used to be great at pies and canning and gumbo but my mother did okay.  But, you know, she wasn't known in the family as one of the great cooks.  She had sisters who were.
Story_ID: 487412
Speaker 1: Do you remember how race relations were in Plaisance [Louisiana] at that time?
Speaker 2: Never saw any white people.  I went to a black school, and we worked on our black farm; we went to our black church.  It was not until I went to Opelousas [Louisiana] that I began to realize that there were these other folks out there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did anyone ever speak of white people?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What'd they say?
Speaker 2: My father [Adam Joseph] used to talk about those Cajuns which was a negative then, which has now become a romantic one but and even when I started school, and I used to run into the white kids, I--we walked to school, they had buses but we didn't have any for black kids, and so we used to walk a long distance.  And they'd call me the N word and I would respond by calling them a Cajun 'cause that was the most negative thing I could think of, and the N word never became a positive word but Cajun did (laughter).
Speaker 1: What school did you attend, elementary school?
Speaker 2: I went, went to St. Landry elementary school in Opelousas [Louisiana].  I started out at Plaisance [Louisiana] as I said and I went there for two grades and then I went to Opelousas and went to St. Landry.  It was called St. Landry Parish Training School [Opelousas, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Was this a private school or a public school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, it was a public school.  We studied in hand-me-down buildings with hand-me-down books.  The building in which we studied had been declared as uninhabitable for white kids, and so they gave it to us.
Speaker 1: Describe the physical condition of the building?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a two story building.  And, I mean, you know, there was no paint on anything to be seen so it was a lot of writing and, and cuts in the wall and the chairs and the furniture.  And on the second floor was a, a kind of a porch but they wouldn't let us go out there because it was tilted and it wasn't safe and so, but I, I remember that.
Speaker 1: And you mentioned the hand-me-down books.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the books were in pretty bad shape, and they had discarded them from the white school and--as no longer fit for white students to study with and so they gave 'em to us.
Speaker 1: Did you realize that at the time?
Speaker 2: No, I never paid much attention, not in elementary school.  By the time I was in high school that's when my sort of rebellious nature began to set in and my sort of militancy, even in that time (laughter).  But in elementary school I just studied with these things and went to this building, and--but, but an interesting happened because I guess it was by the time I was eighth grade or ninth grade, eighth grade, I, I used to pick cotton and at lunch time, we'd take a few minutes off and sometime we had something to eat and sometime we didn't, but I used to lie under the wagon, which they were dumping the cotton that we were picking, and I used to lie there thinking that someday I'm gonna show these people.  Uh-huh, I'm gonna come back here and they're gonna sing my praises.  And so I began, I, I can remember that sort of race consciousness, but it was not one of feeling defeat but it was one of being defiant.  You know, I'm not gonna let you guys stop me.
Story_ID: 487413
Speaker 1: Do you remember your first encounter with a white person?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the real encounter, I mean, I had seen 'em before (laughter), but one day my brother [John W. Joseph] and I were walking back from school and these white kids, they were, they'd come in gangs and beat up black kids and, and we had to run into the porch of a black person's house we were passing by and they let us in and saved us from these kids.  But it was about that same time that a kid in my brother's class was so badly beaten by a gang like that that he died.
Speaker 1: Was there fear of white people, of conflict, of--
Speaker 2: No, no, I don't know that I was afraid.  My, my father [Adam Joseph], he used to have run-down cars but he always carried a gun, he always carried a pistol.  And one time he came looking for us and we were being harassed by white kids and he got of the car with his gun, with his pistol in his hand, and let us in the car (laughter).  But I don't remember any, any real fear.  I can remember some anger that I had to struggle to control.
Speaker 1: What did you notice when you noticed that there was a difference between the two communities?  Help me see the difference?
Speaker 2: Their school.  I used to walk past their school and go to mine.  And they had this beautiful school and I had this run-down school (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the name of the white school?
Speaker 2: It was called Opelousas High School [Opelousas, Louisiana], um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what did their school look like?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a new building with paint and shiny and attractive.
Speaker 1: And they had buses?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: How far did you walk to school?
Speaker 2: Well, I thought it was many miles, my brother tells me it was only 1.7 miles.  Yeah, he, he went out one day and measured it (laughter) some years later, looking back on our experience then.
Speaker 1: How long did it take you to get to school in the morning?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I didn't have a watch or anything.  My mother [Julia Jones Joseph] just set us out in time that we arrived before school began.  And I never paid any attention to how long it took.
Story_ID: 487414
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Social studies in, in high school [St. Landry Parish Training School, Opelousas, Louisiana], yeah, but, you know, I even did well, in, in things like algebra and stuff because my algebra professor was a philosopher who introduced me to all sorts of books that I started reading at a very early age that no high school kids were reading.  He was also my speech teacher and he used to coach me and I used to compete in oratorical contests so--
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Samuel Douglas, and he was interested in me as a total human being.
Story_ID: 487415
Speaker 1: What high school did you attend?
Speaker 2: St. Landry Parish Training School.  It's in Opelousas, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Can you spell the name of the school?
Speaker 2: S-T, Landry, L-A-N-D-R-Y, Parish, P-A-R-I-S-H, Training, T-R-A-I-N-I-N-G, School, S-C-H-O-O-L.
Speaker 1: What kind of--
Speaker 2: And, of course, in Louisiana we have parishes rather than counties, so.
Speaker 1: Were you a good student there?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your role as student?  Were you the leader of the class?
Speaker 2: I was both class president and president of student government at the same time.  That's--not supposed to hold both of these offices (laughter) but we didn't have a student government until I became a senior really and I had been president of my class all the way up to my senior year.  And so when they organized the student government, actually it was in my junior year that I ran and my senior year I served, right.
Speaker 1: How many students were in your class?
Speaker 2: The class that graduated, I think, there were twenty-nine of us, yeah.
Speaker 1: And who was your favorite teacher in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, I had several, but I mentioned Samuel Douglas and he taught me math and geometry, but he was a favorite because of the other things he did.  He kept me after school, and he used to make me practice enunciating and words until I'd be hoarse.  And he even put something in my mouth and made me try to talk clearly without--with that in it, all those sorts of exercises and then we'd sit around and talk about Socrates and Plato.  And, and he was a Catholic and he was a big Fulton Sheen [Fulton J. Sheen] fan and so I read all of Fulton Sheen's books, and I read MacArthur's [Douglas MacArthur] speech and all those kinds of things that we, he could get his hand on because I was interested.  So he was my favorite, but a close second was my English teacher who, for the same reason she was more than an English teacher, she was just interested.  And, and all of my teachers were really interested in me beyond the particular discipline they were teaching, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Mrs. Emerson [ph.].
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned diction, the focus on diction.  Did you have an accent?
Speaker 2: No, but they wanted to make sure I didn't because--
Speaker 1: Did many people in the community have accents?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, that a lot of Creole folks, but the truth of the matter is, is that I go back now and I realize that it's not as heavy an accent in Opelousas as it is in some other parts of Louisiana, and so that it may have been more natural than I thought.  I--when looking back on what they did with me I thought that I had learned this but I think it was more natural for the, for the environment.
Speaker 1: Were you involved in sports?
Speaker 2: Marginally.  I, I went out for the track team, and my high school track team won the state championship every year.  And consequently I wasn't that good (laughter).  I used to travel with the basketball team.  I never went out for the basketball team because we had a very competitive basketball team.  So I was interested in all the sports but I didn't really, football, I took a look at that.  My mother [Julia Jones Joseph] discouraged me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Who were your friends in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, there was, there were two Mason brothers, one of them was Charles Mason, the other J.C. Mason.  Gauthier, Clifford Gauthier, G-A-U-T-H-I-E-R.  And I had a number of friends.  I mean, I was the class president and so I had to know everybody (laughter) and, and, and be a friend to everybody, so.
Story_ID: 487416
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned your father [Adam Joseph] and his ability to speak Creole.  Obviously Creole culture is essential to Louisiana culture.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was that a factor in your upbringing, Creole?
Speaker 2: Foods, yes, but I didn't know very much about the culture.  It was later that I learned about the culture, and I realized that we were in a Creole environment.  But nobody, never told me that and talk about that.  It's just that occasionally I'd hear people speaking Creole and I'd see my father off in the distance just going with 'em.  And when I, I'd ask him to teach me something, he says, "No, you don't need to know that."
Story_ID: 487417
Speaker 1: What's your favorite memory with your mother [Julia Jones Joseph]?
Speaker 2: Well, I have lots of favorite memory of mother.  From a, from a very young boy I used to do these little speeches all the way through formal, original oratory and stuff.  And she'd always sit in the front seat just glowing whenever I was doing that.
Speaker 1: Do you remember one of those speeches?  Not verbatim but--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --whose speeches (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, they--
Speaker 1: --would you replicate?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was in high school [St. Landry Parish Training School, Opelousas, Louisiana] it was original oratory and so I had to write it myself.  When I was a kid it was mostly, you know, reciting the 23rd Psalm and doing those kinds of things that little Baptist kids did in those days (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Starlight Baptist Church [St. Landry Parish, Louisiana] and my father [Adam Joseph] was the minister.
Speaker 1: Tell me about church service.
Speaker 2: Long (laughter).  And I tried my best to avoid 'em, but I--it was no way I could do that (laughter).
Speaker 1: What kind of minister was your father?
Speaker 2: Evangelical.  He was, my father was a very good speaker, of course, it was, in those days he didn't have a public profile; it was just at the church.  But he, he was the kind of preacher who did an educational thing.  He'd take a text, and he'd do a dissertation of the meaning of that and he'd put it in historical context.  And then before he finished, he would go into this sort of call and answer stuff that a lot of the members of the time did and a lot of evangelical ministers do now.
Speaker 1: What did that sound like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And it was a kind of a rap (laughter).  It was, it was the early foundation of rapping is what they were doing in a real sense, yeah.
Speaker 1: Can, can you help me--
Speaker 2: No, I--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) When, when I went to seminary [Yale Divinity School, New Haven, Connecticut], and I was ordained and I came back and my father had me preach at one of his churches and the lady said to me afterwards, "Son, that was a nice talk.  I can't wait 'til you learn to preach" (laughter).
Speaker 1: They wanted to hear (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So--
Speaker 1: --that call and response.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  And actually some people started doing the kind of amen stuff and I'd stand there thinking, man, I'm going to lose my thought, I wish they'd shut up (laughter).
Speaker 1: Were they, were the sermons and the church experience pretty dramatic?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I mean, the women used to shout and get happy and all that sort of thing, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was there music?
Speaker 2: Yes, very--lots of music, and good music.  My mother played the piano, later the organ, um-hm, for the church, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Spirituals, hymns?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember one of the songs?
Speaker 2: Well, 'Amazing Grace' was always and still is one of my favorites.
Speaker 1: What did this church look like?
Speaker 2: Well, Starlight was a little church that my father and his brothers built along the side of the road near the bank of a bayou.  And it started out that way, and it was renovated and rebuilt and then a new church built, you know, we, by the time my father passed away.  But it started out as a, just a little church and I was baptized in that bayou.
Speaker 1: In the bayou?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was that a common practice?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember a baptism in that bayou?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, my own, I can remember my own.
Speaker 1: Oh, how old were you?
Speaker 2: I think I was about six or something.  I mean, it was sort of the, the year before we left to go to Opelousas [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: And what was it like?
Speaker 2: You know, I had seen it so many times that, you know, it was just a, just my time.
Speaker 1: Help--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, help me see it, take me back there?  What would I have witnessed?
Speaker 2: You would have seen a group of people standing around.  It, it was kind of like a, a, a tributary of a, of a bayou 'cause it was also kind of like a pond, that part where they did the baptism.  And folks were standing around.  And my father was, see I, I sort of had on some kind of a white shirt and I was led into this water and my father bent over and put me under the water and then picked me up and, and then people were singing as I came up the banks.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Interesting.
Story_ID: 487418
Speaker 1: I wanted to talk a little bit more about race--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in your county [sic. parish].  What are your memories as a high school student [at St. Landry Parish Training School, Opelousas, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: They used to lynch a lot of people.  And in the, in front of the, the courthouse where my brother's [John W. Joseph] office was when he became mayor (laughter), but at that time, of course, we couldn't vote.  And that's when I really became conscious of what kind of environment we were living in when I start to read the newspaper and, and know about these things that were going on and people being lynched (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What kinds of lynchings do you recall?
Speaker 2: Well, they'd tie a rope--there was a tree and in front of the courthouse and, as a matter of fact, my brother was showing me that, that old tree just last weekend when I was down there.  That's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The tree remains?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And did you witness--
Speaker 2: No, I never--
Speaker 1: --these?
Speaker 2: --my parents [Julia Jones Joseph and Adam Joseph] never took me out or let me.  And when I was high school I, it would have been dangerous to go around and witness that.
Speaker 1: How many people were lynched while you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know, but I can just remember that there were a number.
Speaker 1: A handful?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Probably at least six people.  I'm just trying to think, and it may be more than that but somehow that's what's in my consciousness.
Speaker 1: And why were they lynched?
Speaker 2: Being uppity with white people.  'Cause that was the thing I was always told, "Be careful about being uppity with white people."
Speaker 1: And what did it mean to be uppity (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But to accuse, accused rape--speaking back to 'em, telling them what you thought of 'em.  Like calling young men Cajuns when they used the N word with you (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was this a, an organized mob, Ku Klux Klan [KKK] style?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well it, it was the headquarters, it was the state headquarters of the Ku Klux Klan was my hometown.
Speaker 1: Did they have meetings?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, well.  We as, as a matter of fact, I, I saw a couple of those marches, and my brother and I even recognized some of the people, at least on one occasion somebody we had picked cotton for was wearing his, his Ku Klux Klan outfit in the evening (laughter).
Speaker 1: That must have been shocking.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, well, it was days of learning and we were learning about that.
Speaker 1: Was this man kind otherwise?
Speaker 2: We never had much interaction with him except he'd come around and to, to pay us the little money we made, but during the course of it, there was somebody else supervising the fields.
Speaker 1: Do you remember his name?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I'm sure I repressed it (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Were they wearing the garb?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What were they wearing?
Speaker 2: All this white stuff, with the coney caps and stuff, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Any cross burnings?
Speaker 2: Yeah, those took place too, um-hm.
Story_ID: 487419
Speaker 1: And when did you develop this sort of revolutionary, militant attitude (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I started developing it then and but I just didn't do a, a heck of a lot about it except I, I began to speak back.  You know, I didn't take any, when somebody called me something I said something to them.  But my brother [John W. Joseph] and I when we were older probably I, I was about a, a junior in high school [St. Landry Parish Training School, Opelousas, Louisiana], we started going to Houston [Texas] to work rather than picking cotton in, in the St. Landry Parish area [Louisiana].  And we worked waiting tables at a white cafeteria, and we used to get in trouble with people who were racist.  And, and we had a supervisor who used to hire all these college kids and high school kids to work in the summer and she was white and we were reported several times by customers for having said something.
Speaker 1: What kinds of things did you say?
Speaker 2: Well, one day a lady said, "Boy," and I said, "Boy is off today," (laughter).  And she reported to the supervisor and the supervisor called me in the back and she said, "Look, you have to be careful, you know.  I'm not gonna reprimand you 'cause that's apprehensible, but it might get to my boss that I didn't do anything about it, so I wish you'd not do that."  So yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you remember any other jobs you had along the way?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember several because before I went to this cafeteria which was Weldon Cafeteria [Weldon's Cafeteria] on North Main Street in Houston, I went with my brother the first year and they didn't, they weren't hiring anybody at the beginning and so I had a job in this icehouse.  I used to go in and get the blocks of ice out for the customers, so I'd go in this building where the ice was and Houston was in the nineties and the humidity was higher, and I was in and out of this icehouse and I'd catching colds and so I said, I can't keep doing this.  In the meantime my brother was able to persuade them to hire me at the cafeteria, so I went to the cafeteria.
Speaker 1: And this was the late '40s [1940s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I went back to Houston again.  I, after college [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], and I'm jumping now, but we can come back.  And I had a period before I was in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] and I had gotten a commission and I was gonna be an officer but there was a time before when I, about four or five months before I was gonna be leaving, and so I went to Houston to get a job, to see if I could get a job just for those months.  And I walked in to this department store, and I used to remember the name of it but I can't think of now, and they had a separate entrance for white and a separate entrance for blacks, but once you got in there was a partition between the two rather for a wall and you fill out your forms there.  And there was a white guy on the other side and he saw me filling it out and he says, "I see you can read."  I said, "Yeah."  He says, "Could you help me with the--?"  It was something, and, and I did, and he went in, I went in, and we came out about the same time, we had both got jobs.  And I talked to him across this partition, and he'd gotten a job making four times as much as I was making and I had helped him fill out his form (laughter).
Speaker 1: Wow.

Speaker 1: Do you remember those white only, black only signs--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --in your hometown?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep.
Speaker 1: Where were they?
Speaker 2: They were colored, you know, colored and white.  They were on the water fountains, they, they were in the service stations and restrooms, anywhere there was a public place.  In the restaurants and cafes there was a colored thing in the back if they served colored people, but most times you could only go to the window in the back somewhere and order something.  They wouldn't let you go in and sit anywhere.
Speaker 1: Did you ever try?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at times but I, I quit later but, I mean, when I was a, a young kid I, I did.
Speaker 1: Do you remember a restaurant in particular that had that policy?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember the names, no.
Speaker 1: Was there any political activism at this time--
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: --in Opelousas [Louisiana] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not really.  Later but at this time no, I don't, if there was something going on it didn't come to me and I used to wonder why my father [Adam Joseph], you know, took that stuff.
Speaker 1: What did you decide you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that's a later story which we can come back to.
Speaker 1: We'll come--okay.
Story_ID: 487421
Speaker 1: What was your dream when you were in high school [St. Landry Parish Training School, Opelousas, Louisiana] thinking about the future?
Speaker 2: Well, I, as I said, I wrote in my high school yearbook that I was gonna be the first black senator from Louisiana.  My, my dream was--my father [Adam Joseph] wanted me to be a minister and all my family because, you know, I was always making these speeches and stuff that they just knew I was gonna be a minister and that's what they expected I was gonna be.  I knew I was gonna go into public life in some way.  I wasn't sure, and I thought about law, and I had decided I wasn't gonna be a teacher because all the blacks I knew were teachers.  That was the only thing open to them.  We had--by the time I was in my junior year in high school, we had a black doctor who came to, to the parish [St. Landry Parish, Louisiana] and so we had one black doctor.  We didn't have any black lawyers or anything like that.  The only professionals I knew were teachers and undertakers (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you remember the name of that black doctor?
Speaker 2: Yes, doctor, oh, I can't think of it now 'cause he treated me once (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Where did you go to college?
Speaker 2: Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College] in Baton Rouge, Louisiana (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, and you graduated high school with honors?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Valedictorian?
Speaker 2: I was the salutatorian.  I was too busy with all the extracurricular (laughter) activities, being president of this, that, and the other, traveling and making speeches.  I, I might say that when I was in high school, I, I did so much of the original oratory thing that I won my parish, I won my state, I won the southeastern region, and I came out second in the national.  And that was a lot of traveling and stuff and so I was doing, while my, my friends were doing football, basketball, and stuff I had found my niche.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Did they have separate divisions, white kids, black kids (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, this was the black ones.
Speaker 1: Did you ever--
Speaker 2: And, and yes, I used to say, boy I, I just can't wait until I can compete against the white kids 'cause I know I can be better (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you ever do a Frederick Douglass speech?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I did it, all sorts of things.  But when, in, in high school, when I participated in original oratory it was the kind of thing they'd give you a theme and then you'd write something and then you'd deliver it.
Speaker 1: What topics would you take on?
Speaker 2: Well, I can't remember very much but it was--my, my speech coach, the math teacher [Samuel Douglas] was Catholic, and he had me do this speech once about God and education.  I don't believe now the thing I said then, but (laughter) it was about what happens to education if you take God out of it.  And that speech won me all sorts of awards.
Speaker 1: So you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I remember I'd say take God out of education and, and then I had this thing, take God out of education and, and then so (laughter).
Story_ID: 487422
Speaker 1: What year did you enter Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College] in Baton Rouge [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-two [1952].
Speaker 1: What was your first impression of Southern?
Speaker 2: Well, Southern was as much myth as it was reality because--and black kid growing up in Louisiana, you know, you're always thinking, boy, someday I'll get to go to Southern.  And I used to go there for the basketball, high school basketball tournaments and, you know, that's where they were held and, and so I had finally arrived.  And to, to my surprise it was very much like my high school [St. Landry Parish Training School, Opelousas, Louisiana] in a lot of ways.  My first year I lived in a barracks with fifty people.  It was an old military barracks that had been, the same thing, had been discarded like my stuff in high school.  And then I began to realize that, you know, it wasn't much different but great teachers.  I mean, and people who took an interest in the whole person just like my high school.  And so it's--in that way it was similar.  But my first memories were of that Barracks B where I had to live with all these guys.  And, and there were double, there were beds with a cot underneath and a cot on top.  And they were very close, I mean, I'm sure it was unhealthy for us to be that many jammed into a room that close to each other.
Speaker 1: How many were jammed into a room?
Speaker 2: Well, it was one big room with fifty people.
Speaker 1: Who were your favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: In, in college?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, my favorite person was the dean of students who was also the dean of the chapel.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Martin Harvey.  And that--Martin Harvey began to use me to also to do speaking things in the, in the worship services and stuff.  And, and the next person was J.S. Clark [Joseph Samuel Clark] who was the president.  And he was one of, it was at a time when the black college [HBCU] had all these great presidents and, and he was one of them, and he was an incredible speaker, and I used to sit there and say, "I wanna be like him one day."  But Martin Harvey was too.  And he used to give prayers that were just absolutely unbelievable the way he was able to paint pictures with words.  And I used to sit there, and I was charmed by that.  But neither one of them taught me anything, they were just people I wanted to be like.  In terms of teaching, I'm trying to, trying to remember now, I had Lionel Newsom [Lionel H. Newsom] in sociology, Rodney Higgins [Rodney Gonzales Higgins] in political science.  And Rodney Higgins used to run Bayou Boys State and I became the associate director of Boys State under him afterwards, Lionel Newsom.  And then we had two Barclay [ph.] brothers, political science, and I began to gravitate, most of the things I remember about college and my teachers were people in political science.  And that--
Speaker 1: What was your major?
Speaker 2: Social studies I think it was called, it was basically political science but and, and at one time I was gonna be a lawyer and then I said no.  But interestingly enough, the universities, the schools were integrated while I--in 1954 I was in college.  By 1955, Rodney Higgins had gone to the University of Wisconsin [ph.] where he became chair of the political science department.  His, his, no, his brother, the Barclay brothers, one of them became chair of the political, the political science department at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California].  And these guys just went everywhere and went right to the top, that's the caliber of people who were teaching me at Southern.  But soon as the doors opened for them and they could go elsewhere, they left Southern.  And but I, I would, I had the benefit of having had them as a student.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Do you remember that battle to desegregate the schools?
Speaker 2: Not a lot but I was in my sociology class with Lionel Newsom and he walked in one day and he told us about the, the [U.S.] Supreme Court decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  And we cheered and we sat around talking about what this was gonna mean.  And we kind of assumed that everything was gonna open up immediately.  We weren't told about this deliberate speed qu- clause (laughter).
Story_ID: 487423
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you involved in campus clubs or fraternities?
Speaker 2: Well, I was president of my class.  When I was president of my class most of my years there, three of the four years I was president of the class (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How many students in your class?
Speaker 2: But this time I didn't run for president of student government because I preferred being my class president, but I was the campaign manager three years for the guy who won (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) How many students were in your class?
Speaker 2: It was pretty large.  I, probably as much as four hundred graduated from there but there, there was a pretty significant dropout rate.  And so when I started it might have been close to a thousand, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you remember--
Speaker 2: I was president of the Baptist club and just, you just name it--
Speaker 1: Well, go ahead, Baptist club, what else?
Speaker 2: There was some kind of debating group.  It, it wasn't like original oratory and it wasn't debate but it's, but I did join the debate club, too, but I wasn't head of that.  And what else?  The YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  It seems to me I was always going to meetings as president and, and, and here again, I wasn't magna cum laude.  Actually, I made better grades at Yale [Yale Divinity School, New Haven, Connecticut] than I did at Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] (laughter).
Story_ID: 487424
Speaker 1: Did you pledge a fraternity at Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was an Alpha, a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Beta Sigma chapter (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was that experience like?  Is there any part of the pledging (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it--
Speaker 1: --experience you can share?
Speaker 2: It's--it was very good because the Alphas at the time and I still think, emphasized scholarship.  And, and many of the folks who were in the chapter with me have gone on to do great things--
Speaker 1: Who are those--
Speaker 2: --generals in the [U.S.] Army and all that. So yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you give us the name of some of those people?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Robert Dinkins was our chair.  [HistoryMaker] Grady Poulard was a member.  Anyway, there, there, there were a number of people.
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: Donald Wade [Donald C. Wade] who became the director of alumni affairs at Southern.
Speaker 1: What kind of activities did you have on campus?
Speaker 2: Well, of course, the Alphas emphasized scholarship, but they were also very social (laughter), and so we had parties and stuff.  And the, the thing I remember is that we used to sing the 'Sweetheart Song' to our--we'd go out on campus by the lake and stuff and serenade the, our sweetheart and do that kind of things.  And, and one thing I could not do was carry a tune very well.  And so they worked out this role for me, I'd be the one who'd step out in the middle and read the poetry to the sweetheart (laughter) and recite the history of the fraternity on other occasions, and so I'd step out there, I'd say, "Fifty years ago" (laughter).  That was when the fraternity was founded at the time.  But no, and I remember that very fondly.  But they had a lot of parties and stuff and I was always saying we ought to be doing things in the community rather than these parties but that was part of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you remember any of the parties?  What were they like?  Dancing or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, dancing and drinking and (laughter) yes.
Speaker 1: Did you do good works (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As a matter of fact Dean Harvey [Martin Harvey] who I had mentioned once called me in his office and said, "I'm concerned about some of the company you're keeping (laughter).  And you've got a good future but I don't wanna see you ruin it and, I, I know you've been hanging out with some guys who drink a lot and they may be disciplined and you don't wanna be in that crowd."
Story_ID: 487425
Speaker 1: Do you remember the sort of philosophical message administrators at Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] were sending student body at that time?  Was there a sense of mission?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.  You, if you work hard, you can be as good as anybody else.  But my mother [Julia Jones Joseph] used to tell me that I have to work twice as hard to have half a chance of a white person, and so I always believed that I had to work twice as hard.  And I used to say I'm not just as good as them, I'm better than most of them, and I just need a chance to, to prove it and so I just kept waiting until.  And I didn't really get a chance to prove it until I went into the [U.S.] Army, and I had my military commission as a second lieutenant from Southern, I was with all these guys from West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] and, you know, and all these places and I just had to show them and show the unit commander that I was better than them.  I wouldn't settle for being as good as them.
Speaker 1: Is there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I did (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And even before we get to the army experience--
Speaker 2: Oh, but we're going back to Southern you asked me about that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.  Is there--would you identify a turning point experience at Southern?
Speaker 2: You asked me about the mission of the--and what, what were we learning.  I have to say that one of the wonderful things about black colleges [HBCUs] at that time is that you had all of the leading people in, in black American life come to the campus to speak, and I met those folks.  On Founder's Day my senior year, the speaker was Mary McLeod Bethune, and I was the student speaker.  And so that's the kind of experience we were having.  And, you know, we'd sit there and listen to these, at least I did, you know, I was a dreamer, and I'd sit there and just dream that one day I am gonna be like this guy or this, this woman.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the other speakers at convocation?
Speaker 2: The president of Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], what was his name at the time?  Benjamin Mays when he was president of Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  The president of A&T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] who became a professor at Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] by the time he died.  Anyway these are some of the people who used to come to speak and--
Speaker 1: Was there political activism on campus at this time?
Speaker 2: We'd began to, to be a little bit active but much of it was directed against the university rather than the real cause (laughter).  We, I, I remember one day there was this big protest, the students didn't like the food in the dining hall, and I said, "Well, we ought to meet with the president [Joseph Samuel Clark] and--instead of just out here complaining about it."  And so I arranged this meeting with the president and we went in this auditorium, all these people were there when the president walked in they just started booing him, booing him and the president had come in good confidence 'cause I had asked him and I was presiding.  And I'm standing there thinking oh, my God what I'm gonna do?  I started the Lord's Prayer, by the time I got halfway through everybody had quieted down and then I finished it, then I, I asked them to hear the president and everything went well from there.  But that was activism (laughter) of one kind.
Speaker 1: Were you active with the church or the chapel on campus?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  I was a liturgist, a student liturgist often under Martin Harvey (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the name of the chapel?
Speaker 2: Well, it didn't have a name.  You see we're a public university.  We really shouldn't have had chapel but we had it regularly, weekly, it was called vespers and we had it on Sunday evenings.
Speaker 1: You had mentioned the importance of club membership and fraternity affiliations if you have some desire to lead in the community.  Was that part of your mission at Southern is to gain these memberships 'cause you knew you were going to lead?
Speaker 2: Well, partly but it was partly because they were, they were tightly knit supportive communities, and a kid from Opelousas [Louisiana] going to Southern where all these kids were from the big cities like New Orleans [Louisiana] and Memphis [Tennessee] and all these places, it was nice to have a group of close-knit friends and, and the fraternity was that.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite memory from your experience at Southern?
Speaker 2: Probably speaking in the same platform with Mary McLeod Bethune.
Speaker 1: What was that like?  Describe that day.
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't--I don't remember too much about the day except that I met her before the convocation, they introduced me to her and we went in together with the president, and I did my little speech after the choir had done a couple of numbers and then they did another number and then the president introduced Mary McLeod Bethune.  She made some comments about my speech (laughter).
Speaker 1: What were those comments?
Speaker 2: They were complimentary (laughter).  I don't remember a thing I said though (laughter).
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from Southern?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-six [1956].
Story_ID: 487426
Speaker 1: Were you drafted?
Speaker 2: No, I was in the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], and I got a commission, and I got a commission in the Medical Service Corps which was interesting in itself.  We had pre-med students who got infantry and here I was in social studies and I requested the Medical Service Corps, because I didn't see myself fighting.  I, I had gone in the ROTC because they provided a subsidy, and one day I suddenly realized I was gonna have to go in the [U.S.] Army.  I mean, this has all been fun and I've enjoyed the money I've gotten but (unclear) and then.  So I had to get a commission and so I requested in a, a noncombatant part of the [U.S.] military.
Speaker 1: Did you--
Speaker 2: And then I--
Speaker 1: --serve in Korea?
Speaker 2: No, I, I didn't.  I was in between wars, and my first orientation was at Fort Sam Houston [San Antonio, Texas], and they sent me to one of these mass casualty class and that's when I realized how much I was disturbed by the sight of blood, and, and here I had requested the Medical Service Corps (laughter).
Speaker 1: What's your, I guess, the most profound memory from your time in the Army?
Speaker 2: Well, the, there are, there are lots of profound memories.  I grew up, I matured.  I, I graduated, I mean, I was a senior when I was twenty.  And it was in the military where I began to meet people who were different.  I began to enjoy the opportunity to compete with people who were different, in particular whites, that's where I had a chance to, to really shine.  I might mention that the first time that really occurred was in ROTC summer camp while I was still in college [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], it was the first year they had integrated the summer camps and other, otherwise black college ROTC units used to go together, this time they sent us to Fort Hood [Camp Hood; Fort Hood] in Killeen, Texas with whites, and a lot of the whites were just as racist.  I mean, they, it was the kind of thing where you were all sort of boot camp, you know, because we hadn't been commissioned yet.  And they used to assign, make assignments and the blacks always got the latrines and things like that as an assignment.  However, I mention it because for the first time I met a white person who was fair, he was my super- one of my supervisors.  And he began to notice what was happening and so he started giving me leadership roles.  And when I finished ROTC camp there, I think about a 150 something people and most of the blacks were like 49, 149, 148, 147, and I was in the top ten, because this guy had given me a chance and--
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't, I really don't remember his name but I do still have a visual image of him and his, his talking to me and, you know, making sure I, I dealt with those, those things I was dealing with because they were things he couldn't control.
Speaker 1: Describe the racism, what kinds of things did you witness?
Speaker 2: Oh, the assignment of duties by whoever was making the assignments and the kind of assignments I got.  They did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Like what?
Speaker 2: Like cleaning the latrine and sweeping out the barracks and those kinds of things.  But that was initially and then this guy took note of me and then he made sure I got a chance to be squad leader and other kinds of things that I could demonstrate.  And one day, I mean, there was a guy who used to come in with a lot of (unclear).  I mean, most of 'em did, that's what they called you even though they were, we were all in summer camp.  And I had told this guy what I thought of him for that and we were marching one day in the formation of a company and he was in front of me and when we turned the corner he swung his rifle and trying to hit me, but it would have been an accident the way he did it because it was on his shoulder and he did it like that, and it just missed my face.  I held back my feeling of wanting to hit him but (laughter) I, I remember what this guy told me: "Look, if you can take this, you know, it's gonna be in your benefit ultimately and--."
Speaker 1: What's a familiar sound from your years with the Army or ROTC?
Speaker 2: Familiar sound?  The singing and marching, (laughter) you know.
Speaker 1: What did that sound like?
Speaker 2: Well, I was also in the ROTC drill team.  Well, they, they, they were not nice things (laughter).  I mean, not the kinds of things, I, I, I, I want to say.
Speaker 1: Are there any parts of it you could kind of share what it, just to give us a sense of what it sounded like?  You know, on TV you--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --you see certain things, "Left, left," that kind of thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Singing) "I have a girl in Jacksonville, she won't do it but her sister will" (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was that enjoyable?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, that's what the boys, that's what the guys were singing, you know, and then we'd go (singing), "One, two, three, four," and then, you know, and then you'd go into another one of those and that sort of thing.

Speaker 1: Was there a highlight from your experience with the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You mentioned the competitions.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, there were a, a number of highlights and one of them was interesting.  I was assigned to Fort Devens in Massachusetts and they needed some people to open up a military base in New Jersey that was being opened for Hungarian refugees who were coming in.  And I was a bachelor so I was one of the first people sent from the fort there.  And on that second day, I went into the mess hall, and I wasn't dressed and I was sitting next to another guy and I was complaining about the fact as a second lieutenant, they hadn't sent in enlisted men yet, they sent officers first and so as a second lieutenant I was getting all the dirty jobs, you know.  And so I was complaining to this guy and then we talked about it and the next day I got a call saying the post commander wants to see you.  Turned out the guy who I was sitting next to and I was complaining to was the post commander, and he brought me into his office and made me his assistant, and from then on my military career took off. I mean, it was only two years but I always got great assignments.
Speaker 1: What were those assignments?
Speaker 2: Company commander, I used to run the, the military, the, the hospital units on the post were under me, organizationally.  I wasn't a medical doctor, I was an administrative medical person.  But yeah, it's--I taught ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps]; I was commander of the ROTC training company that trained cadets in, in the summer, and I was commander of that.  I used to teach medical evacuation classes, all this dramatic stuff where I'd have a helicopter come in and land in front of me as I was lecturing and then I'd take 'em through.  Fortunately, I never had to do that in real life (laughter) but--
Speaker 1: Were you leading white soldiers and black (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, oh, they were all white.  I, I'm trying to remember, I didn't have, when I was commander at the medical detachment I didn't have a single black person in, in my unit.  My officers were all white.  And--
Speaker 1: Was that odd?
Speaker 2: Well, for me it was obviously a new experience.  Now, I had a, a commander above me who was a southerner who was racist and I, I, I can't fully remember the experience but one day he and I got in an exchange which I can only go so far because he was my superior.  And I used to send out from one of the platoon the people who used to inspect the mess halls that were run by the company, and I decided to do his myself, and I flunked him in everything (laughter).  He never related that to the exchange we had I don't think, but I must say that retribution is not a part of my spirit now but I was learning (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Developmental years.  What year did you complete your service in the Army?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-eight [1958].
Story_ID: 487428
Speaker 1: Where did you go next?
Speaker 2: Well, I had applied to Yale Divinity School [New Haven, Connecticut], and I, and I had been accepted at Yale.  And I had, here again I had some time off because of the, the yea- the time of the year I got out.  So I went back to Louisiana and I taught for a half a year in a, in an elementary school.  I, I thought, I taught third grade.  And the reason I ended up teaching third grade (laughter) is went into the superintendent's office and I met with the assistant superintendent, and I had, I had just completed a military career and the guy called me boy.  And I stood up and I said, "I have just come from an experience where everybody called me sir, and I don't have to sit here and have you call--and listen to you call me boy," and I left.  But they were obligated to give me a job because I had, had a half year before--I didn't talk about that, but when I graduated from Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] I didn't go immediately in I had a half year, and I had gone to Houston [Texas] and I didn't like that so I took a job teaching.  And I left at the midyear so they were obligated to take me back and so this guy assigned--they assigned me to the third grade that was, I had, I used to teach high school, I was a high school teacher, and in a Catholic school that was gonna become a public school.  And so I was the only guy with these nuns in this little rural school, (laughter) uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Was it an integrated school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, and it turned out to be a great experience.  No, they were, they were black.
Speaker 1: Were the schools integrated yet?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, not yet.  And the nuns were the greatest people.  They used to do all of my work for me and (laughter) I used to play basketball with 'em and it was a fun time, but they really were trying to, to, to retaliate.
Story_ID: 487429
Speaker 1: What year did you enter Yale [Yale Divinity School, New Haven, Connecticut]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen six- 1959, yeah.
Speaker 1: How did you decide to even apply to Yale?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was in college [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] I, I was president of the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], and I went to a YMCA convention in Oklahoma and there were these two guys from Yale Divinity School on the panel.  And I was so impressed that once again I sat there thinking, you know, I wanna be like them, and they were white.  That's--that was another time when I had a chance to interact, I didn't really interact with 'em, I was just in the audience.  And so while I was in Massachusetts in [U.S. military] service I investigated Yale Divinity School and decided to apply and that's where I went.
Speaker 1: What was your impression of Yale?
Speaker 2: A lot of really bright white boys (laughter).  However, they were much more sociable and personable and accepting and that's when I really got involved in political stuff.  We used to demonstrate in front of the village green, in front of Woolworths [F.W. Woolworth Company] and all that stuff (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This was part of the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: How did you get involved with civil rights?
Speaker 2: Well, it started at Yale Divinity School.  We were always marching for something, and our professors were marching.  And I was, yeah, and I, I got involved in that and then I, I knew that when I finished I had to go back south and get involved in the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 1: So you were a leader on campus in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --civil rights protests?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, yes. I, I helped to organize some of the, some of the protests but faculty were heading those.  Some of these guys who were organizing were southerners; they were southerners.  We had one guy named John Maguire who became president [sic.] of Wesleyan [Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut].  I, I remember going into the, to the lobby where we were having this rally and this guy was standing up there, "We go forth to war," with this thick southern accent (laughter) and we went, we were just going down to the village green to march and, and he and I became friends.
Speaker 1: Tell me a familiar sound from those protests.
Speaker 2: Oh, we used to sing, of course, 'We Shall Overcome' and all those kinds of things and, and we used to sing while we were marching too.
Speaker 1: And this was a mixed group?
Speaker 2: Yeah, mostly whites, you know, 'cause I think I had four blacks in my class.
Speaker 1: Do you remember who the president of Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] was at this time?
Speaker 2: Well, Kingman Brewster [Kingman Brewster, Jr.] is the one I got to know later, but I'm not sure who the president was, but we had Bill Coffin [William Sloane Coffin] who was the university chaplain who was white and who had been on the Freedom Ride and stuff and Bill Coffin was our leader (laughter).
Speaker 1: Can you share one of those experiences with me of--
Speaker 2: The marches (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the sit-ins?
Speaker 2: Well, one day we were picketing Woolworths, it was very hot and the manager came out and said, "Would you guys like me to bring you some water?"  And we explained to him we had nothing against him and he says, "I understand."  "You know, that it's to change stores down south who won't let people sit at the lunch counters that we're directing this protest at, but we've gotta do it in front of your store 'cause you're a part of the national chain," and he said, "I understand."
Speaker 1: So it was symbolic in a sense?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, and it was just the fact that the guy would come out and offer us a drink of water and we were picketing his store.
Speaker 1: So now that particular store allowed black clientele?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, this was in New Haven [Connecticut], the North.  Woolworths in the North were allowing people at the lunch counters; it was just in the South they weren't.
Speaker 1: So it was a political move (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 487430
Speaker 1: And another time, Vanderbilt [Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee] had expelled James Lawson who was a divinity student, because he was participating in civil rights activities in, in Tennessee and one of our protests was in support of James Lawson.  And, and there were always some, some reason like that that we were demonstrating [in New Haven, Connecticut].  But one day I was marching alongside a professor who asked me what I will, planned to do, and I told him, "I, well, I've been thinking I'd like to go into campus ministry."  And he said, "Have you heard about the Danforth Foundation internship for students who are in campus ministry?"  And I said, "No."  He says, "Well, come to see me when we get back," and I went to see him.  I applied for that, and I became--I got that fellowship and they sent me to the Claremont Colleges [Claremont, California], which is where I ended up a number of times later and where I spent a lot of activity, I did a lot of social activities, protest activities but it was--
Speaker 2: Was--
Speaker 1: --because of that professor.  And when I was selected by the Danforth Foundation [St. Louis, Missouri], they had never sent a black to a white institution, they always send 'em to a black school [HBCU].  And so I said, "Look, I went to a black college [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  If this is gonna be meaningful to me, I'd like to have the experience of a predominantly white institution."  And they were very concerned about what predominantly white institution they, they would send me.  Well, it turns out that the head of the foundation had once been the chaplain at the Claremont Colleges and he says I think Claremont would be a good place to go, you wouldn't have any problems there.  And so that's, started my connection with Claremont.
Story_ID: 487431
Speaker 1: Any other highlights during your experience at Yale [Yale Divinity School, New Haven, Connecticut]?
Speaker 2: Well, I was surprised how competitive I was, that I made as good a grades as anybody else, and I wrote as good a papers, better papers than, than most people.  I, I, I realized that my writing, and my speaking, my capacity to, to think, analyze, though I had gone to a school, two schools, that had been very deficient in some of the material things, that I had really learned to do all these things that I needed to do to succeed in graduate school, and my dream came true.  I was not only as good but I was better than most.
Speaker 1: You went on to the Claremont Colleges [Claremont, California] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I didn't go into Claremont directly because Claremont is in the West Coast and I had a wonderful time there my year as an intern, but I wanted to go south.
Speaker 1: Stillman [Stillman College, Tuscaloosa, Alabama].
Speaker 2: And, and so I, looking around, how can I go south and somebody called Stillman to my attention and the rest is history.  I, I went to Stillman, which at that time was a black school [HBCU] with a white faculty.  It was a Presbyterian school, southern Presbyterian.  And--
Story_ID: 487432
Speaker 1: In a sense you were a big civil rights leader at Stillman [Stillman College, Tuscaloosa, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, I left Yale [Yale Divinity School, New Haven, Connecticut] with my newly minted degree, and I really got some offers to do the thing I had been always dreaming of, and that was to lead some major white institutions, so white churches, white organizations, et cetera, but I said, I have to go south.  So I went down to Alabama, and when I landed and I started hearing those accents and stuff, I said, oh my god.  I, I've returned to what I spent all my time trying to leave (laughter).  And Vivian Malone [Vivian Malone Jones] had just been admitted to the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] along with a fellow named Jimmy Hood [James Hood], and they were the two blacks and George Wallace had stood in the doorway in George Wallace fashion saying, "Segregation now, segregation forever."  And two days after I had been there, I was invited to a barbecue in a faculty member's backyard where Jimmy Hood and Vivian Malone were there, and Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy Hood got a call and he was notified that he was being expelled.  Vivian Malone remained and we all became friends.  But that heightened my sensitivity.  And so I started going around the community to, to the ministers that were in the community, black ministers and, and saying, "You know, why isn't anything happening here?"  I mean, something they told me is this is the national headquarters of the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] and folks here are intimidated and all that sort of thing.  And so then I started making speeches at, at Stillman to the students about, you know, "Our time has come and it is time for us to turn this community upside down," because everything was segregated, I mean, the same problem with lunch counters and hotels and--
Speaker 1: Describe for me Tuscaloosa, the center of town.
Speaker 2: Tuscaloosa, Alabama, well, it was much larger than Opelousas [Louisiana] (laughter) even though they both had the Klan connections.  But it had several hotels and a number of restaurants, et cetera.
Speaker 1: And blacks?
Speaker 2: Blacks were not admitted as I said to the University of Alabama, but Vivian had come to town and was, had integrated it.  Blacks went to black schools even though we had had the '54 [1954] Supreme Court decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  And blacks taught at black schools and nobody, well it, it hadn't moved to the university level yet and particularly in Alabama.  And so that's what the environment was like and--
Speaker 1: Situation still segregation at theaters and restaurants?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, all those things were segregated.
Story_ID: 487433
Speaker 1: Then they were building a, a new courthouse, and I--finally, of the ministers I had called on, there were three, young like me, who seemed to be interested in doing something so I invited 'em all together one day.  You know, we sat around and we decided that we'd write a letter to the county probate judge demanding that they not put up the--in those days, we demanded, we didn't request (laughter) or suggest--demanding that they not put up colored and white signs in the county courthouse building, and that hit the, the press, the letter.  I think we sent it to the press.  And it made news and television and newspapers and oh, folks were very upset that these troublemakers have now come to Tuscaloosa [Alabama] and black folks were saying that, too.  And one of the deans at Stillman [Stillman College, Tuscaloosa, Alabama] went down and met with the, the White Citizens' Council to assure them that we were outside of this and it didn't reflect the thinking of the, the good blacks in the community (laughter).  And--but we were getting so much publicity and, and folks were wondering, Who the heck are these guys?  One was a, a Methodist minister, one was a Baptist minister [T.Y. Rogers], and one was a Lutheran minister.  The Lutheran minister was the first one I really went and talked to on my second round, but I had not met with him on the first round.  And his name was Will Herzfeld [Will L. Herzfeld], and he was a Missouri Synod Lutheran.  And everybody kept telling me you got to meet this guy.  And I just knew he was white, Herzfeld, a German name, Missouri Synod Lutheran minister, I don't think there probably were any other blacks in the Missouri Synod.  And anyway I went down and I was surprised to see this was a black guy, and, and we became very good friends, and then we got the other two guys together and then we wrote this letter.  Then, when we got the publicity we met again and we said, you know, "We never said what we'd do if they didn't respond to our letter."  And there's all these questions and we said, "Well, let's announce that we've formed the movement and invite people and send out, do leaflets and stuff at the churches and invite people to come to a meeting at the black Baptist church [First African Baptist Church, Tuscaloosa, Alabama]," which was the biggest.  The Lutheran church was small, the Methodist church was not so big, and we did.  And that night, not only was the church full, but the parking lots were full and we had had speakers outside for all the people who had showed up out of curiosity who are these young fellows who dare to stand up to the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK].  And we started a movement, and the week later we had announced that we were gonna have a demonstration, and I went to chapel at Stillman just before the demonstration and I said to the students--I had nothing to do with religion, I was in administration and I was teaching but even though I had been at the divinity school [Yale Divinity School, New Haven, Connecticut], but I was not the chaplain--and I said, "What I'd like for you to do," in a very dramatic fashion, "is to leave here, go back to your room and get your toothbrush and a washcloth and we're going to jail" (laughter).  And I told 'em why it was necessary and, boy, when I walked out, all these students walked out with me.  And the president [Samuel Burney Hay] who was a white Presbyterian minister who had been very concerned about my speech, my prior speeches that he was hearing back from people about, and he was outraged.  And the black chaplain was outraged and some of the black faculty was outraged that I did that.  And we went down and we marched to the black church and we got the people who had gathered at the black church and we marched to the county courthouse.
Story_ID: 487434
Speaker 1: The four of us who were the committee were now the leaders of this new movement that we started.  And we, we had announced, and--this demonstration and so when we arrived at county courthouse, George Wallace's storm troopers were standing, protecting the entrance, they had usurped the authority of the local police and these were the state troopers, and they were standing there with billy clubs and cattle prods.  And we turned around to read a statement to the audience and then they descended on us with these cattle prods and billy clubs.  And across the street from us were these Klansmen [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] with baseball bats.  And they drove us into the Klansmen with the baseball bats.  And I say that I don't even remember taking a step when I got hit by this cattle prod, all I remember was I was over there (laughter) where the Klansmen were.  That was the result of being shocked a few times with this electric prod, and the Klansmen were swinging baseball bats.  I didn't get badly injured; I got the bruised hip.  Some people were injured, and we had one white guy in the demonstration, he was a, was he a full, no, not a Fulbright [Fulbright Fellowship] he was some other kind of a fellow who was on the faculty at Stillman [Stillman College, Tuscaloosa, Alabama] and he was with us and they pulled him out of line and they just really beat him and they put him in jail.  They didn't jail any of us that time, and--but they--so then we had to form a committee which was the four of us plus a couple of people to do an all-night vigil to make sure that nothing happened to the white guy.
Speaker 2: Do you remember some of the names you were called or the things they were yelling?
Speaker 1: (Cough) Excuse me.
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: We just though those folks hated a white person who would be involved with black people more than they hated the black people and that's why they pulled him out of the line.  We stood vigil that night and another night and then the third day they let him out and, and we took him to the doctor, et cetera, and he was okay, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Good, good.
Story_ID: 487435
Speaker 1: As you look back now, how would you define the accomplishments of those days (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, what?  In a year, the, the lunch counters were integrated, the restrooms were integrated, the hotels were integrated, they were hiring black people.  The University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] started bringing in blacks for their basketball team and football team.  And once during the course of the, the movement during that year, I was invited by a campus minister at the University of Alabama to meet with some people.  And while I was meeting, he went out for a minute and then he came back in and he said, "People are gathering in the front. I think we'd better sneak you out the back door," and they did.  But a year later, you know, they were looking for athletes (laughter) and stuff.  So I would say we were so successful that at the end of the year I said the local community is engaged.  And I, I had a, a, a baby [Jeffrey Joseph] when I left New Haven [Connecticut], and he was only a couple of months old and I used to get these threatening calls every night about what they were gonna do to him.  And it was very tough for my wife [Doris Joseph] and so my friend from Claremont [Claremont Colleges, Claremont, California] came over and offered me a job (crying).
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah, it's okay.
Story_ID: 487436
Speaker 1: Tell me about your children.  You had your first child in those years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my son was born while I was in New Haven [Connecticut], and he always wore the Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] T-shirts and then when he graduated from high school he decided he'd go to Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Isn't that always the case?  Tell me his name.
Speaker 2: Jeffrey [Jeffrey Joseph].
Speaker 1: What year was he born?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 1: And he went to Princeton for undergrad (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or grad?
Speaker 2: Undergrad, um-hm.
Speaker 1: What did he study?
Speaker 2: Well, to my surprise he majored in religion (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: He went there to go to the Woodrow Wilson School [Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton, New Jersey], but he met a couple of professors at--in theology that he really liked and so he decided to do that.
Speaker 1: Other children (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I was really shocked when he told me that.  I have one--
Speaker 1: Following in his dad's footsteps.
Speaker 2: --I have one daughter and she was born in 1969.  She--
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Denise [Denise Joseph].  She went to Mount Holyoke College [South Hadley, Massachusetts], and was a great proponent of the importance of women's colleges, and she called me in her junior year and said she couldn't stay at Mount Holyoke anymore.  It was too cold and she wanted to go to a college that had both men and women, and she transferred to the University of New Mexico [Albuquerque, New Mexico], where there were lots of guys and it was much warmer (laughter).
Speaker 1: And what's her profession?
Speaker 2: She went on from there, she went to, came back to the Washington [D.C.] area where I was living, and went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] to do a Ph.D. in history.  And she decided to get married and so she took a master's [degree] in history instead of continuing on for the Ph.D.  And she's--went into a couple of tech companies at the time that failed (laughter) as they were doing.  And so she had, had, was doing nothing with her history, but she was making money.  And then she got married, and then she became a technical writer and editor, people who take technical language and translate it in a user-friendly language and she was doing proposal writings and stuff like that for grants, and--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your brother, I'm sorry, your brother, your son, Jeffrey, did he remain in the ministry?
Speaker 2: No, he wasn't in the ministry he just majored in religion, it was an academic study for him and he never (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did he go on to do?
Speaker 2: Well, he left Princeton and he went to work for a public relations company in Washington, Ogilvy and Mather.  And he was doing an, an internship with them.  And at the end of the internship he was working--HIV/AIDS [human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] was just becoming a phenomenon and he was working on H, HIV project with the Center for Disease Control [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia].  And he did such a good job they offered him a job, they hired him.  And the next thing he, a few years he was the youngest vice president in Ogle Mather--Ogilvy and Mather.  And so he continued in that field.
Speaker 1: So you had two children in the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you were married also in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the late '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Early--
Speaker 2: --in 1959.  My, my first wife passed away in 1990.
Speaker 1: And tell me her name.
Speaker 2: Doris [Doris Joseph].
Story_ID: 487437
Speaker 1: So, let's make a sharp turn--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --and take me to Claremont [Claremont Colleges, Claremont, California].  What year did you go to Claremont?
Speaker 2: I, I went to Claremont in 1964.  I, I, I went to Stillman [Stillman College, Tuscaloosa, Alabama] in '63 [1963], and so I was a leader of the civil rights movement for a year.  And I, I left and I went to Claremont as associate chaplain to the guy I had been an intern under when I was in--at Yale Divinity School [New Haven, Connecticut].  And within six months I was getting the same threatening calls I had gotten in Alabama except this time I was a leader of the antiwar movement.  I was head of the Pomona Valley committee against the Vietnam War.  And the right wing down there had discovered me (laughter), and I found out I had just changed venues and changed subject matter but I was getting the same reaction.
Speaker 1: How did you become active in the anti-Vietnam War movement?
Speaker 2: Well, I had felt all along that it was wrong, and that those of us who were trying to raise the moral consciousness of the nation had a responsibility to do so in regards to human rights as well as civil rights.  And I had already started thinking internationally, and South Africa became on my radar screen and that sort of thing, and then I went to Claremont and I met a few students.  Now, I have to tell you, Claremont was also white, and there were five undergraduate colleges and a, and a graduate school.  And I don't know, there probably might have been another couple of black faculty throughout the institution, and they were conservative except for this one new college they started called Pitzer [Pitzer College, Claremont, California] which was focused on social sciences, anthropology, et cetera.  And some of those faculty were getting involved and so they kind of talked me into going to this rally, and the next thing I knew, I was the leader of the movement.  But one of the things, the skills that I had gained in the Civil Rights Movement was talking at rallies.  And I, I went to this rally and the students were sitting on the lawn, having a great time, like a picnic.  And my friend who was coordinating this in some way and so he asked me to speak.  And (laughter) it was very interesting, because I started out softly and with all modesty I can say that by the time I ended up everybody was on their feet cheering, and we had a movement (laughter).
Story_ID: 487438
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What kinds of things did you say to the crowd to move them such a way?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, I, I talked about how wrong this [Vietnam War] was and, I, I, I did visual images of people dying in remote villages and et cetera, et cetera.  And, and I had learned to--I mean, all of us who were in the Civil Rights Movement were sort of mini Martin Luther Kings [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] by then (laughter).  And though I did not have the Baptist preaching style, I had, I sort of learned the kind of rhetorical exercise that was necessary to, to get an audience aroused (laughter).
Speaker 1: Would you often listen to the speeches of Martin Luther King in the late '50s [1950], early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Well, Martin Luther King came to town [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] when I was organizing the civil rights movement and our biggest movement after the first one where all these people showed up.  The next time we invited Martin Luther King and so I heard him a number of times but it wasn't just Martin Luther King, I mean, there were lots of people.  Martin Luther King was the leader and, you know, he was the spokesperson but I also developed a lot of, the style of Bill Coffin [William Sloane Coffin] who had been the chaplain at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about that oratorical style.
Speaker 2: Well, Bill Coffin was much more intellectual.  And from my earliest days with my math teacher [Samuel Douglas] who was a philosophy, philosopher, I learned to intersperse my speeches with all sorts of literary references, whether from Shakespeare [William Shakespeare] or whatever.  And so I had to master a lot of those that I could call on and that was Coffin's style.  And, you know, and I, I loved that because it was much more substantive than a lot of the stuff I had heard guys doing in the Civil Rights Movement.  And so if you would say who, who, who was my style most like?  It was like Bill Coffin who was white but who could talk to any audience, and so I think probably I more emulated Bill Coffin than I did Martin Luther King.
Story_ID: 487439
Speaker 1: Tell me about--I'm gonna backtrack just a little bit.  Tell me about your interaction with Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] back in Tuscaloosa [Alabama].
Speaker 2: Well, we just invited him to come and speak and he, he came to town and spoke a couple of times (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did--what was that speech, do you remember what was--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --the substance?
Speaker 2: It, he, he started to talk about these young men who started this movement, and how important it was for them to listen and to, to follow us, et cetera.  But, you know, that was a long time ago and I can't remember some of the, some of the rhetoric but it was familiar stuff that he used over and over.
Speaker 1: Did you realize you were making history, that you were a part of history at that time?
Speaker 2: Never thought about it that way until one day after we had a demonstration.  We began to realize that we were not a part of a national movement, that we had started this, we hadn't checked with anybody, and we were sort of isolated.  And that's when we decided to ask Martin Luther King to come.  And I met Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] who, who became a friend.  But they had a guy named James Bevel [HistoryMaker Reverend James Bevel].  And James Bevel used to wear a kind of Jewish skull cap and go around and, and he was unbelievable in pool halls and places like that.  He'd just turn 'em out for the demonstrations and, and, and I'm backing up but that's, it's kind of important because it's also funny.  James Bevel heard that I'd been making these fiery speeches.  Somebody told him and so he came to Tuscaloosa looking for me.  And I was scheduled to go to talk to the ministers that day, to the black ministers' local association, and so I told Bevel I was going and I brought Bevel and, of course, Bevel was pretty famous by then 'cause he had been in Birmingham [Alabama] and et cetera.  And (laughter) Bevel got up and called them a bunch of sellouts and (laughter) for a, for a half an hour Bevel told 'em what he thought of 'em, and I was never invited back to the ministers association (laughter).  But Bevel and I became friends and he helped us to get Martin Luther King to come, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you incorporate some of your father's [Adam Joseph] sermonic style?
Speaker 2: No, no (unclear).  Remember I told you this lady said that that she enjoyed my speech but she was waiting for me to learn to preach.  Well, for that lady I never learned to preach (laughter).
Story_ID: 487440
Speaker 1: So now back at Claremont [Claremont Colleges, Claremont, California]--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you were a leader once again.
Speaker 2: Well, I got involved in that, that, yes, yes, and I organized the campus and we had demonstrations in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and I made contact with the people in the antiwar movement throughout the state.  And so, sometime you'd find me speaking in Berkeley [California] and sometimes you'd find me speaking in Colorado, in Oregon.  And what happened is I met a, a folk singer named Clabe Hangan, a black guy.  And Clabe sung one time before I spoke and from then on every time I had a speech to make, I made sure Clabe was with me, and so it was Joseph [HistoryMaker James Joseph] and Hagen that went to these rallies (laughter) and he'd sing and I'd speak and--.
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of the leaders, additional leaders involved in the anti-Vietnam [Vietnam War]?
Speaker 2: In, in the antiwar movement?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, it was all the famous name, I mean, I even was at a rally with Muhammad Ali in, in Los Angeles.  And so we, we connected.  And, and, of course, you know, we had the brutality.  We used to go down and demonstrate in front of the federal building in, in Los Angeles a lot.  And one time we were in a rally and the police were riding horses and they just rode those horses through the crowd and horses were stepping on people as they were trying to get away and stuff, so we encountered brutality once more.
Speaker 1: You were also involved in the chapel on campus?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this time I had responsibility for the college church too.  And the first time I went I was a associate, later I came back as the chaplain and the minister of the college church but this time when I left Stillman [Stillman College, Tuscaloosa, Alabama], I was the associate chaplain and I used to preach in the college church too, in addition to running, helping run our religious activity center.  And the religious activity center became the, the rallying point for the antiwar movement and students built tents all around the campus and they, and all around the religious activity center, and you'd come in and you could see that it was the, the center of the movement.
Story_ID: 487441
Speaker 1: By the way, March on Washington, did you venture up to Washington [D.C.] for that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I wasn't, that was when I was at Stillman [Stillman College, Tuscaloosa, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I had just gone there and I had--yeah, I was speaking at a Presbyterian conference that day.  And I didn't realize at that time what the March on Washington was gonna turn out to be, and so I had made a commitment to these people and I kept my, my commitment and--
Speaker 1: Did you ever come across Rosa Parks in those days?
Speaker 2: No, no, I knew who she was but I never met her personally.
Speaker 1: So Claremont [Claremont Colleges, Claremont, California], take, help me understand the timeline.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I was there from sixty--I was there '64 [1964] and '65 [1965].  In '64 [1964], I started organizing faculty and students to go to, do voter registration in Mississippi.  And so I took a group of students and faculty to Edwards, Mississippi, where we spent the summer.  And where, and this was, as I say a conservative institution, it hadn't even had any demonstrations before I, I went there.  And then when I said, you know, we really ought to go down to Mississippi and help the folks down there because I was, I'm sorry, I was concerned that the focus was getting to be exclusively on the war [Vietnam War], and these people had not been sensitized to the relationship between the war and what was going on in the South, et cetera.  So I know I immediately began to sort of, not shift gears but begin to balance back my antiwar activities with civil rights and so I took them (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You took a majority white group down to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Actually, it was all white (laughter).  I was the only, only black.  And we went to Mount Beulah [Mount Beulah College, Edwards, Mississippi] which had once been a little school, and we sort of camped out there and decided that we should consult with the local people about our presence there.  And so we had a meeting with some of the local people.  And we told 'em we'd come down from Claremont.  And by the way, we had done a lot of work, we had collected all sorts of stuff.  We had four Volkswagen vans we had had people donate that we had fixed up and we brought 'em all full of typewriters and all sorts of things we took for the schools and, the Freedom Schools in Mississippi at that time.
Story_ID: 487442
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you were telling me about Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, Ed- Edwards, Mississippi.  And so we, we did voter registration and we, we built a swimming pool and we wrote a curriculum for the local elementary school teaching black history.  And I had this white graduate student who did all the research and wrote this.  She became very famous as a feminist theologian.  Her name is Rosemary Ruether [Rosemary Radford Ruether].  At that time she was studying theology at the graduate school in Claremont [Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, California].  But we all did all sorts of things, what the people wanted and we responded to their needs.  And she responded to the, to the need to do something on black history, and she did a superb job with putting together an elementary school curriculum for them to teach black history, and so those were the kind of things we did.  But meanwhile when we got back to Claremont [California], Watts [Los Angeles, California] exploded and, and we realized we needed to be doing things at home and so we got very heavily involved in Watts and--
Speaker 1: How were you received in Mississippi by the white community?
Speaker 2: Oh, they didn't like it at all.  We, we received threatening letters.  One night we heard some rustle in the woods nearby and we, we used to have security every night and we'd alternate providing security.  And it turns out it was the, the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] dropping leaflets about our presence.  And so we were in danger but nothing happened.  As a matter of fact, the only thing that happened is that one of those Volkswagens we had repaired had a bad door in the back and it dropped on my head.  I went (laughter), and I went back to, to Claremont with a bandage on my head and everybody thought the Klan had, had beaten me and it had been this Volkswagen door (laughter) that dropped on my head.
Story_ID: 487443
Speaker 1: But the other thing I wanted to say about Claremont [Claremont Colleges, Claremont, California] when we went back in addition to getting involved in Watts [Los Angeles, California] and we got involved with a, with a lot of people at the time, I met Ron Karenga [HistoryMaker Maulana Karenga] and became friends with Ron.  I used to invite Ron over to speak at the college church.  And we used to, there used to be a lot of black poets developing at that time in Watts and I used to bring 'em in.  And, and next thing I knew, I really had a fully integrated service.  Blacks were coming too, because I was bringing all these folks in.  But the other thing we did is we decided it was time to work on integrating the schools.  And so the chaplain, the, who had been the chaplain.  He was then the provost when I was chaplain.
Speaker 2: What was his name?
Speaker 1: Pete Reckard [Edgar C. Reckard, Jr.].  We decided we'd develop a special program that we called Project Open Future where we identified kids in, in Watts and we helped them get into a prep school, one of those top California prep schools for a year, and then we had it worked out with the Claremont Colleges that they would take some of these students.  In the first year, they would have a lot of mentoring and tutoring and support group, and then they would become regular students after that.  And so we developed Project Open Future and many of our students went on and did well and some of them eventually became lawyers and doctors and stuff but they wouldn't have been able to get admitted into those elite colleges at the time without--because they didn't, they couldn't do the test scores and, you know, and that kind of thing but with a little support--and so Project Open Future became a very popular program.  Later on people began to do this, this kind of thing in lots of colleges, but we were early in, in developing this, this notion.
Speaker 2: Tell me more about the Black Arts Movement in Claremont [California] at this time.
Speaker 1: Well, it was in Watts, and it just happened that, that I met and I can't remember the guy's name, he used to run the, the Watts arts festival [Watts Summer Festival], and we became friends and so we began to exhibit a lot of their stuff in Claremont and--
Speaker 2: Tell me your favorite memory from that period, sharing poetry, et cetera.
Speaker 1: My favorite memory was, there was a, a, a service we did with a, a young lady from Watts and, and I, I don't know whatever happened to her, but it was an incredible service.  She was really good.  She not only wrote poetry but she was good in reciting her poetry and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Why was that so important?  What was the role of art in sending the message and mobilizing the people?
Speaker 1: Well, it's another medium of communication.  And it was struggle art, in, in, in a sense, so it was conveying the same messages we were in our rallies but they were just using art to do it.
Speaker 2: And what were those messages?
Speaker 1: About segregation and the importance of eliminating segregation but also some of them were antiwar too and get out of Vietnam.  And so we were mixing it in the medium.
Speaker 2: So schools in that part of California at this time were still segregated?
Speaker 1: Well, they were weren't segregated, just didn't have many black students.  And this also, while I was at Claremont, Ronald Reagan [Ronald Wilson Reagan] ran for governor and people said he'd never win, he won.  And then once he got in, he started cutting back the budget at the University of California and they were having student rallies all across the campus and so a group of students came to me and said they wanted to do a demonstration rally and would I speak.  And I said, "Look, I'm a chaplain.  I can't have any symbolic acts of violence," because they were--the famous thing at that time was burning a picture of Ronald Reagan.  And so we had this rally and the students promised me nothing, no acts of symbolic violence.  When I got through speaking, this student burned Ronald Reagan's picture, and the next day the headlines of the paper was, "Chaplain Speaks at Effigy Burning" (laughter).  And you can imagine there were a lot of angry trustees and donors to these colleges, and I, I learned that you, you can't control these things, I mean, you know, you try your best and I had been promised that there would be no stuff like that but it occurred and we continued.
Story_ID: 487444
Speaker 1: You remained with the Claremont Colleges [Claremont, California] until 1967?
Speaker 2: I went--I left Claremont in '67 [1967], but I came back again.  I, I went for a year and Indiana as an associate director of three foundations.  One was the Cummins Foundation [Cummins Engine Foundation; Cummins Foundation], another was the Family Foundation [Kaiser Family Foundation, Menlo Park, California], and the third was the foundation of a group of banks.  And they had identified me through a headhunter.  And interestingly enough, the headhunter went to talk to the people at the Danforth Foundation [St. Louis, Missouri] who had been responsible for my internship from Yale [Yale Divinity School, New Haven, Connecticut] and my going to Claremont, and they told 'em about me and they came out to see me and the next thing I knew I was going to Columbus, Indiana.  And I went there and--
Speaker 1: How was that switch?  I mean, you've moved around quite a bit, you've gone from the Deep South to the Northeast to the West and now the Midwest.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, you know, these were not planned moves.  My concern at the time was to do something about the issues confronting American society.  The arena in which I served depended on the circumstances at the time.  And I was learning a little bit about philanthropy and I got an opportunity to use philanthropy to support civil rights activities, and so when I got that opportunity to do that I went to do that.  And the guy who came out to see me had been brought on by the foundations to help organize the foundation, and he came and I remember sitting on the steps of my house for a couple of hours with this guy I had never met before, his name was Phil Sorensen [Philip C. Sorensen].  He was the brother of Ted Sorensen, who had worked with Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] and he had been lieutenant governor of Nebraska and he had just narrowly lost a candidate for governor, I mean, as a candidate for governor.  And I met him and I really liked him in terms of what he wanted to do with this money of this wealthy family and the company, and so I went to join him.  And then in the meantime--and we did so many things through philanthropy, that's another whole story, but I stayed that year and then Pete Reckard [Edgar C. Reckard, Jr.] who had been chaplain of the Claremont Colleges and I had been his associate, moved up to provost, and so they invited me to come back to Claremont to be chaplain, and so I went back to Claremont as chaplain.  And then, shortly thereafter Phil Sorensen decided to leave the, the company and the family and they invited me to be the president and so then I left Claremont and went back.  I, I had three goodbye parties at (laughter) Claremont.  And the last time I left, I said, "If I ever come back here again, please don't give me a goodbye party, it's getting ridiculous" (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 487445
Speaker 1: What about the--your work with the foundations in Indiana, what's one highlight?
Speaker 2: Oh, there, there are many, many highlights.  We began to fund the development of alternative institutions and Nairobi college.  And all sorts of things like that were emerging, the alternative art center in, at a museum in Washington, D.C. by Tapa Karu [ph.].  And then there was this guy developing a, a museum that is now a part of the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.] which we funded that.  We funded a number of alternative institutions that eventually became mainline.  But my real fun was that was the time when I developed the Association of Black Foundation Executives.  I was the founding chair of the United Black Fund [sic.] which we developed as an alternative to United Way [United Way Worldwide] because we didn't like the money going into black, they weren't making the kind of decisions to, to support empowerment.  They were supporting social service but we wanted some money to support reform, and so we developed the, the Black United Fund [National Black United Fund].  And the reason I say it was, it was great times because those foundations supported me every step of the way.  They not only supported me but they provided the money.  When we organized the Association of Black Foundation Executives, some of the foundations would not pay for their staff to go to a meeting.  My board paid, picked up the tab for the travel expenses for all of us blacks to come to this meeting 'cause their foundations wouldn't do it.
Speaker 1: Who attended that meeting?
Speaker 2: The meeting?  Well, the first meeting where I met with two other people, it was Brian George [ph.] who was at the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] and Harriet Michel [HistoryMaker Harriet Michelle Michel] who was at the New York Community Trust [sic. New York Foundation].  And that was the first time.  And then by the time we got a, a group of about twenty together, I had then hired five black program officers so we were six of the twenty and it was no accident that I was elected chairman (laughter).  I think a--
Speaker 1: Tell us--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And it wasn't, it was really not just because of my, my five votes from my own foundation, but I had taken initiative to pull the whole thing together.  And who were some of the other people?  There was a guy named Roland Johnson from The Cleveland Foundation [Cleveland, Ohio].  Ernie Osborne [Ernest Osborne] who was in New Haven [Connecticut] who headed a small foundation there.  These were--
Speaker 1: Why was--
Speaker 2: --some of the people.
Speaker 1: Why was this work rewarding?
Speaker 2: Because it was a way to serve the black community and to use white resources.
Story_ID: 487446
Speaker 1: Did you see any of the rewards, any of the benefits made possible through the donations?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, many (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Give me a, a visual description of one of those.
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things I funded, and one of the reasons this family asked me to head the foundation is because J. Irwin Miller was head of the, lay head of the council, National Council of Churches, and he was very much interested in religion, and they were supporting theological education.  And so because of my theological education as well as my civil rights background, and all of the things they were interested in were things that my life reflected and so they asked me to do that.  One of the projects that I still take great pride in is we decided to--they, they were beginning to teach black church studies in seminaries but they had no literature, no curriculum.  And so I went to a black guy at Colgate Rochester [Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School, Rochester, New York], and I talked to them and I said, you know, "Maybe we ought to develop a project to get black ministers to do some writing and to begin to produce literature on preaching and on worship in the black tradition," et cetera.  And so we developed something called the Martin Luther King Fellows.  And we identified twenty black ministers around the country and we worked it out with Colgate Rochester that if they spent three summers in the program and they were willing to write something, they'd get a degree.  And so those fellows in that program included Beecher Hicks [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. H. Beecher Hicks, Jr.] in Washington, D.C., who has one of the largest black church.  Jim Forbes [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. James A. Forbes, Jr.] who is the minister of Riverside [Riverside Church] in New York [New York].  And on and on it goes.  But none of these guys were at that level then, they were young black ministers who we identified as people who were gone be major leaders.  And in the end, each one of those ministers wrote a book, except one.  I think nineteen of the twenty wrote a book.  Wyatt Tee Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker] was one of the people, and actually Wyatt wrote about six books after he got started.  And a number of them wrote multiple books as a result of that.  And now that's something I'll look back, and there was a three year project when the money was, I couldn't get any more money, they incorporated as the Martin Luther King Fellows corporation and I think that still exists, yeah.
Speaker 1: How long did you spend in that capacity with the foundations in Indiana?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I was there twice (laughter).  Actually, I went, I, I went into the company and I came back another time.  I, I was there one year and then I left and was there two years, and then I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you started, what year was that, in 1969?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I came back in '69 [1969] as the head of the foundation.  And then in 1970, Irwin Miller sort of said, "Look, I'm gonna be retiring as CEO of the company," and, and the company was, was known as the, the large multinational corporation with the best values.  And not just civil rights but internationally investing in everything else.  And Irwin Miller said to me that, you know, "Maybe you ought to join the company and help them."  And so we developed something, a, a job where I became vice president for corporate action where I had five departments reporting to me.
Story_ID: 487447
Speaker 1: And one of them was philanthropy but I also was doing some international things for them.  I traveled abroad and look at what it means to be responsible in doing business in this country, and one of the times I went to South Africa which started my connection with South Africa.
Speaker 2: Well, that's my next question.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: In 1973 was that your first trip?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So tell me about that.  I know there were several leaders who were also involved in this sojourn as well.
Speaker 1: Well, when I went in '73 [1973] I went by myself.  And, I mean, the Association of Black Foundation Executives sent a delegation and I used to lead delegations later.  But in '73 [1973] I went, not by myself because now, I, I should say that I became a part of a group of leaders that were going to South Africa to take a look at South Africa and I was a part of that group, but I was also there to do a study in economic and political environment to ascertain whether or not Cummins [Cummins Engine Company; Cummins Inc.] could operate in that environment and maintain its values.  And I had to come back and recommend whether Cummins should do business in South Africa or not.  But at the same time, I was a part of the, the South African Leader Exchange Program [United States - South African Leader Exchange Program] that I became a part of.  And between the two of them I got access to everybody I wanted to see.  And that sort of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who did you see?
Speaker 1: There was a group in South Africa then called the Broederbond when means in Afrikaans the bond of brothers.  There were the most feared group but they were the shadow government, they were running the government.  And, and most people didn't know who they were, and I was able to get an appointment with the Broederbond to talk about South Africa.
Speaker 2: What was your first impression?
Speaker 1: Oh, the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] (laughter).  I said, "Oh, I've found another group of Klan in another country."  But they, they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What did they say or do?
Speaker 1: --they regarded themselves as a think tank.
Speaker 2: What gave you the impression that they were comparable to the Klan?
Speaker 1: Because the way they talked and then I began to hear about some of the thing.  And remember South Africa was very violent then.  And they were the powers behind the throne.  They, they were, and some of them were in elected positions but most of them were not, but they were the one who made policy and called the shots in those days.
Story_ID: 487448
Speaker 1: Was the divide between white South Africans, the coloureds, the blacks, was it stark?
Speaker 2: It was stark (laughter), and in the, in the speech I, I, I made at the end, I referred to South Africa as a pigmentocracy in which rights and resources are apportioned according to pigmentation of the skin.  And they were pretty upset about my saying that publicly.  And I also had a picture taken under a sign on the beach that said, "Whites only, no dogs allowed."  It appeared in the papers with a caption underneath saying, "African American says dignity insulted."  And that night, I started getting threatening telephone calls because in the newspaper, in the story, in connection with the picture, they had not only reported on what I had said but they reported on where I was staying.  And so everybody knew where I was staying and so I started getting these threats that became so credible that I pushed all the furniture up against, much of the furniture as I could move, against the door and then I left the country the next day.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Was it more frightening than your experience in the Deep South?
Speaker 2: Well, what occurred to me as in Alabama I could call the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice] if I got in serious trouble.  In South Africa I couldn't call anybody.  I couldn't even call the American embassy because the American ambassador [John Hurd] used to go hunting with the prime minister of South Africa [B.J. Vorster].  And the South Africans were so upset that their ambassador to the United States called J. Irwin Miller, the chairman and chief executive officer at Cummins [Cummins Engine Company; Cummins Inc.], and said that I was a disgrace to the company and they really should know what I did to disgrace them.  And when he finished, J. Irwin Miller, the CEO said, "He's not only a credit to the company but we consider him a great credit to the country," and they did not fire me.  But in the meantime I, I was approached about funding a, a film that was being made clandestinely in South Africa.  And I agreed to fund it with the understanding it would be anonymous because it was about workers in the mines and I did not think that it would go over to well if a business corporation funded this, this film, so I said.  It was shown on PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] and at the end they gave the credits to Cummins Engine Company (laughter), and needless to say that some of our distributors were pretty upset and it raised the furor I thought it would.
Speaker 1: What was the--
Speaker 2: But J. Irwin Miller, again, stood by me.
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds of South Africa you recall from that 1973 trip?
Speaker 2: The music.  I mean, everywhere you went people were singing.  And that's still true in South Africa, choral singing is one of the most pronounced cultural features.  And so if you asked me what are the sights--what are the sounds, I remember the singing.  The, the sights were the townships.  Now they tried to keep me from the townships but I managed to orchestrate visits to a couple of townships.  And so I saw some of the--
Speaker 1: The shanty (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) samples of the plight in which people were living at that time.
Speaker 1: What did you see?  Describe the scene.
Speaker 2: Oh, people putting together cardboards to live under, kind of, so they had cardboard shack.  You know, the sewer, sewage was running through these places and it was just the worst of what you can imagine.

Speaker 1: What was your mission upon your return to the United States?
Speaker 2: From then on I was a very devout antiapartheid activist, and I used everything I could to try and help black people in southern Africa.  My, my foundation funded a meeting in Puerto, Puerto Rico where we invited a number of people in to talk about what African Americans could do to help the liberation movement in southern Africa.  And those folks were the ones who later formed TransAfrica [TransAfrica Forum; TransAfrica], but it sort of grew out of that meeting in Puerto Rico where there was a commitment made to forming something like that.  And so (simultaneous) --
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you, at this time were you aware of people like Randall Robinson and--
Speaker 2: Well, it was Randall Robinson who was the leader and for the first few years of TransAfrica, my foundation paid his salary (laughter).  We also at that time were starting the Black United Fund [National Black United Fund] in which I was the founding chair and we wanted to get into payroll deduction within the federal system and corporation.  And my foundation paid for the lawyers to file the litigation that led to opening up a payroll deduction.
Speaker 1: Do you know what Andrew Jackson Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] was doing at the time?
Speaker 2: Well, he was in Alabama when I was in Alabama doing some things.  And he did, I mean, he was a major lieutenant to Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], so he was doing his thing.  I never got involved directly with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC].  I was always out there sort of on my own.  And that's where you look at the history, unless you go to Tuscaloosa [Alabama], and they've got something in their archives, not a lot of people outside of Tuscaloosa know what I did in Tuscaloosa.  And Andy, of course, knew very well and he once called J. Irwin Miller the most progressive businessman in the country.  When Maynard Jackson announced that he was gonna be a candidate for mayor, I invited him to Columbus, Indiana, and we had a major fundraiser, and Columbus, Indiana, is a little town but he raised some of his most significant funds in Columbus.  That was because of the big contribution of my donors again.
Speaker 1: What town was this?
Speaker 2: Columbus, Indiana.  And oh, I had a person on my staff whose name was Ivanhoe Donaldson who had been with SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], and every time a major campaign came up, we released Ivanhoe to work on the campaign.  So he worked on [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry, Marion Barry's campaign, he works on Andy Young's campaign, and he worked on one of Dick Hatcher's [HistoryMaker Richard Hatcher] campaign, and all of these people who were pioneers.  By then I had a program officer in five cities and whereas it was just coincidental, we evidently picked the right five cities because in a few years each of those cities had a black mayor.

Speaker 1: Jumping ahead just a little bit, tell me about your work with the [U.S.] Department of the Interior.
Speaker 2: Well, I was at Cummins [Cummins Engine Company; Cummins Inc.] minding my own business (laughter) and Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] and I were at a conference in Lesotho and Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] had just been elected and I said, Andy and I were having breakfast, and I said, "Andy, are you gonna go in the Carter administration?"  'Cause he had been such a big supporter and he said, "Oh, no.  I, I've just gotten a few very important committees in the [U.S.] Congress and I'm gonna stay," he said, "but you ought to go."  I said, "Oh, no, I've just gotten big promotions at Cummins and now I've got an opportunity to do more things."  Two weeks later both Andy and I were in the Carter administration (laughter).  It just happened that in my case, Cecil Andrus was the governor of Idaho and he was a friend of Jimmy Carter's and he was asked to be secretary of the interior.  And I had a next door neighborhood who had been in a law firm in Idaho and he and Cecil Andrus were friends.  And Cecil Andrus called him to see whether he'd consider being solicitor general.  And so Cecil Andrus shared with him what he was looking for and a number two person to run the department and he says, "I've just got just the person for you; he's my neighbor."  So he came back and he said, "I'd like for you to meet Cecil Andrus.  He wants to meet you," and I say, "The Department of Interior?  I mean, why would I wanna go to the Department of Interior?"  And so he said, "Why don't you take a look at it?"  So I did research the next few days.  I found out everything I could, and I found out that it was one of those departments blacks ignored because they usually went into the ones that, social welfare kind of agency.  But there were a lot of resources there that whites were taking advantage of, that black people were not getting.  And so I said well I think I'll go talk to him.  And then I went to Washington [D.C.] and talked to Cecil Andrus and I liked him very much, even though we had very different background.  He had been a lawyer, a logger for gun (unclear) politics, got elected governor and now he was being appointed secretary of interior.  My background was very different but I liked him and I decided to go and do it.
