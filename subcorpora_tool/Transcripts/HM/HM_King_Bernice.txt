Story_ID: 482290
Speaker 1: Let's begin by talking about your, your parents, and I want to begin with your mother.  So let's talk about your mother.  Tell me your mother's name and spell it for me, please.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Coretta Scott King.  And the first name, C-O-R-E-T-T-A, middle name S-C-O-T-T, and the last name of course, K-I-N-G.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your mother, where was she born?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in Perry County, Alabama.  We now know it as Marion, Alabama.  At the time, it was called Heiberger, Alabama, a very small town in kind of the middle of Alabama, about forty-five, sixty, about forty-five miles from Selma, Alabama.  About seventy, seventy-five miles from Montgomery [Alabama], and about the same distance from Birmingham, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Did she share any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, of course.  She shared many, many stories.  One of the ones that a lot of people don't know about is that my mother used to pick cotton.  She started at the age of ten and they were doing it first and foremost, because my grandfather [Obie Scott] was trying to teach them a work ethic.  He used to always say it's important to get up early.  And even if you don't have anything to do, to sit up because you'll end up being lazy and he even continued that phrase when we used to visit them down in Marion, Alabama.  She said he would say, "Coretta, why those kids still asleep?  They need to get up and just sit up if they have to or they gonna be lazy."  But anyway, she started picking cotton to help supplement their educational needs, whatever they needed in terms of school.  But it was not to help supplement the family income or anything like that.  And she was able to pick more cotton than most of the boys.  I mean she was just a good cotton picker.  And they used to tease her about that.  You know, that she was, you know, one of those great cotton pickers.  Even more so than the boys.  She had a cousin, Martin McMurray, who she used to play with on the farm (laughter) and one day she got really upset and ended up hitting, hitting him over the head with an axe handle.  The nonviolent, wife of a nonviolent leader [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], and she was a nonviolent person, but she used to share this.  I found it out, I was so shocked.  I was like, wow.  So she had a little, I guess somewhat of a little temper growing up.
Story_ID: 482291
Speaker 1: There were so many other stories that she [King's mother, Coretta Scott King] shared, historical stories.  Something that I'm very proud of in our family is that on both sides of her family, her mother's side and her father's side, they were land owners.  They on the Scott side, which would be her father's side of the family, Obie Scott was her father's name, Obadiah Scott, spelled O-B-A-D-I-A-H.  On his side of the family, his father, which would be my great-grandfather, Jeff Scott [Jefferson Scott], owned three hundred acres of land.  It was a farm that passed on through the family.  And I can say this day that we are fourth generation land owners and I'm very proud of that and on the history in African American community of a land being stolen from the African Americans and us typically selling land off for money for family and provisions.  But we've been able to maintain that in our family.  And so that land passed on.  It was a farmland.  And my mother grew up, herself, on a farm.  My grandfather, Obie Scott, actually was married at the age of twenty-one to my grandmother, who I was named after, Bernice McMurray Scott.  The middle name is M-C-M-U-R-R-- I believe A-Y.  And her name was Bernice McMurray.  And obviously when she married my grandfather Bernice McMurray Scott. She was sixteen when they got married, he was twenty-one.  And he actually built their home, the first home that my mother lived in throughout elementary and high school [Lincoln Normal School, Marion, Alabama].  It was a two room house, basically.  A--two large rooms, a kitchen and the other was a bedroom.  And I'm thinking in my mind today in 2008, how did that sleeping arrangement work?  But they had two beds, I guess they had to share floors and all of that kind of stuff.  But I just thought it was so interesting.  He built his own home and back then that was just unheard of.  My grandfather always was a very business minded man.  He was a very determined man.  And you know he had an, an independence about him.  He was not going to allow the system to break him and define him.  So he built that home.  And they grew crops and vegetables, corn, peas, potatoes on the land.  And my mother, her sister Edythe, E-D-Y-T-H-E, Bagley [Edythe Scott Bagley], B-A-G-L-E-Y and her brother Obie Leonard Scott, and it was O-B-I-E of course, and Leonard, L-E-O-N-A-R-D.  They all helped with the crops and the vegetables.  They would not till the ground, but they would help with the planting and the hoeing.  They also helped because they had cows on that farm, chickens and pigs.  So they fed the cows and pigs, or they fed the pigs and chickens and they milked the cows.  So early on my mother, you know, was into a little farming, picking cotton.  But the cotton didn't start until she was about ten, but she started working in the garden and the farming part around the age of six.
Story_ID: 482292
Speaker 1: We were talking about the education of your grandparents.
Speaker 2: Yeah, both of my grandparents on my mother's [Coretta Scott King] side, they, their education was only elementary school education, as a matter of fact.  But my grandfather became a businessman, very successful.
Speaker 1: He owned a number of businesses.  Before we go to the business, actually I want to know if this is true.  You talked about the generations that owned the land, and do you believe that it's true that they acquired the land right after the American Revolution?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Yes.
Speaker 1: And as far as your grandfather being a business owner, of course he had the farm.
Speaker 2: My great-grandfather [Jefferson Scott] had three hundred acres that passed to his children, ultimately to my grandfather, Obie Scott.  But the land that they lived on when he built his home, was not the same land.
Speaker 1: I see, all right.  So tell me about his entrepreneurial spirit.
Speaker 2: My grandfather Obie Scott, actually started working early at a sawmill and was a very wise man.  He saved his money and ended up buying him a truck.  And that enabled him to begin to haul the lumber and the logs for the sawmill.  A lot of the whites in town, poor whites were very jealous because here was this black, at that time Negro, or maybe even colored man, who was moving up the economic ladder.  So there was a lot of jealously and he faced a lot of threats constantly, even at night.  People--they would stop him on the road and threaten him.  And he used to tell my mother and her sister [Edythe Scott Bagley] and brother [Obie Leonard Scott] that if you look a white man in the eye he can't hurt you.  And so he just learned to confront the threats and stand up to it.  And my mother used to remark that she learned early in life to fear for those that she loved because oftentimes he would leave home and they wouldn't know if he would come back safely because of the fact that he had bought his truck and was hauling lumber.  He also supplemented his income so he--barber trade.  So he used to cut hair on the weekend and at night.  And my grandmother Bernice Scott [Bernice McMurray Scott] would also pitch in to help him. And so he was cutting hair, driving.  He eventually bought his own sawmill.  And again that same spirit of jealousy rose up and his sawmill was burned down.  But he was so determined and resilient that nothing could stop him, so he always found another thing to do.  So he went back to hauling lumber and he was cutting hair again.  And eventually when they moved to the home, the second home that he built that we still own today, my mother did not necessarily live in that home because the home that he first built in 1920 right after he and my grandmother got married in 1920 he built this home.  That home burned down when my mother was away in high school [Lincoln Normal School, Marion, Alabama].  And I think it was around either the year before she graduated or the year she graduated from high school.  And so this home in 1948 that he built that currently it is there today, he built that and had connected to it a grocery store.  The equivalent of today of what we call convenience stores with gas stations.  Because he sold gas and he sold groceries to many people in the community.  And so he was a very smart man in spite of not being educated, very business minded and had an entrepreneurial spirit.
Story_ID: 482293
Speaker 1: Did you, or were there stories about his [King's maternal grandfather, Obie Scott] father and mother?
Speaker 2: Jeff Scott [Jefferson Scott] was his father and his mother was Cora Scott [Cora McLaughlin Scott].  She died at an earlier age.  He had actually thirteen siblings with his mother and then when she died, Jeff Scott remarried and had twelve other kids.  So there are twenty-five of them in all.  I think only maybe one or two, maybe three, maybe even one are living today.  But Jeff Scott again, both of my mother's and father's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] side, they were not very well educated.  But they educated themselves.  He was very active in the community.  He traveled a lot.  He was a trustee at the church that my mother grew up in which was Mount Tabor, and that's T-A-B-O-R A.M.E. African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church [Mount Tabor A.M.E. Zion Church, Marion, Alabama] (laughter).  So he was a trustee, a preacher steward.  He traveled a lot related to that.  He became an insurance salesman, so he traveled a lot related to that.  And he was just a very well-known man in the community.  My, my grandmother Cora Scott, I don't know a lot about her.  My mother often remarked that she wished she had gotten to know her better, you know, but you know I think because she died so early on, she didn't get to know the person who was named after her, excuse me--
Speaker 1: She was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous) that she was named after.  Cora and my mother of course, Coretta [Coretta Scott King].
Story_ID: 482294
Speaker 1: Now going back down to your mother's generation and your grandparents not being educated, but they were for education for their children.  What did your mother talk about her parents telling her about education?
Speaker 2: Well my, my grandmother stands out in particular, the story that I--that has been shared over and over with me by my mother, is that my grandmother used to say, "You all are going to get an education even if I have but one dress to wear."  And, and so my mother and my mother's sister, Edythe Bagley [Edythe Scott Bagley] actually became valedictorian of their classes, their high school classes.  They had to, because my grandmother and grandfather [Obie Scott] were concerned about them getting the best education they could, there was a school that was eleven miles away from their home.  And of course back then, we don't have the kind of bus transportation system that we have today and because of the laws of segregation, white kids were bussed, but black kids weren't.  They had to walk to school.  She had to walk to her elementary school.  And then when she finally went to the Lincoln Normal School, which was further into Marion, Alabama, eleven miles away. They, they had to board there because there was not you know, that transportation.  And this school was founded by missionaries.  And that was the first place where the whole world of social consciousness was awakened in, in my mother and her sister.  But--and a lot of people took interest in them.  This is where my mother's gifts of music further developed.  As a kid, my mother actually was over the youth choir at her church.  She played the piano, sang obviously, and she learned to play other instruments in high school.  There were missionaries--some of the teachers that came in, one in particular that really took to her that remained family friends as a matter of fact.  To this day we are family--we're still family friends with the grandchildren of Fran Thomas and I--I'm trying to remember Fran's--Cecil, Fran and Cecil Thomas.  Both of them were teachers there that really wrapped their arms around my mother and her sister Edythe.  And taught my mother how to play the trumpet, and some other things.  And so yes, education was a--was a high priority.  So much so that my grandmother eventually, Bernice Scott [Bernice McMurray Scott], eventually started driving--they turned the truck into like a bus to transport the kids to school.
Speaker 1: What about--your mother has a brother.
Speaker 2: Brother, Obie Scott [Obie Leonard Scott].  All three of the--of my grandparents' children, Obie, Edythe and my mother Coretta [Coretta Scott King], all college educated.  In spite of the fact that both of my grandparents only had an elementary school education.  So you could see how important education was.  You know, they tied education to success, to liberation, to freedom.
Story_ID: 482295
Speaker 1: What was your relationship like with your mother [Coretta Scott King]?
Speaker 2: My mo- my relationship evolved over the years because when I was five my father [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated in 1968, April 4th.  And this caused a shift in the household.  So my mother, because of her calling to carry on my father's work and to institutionalize his legacy in the King Ce- into the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change [Atlanta, Georgia].  And to creating a national holiday in his honor, the King Holiday [Martin Luther King, Jr. Day] which is the third Monday in January every year.  She had to travel a lot.  She had to be away from home a lot.  So some of the things that girls do with their mothers, I didn't get to do.  I didn't get to go to the malls.  And even if I probably tried to go to the mall, we would have been bombarded because the few times when we went places, when we'd go out to dinner or as I got older and I would take her to a movie, she was just bombarded (laughter).  And there was one time I remember we did go to a mall, I was an adult then.  And people just--all kinds of people, not just black people, white people, people from Asian American background, Latino.  I mean just the whole nine.  She was just recognized everywhere she went.  And so through the years because she was away a lot and we didn't get to do as much, our relationship, it wasn't strained or anything.  It's just that I wasn't as close as perhaps I would have liked to have been.  But as I got older, especially as I got into college and then after I graduated from college in 1981, went on to a joint degree program at Emory University [Atlanta, Georgia] where I got a Doctor of Jurisprudence. Oh we--didn't want me to say all that.
Speaker 1: We--we'll come back to that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I was trying to explain the relationship.
Speaker 1: I understand, I understand (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So you just want to talk about it generally?
Speaker 1: No, we're gonna--we'll, we'll come back to that.
Story_ID: 482296
Speaker 1: One thing I wanted to go back because you said your mother [Coretta Scott King] did go to college.  What college did she go to?
Speaker 2: My mother went to Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio.  And the founder, Horace Mann.  On the campus there is a bust there, and it says, be ashamed to die until you've won some victory for humanity.  That was his, his quote as the first president there.  And that impacted her so greatly she understood her call to serve hu- humanity.
Speaker 1: And her, her music.  Tell me about her music as she got older and, and went into college.
Speaker 2: She actually--when she went into college, her major was elementary education.  And so she faced some discriminatory situation there where she could not teach in the Yellow Springs district.  She wanted to do her student teaching and they would not let her do it.  She was very troubled by that.  And I think that resonated with her later on when she connected with my father [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and they started--became a part of the leadership of the movement.  It was when she--it was in college where she had an opportunity to meet Paul Robeson.  And I think his comment to her about her voice and her singing really further stimulated her to pursue her, her, her musical career even further.  And--'cause she got to tour with him when he came to the school.  She went on to the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, Massachusetts.  And there is where she, you know, further developed her, her interest in music.  Her, her desire was to be a concert singer.  And she--I'm trying to remember her degree was in--I think it was music education and voice.
Speaker 1: But eventually she would become a teacher?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  Actually my mother, she did student teaching.  When she graduated from New England, of course she met my father while she was in Boston.  So everything kind of shifted for her (laughter).
Speaker 1: You alluded to the fact that she wanted to teach in a certain county and she wasn't allowed to.
Speaker 2: In Yellow Springs, the same place where Antioch was located.
Speaker 1: Tell me more about that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So she had to go to the black school district.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And do her student teaching to meet her requirements.
Speaker 1: They wouldn't allow her to work in the white school.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Story_ID: 482297
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your dad.  Tell me his name and spell it for me please.
Speaker 2: My father's name is Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And the first name is M-A-R-T-I-N, middle name L-U-T-H-E-R, and last name K-I-N-G, and of course a comma and the capital J-R or it's capital J, small R, period.
Speaker 1: When was he born?
Speaker 2: My father was born in 1929, the same year as the Great Depression.
Speaker 1: And tell me any stories that he might have--well you were very young.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, I was very young and I really didn't know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well stories that someone else might have told you about your father's growing up.
Speaker 2: Oh I know many stories about my father's growing up.  My father was a very ambitious young child.  He was precocious, he, he enjoyed keeping books around him, he read a lot.  He started reciting scripture at five.  In fact, he used to read the dictionary.  When he was a young child, between the ages of one and five, he had a white playmate that was the, the son of the proprietor of the store across the street from where he lived.  And he often would go over and play with his playmate.  And when it came time for him to enter into elementary school at the age of six, both of them, he went to the all-black school, his white playmate went to the all-white school.  So he went over to play with him one day and he was told that they could no longer play together because he's colored and you know the, the playmate is white, he was told by the mother.  Of course this destroyed my father.  Because he knew nothing about segregation, differences or anything at that point.  And it's kind of strange, I'm playing with you and all of a sudden there's this separation.  So this must have been around right around 1935.  My father ran home and that's where he received his first lesson on my grandmother, Alberta Williams King.  And I can spell her name, A-L-B-E-R-T-A, and her maiden name, Williams, W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S, and then married name King, K-I-N-G.  She explained to him the lessons of segregation and what was going on in the culture, and reminded him you're just as good as anyone.  Of course he was crying from that incident.
Story_ID: 482298
Speaker 1: So you were sharing stories about your father [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] growing up.  Where did they live?  Where did his family live?
Speaker 2: My father's family lived in a community in Atlanta [Georgia] called the Sweet Auburn district [Sweet Auburn Historic District], Auburn Avenue.  And it was a big, thriving street economically in terms of business for African Americans.  There was some of the first banks, I don't want to say banks, it was one of the first banks located there, Citizens Trust Bank, Atlanta Life Insurance Companies [Atlanta Life Insurance Company; Atlanta Life Financial Group, Atlanta, Georgia], one of the first African American owned insurance company.  There were real estate companies.  It was just a big business thriving, black business thriving street.  And that was on one end, and the other end were you know, pretty much residential community, middle class, actually.  So my father grew up in a middle class setting and my, my mother [Coretta Scott King] more so in a rural, working class environment.
Speaker 1: So during this time on Auburn, there were white proprietors on that, on Auburn Avenue?
Speaker 2: I'm not familiar with there being, it's not known for that.  I mean it's known for--I mean when we talk about Auburn, Auburn was the street where a lot of black businesses were located because they could not be on Peachtree [Street], which was the main thoroughfare where all of the white businesses were located.  So they set up shop on Auburn Avenue.
Story_ID: 482299
Speaker 1: So you were telling us about the story about your father [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] first learning about segregation from your grandmother [Alberta Williams King].
Speaker 2: Right.  That was--that was one of the incidences with the playmate.  His--some other encounters that he had, he was spending time with my grandfather, Martin Luther King, Sr. [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] and two occasions in particular that have been shared with me and that I've read about.  One was when my grandfather went to a store, a shoe store and it was basically empty, nobody was in there.  And he sat down in the--in the front, wanted to be served.  And the lady said if you go in the back, I can serve you.  And he said I'm not going in the back.  If I can't be served here, then I'll just leave.  And of course that's what he did, he left 'cause she said she could not do it.  So he left.  He said I don't care how long I have to live with this, I'm not going to accept it.  So these are messages that are going into my father's head to prepare him later to be the, the leader of the Civil Rights Movement.  The other incident is, he was riding with my grandfather in a car and the police pulled him over, I guess for maybe speeding.  And the police came up to the car and said, "Boy let me see your license."  And my grandfather, he was a robust man, he took his finger and he said, "You see this child here?"  He said, "That's a boy, I'm a man."  And the story is that the police officer just, you know, nervously wrote up the ticket and, and just gave it to him and just rushed off.  Um, because again, my grandfather was just determined not to accept this, this desegregation practices.  Another incident with my father, I want to say he must have been somewhere between nine and eleven years of age.  He participated in an oratory cos- oratory contest sponsored by the Elks in Valdosta, Georgia.  And he went down there and did very well.  He came in second place, he was awarded.  The irony is here he was awarded in a competition where, you know, even other races were involved, and on the way back home, they rode the bus back up to Atlanta [Georgia], because of the segregation laws that separated blacks and whites and there was certain sections on the buses where blacks sat and whites sat.  Because there were no seats in the black section, he had to stand up all the way back.  Even though there were other seats in the section where whites sat.  And so this early, this incident is one of the things that caused him to entertain or wrestle with, you know, whether he would ultimately hate white people, which we know he never did.  But it pushed him almost in that direction.  Because you know the pride of winning this contest and then you're reminded that you're still--you're still black or colored or Negro at that time.
Story_ID: 482300
Speaker 1: Tell me about his parents.  What were their names?
Speaker 2: Martin Luther King Sr. [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] is his father and the same spelling is--do I need to spell it again?  As my father, but senior, S-R.  And his mother was Alberta, A-L-B-E-R-T-A Williams, W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S, King [Alberta Williams King].
Speaker 1: Tell me about them.  Well let me ask you about your grandfather.  Was his name always Martin Luther King, Sr.?
Speaker 2: No, it used to be Michael King.  I'm not clear on the story.  I've been trying to get this story straight as to when the name switched to Martin Luther King, and whether it switched before my father [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Sr.] was born or after my father--my understanding is it switched in my father's lifetime.  Because--and I haven't seen the birth certificate yet because apparently the birth certificate of my father may still say Michael Luther King.  But they, they switched the name and some kind of way it was to be similar, it was--it was behind Martin Luther.  But I'm not sure (laughter) when all of that--so he was known as Big Mike.  And the reason I say it had to be during my father's lifetime that the name was changed because why would you call him Big Mike even if he was big?  But I think it had a lot--because my father was also referred to as, as Little Mike.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the times that you spent with your grandparents.
Speaker 2: With Martin Luther King, Sr. and Alberta King?  I used to--when my mother [Coretta Scott King] was away traveling, carrying the message of my father, trying to build interest and, and generate interest in King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia] because she was raising monies to, to build The King Center in Atlanta [Georgia].  I would often stay with my father's sister, [HistoryMaker] Christine King Farris.  Her first name really is Willie (laughter), which is W-I-L-L-I-E, Christine, C-H-R-I-S-T-I-N-E, King, K-I-N-G.  And then when she got married, Farris, F-A-R-R-I-S.  This is my father's only sister.  He had one sister that was older than him, she was born in 1927, which is the same year my mother was born, 1927.  And her brother A.D. King, which Alfred, A-L-F-R-E-D, Daniel D-A-N-I-E-L King [Alfred Daniel Williams King], was born in 1930.  Aunt Christine was, you know in, in those days, in the early days, she was kind of like another mother figure because when my mother was away, I would go stay in her home with her and, and Uncle Isaac, Isaac Farris [Isaac Farris, Sr.], I-S-A-A-C, F-A-R-R-I-S, Sr.  And I oftentimes on the weekend when we would go to church, Aunt Christine would send me and her daughter Angela [Angela Farris Watkins] to my grandparents' house because she lived in close proximity to my grandfather, Martin Luther King, Sr. and Alberta.  And so we would get--I'm trying to remember if we got dropped off, yeah we would get dropped off at his house, at their house, and we would ride with them to church.  And I remember my, my grandmother was somewhat of a reserved woman, somewhat like I am as a matter of fact.  She, she didn't talk a lot but when she did speak, you know, these words of wisdom would come out of her, her mouth.  And I remember just ri- riding to church with them quite often and just observing the relationship between them.  They were a very loving couple.  And she was very supportive of him in ministry.  He was the pastor of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia].  He became the pastor after her, her father, Alberta's father, who is my grandmother, her father, my great-grandfather A.D. Williams King [sic.], and that's Adam after Adam in the Bible, A-D-A-M Daniel, D-A-N-I-E-L, A.D. Williams [Adam Daniel Williams].  He was the pastor of Ebenezer, the second pastor.  He pastored there for thirty-seven years.  He passed I believe in 19--I want to say 1930, was it '31 [1931] I believe?  And that's when Daddy King, my grandfather, my father's father, became the pastor.

Speaker 1: And so when we would go to church often on those Sundays, she [King's paternal grandmother, Alberta Williams King] was the one who was the church organist, choir director, the minister of music.  And I remember her for two reasons (laughter).  I remember her musically, cause she had an organ in the house that she would play often.  And I remember the little threats we used to get when we used to be at her house.  She had carpet on the stairs and as little kids, you know, back in that day there's not technology, you know.  We didn't have PSP [PlayStation Portable] and all of that kind of stuff, Wii and all that.  We had to find ways to have fun.  And so we used to get at the top of her stairs (cough), excuse me.  We would get at the top of her stairs, sit down and slide down.  Bump from stair to stair.  And she had this big, thick pad it was called heat for the seat.  She said, "If you all don't stop," I forget how she said it, "If you all don't stop playing on those steps like that, I'm gone apply this heat to your seat."  (Laughter) We never got it applied.  Some kind of way we were able to sneak and do it and I don't know if she just forgot and we would giggle and then pass by.  But I just remember that paddle because I did not want it on my (laughter) backside.
Story_ID: 482302
Speaker 1: But those are some of the stories.  I didn't have as much time with her [King's paternal grandmother, Alberta Williams King].  She was killed in 1974 while she was playing the organ at church, at Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia].  She was playing 'The Lord's Prayer,' a song called 'The Lord's Prayer' based off the prayer that Jesus taught his disciples to pray.  And I was--me, my sister Yolanda [Yolanda King], Y-O-L-A-N-D-A and middle name Denise, D-E-N-I-S-E.  Me and Yolanda, I don't know who else drove up to the church that particular Sunday, July- excuse me, June 30th, 1974, and I would have been eleven then.  We drove up to the church and noticed there was an ambulance outside of the church.  And a deacon came up to the car and said, "You all need to go to Grady Hospital [Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia] 'cause your grandmother was shot today."  And so we proceeded to Grady Hospital here in Atlanta [Georgia].  And of course by the time we got there, within probably twenty to thirty minutes the doctor came in and said she had, she had died.  A deranged gentleman, a young man, his early twenties, actually he said he was on assignment from God.  So his mind was very confused and he had a list of people.  In fact Aretha Franklin, Queen of Soul was on that list of people that he was to kill.  He came to kill my grandfather [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.].  What happened is my grandfather as most preachers do, don't always come in 'til the first part of the service.  But my grandmother was over playing the organ.  Now I don't know if he knew the connection.  We're assuming he didn't know.  It was just coinciden- or he read a notice that she was, you know, the wife.  But my grandfather was actually walking into the church at the time that she was playing 'The Lord's Prayer' and this shooting, you know, began.  And a bullet went into her and into a few other people.  And she was lying there in this blood and my grandfather wanted to rush over, but everybody pulled him because he was still in the church, the shooter, you know, shooting.  And of course he could not go over.  That was very awkward I guess for her husband.  And so long story short, you know, we lost her in 1974.  So I didn't, I didn't get to grow to know her, other than those eleven years.
Speaker 2: When you drove up to the church, who was in the car with you?  Who was driving?
Speaker 1: My sister Yolanda.
Speaker 2: Who was driving?
Speaker 1: Yolanda, she was older because back then I think you could drive at sixteen.  And my sister was like seven, eight years older than me.  So I was eleven, so she was probably about seventeen or eighteen.
Speaker 2: Where were your parents?
Speaker 1: My mother [Coretta Scott King].  Course my father [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated in '68 [1968], this was '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: Oh, 1974, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: My mother was in Chicago [Illinois].  And this is the very strange thing that happened that day.  My mother, when she was out of town, her statement to her staff people and everybody was, "Wherever I am in this world, when my children call, they are my first priority.  You know I must speak to them."  And so she stayed in touch with the house.  She, she told us she would call us to wake us up that Sunday morning.  She was late calling.  But it was a blessing, 'cause we would have been in the church when the shooting took place.  And perhaps I would have been a very devastated child witnessing that after hearing, you know, about your father being assassinated, your uncle [Alfred Daniel Williams King] we'll talk about later drowning, and now your grandmother getting shot in church.  So I think it was a protection for me that God allowed her not to wake us up on time.  So that's what happened.  She called from Chicago and we got there late as the ambulance was pulling up.
Story_ID: 482303
Speaker 1: What did you feel about that?  About your [paternal] grandmother [Alberta Williams King] now being, being gone?
Speaker 2: Well I mean I spent a great deal of time in my childhood trying to understand what was going on with all of these deaths.  'Cause we had a lot--for me very traumatic deaths at young ages, started at five for me.  Then my uncle who drowned, my Uncle A.D., Alfred Daniel King [Alfred Daniel Williams King] who drowned when I was six.  We went on vacation in July of 1969, a year and three months after my father [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated, or two months, no, three months.  And he taught me how to swim while I was there.  My uncle threw me in the pool and said, "Look, you swim or you gonna die."  So I did what I saw dogs do.  I started beating the water.  Dog paddling as we call it, and made my way back to the edge of the pool.  He left and said he was going home and he was gonna have a welcome home party for all of us.  He had just--they had just put in a new pool.  And he was gonna have a party at the pool, et cetera.  Well we got word I believe on the day that we were leaving that he had drowned early in the morning.  And my mother [Coretta Scott King] said I blurted out, "I'm not going to any more funerals."  So obviously for me five and then six, and then my grandmother getting killed at eleven, I'm like what is going on?  I was very confused.  Very scared and very confused.  And in a sense became very withdrawn and afraid to live.  Because it seemed like in my mind as I got older and I looked back on things, it seemed like every time I was enjoying life, something would come and take away somebody.  And so it would shut me down.  And that, that's the real, the traumatic impact that it had on me for years.
Speaker 1: We're going to talk about--more about that as we go forward and you get older.
Story_ID: 482304
Speaker 1: But let's go back to your, your father's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] life and growing up.  Tell me about his schooling and what his parents' philosophy about education.
Speaker 2: Well my, my grandfather Martin Luther King, Sr. [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], was from Stockbridge, Georgia, which is maybe about an hour and a half or so, about, maybe fifty miles from Atlanta [Georgia].  And--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: We were talking about your grandparents and their education and then your father's education.
Speaker 1: Both of my father's parents, Martin Luther King, Sr. and Alberta Williams King, were college educated.  It took my grandfather a little while because he--when he left Stockbridge, Georgia at age sixteen and he came to Atlanta, he had to kind of finish up his high schooling credentials and entered into college at a very late age, at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And graduated, I think he was in his late twenties when he finally graduated from Morehouse.  And my grandmother Alberta, she graduated from Spelman at the time, it's Spelman College today for women.  But at that time it was called Spelman Seminary [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And so both of them were college educated.  She went on to Hampton Normal and Industrial Institute [Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute] which is Hampton University today in Hampton, Virginia.  And ended up getting a teaching certificate.  She went there to teach and got her teaching certificate.  And when she came back is when they connected and married.  My father was--he was awarded the highest degree, a Ph.D., he's a graduate degree.  Went to Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia at the age of fifteen.  He skipped the ninth grade.  He took an entrance test, an early entrance test and was able to get into Morehouse in the eleventh grade, so he was fifteen at the time.  So he went to Morehouse, got his undergraduate degree in sociology.  And left there to go to seminary and went to Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania [Upland, Pennsylvania].  And he stayed there for three years.  When he graduated from Morehouse, he graduated as a C student.  When he graduated from seminary, he was valedictorian.  When he left Crozer, he went on to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] where he got a doctoral degree in systematic theology, Ph.D. degree.
Story_ID: 482305
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother [Coretta Scott King] and father [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] met?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Both of them were in Boston [Massachusetts].  They'd both left the South.  And decided to go to schools in the North because they had lived under the conditions of the South for so long, they wanted to give it an opportunity to see what it was like in the North.  So my father was at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] working on his Ph.D. degree, and my mother was working on her--they didn't call it a master's degree at the time, but it was some kind of advanced I guess bachelor's degree in voice and music education.  There was a friend that they had in common, her name is Mary Powell [Mary Stamper Powell].  And my father was inquiring about, you know some nice girls that he could meet, 'cause he had met all of them.  And initially Mary Powell said well, I'm not sure if I know.  And then finally she said oh, there is one girl, two girls.  And one of them that he mentioned, she mentioned, he said I already know her.  He hadn't met my mother, of course.  So she was able to connect the two.  She talked to my mother about him, about my father, and got permission to give the number to my father.  My father called my mother (laughter).  And he was a very charming young man, and they talked briefly.  And there's a story and I don't remember exactly, but he said, "Every Napoleon [Napoleon Bonaparte] has their Waterloo [Battle of Waterloo] and I'm at my Waterloo," speaking of her.  And, you know, asked if they could meet, when they could meet.  They didn't call it for a date, I don't know what they called it back then, but if they could get together and meet and talk.  So she found a space on her schedule and of course his voice, he had a pretty deep voice, very articulate gentleman.  And it was the kind of voice, baritone voice that you would think that when you see this person, he would be a very tall man.  So the story is told that they get off the phone after making arrangements to meet the next day between her break, twelve and one, and they went to eat at a restaurant.  And he pulls up in his car and gets out.  (Laughter) And she says to herself how short he is and how unimpressive he looks.  (Laughter) Oh, boy, and so it's funny because my mother's father [Obie Scott] was only 5'7", my dad was about 5'7".  So I don't know, I don't know where she got that from.  I think in her mind she had an image of, because of the voice and maybe because she desired to be with a taller man.  So they went out and of course you know, he was very articulate, very intelligent, was able to talk about a lot of different things, was, was even versed in the kind of music she loved, and that just fascinated her.  And as he began to talk passionately about his concerns, about his people in the South and the segregation conditions and all of that kind of stuff, it resonated with her because she had a similar concern.  And she said as he talked, he grew in stature.  So it was like even though he was a short man, his charisma overwhelmed all of that.
Story_ID: 482306
Speaker 1: And they went on and as she talked, he got to know, he realized that this was a woman who knew more than just music, that she was very socially conscious.  And it fascinated him.  So at the end of the conversation, he said, "You know there's four things I'm looking for in a wife, and you have all four of those qualities."  And I can't remember all of them, character, personality, intelligence, it was four things.  And she said, he said, "You have all four of them."  Now of course for her it was like wow, this man is already you know, identified me as his wife (laughter) on the first date.  And the rest of course is history.  But it took some time for her, 'cause she had to get through that initial look.  But then she was very attracted to him.  But the, the struggle was she did not want to lose her career.  You know, she was very intent and very focused on developing this music career and becoming a classical concert singer, and felt that this would shortchange her.  So she went back and forth.  Eventually, she was concerned with whether or not his father, Martin Luther King, Sr. [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], would accept it.  Because he had his eyes on another woman in Atlanta [Georgia] for his son Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And she felt that you know, would Daddy King overrule what he wanted to do.  'Cause back then, you know there were relationships between fathers and sons and daughters and mothers where the children kind of respected parents' decisions in either choosing or identifying lifetime partners.  Well Martin of course Martin my father, you know, was an independent thinker.  And he very much respected his father.  You know, he knew how to, to respectfully disagree with, with his father.  And, he chose my mother [Coretta Scott King] because he felt like she was the one.  My mother on the other hand, was concerned because she didn't feel like his family was accepting her because she was from the rural South.  She didn't come from this, you know, prestigious family and of course my father's family was very prestigious in Atlanta [Georgia] because of A.D. Williams [Alfred Daniel Williams], his mother's father being the pastor of the historic Ebenezer Church [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia], very well known church at the time, and they were activists in the community.  And Martin Luther King, Sr. had taken over.  So they were from this middle class, very well known family, cross between social activists and socialites.  And here is the rural girl, country girl from Marion, Alabama.  Where is Marion, Alabama?  Marrying their son.  You're taking the family down.  But she had a dream one day.  And in that dream my [paternal] grandfather was waving and smiling at her, and she took that as her confirmation that it was okay to marry him.  And they got married on her lawn at the house that my [maternal] grandfather [Obie Scott], the house they built after the house got burned down.  They got married on the lawn.
Story_ID: 482307
Speaker 1: You were sharing about your mother [Coretta Scott King] and her confirmation that it was okay to marry your father [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and they did get married.  But when we think about the lineage going back, your mother's family actually owned land, whereas your father's family did not.
Speaker 2: I have no knowledge at this point, of my father's family owning.  My grandfather, Martin King, Sr. [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], he was a sharecropper in Stockbridge, Georgia.  And he in fact had to leave there at sixteen because he was very smart with numbers and he saw his father getting cheated out of money when they were counting the cotton seed.  And the family, you know because they perceived my grandfather as being this smart little Negro boy, he's gonna get you in trouble, and this was James King [James Albert King] was his father, which is my great-grandfather.  And long story short, they had to kind of become like vagabonds because of the threats because my grandfather doing that, they ended up beating him, my grandfather, they beat him.  And when he told my grandmother [sic. great-grandmother] about the story and her name is King, wow, her name is Lila, it will come to me in a minute.  'Cause I'm looking at it, it's just--it's, it's slipping me.  Delia [Delia Linsey King], Delia, D-E-L-I-A, which was my grandfather, Daddy King, Martin Luther King, Sr.'s, mother, beat the, beat the gentleman (laughter).  Now here's the--Dr. King, Jr. later becomes this non- (laughter) all these ironies.  And then when the husband, cause they tried to keep it quiet 'cause they knew that James Young [sic.] had a temper, my grandfa- my great-grandfather.  So they tried to keep it quiet because if he had found out, he was going to--so he, he found out and it got even more violent.  So they had to kind of shift and move.  My grandfather eventually as a result, left Stockbridge, Georgia and so there's--on that side of the family, I'm not aware of any land ownership.  Now on the Williams' side of the family, there was obviously my great-grandfather, A.D. Williams [Alfred Daniel Williams] owned the home on Auburn Avenue.  And that home is still there today.  It's the birth home of Martin Luther King, Jr., on Auburn Avenue, and it's a tourist attraction.  So in terms of that, that kind of land ownership, but that home is no longer owned by the family.  It's owned by The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: So I just want to get the names straight for the record.  Martin Luther King, Sr., his father was James King.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And Delia King was his mother (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) His wife.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, his wife.  And do you know how many brothers and sisters he had?
Speaker 2: Martin Luther King, Sr.?  I think it was nine.  It's nine of them in total.
Speaker 1: Total, yeah.  An- but he was the oldest.
Speaker 2: My grandfather had nine, nine of them in total.  And, and my grandfather was, yeah, no, he was not the oldest, he was the second oldest.  Woodie was the oldest, Woodie King [Woodie King Brown] his sister was the oldest.  He was the second oldest.  He was the oldest boy.
Story_ID: 482308
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's go back to the wedding on the lawn.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Tell me what else do you know about that?  Or what happens in their life after that?
Speaker 2: After the wedding or--
Speaker 1: After they get married, where did they live?
Speaker 2: Well you know the funny story is that they spent their honeymoon in a funeral parlor.  Upstairs of a funeral (laughter).  That was so funny, my mother [Coretta Scott King] telling that story.
Speaker 1: How did that happen?
Speaker 2: Well there was a friend in town who, who owned the funeral parlor.  And because they, they were trying--they were in the midst of doing summer work, summer studies and all that kind of stuff.  They didn't do their honeymoon until I think two, three, five years later.  Because they were just trying to finish some things, and they didn't have time to get away, and probably did not have the money to do it.  So there was a room there (laughter) at the funeral parlor.  There was no hotel at that time, and that's where they stayed in Ma- right in Marion, Alabama, in the town.  Very interesting.
Story_ID: 482309
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now was your mother [Coretta Scott King] already involved in, in socia- civil rights types of things that were going on before she met your father [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Yes she was.  She was actually involved in the peace movement very early on.  And participated in a lot of peace rallies, and she--I can't remember the name of--I think she was connected to at one point when she was in college, I want to say the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], but yeah she was, she was, she was somewhat of an activist early on in her life before she even met my father.
Speaker 1: And tell me the year that they got married.
Speaker 2: They got married in June of 1953, June, I want to say 18th, June 18th, 1953.
Story_ID: 482310
Speaker 1: When you look back and you think about when you were very young and where you were living when your mother [Coretta Scott King] and father [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] have children.  Tell me about your, your siblings and tell me their birth order and where you fit in.  I know that you're the youngest.
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm the youngest.  My sister Yolanda Denise [Yolanda King] came, was born in 1955 just before the, the incident that started the, the Civil Rights Movement in the 20th century.  That movement started December 1st, 1955, and it was when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a segregated bus.  She was sitting in the, in the white section and she refused to give up her seat to a white gentleman.  And the bus driver, you know, insisted that she do it and she didn't.  So she was arrested and this stirred you know, some boycott.  It stirred some organization and eventually a boycott that led to some ongoing demonstrations around the South to change the segregated conditions.  But Yolanda was born November 17th, 1955, so just about two and a half weeks, two weeks or so before that.  Martin, II was born--Martin Luther King III was born October 23rd, 1957, and then Dexter Scott King [Dexter King], D-E-X-T-E-R, middle name Scott like my mother's last name, King.  He was named after the first church that my father pastored in Montgomery, Alabama, Dexter Avenue Baptist Church [Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church].  He was born January 30th, 1961, and of course I was born in 1963, March 28th, that was a very famous year (laughter).
Story_ID: 482311
Speaker 1: Tell me about your siblings.  Tell me about Yolanda [Yolanda King].
Speaker 2: Well my sister Yolanda is now deceased.  She passed May 15th, 2007 from congestive heart failure.  And she was an actress from the womb (laughter).  She came out acting.  She used to make us do plays all the time.  I mean she, she forced us to, to be her, you know, experiments.  She put us in these roles and we'd have to play them out.  And I remember one occasion I had to, Dexter [Dexter King] had to kiss me, I was Sleeping Beauty.  It was just terrible (laughter).  So from a child she was directing and writing and eventually became an actress and did a lot of stage productions, some of which she incorporated my father's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] words and work into something that could parallel with issues of our time and presented a production from that.  She had cameo roles in a lot of different television movies.  As a matter of fact, she was in 'JAG' one time.  She did a lot of speaking around the nation and had a real, a cry for world peace and spent a lot of her latter years involved in different peace circles.  Martin the III [Martin Luther King III], Yolanda also, just so you'll know, she ended up--she had a master's of fine arts.
Speaker 1: What school did she attend?
Speaker 2: She attended first Smith College [Northampton, Massachusetts] and graduated from there.  I can't remember what her major was at Smith, it may have been drama, but I'm not sure.  And she went on to attend New York University [New York, New York].
Story_ID: 482312
Speaker 1: Martin, III [Martin Luther King III] graduated from Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] in 1979, and he was a political science major.  He early on was very drawn to politics and ended up serving some time on the Fulton County commission [Fulton County Board of Commissioners] here in Atlanta, Georgia.  He--his passion and love has been for a lot of the social issues, in particular poverty.  And he's been a champion of that for, for years.  He served for a few years as the president of the same organization that my father [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was the first president and founder of, which was the Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC].  That was the organization that--not spearheaded the movement because when the movement first started in 1955, the organization that spearheaded was called the Montgomery Improvement Association.  But the spinoff later, I won't even call it the spinoff 'cause the Montgomery Improvement Association continued to exist.  My father and them organized a group of ministers together and created the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and it was officially, it was announced in Atlanta [Georgia], but it was officially founded in New Orleans, Louisiana.  So that was the organization that was the organizing entity for all the rest of the demonstrations throughout the remaining '50s [1950s] and the '60s [1960s].  He became president of that organization and I can't remember the exact year.  I think it was somewhere around 1997.  And it was a lot of tension because a lot of old heads still a part of the board of the SCLC, and they still have, you know, some of their old thinking caps on.  So it was a lot of tension and conflict.  There was some things that Martin wanted to move in, bringing even in younger staff people.  And you know just a lot of resistance.  So the marriage was not a very, a good marriage.  And so eventually he, he resigned.  At one point they were trying to kick him out.  It just went back and forth and back and forth.  And he resigned there and he ended up at The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia] as the president and CEO there for about a year and a half.  Yeah, about a year, maybe a year and nine months.  He's currently the president of Realizing the Dream [Realizing the Dream, Inc.].  It's an organization he started, a nonprofit that focuses on the issues of poverty, nonviolence conflict resolution training, and economic development.  His, his primary focus right now is around the issue of poverty.  In 1968, which would have been forty years ago, my father initiated the Poor People's Campaign.  He had begun in the mid-'60s [1960s] to begin to focus on issues of economic injustice and so this Poor People's Campaign was launched in 1968 where he was bringing poor people from across the world, nation excuse me, to converge on Washington, D.C. to deal with issues such as income, healthcare, housing.  Having a, not just any kind of income, but having, not even--I don't even think they called it livable wages.  They called it a guaranteed annual income.  And decent and affordable housing.  And these same issues that are still with us today, Martin took on the task of going back to some of the similar communities my father visited around the nation.  From some of the reservations, Native American, to the barrios, to the rural areas, and just listening to, the same thing my father did, to hear about the issues in that community.  The issues of poverty.  And then putting together a whole guide and going to have a, at some point, a town hall meeting to bring out these issues and then move towards trying to bring in the resources to uplift that community.  And so he's been spending a lot of time with that.
Story_ID: 482313
Speaker 1: Dexter Scott King [Dexter King], who is a couple of years older than I am, is--spent several years as the president, CEO and chairman of The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia] after my mother [Coretta Scott King] retired in 1993, I think it was the year when she officially retired.  And he's been in the role of chair since 2004.  Dexter's more reserved.  He's--he doesn't do the public speaking.  Yolanda [Yolanda King] did public speaking, Martin [Martin Luther King III] still does, and I do public speaking.  Dexter's never been comfortable doing that.  And my mother used to tell us whatever you do, do it well, do it to be your best self.  And he just did not feel that this was his cup of tea.  A lot of people feel like, well how come he's not speaking?  He's just--that's just not who he is.  He's more behind the scenes, background type who has this mind of business and is always seeing these ideas.  So that's where he is today.  Now he did not graduate from college.  He's the only one that did not graduate from college, but is very brilliant.  But it just wasn't his cup of tea.  And he's written about a lot of these experiences in his book, 'Growing up King' ['Growing up King: An Intimate Memoir,' Dexter Scott King] and some issues of not being able to sit in a classroom setting, you know, probably some ADD [attention deficit disorder; attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder] that set in.  He's one that probably required a little more nontraditional learning.  But I can say--I want to share this story about him because it's really funny.  When we were, I guess I must have been about fifteen or sixteen, Dexter worked in a funeral home.  The same funeral home that handled my father's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] arrangements.  He used to come home at like five, six o'clock in the morning, cause he worked at night.  And the stories he would share with us (laughter).  I mean I could not believe it.  Now you know you coming home sharing these stories and we're still kind of just getting out of our sleep, you know.  And it was just, it was--some of it was, was funny, but scary.  'Cause I didn't know all these things (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What were some of them?
Speaker 1: I didn't know people take these last breaths and he said one, one gentleman raised up.  It's like what?  So it was just--these really eerie stories, but they were funny because you're thinking people when they die, they're gone.  There's nothing else left there.  And it was just interesting hearing some of those stories.  And then one--he also worked for the corrections department in Atlanta [Georgia], and people thought that was very strange for the son of the nonviolent proponent to be carrying a gun only because we don't believe in guns in our family.  And you know, he had to carry this weapon.  And again, my mother, you know, she taught us certain things, but she also allowed us to make our own decisions and work through some things.  So one time he had to arrest this gentleman.  And the guy, he, he, he, he just--he was on some kind of medication and he just lost it and ended up biting Dexter's finger, and he had to have surgery on it.  But he just turned into this animal.  But he used to tell all these stories about the, the inmates cause they'd say, "You that King guy, ain't you?"  And they say, "I know you gonna treat us right" (laughter).  They tried to play off of that, you know, cause you know your dad was so nice and he, he cared about the least of these and folks in our condition.  I know you not gonna come in here, you know, all difficult.

Speaker 1: What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory.  I would have to say I don't remember it as a story per se, but--and how do you know if it's your earliest, I mean, you could have been at age four (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well what do you remember?  What, what do you remember at a very young age that comes to your mind?  Doesn't have to be a story, just something--
Speaker 2: I remember going to University Homes nursery, which is located right next to the Clark Atlanta University campus [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  And there's a housing project there, it was called University Homes [Atlanta, Georgia], and there was a nursery in the basement of one of the sections.  We used to have these Mayday parades and I used to love to wear the little uniforms at these little--they were band like uniforms.  But why, the reason I loved them you know when I was a kid, the little silky smooth stuff, kind of like this material, I used to love to rub it (laughter), as a little kid.  And I seen some of the pictures from it recently, since my mother [Coretta Scott King] died I've found a lot of stuff.  I remember going there and I remember not particularly liking the food, you know, the cornbread.  That old--you know we like sweat cornbread today, a little sugar in it.  That old kind of cornbread that had no taste and it wasn't--it was kind of not, hard-hard, but it wasn't soft.
Speaker 1: Coarse.
Speaker 2: Coarse, yeah, oh, I couldn't stand that cornbread.  Then I remember going to kindergarten at Montessori school, a couple of times.  And I, I started, interestingly enough, I started going to school probably at the age of two or three.  I think kindergarten I must have been about four.  And I remember--I don't know if they call them monkey bars, but these bars that you kind of--you hang from and then you climb to the next one and the next one.  I remember going outside and doing that at kindergarten, it just stood out to me.  I enjoyed going out there doing that.  And then I remember another time that my mother [Coretta Scott King] had visited India and she brought me back some clothes and I wore them to school and I had this red dot on my, on my head.  And all the kids were like, "What is that?"  You know and I tried to explain to them about the tradition and the customs in India with the red dots. And so, I, I do remember that.
Story_ID: 482315
Speaker 1: And the thing that I probably remember and cherish the most is--and I don't know how far back I remember, but when my father [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] used to come home off of the road, he loved to play with us, the children.  And my mother [Coretta Scott King] was a little frightened for us because the kind of stuff he would do was a little dare devilish.  One of the things I would do is I would run up into his arms and he'd say, "Okay we're going to play the kissing game today."  And each one of us had a spot.  So he'd say, "Okay, where is Dexter's [Dexter King] spot?"  So I would kiss him on Dexter's spot.  And then he'd say, "Where is Martin [Martin Luther King III]--" Marty was his name at the time.  We don't call him that today.  He gets upset if you call him Marty.  So I'm saying that on this camera.  Do not call him Marty.  He will let you know it's Martin today.  But back then it was Marty.  "Where's Marty's spot?  And where is Yoki's [Yolanda King] spot?"  And then he would do mine and mom's.  And I'm trying to remember my spot.  I remember, I heard somebody tell it a different way, but I'm telling you what I remember as an impression in my mind, is that my spot was on the forehead.  Martin and Dexter's was on either cheek.  Yolanda's was on the side over here of the mouth, and then my mother's obviously was the center of the mouth.  That's what I remember.  But I'm also told that my father--and this is true, it's not that I'm told like it's not true.  But he used to put all of us up on the refrigerator and have us to jump down in his arms.  And my mother was just--that's the one I said she was just so afraid for us.  But we didn't have a care in the world because we felt that our father was going to catch us in his arms and that we were safe and secure.  And Yolanda tells the story that she used to get so jealous because she got too big to do it.  So when I came along (laughter), I took over everybody's spot (laughter).  And I would jump down into his arms.
Story_ID: 482316
Speaker 1: What other times do you remember spending with your father [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]?  What do you remember about your father?
Speaker 2: Nothing.  Everything is told to me. Yeah, It's not that it's probably not there, it's just I probably went into shock when he got killed, that I, I've never been able to recall anything.  I mean they tell me stuff all the time.  They say, "You don't remember that?" (Shakes head) I don't remember any of it.
Speaker 1: Do you remember them telling you that he had been shot?
Speaker 2: I remember my mother [Coretta Scott King] telling me just shortly before I would see him that he wouldn't be able to talk to me, you know.  That your, your father's--I think she said he was killed or he was--no she didn't say he was killed.  She said, "Your father is dead and he's gone to live with God."  Of course I didn't know what that meant.  And you know, a little child like me, like how's he gonna eat?  So I asked little questions like that.  And she didn't know, she didn't really know how to answer them other than you know, God's gonna take care of that.  And he won't be able to speak to you.  And so you know, eventually she would just say--put her arms around me and say, "Mommy loves you."  'Cause she couldn't answer some of the questions.
Story_ID: 482317
Speaker 1: So when, when we first went to the airport to receive his [King's father, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], his remains, I remember going up on the plane and when I got in the plane I heard this, this sound like a wind.  And I asked, I told my mom [Coretta Scott King], I said, "He's breathing back there."  And she said, "No, that's the plane."  Now I don't know where I got that from, but in my mind it was him breathing.  And then when we finally went to the funeral home, my silly brothers [Martin Luther King III and Dexter King].  We went in, my father was on one side and there was this other woman.  And this other woman apparently, back then they used to put pennies in your eyes to close them.  I don't know if you know about that.  But this woman, some kind of way she blinked or something, something happened.  And it frightened everybody and they ran and left me down there, and I was so terrified.  But you know, again, I was keeping all this stuff in my head.  And when we got to the funeral on Tuesday the 9th of April, '68, 1968, my mother had decided to allow my father to preach his own eulogy.  Because the--two months prior to his assassination on February 4th, '68 [1968], he preached at Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] a sermon called The Drum Major Instinct.  And in that sermon near the end, he talked about if any of you are around when I have to meet my day, tell them I don't want a long funeral.  Tell them not to talk too long.  And if you get somebody to do the eulogy, he went on and on, you know, tell them not to talk about all of the degrees I have and, you know, all of that kind of stuff.  And I just want to be remembered as being a drum major for justice, freedom and all the other shallow things don't matter, and all that kind of stuff.  So as soon as they started playing his voice, now I was asleep, basically off and on during the funeral.  I was hot.  I saw all these lights and, you know, cameras and you know, I'm looking around and all these people.  So I go in and out of sleep, and then all of a sudden his voice comes through the speaker, and I'm sitting up there, you know, like and I look at the casket like he's going to come out of it, looking for him.  'Cause she told me he couldn't speak anymore when I saw him.  Well I'm five years old.  I know my father's voice by this time.  And I'm thinking wait a minute, where is he?  So I was very confused.  And even to this day, it's an issue, this whole death thing and completion of it because that was embedded in my psyche.
Story_ID: 482318
Speaker 1: So life without your father [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr].  By this time you're--because you had been going to nursery school and Montessori school, you were not yet in kindergarten.  Is that right?
Speaker 2: No, I was in kindergarten.
Speaker 1: You were in kindergarten.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started kindergarten at four.  He was five when he passed.  He died seven days after my birthday.  So every year if my birthday's on a Friday, I know when his death date is going to be, seven days later.  So if I'm a Friday, he's a Friday, the death date, Thursday, Thursday.
Speaker 1: So you really didn't know what to think about your father being gone.  Did you have any thoughts about that at all?
Speaker 2: No because you know, the issue was, and my father traveled a lot.  Once I was born.  The movement in '63 [1963], the year I was born, shifted to a national scale, cause that's the same year as the I Have a Dream speech, in August of that year, August 28th, which was my fifth month, I was five, I turned five months old on that day.  And--but it had started shifting two and a half weeks after I was born.  My father went to jail in Birmingham, Alabama and wrote his famous 'Letter from the Birmingham Jail' ['Letter from Birmingham Jail,' Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] on April 16th.  But when he was arrested shortly before that time was where everybody saw those water hoses and those dogs being sicced on all those young people.  And it was, you know, showcased to the whole world over television.  Or the whole nation.  And that's when the nation became more aware of what was going on in the South.  And so everything shifted to a national perspective.  So once it became more national, you know they got the (background noise).  You want me to continue?  He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, you know, that was international.  So everything was so national, so he traveled a lot.  And probably him being there it didn't--I didn't quite, I got it but I didn't get it.  And then I probably didn't fully understand Daddy because he was away a lot.  I mean I knew Daddy, a man in the house.  But I don't think I understood this whole notion of the permanency of marriage commitment, and what all that meant.  So oftentimes when men would come around, I would say to my mother [Coretta Scott King], "Can he be our daddy?" (Laughter) One time however, I was going to a dance performance, 'cause we had a lot of photographers around us during the early years of my life.  And there was one gentleman in particular that was going with us to one of the dance recitals.  And I said to my mom, I said, "You know if he goes with us, people are going to think he's my daddy."  And this was a white gentleman.  So back then it didn't--I didn't even--it didn't even phase me, it was like white, black, whatever.  Can he be my daddy?  You know.
Speaker 1: Did you wish that your mother would remarry?
Speaker 2: I think early on I don't think it was about remarrying, it was about me having a daddy.  'Cause again I didn't understand totally as a child.  So I think more importantly I just wanted a, a man in the house.  And as I got older, they claim that I didn't want my mother to get married.  I was the reason she didn't get married.  I'm like I didn't have anything to do with that.  You know, because I just, I became more possessive I guess.  And so as I began to understand who my father was, no.  Now as I got older, like into my adulthood, late twenties, then I started thinking more about her before I was thinking about me.  And I kind of wish she had male companionship, I do.  But by that time, and then at that time twenty-eight, although I was wishing it, I really began to understand her, him, their life together, and that nobody could step into that.  I mean that was, that was truly 'til death do us part.  Meaning when you die, we still--and then I die. 'Til death do us part.
Story_ID: 482319
Speaker 1: You talked about photographers always around.  What was that like for you?  Did you understand why, why (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no because to me it was, you know when you, when you're born into something, it's not new.  It's--what I mean by that is it's always been that way.  So it doesn't stand out as something different or unique.  It was normal.  So I didn't, you know and they--and my mom [Coretta Scott King] and dad [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had a way of making everybody feel a part of the family.  So many times some of these photographers, and I can't remember the one in particular, many times we referred to these people as uncle.  You know, they're males in most instances.  But friends of the family.  Like we have play uncles and aunts that are black, white and you know, Jewish.

Speaker 1: Who were some of your friends as a young child?
Speaker 2: What specific age?
Speaker 1: When you're starting, when now you're in--tell me about your elementary school.  What elementary school did you go to (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I actually attended a private school in, in Buckhead [Atlanta, Georgia], which is north of Atlanta [Georgia], called The Galloway School [Atlanta, Georgia].  It opened its doors I believe the year my father [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated, that September.  And we started attending, I started attending in '69 [1969], I think all of us did, Martin [Martin Luther King III], Dexter [Dexter King] and myself.  My sister Yolanda [Yolanda King] was already at Grady High School [Henry W. Grady High School, Atlanta, Georgia].  So my mother [Coretta Scott King] wasn't going to shift that.  And so it was in Buckhead, it was a--you were not graded by letter grades, you know it was basically pass/fail.  And you were basically--it was more like a customized curriculum, you know.  People--you could work at your own pace.  Now if you got stuck, you would be pushed of course.  But you didn't have the pressure of trying to compete with this student versus that student.  So it was a laid back environment like that.  I went there for about eight years, and then transferred to Frederick Douglass High School [Atlanta, Georgia], which is a public school here, Dexter and I transferred to Frederick Douglass.  Martin actually graduated from Galloway because by the time he started, I think he was in high school.  But a lot of my friends--I mean I had--most of my friends were boys.  I had very few girlfriends.  I was very athletic.  Everything you named, I played.  Everything, literally, before I developed things that women develop, I, I played tackle football. (Laughter) In, in the yard at home of course.  I didn't play on the team at school.  But I played soccer at elementary school.  I played on the boys team and the girls team.  That's how good I was.  I loved it so much that one time I had a cast on and I was playing goalie, and I still played in that game with my cast on. Yeah, I loved the game.  I played basketball, I played street hockey.
Story_ID: 482321
Speaker 1: I remember Claire [ph.] and Melanie [ph.] were two white girls that were my friends.  I remember Alfred Moon [ph.] was a black guy.  Joe Crowder [ph.] was a black guy.  Peter Dom [ph.], a white guy.  Devon Blom [ph.], another white guy.  Matt Martis [ph.], he and I were close in elementary school [The Galloway School, Atlanta, Georgia].  I think he had a little Native American in him, but I used to go stay at his home from time to time.  And I would have sleepovers at my home with the girls and they would come over.  And my cousin Angela [Angela Farris Watkins], we were very close when I was a kid.  This was Christine Farris' [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris], my father's sister's daughter.  And then there was [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond's children who lived down the street from us.  Julian Bond who currently is the chairman of the board of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  He had a daughter Phyllis [Phyllis Bond McMillan].  So when I had a sleepover, she would be there.  Then some of the people that were friends of my family, like the Grants, Dr. Anna Grant [Anna Harvin Grant] who used to teach I think sociology at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Her two daughters, Kim [Kimberly Grant] and Donna [Donna Grant Dunn], they would be a part of that whole posse.  Myrna Clayton, her mother Mrs. Clayton, I forget her first name.  Not [HistoryMaker] Xernona Clayton, but another Clayton, worked as a librarian and archivist at The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia] and founding early years.  Her daughter was a part of that.  So these were all my friends and, you know, we had sleepovers and went bowling, skating.  I mean we just had, we had so much fun.  I went to summer camp at the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], Olive Street YMCA off of what's now Martin Luther King Drive [Martin Luther King Jr. Drive].  It used to be Hunter Street, which is like within six, seven minutes of the house that I grew up in on Sunset Avenue in Atlanta [Georgia].  And then I had these church friends.  I mean I had a lot of friends at church.  And Stephanie Lockwood [ph.] and Edward Buggs [ph.], had a twin brother Edmond Buggs [ph.], Rodney Maxwell [ph.], trying to remember the other young lady's name.  It's slipping me, Yolanda Gordon [ph.].  I mean and some were older.  So I had younger and older friends and the same age.
Story_ID: 482322
Speaker 1: What about teachers at your school [The Galloway School, Atlanta, Georgia]?  Is there a teacher that you remember or might have influenced you in any way?
Speaker 2: I didn't have any one particular teacher that stood out as saying, you know, Bernice [HistoryMaker Bernice Albertine King] is, you know, an exceptional student.  'Cause they all kind of liked me.  You know I was pretty studious.  You know, I had good conduct.  There was one teacher, and I won't call names 'cause it's not appropriate, but there was one teacher in science that made me hate science in high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Atlanta, Georgia].  I mean after I got out of that class, I said unh-uh.  Because we had certain, we had a certain number of credits we had to get in science in order to ultimately graduate.  So I hated it so much I went to summer school and took biology in one of those short terms just to get it over with cause I was not gone take science in the regular school time.  That's how much I hated it.  She used to make me hate it. She just--her attitude and coming to class.  I mean she was just, it was just a nasty way of dealing with us, so, yeah.
Story_ID: 482323
Speaker 1: Well before we go to high school, at The Galloway School [Atlanta, Georgia], the teachers there.  Now '55 [1955] is integration into the schools.  This school is obviously--
Speaker 2: A private school.
Speaker 1: A private school, but is it--
Speaker 2: We were one of very few blacks.  It was, you know in my class it may have been four of us.
Speaker 1: And what about the teachers?
Speaker 2: I don't remember a black teacher being there at all.  At all.
Speaker 1: And so now why did you, your parents decide, or did you and your brothers decided that you would go to a public school after leaving there?
Speaker 2: My mother [Coretta Scott King] actually made the decision.  She was having some discussions around I think some challenges Dexter [Dexter King] was having at the school.  And she was talking to my Aunt Christine [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris].  And at that time, Isaac [Isaac Farris, Jr.] was at Douglass High School [Frederick Douglass High School, Atlanta, Georgia].  And Isaac and Dexter were very close.  So I think discussions led to maybe he would do better in a setting because of their friendship and connection.  And therefore made the transfer for him.  Well I didn't want to be left behind.  So just as I followed him to Galloway, I followed him over to Douglass.  And I guess my mother didn't want to have to have one child going here and one child going there, transportation-wise, convenience.  Because we had a gentleman who was like an all around person while I was growing up.  He would drive us to school.  He would fill in sometimes if the person who was cooking wasn't available.  He was a handyman, just a lot of stuff.  And so it would be very difficult for him to get Dexter to school and then get me to school.  So for convenience, we all ended up at Frederick Douglass High School.
Story_ID: 482324
Speaker 1: When you're, you're talking about the person that took care of you, took you to school and cooked.  Tell me about how your household ran because your mother [Coretta Scott King] was gone some of the time, you know doing, you know, the things that she did socially.  Tell me about your household.
Speaker 2: There were members of the church, predominantly who my mother used to supplement her time away, who babysat us.  And of course she hand picked them because she was concerned that, you know, the things that she taught us would stay on par.  And so you had Ms. Rachel Ward, Ms. Lockhart [Dorothy Lockhart], and there was one or two others that I don't remember in the younger years.  And then Marissa Neal [ph.] came later when I was like maybe third, fourth grade, all the way up 'til ninth, I think ninth or tenth grade.  And they would stay there overnight, you know.  Make sure that we followed the, the routine.  We also had tutors.  So every evening from 6:00 to 9:00, the tutors probably get there about 5:00, 5:30, and they would be there to make sure we did our homework between 6:00 and 9:00.  All three of us, Martin [Martin Luther King III], Dexter [Dexter King] and me.  Before then, we could play outside if we had extracurricular activity as I did, I had soccer and all of that.  And then we would eat dinner together around 5:30.  But between 6:00 and 9:00, we would be studying.  So Mr. Fuse, Bobby Fuse [ph.] who later became a teacher at the school, the high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Atlanta, Georgia] I went to in history.  Gordon Joyner, who was a county commissioner here, Fulton County commissioner here in Atlanta [Georgia], was one of our tutors.  And I forget the other gentleman's name, but those two stand out the most.  Another gentleman's name was Ronald [ph.], but I don't remember his last name.  And so the tutors, the babysitters (laughter), and then there was a lady who used to cook for us and clean.  She came in and did all of the cleaning, ironing, washing clothes, et cetera, so I really never washed clothes until I was well into my, probably late teenager, late teenager.
Speaker 1: You had no chores as a child (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I had chores.  I had to make up my bed of course.  I had to wash dishes after dinner, and we alternated, all of us, or vacuum the floor or sweep, whichever the case would have been and the season that we were in in terms of whether we had carpet or floor.  And empty the trash.  So those were our chores.  And then on Sunday mornings, we rotated cooking breakfast.  So we, we had a little bit in there.  She wanted to make sure we weren't totally just so taken care of that we could never take care of ourselves in life (laughter).
Story_ID: 482325
Speaker 1: Describe for me the neighborhood in which you grew up, your house.
Speaker 2: I call it the ghetto.  I mean it's Vine City [Atlanta, Georgia].  If you know anything about Vine City today, it is still a ghetto.
Speaker 1: So you, you considered it a ghetto then?
Speaker 2: I did.  Compared to Collier Heights in Atlanta [Georgia], which is where most middle class African Americans lived.  I would consider our family middle class, but we didn't live in a middle class neighborhood.  And so we lived in a working class neighborhood.  The irony is that the neighborhood we moved into was at one point the neighborhood where a lot of the teachers in AU Center [Atlanta University Center; Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] lived.  But by the time my parents bought the home there in 1965, that had begun to shift.  Now [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond did live there.  But I think and our family were probably the last two, and then there was a preacher that lived two houses up from us.  But it's, it's the serious ghetto.
Speaker 1: What's the street name?
Speaker 2: It's Sunset Avenue.  It's not like Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood [Loos Angeles, California] (laughter), nowhere near it.
Speaker 1: Well tell me about the neighborhood.  Did you--you had an opportunity to play with the kids in the neighborhood (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, we played with--I played with Tangy [ph.] and Shayman [ph.], I don't even know Shayman's real name.  That was Tangy's uncle.  And he was younger than Tangy.  And Karen Hall [ph.], Jackie Hall [ph.], more Karen was closer to my age.  Mark [ph.] and Steve Hall [ph.] were closer to my age.  I used to play basketball with them.  And then the lady who used to work for my mother [Coretta Scott King], Ms. Johnson [ph.], her son Troy Johnson [ph.] and Donna Johnson [ph.], used to play with them.  I played basketball a lot, or skated.  You know all Christmas you get these skates, metal type skates with the little key thing.  And you put your, you know you keep your shoes on and put those skates on.  We skated up and down the street.  We made little, you know, what would you call them, you sit down on them have a piece of wood and put four skates on each corner.  And you sit down and create you a little device.  And we played--next to my house is what we called an alley that's a gravel road.  And we played kickball there, softball, baseball.  I used to climb the trees.  I mean I did some of everything and you know, I did it with the kids in the neighborhood, as well as my brothers [Martin Luther King III and Dexter King].  See my sister [Yolanda King] was gone.  By the time I was nine, my sister was out, she was gone to college [Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts].  So I was left with two boys, you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 482326
Speaker 1: When you think of that time, think of a sound, a sight and a smell that would take you back to that time.
Speaker 2: All three at the same time?
Speaker 1: No, think of a sight.  And not all happening at the same time.
Speaker 2: A sight that would take me back to that time?
Speaker 1: Something that you remember seeing in the neighborhood [Vine City, Atlanta, Georgia] maybe.  A smell that--of a favorite food.  I don't know, a smell.
Speaker 2: You said in the neighborhood.  I mean I remember the smells in the house.
Speaker 1: Well in the house at that time.
Speaker 2: I remember Ms. Dowel's cooking.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So what do you want me to take you to?  To the fried chicken and all of that kind of stuff (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was just, yeah, I was just asking you--
Speaker 2: The scallop potatoes (laughter).
Speaker 1: I was just asking you, yeah a smell.  You remember that time when you, when you think of that smell, it takes you back to that house?
Speaker 2: Our house?  Yeah.  I mean I remember coming in many times and, predominantly from school, and she'd be in the kitchen cooking and you just, you know, the scent of it.  And you look forward to it.  You know she had some green beans to this day I really don't like green beans.  I don't care for them.  Will I eat them?  Of course.  But I don't care for them.  But Ms. Dowel's beans?  I have not found them like that since.
Speaker 1: And what about a sight or a sound?
Speaker 2: Well just you know--
Speaker 1: That makes you think of that time.  Doesn't have to be in the house or in the neighborhood, but just makes you think of that time.
Speaker 2: Well you know every blue moon we would hear some gunshots.  Honestly I tell you we lived in the ghetto.  People don't believe that, but we did.  So you know now, you know you do this but I've heard them before, so it's not the same as somebody like (makes sound), you know.  The kids playing in the streets is another sound.  I mean you sometimes--when I be in the house and I'd hear the noise outside, you know.  You don't hear a lot of that today.  You know, kids playing in the streets.  You usually, you know it does end up in gunshots.  So the sound of us, you know, hearing that and sometimes if I was inside and I wanted to be outside.  You know because we had to study from six to nine [o'clock].  The other kids didn't have the, the regimen that we had.  So when we had to go, we left.  But some of them would still be, you know, playing.  And then I don't know about the kind of sights.  I can tell you a funny story.  When I was about nine or ten, my sister [Yolanda King] had a wig and I got one too, an Afro wig.  Not cause I needed one, just style, fashion.  So when we would play over in the alley, kickball, baseball, it would go into the wood, the little trees, the brushes in the back.  So I would go back there to get the ball and I'd tell whoever's standing there, I'd say, "Look here, hold my wig while I go get the ball."  (Laughter) Because you know, the tree, the limbs, they would catch it and pull it off.  So hey, instead of being embarrassed, boom, here, just take it right now.  Let me go get the ball.  And I'd go in there and get the ball and come back and just put the wig back on.  It was really crazy.  But I remember that alleyway very well.  'Cause we did som- so much stuff there. That was the common ground (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So that's a sight--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to remember the alleyway.

Speaker 1: What type of child were you?  Were you--
Speaker 2: Mischievous (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Misc- I was gonna--
Speaker 2: I was very mischievous as a child.  And I--well maybe I was a little sneaky, but I remember being told that when my cousin Arturo [Arturo Bagley], which is Edythe Scott Bagley's son and Arthur Bagley.  Edythe is my mother's sister.  She came to Atlanta [Georgia] after my father [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] passed to kind of support my mother [Coretta Scott King] and ended up having her child here in Atlanta.  Well when he was born of course I was the youngest.  So when he came along, he displaced me.  And one time he was in his room, in his crib and I went back there and, and for a little, for a few little minutes then I came back into the kitchen.  And everybody was looking like what's going on, Bunny [HistoryMaker Bernice Albertine King]?  You know 'cause I probably had this little mischievous look on my face.  And then they heard Arturo crying.  We called him Arty back then.  I had gone back there and scratched him and pulled off some of his skin.  (Laughter) And I tried to play it off, you know, as a child.  I just came back up, I was like hm.  But I couldn't hide it.
Speaker 1: Because you no longer were the baby?
Speaker 2: No.  He took my place.
Speaker 1: He took your place.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and I didn't like that.  But we had a lot of fun around our house.  We did little crazy stuff.  I remember burning Dexter [Dexter King] with a lamp.  We did crazy stuff.  My brothers were playing with him.  You know, my brothers said to put the lamp up and just leave it like this.  So I just decided to take it and do it like this and left it.  You know, so you know I was mischievous, but I also was very shy, you know.  I was very shy, a reserved person, especially around adults.
