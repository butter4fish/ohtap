Speaker 1: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  They were the enemy at the time.  And why were they the enemy at the time?
Speaker 2: 'Cause they were on the wrong side.
Speaker 1: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  'Cause they were on the wrong side of your issues, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Okay.  Jesse Unruh was a big--was the big wig in the State of California, and they didn't--the, the local grassroots did not always see eye to eye with what he wanted to do, is that right?
Speaker 2: He controlled all the black elected officials.
Speaker 1: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  He controlled all the black elected officials.  Did that include your husband, Tom Bradley?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  No, so that was the reason why you didn't always agree with him, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what about Merv, Merv Dymally wasn't aligned with Unruh, was he?
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Yes.
Speaker 1: He was.  Okay.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Yes, yes. When she says all the black elected officials, she means all of 'em--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  --except Tom Bradley.
Story_ID: 612937
Speaker 1: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Okay, where you wanna go now?
Speaker 2: So I guess like how they made--he made the decision or if she was part of the decision that Tom Bradley made to run for city council [Los Angeles City Council].
Speaker 1: (LORRAINE BRADLEY): Okay. When your husband, Tom Bradley, decided to run for city council, what was the discussion?  What did he say to you?
Speaker 2: Or was she in favor of it?
Speaker 1: I, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  (Simultaneous) Or were you in favor of it?
Speaker 1: I learned that before (unclear)--
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  You learned the night before he decided--he made the decision to run.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Were you happy with the decision?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  No.  What did you want him to do?
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Was he a lawyer at this time?
Speaker 1: No.  He was in law school.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  He was a lawyer though?
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: (PHYLLIS BRADLEY):  Studying the bar.  He was studying the bar.
Speaker 1: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  When he ran for city council in 1963, Daddy was already a lawyer.  He was working with, with--
Speaker 2: (PHYLLIS BRADLEY):  He didn't go into practice though.
Speaker 1: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  No, he didn't, but he was a lawyer.  Charlie.
Speaker 2: (PHYLLIS BRADLEY):  Fifty-three [1953]--
Speaker 1: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Charlie--
Speaker 2: (PHYLLIS BRADLEY):  Yeah, Charlie Lloyd [Charles E. Lloyd].
Speaker 1: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  He was with Charlie Lloyd.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (PHYLLIS BRADLEY):   Yeah, but he wasn't practicing.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Right, so he was practicing law, right?
Speaker 1: (PHYLLIS BRADLEY):  He wasn't a practicing attorney (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A lawyer--
Speaker 1: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Okay, so did you want him to continue to practice the law--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  --instead of going into politics?
Speaker 2: (PHYLLIS BRADLEY):  Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  But once he decided to go in politics, were you supportive then?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Okay, did you help in the campaigns?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  And what kinds of things did you help do in the campaigns?
Speaker 1: Everything.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Everything.  You gave fundraisers?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  You gave little parties?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Got on the telephone, called all of--everybody in the precincts (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yes.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Okay, so you were actively involved--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  --and when he won the election in '63 [1963], he became the first African American elected to the city council, is that correct?
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 612938
Speaker 1: I guess I would ask like how did his election change family life?
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Okay. After he was elected [to the Los Angeles City Council], did the family life change, become any different?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  No.  Why was that?
Speaker 1: It just didn't.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  And I think more than that, it, the reason, one of the reasons it probably didn't was because you were right there, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (PHYLLIS BRADLEY):  (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  'Cause who was the one still at home taking care of the house, taking care of the family?  Was that you?
Speaker 2: Apparently.
Speaker 1: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  So that was probably one of the reasons why it made it easy for your husband [Tom Bradley] to do the work he did, because you were still there.
Speaker 2: (PHYLLIS BRADLEY):  Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Okay.
Story_ID: 612939
Speaker 1: And he was the first black city council member (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  (Simultaneous) He was the first African American elected.
Speaker 1: Along with Billy Mills?
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Billy--
Speaker 1: Billy Gene Mills [Billy G. Miles]?
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Yeah, but that came--he's in--did he get--he wasn't elected at the same time though, was he?  Billy Mills.
Speaker 1: (Unclear). In this, what I have here.  I don't know, but you all were here, but the case in--and the written stuff I have, they were elected at the same time, but I don't know.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Oh, Daddy was elected in the April primary, and Billy was in the June.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  That's the reason why.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, that clears it up.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  That clears that up, so, and then, (snaps fingers) convention center [Los Angeles Convention Center, Los Angeles, California]. (Snaps fingers and slaps thighs).
Speaker 1: (PHYLLIS BRADLEY):  Doing the Macarena?
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Who's the other African American in the city council [Los Angeles City Council] at that time?
Speaker 1: (PHYLLIS BRADLEY):  Helen--
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  They've got the statue, they have the--he's in convention center.  Gill Lindsay [Gilbert W. Lindsay] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (PHYLLIS BRADLEY):  (Simultaneous) Gill Lindsay. He--
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Gill Lindsay was actually the first African American in the city council, but he was not elected.  He was appointed.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was--Tom Bradley was the first elected.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Tom, Tom was the first elected because he won his election in April, in the primary.
Speaker 1: Of 1960?
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Of '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  And Billy Mills won his election in the, in the general election in June.  So that's where the distinction comes in.
Speaker 1: So this is historically significant because '63 [1963] was the time of the Birmingham [Alabama] stuff, and the March on Washington.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Right.
Speaker 1: The country, a lot of the cities had like a discord over housing and jobs and CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] was active (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  (Simultaneous) Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --and demonstrations in most of the major cities.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  Absolutely, a very volatile time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Big summer.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  --big summer, big volatile time for city and everything going on.  Yes, that's correct and it was the first time they'd had three African Americans sitting on the city council making decisions and becoming a part of the fabric.
Speaker 1: Right.  So what happened here, mirrored what was going on in a lot of cities.
Speaker 2: (LORRAINE BRADLEY):  In a lot of cities, right, right.
