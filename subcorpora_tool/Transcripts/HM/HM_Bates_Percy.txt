Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe. I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Percy Bates.  P as in Paul, E-R-C-Y, Bates, B as in boy, A-T-E-S.
Speaker 1: And is that your full name?
Speaker 2: That is my full name.
Speaker 1: No middle name?
Speaker 2: I don't have a middle name.  I do have--I guess we gotta correct it.  I'm officially Percy Bates, III.  My grandfather was Percy Bates.  My father was officially [Percy Bates] Jr., although he never used it.  I have in fact used Jr. for most of my life except when I was in the [U.S.] Army and they saw this, this array of, of Percy Bates' and said wait a minute if your dad was the same name, then you can't be Jr., so it, it either had to be Percy Bates, III, or Percy Bates, Jr., the II and so we, we decided on Percy Bates, III.  So, somewhere out there although my grandfather and father are now deceased, so that, that clears the road a little bit to accept somewhere there'd be paperwork that would suggest there might be some confusion among us.
Speaker 1: Okay, they might think that Percy Bates lived, lived three hundred years (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Correct, correct.
Speaker 1: --I see, okay.  All right, and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: July 8th, 1932, in Pensacola, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay, and sir what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a professor of educational psychology at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay, now what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is January 19th, 19, 2005.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Story_ID: 252572
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as a warm-up, and they just require like a short answer basically.  And the first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Favorite food, yeah I would say it's in the sweet vein and it's probably banana cream pie.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Green is my favorite color.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I would have to say that it's the fall of the year, although I ski and I play golf, and I do a number of things in each of them, but I think the actual favorite would have to be the fall, probably later fall around mid-October when the colors are changing in a state like Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No I do not have a favorite vacation des- destination 'cause when I was growing up we were not vacationers, so we didn't have those places where families went year after year and since I've become an adult we've gone various places, so I do not have a favorite spot.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last question in this series is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I'm sure I do that somebody around me could tell you, but I don't know what that is.  That is something that I would repeat most of the time.  When I was in college [Central Michigan College; Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan], I think, you bet was the, was the phrase that I think people said I used periodic--quite, quite a bit.
Story_ID: 252573
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask you about your family history and I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Percy Bates, Jr.] side of the family, but I'm gonna start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your, your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Gladys Travis, which was her maiden name.  That's G-L-A-D-Y-S and Travis is T-R-A-V-I-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't really, I couldn't give you her date of birth, but she was born as well in Pensacola, Florida.  She passed away about three years ago, and at that time was I believe eighty-nine when she passed.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so she was born I guess in about 1911 or something like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah that would be the approximate time.
Speaker 1: All right, now what do you know about her branch of the family tree?  How far back can you trace that branch?
Speaker 2: I can go back to her mother [Elizabeth Travis] and father [Alex Travis], although I only saw my maternal grandmother a few times, and I have a photograph of her some place.  Her father I saw a bit more, but I can't go back on her side of the family beyond her mother and father.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she never talked about her grandparents or anything?
Speaker 2: No, not that I can think of, that all I've ever recalled having conversation with her was about her mother and father.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And were they from Florida as well?
Speaker 2: I am told, again and some of this has to be as to what I was told that our original core family came from a place called Troy, Alabama, and they moved from Troy down to Pensacola and so that most of the people that I knew in my family were all there in Pensacola and in, in fact I'm told that one of my aunts found the family in Troy who was related to us, which is how we knew that that was where we originated, at least the core of the family that came down from Troy to Pensacola, and they were only discovered 10 or 15 years ago after many, many years.
Speaker 1: Now is there, there any, are there any stories that are passed down through the family about why the family moved from Troy to Pensacola and or about life in Pensacola?
Speaker 2: I don't reca- I don't really recall any stories about how and why they got there, and as I said, the, the other part of that story is that nobody really talked about where we came from until this family, a very large family as I gather, was discovered in Troy, Alabama, knowing that they were relatives to my core family and that's how they really, really discovered the Troy thing and, and that, that's where they originally came from.  But other than that, nobody talked about Troy when I was growing up because nobody knew about it.
Story_ID: 252574
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Gladys Travis Bates] talk about growing up in Pensacola [Florida] and what it was like for her to grow up there?
Speaker 2: No, not, not, not a lot, but you know in, in, in her day when she was, you know, a child that area was pretty well segregated and the comments that, that I heard from her mostly related to where she went to school, the things that they could or could not do as young girls growing up in that, in the town.  But, there was not a lot as I said of conversation about the history of, of her background.
Speaker 1: Okay, did she get, so she had a chance to go to school in Pensacola and everything?
Speaker 2: She went to school in Pensacola right.
Speaker 1: You said that she talked about things that they could and couldn't do, I mean what, what were some of those things that she talk--?
Speaker 2: Oh that when they went to local clothing stores they were unable, you had to buy it from the rack.  You could not try it on and you had to look at it and you had to measure it up by sight, but you couldn't go in the back and, and, and try anything on.  That was true with shoes, it was true with dresses, and the like.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was for black people in, in--
Speaker 2: That was for black people in general, but that was part of what I think at least as I talk to her that was part of, of what was etched in her memory some of the difficulties that she had growing up as it related to, to a segregated, you know, community.
Speaker 1: Now did she have to walk a long way to school or was the school right in the community?
Speaker 2: This, the school from her point of view was quite a distance.  She would often tell us and then I think later I was told whenever I complained about not wanting or school being so far away, she would explain to me that you know she often had to walk much further to school than we did and never complained and et cetera, et cetera, but lots of kids say their parents tell them that if you think your life was tough you should have been around when I was growing up.
Speaker 1: Right, there's a standard story about the cardboard in the shoes--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and walking miles and miles right.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I tell my kids I mean I walked for miles in my bare feet and all that stuff you know, and they said yeah, yeah, we've heard all that before.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's like standard, but did she, did she have a chance to go onto higher education or anything?
Speaker 2: No, in fact, my mother was the first person in our immediate family to complete high school.  Apparently, in her day if you got through elementary school that was a real task, and she was actually the first person to, to finish high school in our immediate family.
Speaker 1: Okay, so do you know the name of the high school she attended in Pensacola?
Speaker 2: She attended Booker T. Washington High School in Pensacola, Florida, which is the one I attended later on.  It was still there.
Speaker 1: Okay, now can you tell us something about your mother's personality?  What was she like and what did she do?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was a domestic worker.  She worked for various families around Pensacola.  My memory of her is that she was a very generous woman.  I recall she used to say to me repeatedly I will try to give you everything you need and some of what you want, and I don't ever recall really wanting a lot, that she was not there and available to provide whatever, whatever I needed.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you, do you have a lot of brothers or sisters or?
Speaker 2: I have a brother [Lorenzo Bates] who is still alive.  I have a, had a sister who is deceased, but that's been thirty, probably thirty years now.  My, my brother is still alive, lives in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: So, a relatively small group of people.
Speaker 2: Right, so our family, our end of the family is relatively small, although we had quite an extended family.  My grandmother [Susie Bates Polnitz], my, on my father's [Percy Bates, Jr.] side was around.  We'll get to him later probably, but we had, it was very what I recall today an extended family, so it was not, while it was just in our small nuclear family.  We also had lots of cousins that were all over the place and I lived with my grandmother for a while and so in those days, you know, everybody was a parent.
Story_ID: 252575
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your father's side of the family?  Can you give his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name is Percy Bates, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Now he just passed last week and I don't have the exact date, but his birthday was coming up in April, and he was going to be ninety-two.
Speaker 1: Okay, so 1913, '13 [1913].
Speaker 2: Yes, I think it was '13 [1913] or '14 [1914].
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1913 I guess.  Okay, and where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Pensacola [Florida] as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what do you know about his side of the family?  How far can you trace that group?
Speaker 2: Back to his father I knew, although I would have to say that he was some distance I guess from, from us, both physically and I'd say psychologically because I didn't get to know him that well.  It was a kind of an arrangement where you know occasionally I would stop by his house--
Speaker 1: This is Percy Bates, Sr., the, the senior?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the grandfather?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he of course had remarried and was not with my grandmother and so he had remarried.  I was just telling someone recently that it was sort of interesting because their home had sort of the first overhead water closet where you flush the toilet and when I was a kid looking up there I always worried that that water would come, would be coming down on me, and I, I just, I just would only go by there because he was my grandfather and, and his second wife was a woman who weighed about--(unclear)--as a child I would say close to three hundred pounds probably, and for some reason she would always grab you and hug you and you would, you think she was gonna smother you, so I, I just didn't as I said they were grandparents that I would just sort of stop by to see every now and then.  Now the, my father's mother then remarried and that was a family that I was the closest to, and my father's father I, I was not that close to them, but with my, my maternal grandmother [Elizabeth Travis], my paternal grandmother I go to know very well and lived with them off, off and on as a child along with my other cousins.  This is why I said earlier we had this extended family, and I lots of cousins were there and they did like as I did they would, they would live with her for a while and then go back home, et cetera, and Grandma Susie [Bates Polnitz] was a nice place to be--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and most of the cousins enjoyed being there.
Story_ID: 252576
Speaker 1: Now did your grandparents talk about how they grew up or any of the family history or any stories that they passed down any stories to you?
Speaker 2: Well, my, my, my [paternal] grandmother [Susie Bates Polnitz] married, her first name husband was Bates.  This was one Polnitz, P-O-L-N-I-T-Z, and I recall I guess listening to him a lot, but he was a man who described his, his life as being really very hard.  I think he always talked about work, how hard it was to, to earn a living.  He, he was an engraver of grave stones and whenever I saw him he was forever covered with dust from the chiseling of the, of the grave stones.  But, again all I remember much of, of him was the notion that he was a really hard worker and, and I think was sort of disappointed in the fact that some of his children did not share his work ethic and did not work as hard as, as he did.  I only remember him coming and going to work. That was--
Speaker 1: Now is he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) essentially his life.
Speaker 1: Now that, that name Polnitz is odd for a black man.
Speaker 2: Very--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, so did he have a story about that?
Speaker 2: I have never, I have asked in fact as of last week when I was in Pensacola [Florida] the only I guess one of my, the son of my father's [Percy Bates, Jr.] sister is the only, well I guess, no he's left, and then one of my father's brother, but nobody seems to know actually where it came from and in fact among my sort of immediate relatives they never knew how to pronounce it and they were talking to me last week about they would just sort of run through the name and they asked me last week how do you pronounce it again?  So, we don't really know and he never, never told us where it came from.  As far as I can remember he was certainly an African American who was born here and how he came about that name is, is, is still a mystery.
Speaker 1: You think that, you know we often hear people say that they, they can only go back to their, their grandparents, but then they didn't really hear any stories was that a period where you just didn't ask questions about those kind of things or, or?
Speaker 2: I, I think so.  I mean it was, it's like now when I, I sort of dread the fact that I didn't sit with him and ask him how did you get a name like Polnitz?  Where did that come from?  But, in those days kids were they say seen and not heard and, and you just did not engage a great deal in conversation with adults unlike kids today.  I mean my grandkids ask me anything and everything, but I think that's, that's probably correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That it was really a question of saying there's just things you don't talk about particularly with kids.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah they, I, I remember quite the same kind of thing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, but occasionally somebody would like tell you stories that you could listen in maybe and hear something that you didn't know.
Story_ID: 252577
Speaker 1: Tell me now is there a story about how your parents [Gladys Travis Bates and Percy Bates, Jr.] met?
Speaker 2: No, because my, my parents  actually were divorced when I was about five years old, so I don't have any notion about their connection.  The only thing that I remember is that my mother was clearly responsible, and I can speak just for myself 'cause I'm not sure of that connection with my siblings.  But, my father was rarely, I guess, in, in the picture and the only thing I can remember is at one point I remember thinking my mother should be angry with my father, so I should say something negative about him as a way of getting her to su--her support.  And she, I was chastised severely for that, and I remember her saying no matter what you think of your father he will always be your father and you're never to say anything negative about him.  And in many ways I credit her with I guess creating a much better relationship between myself and my dad because otherwise people always said if you haven't seen your daddy, was not that supportive, you must be pretty angry with him and I was never angry with him and I think my mother did a very good job of, of that of saying that's not the way it is, that is your father and doesn't matter how you feel or what you think, he will always be your father.  And I think that helped give some balance to it, but how they met I have--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --no recollection about.
Speaker 1: Okay so well was he, did you get a chance to, to know him when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I, my father was someone who lived on the other side of town [Pensacola, Florida] who would occasionally venture to our side or we would go to his side or he would show up with presents on birthdays, Christmas, et cetera, but not on a regular basis and, and it was sort of when he decided, but I couldn't depend on the gift on a birthday because it was my birthday by my father, unlike the expectation with my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did he do for a living and what was his personality like?
Speaker 2: He, well he was a general laborer.  I understand that he did odd jobs most of his life.  I remember one time I think he worked as a roofer, but that's the only job that I remember other than sort of general work that, that he did.  From a personality point of view, I didn't know him that well, but I was told either by my mother or by other people that my dad was a very ambitious man at one point and for some reason either he didn't get where he wanted to go or something didn't happen right.  He started to drink and in fact supposedly the separation from my mother that was the major cause was, was, was his drinking.  And it would sound to me like my mother was the one who would say, who said that you know he really was disappointed in life, but what you see now is not all there ever was, that he really had some high hope for himself and had great ambition, but they were not realized.
Speaker 1: Okay, did he have a chance to go to school at all?
Speaker 2: I, as far as I know he never completed high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have any sense from your family as to what he wanted to be or what he wanted to do?
Speaker 2: No, other than, than he, what I got was that he, that he really wanted more than he was able to get--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that the drinking part of his life was probably the result of some disappointment that he fell short of, of what he wanted and I, I think part of that was that my mother wanted I guess me not to look upon my father as someone that I might be able, that I might be like at some point and that I think she wanted to make sure that I knew that what I saw was not what was always there.
Story_ID: 252578
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: An earliest childhood memory.  Oh, I've just recently, I was talking to someone about when I was in the fifth grade [at Spencer Bibbs Elementary School, Pensacola, Florida] I was a good speller, and there was a young woman that I looked for last week and I'm not sure she's still around, we always competed on the spelling bee and we were probably sort of at the top of our class as well, is what I remember at least in terms of school.
Story_ID: 252579
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: In Pensacola [Florida], the, the wharf.  We would often go crabbing.  We had this sort of basket that was four-sided that you could drop down and the gates would open and the crab would crawl in and you pull the crabs up and, and there was the salt water.  We would, we'd go swimming in the Gulf [of Mexico] and the, the salt water.
Speaker 1: So Pensacola is on what side of the Florida panhandle?  Is it on the--yeah?
Speaker 2: Pensacola is just at the tip, at the, I'm sorry in the northern part of Florida right next to Alabama.  You go Mobile, Alabama and Pensacola are sixty-five miles.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's on the western coast--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of Florida--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --okay right near Alabama okay.
Speaker 2: The other sights and sounds had to do with the weather.  It was always very, very hot growing up and, and having been there last week the seasons seem to have changed.  It was when I was growing up it seemed like it was warm most of the time, but--(unclear)--I guess when I was in fifth or sixth grade [at Spencer Bibbs Elementary School, Pensacola, Florida] we got our first snow in Pensacola.  We had never seen any snow, but as I said it was, it was essentially the wharf fishing surrounded by water and very, very hot and, and playing in the sand in our bare feet, hopping around trying to find a cool spot for your feet, and that's when I put myself back as a child.  Those are the things that I remember the salt water, the fishing.  I never took to fishing.  I always, somebody would always take me either crabbing or fishing, but I didn't turn out to be a fisherman.  My brother [Lorenzo Bates] on the other hand likes to fish, and he sort of took to that.  I took to something else.
Story_ID: 252580
Speaker 1: Now, what did you neighborhood look like in Pensacola, Florida?  Most of us have grown up in places that are a lot dingier than Pensacola so (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, it certainly differs from what we see and what we know think of as the inner city, but I would say it was a modest neighborhood on a dirt street.  And when I say dirt I don't mean packed dirt, we had sand and this is what I was describing earlier with kids running around in the hot sand kicking through.  The cars could certainly get through it.  But, most of the streets were, were dirt streets around where I was.  There's, there were main streets that were paved, but most of the side streets were dirt streets.  It was, it was modest, but a, but a clean neighborhood, I mean as we think of it now when we think of you know inner city areas versus where I lived.
Speaker 1: Now, is there, is there a difference in the, in the white neighborhood and the black neighborhood in terms of the streets being paved?  That's something that I notice that sometimes the white side of town was paved and black side of town is gravel.
Speaker 2: That was pretty much, that would be pretty much the case that on the other side of probably 12th Avenue is where there was the white side of town and there you had a little different than what we had.  The pavements came later.  As of last week when I was there, a lot of that has changed, but when I was growing up it was running around in your bare feet in hot, hot sands.
Speaker 1: Okay, what's the housing like down there?  Was it frame housing or?
Speaker 2: Frame houses, lots of things that we called shotgun houses.  These were sort of straight houses with the first room being the living room and we didn't think of it as dining rooms.  The dining room was also part of the kitchen, so you had the living room area, the sitting area, the bedrooms, and the kitchen were all in line and I guess the shotgun came from if you shot a shotgun through the house it would go right through from front to back.  That was pretty standard architecture.  I suspect though that now that I think of it that was probably a way to save land.  You didn't spread out.  It was just a narrow house that went, went back so the lots were deep, but not very wide.
Speaker 1: Okay, there's a famous painting by John Biggers called 'Shotgun Houses' ['Shotguns'] with all of them lined up.
Speaker 2: Yes that's, that's right.
Speaker 1: I think he's from Texas [sic. North Carolina].  Now what were you like as a, as young man growing up?  What did you like to do as a little boy?  What, what--
Speaker 2: Well I actually I was in Florida until I was thirteen, but I remember even as a young child I guess being fairly, I won't say ambitious, but I had a lot of support from my mother [Gladys Travis Bates] who often put a lot of confidence in me at a very young age, somewhere between I assume seven and eight and twelve.  I often paid all of her bills for her.  She would give me the money, and I would go to the downtown area and take the money, pay all the bills, get the receipts and so forth, so I was kind of the responsible child.  That was, I think, the label that I got and as opposed to my brother [Lorenzo Bates] who I guess got the label of the irresponsible child.  But, that's what I remember in the early days of people saying that you're gonna amount to something one of these days.  That was the message I guess that I got and I suppose when I look back over my shoulder that's probably the message that I've heard for a long time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was there as a young child.
Story_ID: 252581
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  Church was something that my [paternal] grandmother [Susie Bates Polnitz] did.  It was something my mother [Gladys Travis Bates] did to some degree, but it was not an integral part of, of my growing up, although we all went to Sunday school on Sunday, but some, but church then was more social than religious.  Maybe that's true for children in general, I mean because they go because somebody else is going.  You get there, there are other kids there.  So, I recall church as being much more social and I think I was baptized as a child by the age twelve at least three times depending on which side of the family I happen to be with at the time.  If I was with the group that was Methodist or the group that was Baptist, we, I could get baptized in at least one of those, but it was not as I recall for religious reason.  The young men sort of wanted to go to the church where the pretty young ladies were, and so it was not in that sense an integral part of my growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your mother wasn't, wasn't overtly religious?
Speaker 2: No, but and, and it's strange enough because at the time when she passed I discovered from the minster that she was a regular churchgoer in the latter part of her life, which I did not know and then as he said even when she couldn't come she would all, always send her contributions to the church.  Somebody would bring that, which, which was not part of what I saw as a child.  And then I said to somebody when my dad [Percy Bates, Jr.] passed last week that I'm sure we'd have to have the service in the chapel because he did not go to church regular, and they said oh no, no the last twenty-five years he'd been going to church on a regular basis, so as I said it was not part of their young life.  It was not a major part of either of them, although there was enough religiosity within the family so that there was expectation that you go to church on Sunday.  You would go to Sunday school and strangely enough as I say this it was always in Sunday school for depend--it didn't matter whether it was the grandparent's side or my mother and father or aunt and uncle.  The expectation was that you go to Sunday school.
Speaker 1: Growing up in Florida I guess in the 1930s--
Speaker 2: Mostly '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Mostly '40s [1940s].  You were born in '32 [1932]--
Speaker 2: Thirty-two [1932].
Speaker 1: --so you were a little kid for at least eight years--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --until it got to be 1940--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but did you, did you--that's the, well correct me if I'm wrong I think as to Florida that Zora Neale Hurston writes about and I mean that's--she went to Florida and other parts of the South and recorded songs and stories and so forth.  Did you hear a lot of folklore down there?  Did you or was the music different from other parts of the country to you, I mean when you reflect back on it?
Speaker 2: No, the music that I recall, the earliest was sort of the jitterbug stuff, 'Dancing at the Savoy' [sic. 'Stompin' at the Savoy'].  Those were the songs that I recall during that time.  I recall one of my uncles had one of those zoot suits with the chains is what I remember during that time as a child.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The music was pretty standard, but the upbeat jitterbug stuff is what I recall.
Speaker 1: So you don't remember any of the folksy kind of stuff at all or any of that thing, any of that being a part of what people were doing?
Speaker 2: No, that was not much, I don't recall much of that.  Most of it was sort of the, the pop stuff is what I heard.
Speaker 1: Okay all right.  Did you like music when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: I loved music.  In fact, I, I started singing somewhere along the way and until not too long ago continued that at a sub rosa level, but I love music.
Story_ID: 252582
Speaker 1: Well tell me about school.  What is the name of the school you attended?
Speaker 2: I attended initially Spencer, S-P-E-N-C-E-R, Bibbs, B-I-B-B-S [Spencer Bibbs] Elementary School [Pensacola, Florida], which was in K [kindergarten] through 6, and then I went to high school then was 7 through 12.  So, it was Spencer Bibbs in the elementary, but I only got through 7 and 8th at the George Washington High School [sic.].
Speaker 1: Was that George Washington High School?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it was George Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: George Washington Carver I guess is what the--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --(unclear)--Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you were saying your mother [Gladys Travis Bates] came out of Booker T. Washington [High School, Pensacola, Florida].
Speaker 2: Now wait a minute, then it's the same high school, and I'm, I'm, I must have shifted.  It was Booker T. Washington.  It was Booker T.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: That was the same high school that she attended.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I should have checked that.  It is torn down now, so that I didn't get a chance to touch base with it last week.
Speaker 1: Okay, well in, now who, do you know who Spencer Bibbs was?
Speaker 2: I have no idea who Spencer Bibbs was, but that school is still there, but I'm assuming that it was some educator.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know often the schools in the South are named for the--
Speaker 2: Named after somebody.
Speaker 1: --founding educator--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the founding, the person who put--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --up the money to build it.
Speaker 2: Again I'm not that inquisitive about--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --where those things came from.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well how did--did you like school growing up?
Speaker 2: I liked school.  I had, I've always liked school and found it to be a fairly easy thing for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so I take it from what your, your mother and other people you said in the community said about you that you were a fairly bright student in school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's interesting that I never thought of it as being bright as we do now.  I just recall never having any real struggles in school, that work came fairly easy for me and I was always one of the top students whether it was in, you know, reading or math or the spelling bee in which I was always one of the last ones, ones left and very often the last one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was fairly easy for me.
Speaker 1: So what, what size of school are we talking about in terms of students attending?
Speaker 2: Well I tell you Spencer Bibbs probably had 600, 700, maybe a thousand students at that time elementary school.
Speaker 1: So, that was a good, lot of--
Speaker 2: It was a good size.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well it had, as I said it was K through, you know, K through 6, so we got everybody before they went to high school and it took all of the kids.  We had a few, we had one private school.  Otherwise, everybody else went to that elementary school.  It was, it was sizeable, but I also think that was sort of a southern trait so that you had a school and it would be a fairly good sized school so that we didn't have several elementary schools around town.  And just last week I noticed they have middle schools, which I'm assuming is somewhere between 6 and 8, so that changed the configuration, but everybody in my neighborhood went to Spencer Bibbs is what I recall.  So, it was a pretty size, pretty large school.
Speaker 1: Okay, it was pretty, you know, so it was an all-black school--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --in those days with a thousand students that's pretty, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --good size.  Was the facility big?
Speaker 2: It was a rambling school.  It was a white building that sort of would pods and arms that went out all over the place.  In fact, now it's been rebuilt and I don't know whether it's as large as it was then, but at that time it was pretty, it was rambling all over the place.
Speaker 1: Did you suspect that they would like build out based on expansion and stuff when people could afford to do it or?
Speaker 2: I think they would make it as big as they had to rather than build another school--is the way, is what--is how I thought of it.
Story_ID: 252583
Speaker 1: What were the teachers like there [Spencer Bibbs Elementary School, Pensacola, Florida] and what memories do you have of the teachers and instructors and did any of them take a special interest in you as a good student?
Speaker 2: I would say that one of the things that I've always I guess cherished and even today I realize that the all-black schools had some qualities about them that we don't have in schools today.  I mean, these were people who went to church with your family members.  They knew you.  They lived in your neighborhood.  They didn't live in the suburbs, and it made it feel more like a family rather than, than, than school, and that is very different than what I think we have now and so that any--I used to tell people that any trouble, time you get into trouble in school you take whatever the punishment happened to be and then ask them not to tell your parents because if they did then you had something, some more punishment coming, so that it was much more of, of a sort of a family/neighborhood oriented school that felt often more like a family than school.
Speaker 1: Often today you hear teachers say that the students tell the teacher that they're gonna tell their parents if they punish them rather than--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  Don't hit me if you do I'll tell my parents.  That didn't, that didn't happen when I was growing up and then in the neighborhood any person in that neighborhood could give you a spanking and would give you a spanking and that's when you would again negotiate so you know it's taken care of now don't tell mom because if you do I'm gonna get another spanking and then, and the mom and the parent were appreciative because they, the difference being whatever they did it was out of caring for you and nobody thought otherwise, whereas now you know if you hit my kid then you don't like my kid or something or other and that's not how it was when I was growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you had a comment about why it's not like that now, I mean do you have an analysis on that?
Speaker 2: Well, part of it is, is that the people who run the schools in the communities are not part of the communities.  It's a separate entity.  It's where I go to work, and it's what I do, but it, it has nothing to do with, with anything else and I, I can tell you I guess at this juncture that when I, while I was a professor at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] I remember talking to a young woman who attended Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], not Morehouse, Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] as an undergraduate and she was hear and struggling a little bit and I said to her tell me the difference between Spelman and the University of Michigan, and she said that's easy.  She said at Spelman everybody there was committed to my success.  I said and here?  She said they say you can be successful here, but it's up to you.  They have no commitment to that process.  And that's the difference when I think about growing up and why is it different now.  It's, it's different because as I said your next door neighbor would be your teacher and, and, and that means I'm like a parent to you and that I care for you as a parent, not just I will teach you something and it's up to you to learn it, you know, I'm committed to you learning it and I would not do, I, I would not accept any less so that the, in, in those days I just felt that the commitment and the responsibility to the student was much greater than we see today.
Speaker 1: Very often when we interview people who grew up during the period when there were all-black schools and segregated schools they lament the end of those schools because of the reason you're talking about, though I don't know they're, they're in a quandary as to what we should have done, but--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, I mean I, I think that the, the, the process I guess clearly tells us that there was something good happening in those schools, and I think we wanted to maintain the good things that were happening in those schools.  What did not happen though as a result of school integration was to keep some of the good part.  What we didn't like was that you had no options, and so the move to integrate was to provide options.  But, if one could have gone out and provided those options and then gone back to those environments I suspect we would have.  We just didn't realize that in many cases what was being lost in that process.
Story_ID: 252584
Speaker 1: I take it you probably didn't get in a lot of trouble and didn't have to go through that process of the teacher telling (laughter) on you.
Speaker 2: Actually I didn't, and I was just chuckling because when I was down last week one of my, my uncle's wives whose still alive and she was talking about the fact that I never really got into much trouble and pointed to my brother [Lorenzo Bates] who was there and on the other end he was the one who was always getting into trouble, so there was sort of that and there was a little bit of the sort of good son, bad son syndrome that was there, which didn't help my relationship with my brother at all either because I'm sure he resented hearing that all the time.  That is true I didn't, there was not that much trouble that I got into.
Speaker 1: What, what's your brother, I mean, what did he, how did things turn out for him?
Speaker 2: He finished high school, did not go to college.  Moved to Chicago [Illinois] and worked mostly in the plants and, and until he retired.  So that, that's, that's the route he took and then I took the--(unclear)--route, which was a little bit different and, and I'm sure my mother [Gladys Travis Bates] who would always deny it, that's about what she expected to happen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's what I suspect was conveyed to us.
Speaker 1: Okay now are there any--oh I was asking you about particular teachers, I mean, are there any special teachers that, that guided you that you remember or people in the community that you looked up to when you were growing up in Pensacola [Florida]?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I always felt that I was always closer to the people who were viewed as being middle class in some way, that those were the people that I felt closes to rather than those who were considered not middle class and so I can recall that and I think that's what always kept me on the sort of upper edge of where we were going.  I mean I could have friends who would get into trouble, and I would not go along with them and they would say that whatever they were doing that if you wanted to participate you had to come along and I could say well I don't want to participate I can't do that I've gotta go, I've gotta go another, another route.  So, even in those early years I, I could, I could decide what I wanted to do and what I didn't want to do and I knew right from wrong and good and bad and I kind of separated that out all along the way.
Story_ID: 252585
Speaker 1: So you were in Pensacola [Florida] to the beginning of high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Pensacola, Florida] was that--?
Speaker 2: Well through the eighth grade. I had entered the ninth grade in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Now how did that come about?  How did you wind up in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Well, it came about--now we're getting to part where I know best.  I was about twelve, maybe twelve around that time.  I had friends who were maybe a year, possibly two older who were big enough and was forging papers and going into the [U.S.] Army and my mother [Gladys Travis Bates] was very concerned about what was going to happen to me and in that process.  And so I had been babysitting for a family who was close to my parents, to my mother anyway, and they were moving to Detroit and they had small children and I had been watching them a lot and they asked my mother if I could move to Detroit with them, and she reluctantly agreed to do that.  So I did and when I came to Michigan I came with these friends that I would, that I called my aunt and uncle, but they really were not related to me at all and my mother really saw this as a way of getting me out of that environment and they were going in two directions.  They were going into the Army or they were going to jail, and she was concerned about that and she was looking for better opportunities to me and thought that they, Michigan would be able to provide those better opportunities.
Speaker 1: Now today people might hear that and say that's amazing.  Somebody sending someone from the South to Detroit to get them out of trouble (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, right absolutely.
Speaker 1: Today you would think that you know people from Detroit are sending people down South to get them out of trouble you know--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --but Chicago [Illinois] I know that's a--
Speaker 2: But that, that--
Speaker 1: --regular thing to send your kid to Mississippi when he gets in trouble in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Right, right, but at that time this was a way of getting out of that environment and, and I think too, thinking that there would be greater opportunities for me is what I think she had in mind as well.
Speaker 1: Well, how did it work out?  How did you like Detroit and?
Speaker 2: Well, it worked out very, very well, but as they say all's well that ends well, but the, the family that I moved to Detroit with really saw me more as baby--as a babysitter for them and were not very supportive of anything other than that.  I went to school, but other than that they really saw me as a kid taking care of their kids for them.
Speaker 1: So, they were really, I mean it wasn't really much of a relationship beyond you being like an employee of theirs?
Speaker 2: Right, that pretty much.
Speaker 1: That's how they viewed it then.
Speaker 2: That's how they viewed it.  When you would ask them, they would say otherwise.  The reality of it was what I described.
Speaker 1: How did you feel about that?  Now you're leaving your mother and you know your father [Percy Bates, Jr.] is kind of estranged, you leave your, leave home, you go all the way to Detroit, a new city, you've never been north like this before.  How did you feel about that?
Speaker 2: I was willing--by the time I arrived in Michigan I realized that there were in fact greater opportunities for me, and I did not like the living conditions or the situation I was in, but I was willing to put up with that in order to get what I thought would be coming for me in the future.  And in fact, one of the threats that they often used was that we're gonna send you back to Florida and I didn't want to go back at that time and so in, in that instance I can recall once when they wanted to go to a Tiger [Detroit Tigers] baseball game and I had some activity at school that I wanted to go to and I remember saying to them they'll be lots more Tiger baseball games, this is the only opportunity.  And their view was that's too bad.  So, it was not a good, it was not a good situation, but as I said I was willing to do what I needed to do in order to make that work because I, I did not want to go back to Florida at that time because I could see that there were in fact greater opportunities for me in Michigan.

Speaker 1: Where did you live here in Detroit [Michigan]? (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) I was, I lived in Hamtramck [Michigan], Detroit, which is I wouldn't say a suburb it's sort of surrounded by Detroit.  It was--
Speaker 1: It's on the east side of Detroit--
Speaker 2: It is--
Speaker 1: --sort of an eastern.
Speaker 2: It's on the east side of Detroit.  It was--in those days it was about--when I first moved there in '46 [1946], '47 [1947] it was about seventy percent Polish, about thirty percent black and then by the time I graduated from high school it was about 50/50.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Hamtramck High School [Hamtramck, Michigan].  Well, I actually finished the ninth grade at a school called Copernicus [Junior High School, Hamtramck, Michigan], like the astronomer, named after him, and finished that and then I went to Hamtramck High school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you like school better in Detroit than in--?
Speaker 2: It was, it was more of a struggle for me that I discovered.  One of the things that you heard in those days was that southern schools were behind northern schools and that they would often move you, put you back a grade when you came north.  They didn't do that, but I suddenly found myself feeling not as bright as I had when I was in Florida and it was more of a struggle for me.  In fact, I had, it was a struggle through high school, but the interesting thing is it was not like failing, but it was doing enough to get by.  So, I got to the point where as long as you got by it was okay and yet my friends were struggling and I would often help them, but the, the goal of getting the As and Bs was not there.  It was more, it was more of a survival there.  But, it was much more of a, of a struggle.
Story_ID: 252587
Speaker 1: Hamtramck High School [Hamtramck, Michigan] now did you ever reach a point where you felt you'd caught up really once there?
Speaker 2: I always thought that I had caught up, but it was only a matter of getting by, getting through.  I didn't have the drive to do much more than that, so as long as it was I was not failing and it wasn't that tough it was okay.  It was only when I got to [Central Michigan] College [Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan] when, when that, that changed.  But for some reason from the ninth grade through high school I'd say I was sort of an average student.
Speaker 1: Okay and was Hamtramck High School 50/50 black and white by that time?
Speaker 2: By the time I, I graduated it was about 50/50.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now did you get involved in high school activities and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I, this is, that's where I started singing publicly and I was always in the, the talent shows and performed in that.  I was on the football team.  I was on the track team, so I was fairly involved in, in activities in high school.
Speaker 1: Did you, what did you run in track?
Speaker 2: I ran the quarter mile.  Then it was a quarter mile.  I guess now that's 400 meters.  I ran on the relay team, and I ran 220 sometimes, which was then 220.  It's 200 meters now.
Speaker 1: You were a pretty strong runner then.  Anybody that can run a quarter mile is pretty strong.
Speaker 2: It was a struggle for me.  I was, I always, I had trouble getting tighten up at the end of the quarter mile.  It was not an easy race for me, but I didn't want to do the quarter mile--
Speaker 1: I don't think it's easy for anybody.  That's a--
Speaker 2: But I didn't want to try and do the quarter mile, so that's about where I was.  I had the quarter mile and then we had, had the relay.  I did the relay team and occasionally as I said I would do the 220.
Speaker 1: Okay, and football, what did you play in football?
Speaker 2: I was a running back.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were fairly fast I would take it?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah that was, that--I was what they call a scatback at that time, not the big, we had some guys who were a lot bigger, but mine was just skittering around on the field.
Story_ID: 252588
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Let's see my favorite subject, subject was English.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there any particular reason why?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a, I had really, a really good English teacher and unlike I guess in the earlier grades that for some odd reason I had trouble getting to school on time and I had an English teacher Mrs. [Bea] Olmstead who said to me that unless you learn how to get places on time you're never gonna amount to anything and there would be times when I would, the bell would be ringing and I would be ready to grab the door handle and she would close the door and says nope you're late, can't come in.  Then, when I was in the eleventh grade she actually flunked me in English.  I was getting I don't know a B+, A- in that class, and she flunked me because I was, I had too many tardinesses and so I had to retake the class in the twelfth grade.  And I told the principal, the assistant principal who was also one, one of the football coaches and I said I will take English over again, but I will not take her class.  He said that, that seems reasonable, so, I took it over.  On the first day of class she came with the assistant principal to the room and she said he's gonna be in my class and if he's not in my class she said I'm gonna resign.  And he came to me and he said look you know let's make it easy on her.  You can, you can take her.  I said but I don't wanna be with her.  He says but she wants to be with you.  And when people have points in their lives to get motivated it was this curious mixture of I was really mad at her, but I knew she cared.  Somehow that was what she was trying to me.  And she didn't--I didn't have to be in her class.  She just could flunk me and forget about it.  She says nope it's not gonna work that way, and years later when I went back to school when I had thought I had amounted to something I wanted to go back and see her just to let her know that it worked out okay and, and, but she had passed at that time, but that was a woman that I think was central to me moving on because as I said it was clear to me I'm really angry at her, I mean it was like I would have strangled her and yet I knew that whatever was there was out of her caring for me and, and that was a strange mixture that I tried to even as a high schooler trying to process that this woman really is interested in me and she cares about me, but at the moment I hate her guts, you know, but and I think when in retrospect I, I really liked her too because I knew that she liked me.
Story_ID: 252589
Speaker 1: When you were in high school [at Hamtramck High School, Hamtramck, Michigan] were you thinking about going to college in the future?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I had absolutely no notion.  In fact, the people that I moved to Detroit [Michigan] with my uncle, uncle I call him, was a construction, he had a construction company and I worked with a company during the summer and he said to me I should forget about that college stuff and get myself a good job and yet I said no I don't want to do that.  I, I wanna go to college and I probably got to college almost by accident because a couple of friends of mine that I had grown up with in Hamtramck [Michigan] and had gone through, gone through high school went, had gone up to Central Michigan University [Central Michigan College of Education, Mount Pleasant, Michigan] and they were, they were playing football and they came home one day and said you know it's a great place up here you really ought to take a look at it.  I took a look at it, applied, got admitted, but that same time I was drafted into the [U.S.] Army, so I didn't, I never attended and it was only after I got out of the Army that I went back to school, but it was not that, that, that I, that I had planned to do it and in fact was even encouraged not to do it, but for some reason the thing that I talked about when that little voice when I was a child that said you shouldn't do that that's not right you need to veer off from this group, that same voice I think came back when my uncle said get a good job, he meant a regular job, not a good job.  And something said no I wanna do something different and, and even with encouragement not to do it I felt that that's what I wanted to do, so that's really how I got to college that it was not, nobody saying you're gonna do it like with my kids it wasn't are you gonna go to college, the only question was where.  That was not the case when, at the juncture when I came along.
Speaker 1: Did you have any counseling in high school about that?  Did they, counselor ever talk to you?
Speaker 2: No, you're not, I mean, if they did they would have said you're not going to college 'cause you're not college material.  So, that was not in the scheme of things that, that that's what that was going to happen.
Story_ID: 252590
Speaker 1: Now what year did you graduate from [Hamtramck] High School [Hamtramck, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty [1950].
Speaker 1: Okay and so--and you were drafted in--
Speaker 2: I went into the [U.S.] Army.  I was in the Army from '52 [1952] to '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: Okay, where were you stationed and was there, did you learn anything significant in the Army?
Speaker 2: Yeah I think so.  I was stationed in El Paso, Texas, at the Fort Bliss [Texas], which is an artillery base there, and some of the friends that I met encouraged me to go to college.  One in particular a young man out of, named Roger Nathan [ph.] that was from Chicago [Illinois].  Got to know him very well and he always said you really ought to go to college, so I think had I not gone into the Army I might not have gone to college to tell you the truth.  It was while there, there was sort of constant encouragement that you really ought to consider going, and I think that's how I got back there.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you, what did you do in the Army when you were there?  Did you--
Speaker 2: I was, I was an instructor on the 50 caliber machine gun, and they thought that I was a pretty smart guy and could be a teacher, so they asked me to teach guys about how to shoot this weapon and take care of it and so forth.  And the main job I had was I was a radio man.  We flew radio control to aerial targets for anti-aircraft practice.  We would, had these little plane called, planes called R-cats, which is the radio controlled aerial targets, and we would, we would put a flag on the back so they could practice shooting at that flag except when we had the VIPs in town, then they would shoot the planes down and if they missed the planes as they often did we were instructed to nose dive them into the ground and make it look like, like they hit them anyway.  So, that's what I did, and I was the, radio person to tune those radios so that we could fly those planes.
Story_ID: 252591
Speaker 1: So when you got out he came back to Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Actually I came--I got out of the, I was supposed to get out of the [U.S.] Army in October, but we had a program then where if you were going to college you could get out in time to start in September.  So, I got out earlier and then went back to Central Michigan [College; Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which is where I had already, I had applied before I went in and so because of that it made it easier for me then to just re to, to reapply to go back there.
Speaker 1: Now where is Central Michigan?
Speaker 2: It's in Mount Pleasant, Michigan.  It's about oh gosh I guess it's about three of four hours north of here.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now what was--well did you like Central Michigan?
Speaker 2: In--yes I--Central Michigan in 1954 had about 1800 students.  It was relatively small.  I expanded my singing career.  I earned quite a bit of money singing for fraternities and parties and that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 252592
Speaker 1: What kinds of things would you sing?  Now these are--you would go in popular venues and you're singing popular songs?
Speaker 2: Popular songs.  I actually when I got, when I was in the [U.S.] Army I met a young man who was a musician named Earl Grant, and Earl later became reasonably famous.  But Earl played the piano and organ and so he would accompany me and then we would sing duets together and so forth.  When I got out of the [U.S.] Army, Earl said that his sister owned a club in Missouri some place, and that if I wanted to come there he could get me a job and I could go.  I said well actually I think I wanna go to college, and I'm not sure I wanna do this.  And so I came to Central Michigan [College; Central Michigan University] in Mount Pleasant [Michigan], Earl went home, and the next thing I knew Earl was on ['The] Ed Sullivan [Show'] and then he had a couple of hit records there--
Speaker 1: He had a couple.  I'm trying to think of his big hits, but he was big in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: He did, he, he--I remember he had one called the number 64 [sic. 54], the house, the house with the bamboo floor [sic. 'House of Bamboo'].  I've forgotten the name of the, all of the song.  He did, he did quite well for himself--
Speaker 1: Earl Grant was very (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and then he was killed in an automobile accident.  He--it was ironic because when I was in the Army I used to kid him about his, his driving and then he actually stopped driving and got himself a driver and was driving to a gig somewhere and ran off the road and he was, he was killed--
Story_ID: 252593
Speaker 1: But, that's when I continued my, my singing from there.  And then I went to Central [Michigan College; Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan] and to show you how things work I had a friend in Detroit [Michigan] who owned, he, he knew the person who owned the club and I came down from Central.  I, I was the only one in my group that had a car, so I drove a group of guys home for the weekend, and when we got home, my friend said, he had arranged an audition for me at a club there in Detroit on 14th [Street] and Davison [Street], and so the guy said he didn't do auditions, but I could, he put me in the spot for the male vocalist that Friday night and he said if I did okay he would think about hiring me.  So, I performed, he said okay I'll hire you, but you gotta go join the union.  I went down on Saturday morning to join the union, and the union office was closed, and they said you can come back on Monday.  My friend said look let's go back to school, drive us back to school, I think they only, they needed a ride back is what they were really pushing for, but if you still wanna come back on Monday then you can do that.  So, that's as close as I came to leaving school to try to pursue a career in singing.  But after I got back to Mount Pleasant [Michigan], I decided that I really should stay there and as I said the rest is history I sort of gave that up.
Speaker 2: Did you have a favorite song, I mean a song that was like a--?
Speaker 1: 'Ebb Tide' was the song that I, I guess if I had anything to hand my hat on that was it.
Speaker 2: That's the Earl Grant record that I remember--
Speaker 1: Yep, that's, that's right.
Speaker 2: --my parents had albums on it yeah.
Speaker 1: He had, he did 'Ebb Tide' that is correct.
Speaker 2: That's the one I was trying to think of.
Speaker 1: That is correct.  So--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: --that, that's my singing career and then as I said I just stayed at Central and continued on.

Speaker 1: One of the things that I say about what happened to me at Central [Michigan College; Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan] because I hadn't been to high, been out of [Hamtramck] High School [Hamtramck, Michigan] for a while and didn't have really very high expectations academically, the first semester I remember at Central I got all Cs, and I was delighted.  Well, about I guess the next semester there were a group of guys about six of them, and Central again being a small school, classes were relatively small, and so we were majoring, all majoring in psychology, and--
Speaker 2: Why psychology?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Why psychology?
Speaker 1: Well, I'm not sure why I picked psychology; it's just that I liked psychology.  It was, it was of interest to me.  I've always been one of these sort of analytical people who liked to try to understand both myself and others, but there were these six people whenever they came into a psychology class and we were rating on a curve in that, in those days, the first five A's would go to these guys and I joined that group and from that time on I never got anything less than an A from the time I was in school, but up until that time I was a C student.  And getting into that group and accepting the challenge--I mean we would study together for hours and, and it was the old joke that we had, we'd all study together until about three in the morning, then everybody would pretend to be tired because now we have everything we're gonna get.  We would support each other up to an A-, but I'm gonna get the A.  So, after three o'clock now I'm gonna get the edge.  We would meet the next day after an exam and we'd have a cup of coffee, everybody's that tired and we'd say why you so tired you went to bed at a reasonable hour.  Well, nobody in that group went to sleep.  We, we would stay up until the last minute so that we could get whatever that extra grade would be.  We would get it.  We were very competitive.  We enjoyed each other.  We knew it, I mean, everybody looked at each other and says we know, we know it.  This is our competition.  All of those guys went on to get Ph.D.'s and they've all done very well for themselves over time, but that's the thing that turned me in, away from just getting a C and it was that you can do better.  I always knew that I could do better, but there was never the motivating force in order to do it and, and these guys, we did it and as I said they were, they were terrific.
Story_ID: 252595
Speaker 1: Now are there any important teachers or people that you ran into at Central Michigan [College; Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Yes, when we arrived at Central there were, there were twelve African American males and no African American females in 1954.  We had a sociology professor named Bernard [N.] Meltzer who I understand still lives in Mount Pleasant [Michigan].  But, he sort of took us under his wing and we also minored in sociology, which is how we got to know him.  But, he sort of took us under his wing and I think helped us adjust to the environment at Central, because it was as I said there were no African American females and then they went out to Saginaw [Michigan] and Flint [Michigan] and found some young ladies that were near to bring up there, but he was a very special person and in a sense helped us all really survive in that environment because it was not a very supportive environment.  You couldn't get a haircut.  You had to go to Saginaw to, had to leave Mount Pleasant and, and drive for an hour in order to, to get, to get a haircut.  The young ladies, the African Americans who roomed, who had white roommates would have to when they would do their hair and somebody would think they were cooking in the rooms.  You could smell the hair of being, being done.  So, it was, it was a very different kind of environment for all of us, but Bernie Meltzer was really helpful in, in, not only was he an instructor for us, but he was, his field was black/white relations and he and I think kept us all on the straight and narrow.  A friend of mine who one of the guys in the group had just graduated from, who had just retired from the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] he went on to get a Ph.D. and by the way this competitive group was a mixed group of black and whites in, in the group and we remain friends over the years and as I said they all went on to do pretty good things and we, we did very well, especially coming from a small schools like, school like Central Michigan.
Speaker 1: Now Bernie Meltzer was he related to Milton Meltzer by any chance who collaborated with Langston Hughes on--?
Speaker 2: I, I don't really know, but as I said he, his field was sociology and it was race relations, was, was his specialty and that's as I said he just took all of us, we just gravitated toward him because he was--in those days people didn't talk a lot about race.
Speaker 1: Milton Meltzer was a co-author with Langston Hughes on the pictorial history of--
Speaker 2: Yeah,
Speaker 1: --of, of African Americans ['A Pictorial History of the Negro in America,' Langston Hughes and Milton Meltzer] or something like that yeah.
Story_ID: 252596
Speaker 1: Well tell me about graduation when you, when you finished your bachelor's degree [at Central Michigan College; Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan] did you, what did you, had you decided at that point to move on to get a Ph.D. or?
Speaker 2: Well, the way it occurred to me I recall thinking midway through my undergraduate and I sang a little prayer that said Lord if you just let me get through this degree I won't bother you anymore.  When I finished the undergraduate,--
Speaker 1: Is that in '58 [1958]?
Speaker 2: This was in '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I finished the undergraduate, I decided that I was interested in psychology and you can't do much in psychology with a ba--with an undergraduate degree.  So then I said well Lord, I'm gonna--if you help me get through a master's degree, now you know I'm not gonna go beyond that 'cause I didn't expect to have a B.A., so now it's really presumptuous to be thinking about a master's degree and so and I wanted to get into psychology and Wayne State [University, Detroit, Michigan] had a program at that time and they were just starting a program in vocational rehabilitation and the person who was running it said you can take all the psychology courses you want, and we have funds to support you.  And so I got a master's degree in vocational rehabilitation counseling and really had not thought about a Ph.D. until one of my instructors at Wayne when I said to him if I were to think about getting a Ph.D. would you be a reference for me?  And he said to me that you know if you're gonna get a master's degree on that specialist, he said I think you'd be fine, but I just don't think you're Ph.D. material and I think my history tells me--(unclear)--, I don't know about that and the reason he said that because I said I was interested in going to [University of] Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], and he said he had gotten his degree from Michigan and he just didn't think that I was Michigan material.  Now, years later when I was a program chairperson at the University of Michigan who should apply for a position here that we had in rehabilitation counseling, but the gentleman who said that he didn't think I was Ph.D. material.  And actually when he met me he said oh you went on from Wayne right?  I said yep.  He said what did you get, did you get a specialist degree?  Nope.  And I was not gonna help him with that.  He said well what did you get?  I said oh I got a Ph.D., didn't you know?  Oh, he said I didn't know that.  In fact I said, in fact I'm the chair of this search committee for the job for which you just applied.  Oh my goodness.  I think he realized that somewhere along the line, somewhere along the line he might have behaved differently, but that was sort of the, I really did not ever expect.  I mean if I go back a number of years and you say did you expect to wind up with a Ph.D., the answer is no.  And I really felt pleased to graduate.  I mean having my mother [Gladys Travis Bates] being the first one in the family to graduate from high school and then to get a bachelor's degree and a master's and eventually Ph.D. meant a great deal, but it was not by, it was not by design or expectation.
Story_ID: 252597
Speaker 1: Now when did your mother [Gladys Travis Bates], now, now I suppose she kept up with you during all this time--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes.
Speaker 1: --even though at long distance.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mother, as I said to you earlier, was a domestic worker.  I think that's mostly what she did most of her life.  When I was going to school at Central [Michigan College; Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan], and tuition was not a lot, that it was not a lot at that time, but there were mornings the day before tuition was due and I didn't have enough for tuition and I would write or call my uncles, relatives.  Everybody had a bad week the week before, would love to help, but couldn't.  There was never a time on a Monday morning when Western Union didn't tell me that I had a money order there from my mother for tuition.  I don't know where this woman got the money from in order to be able to get it to me, but when nobody else, and I was always reluctant to even ask her, but when nobody else came through she was always there.  So, in later years when I was married there was the unwritten rule that the one thing I did not have to discuss with my wife [Cheryl Proctor Bates] or my family is when my mother needed something.  It was a given that she would get it.  It didn't have to be discussed.  There was no discussion because I had no idea where this money came from or how she came.  I had uncles that were working and doing reasonably well who could have sent it, never.  And there I was on Sunday nights saying where am I going to get tuition from for, for Monday, and Monday morning there it was.
Story_ID: 252598
Speaker 1: Now the Ph.D. process we didn't talk about that, but what was your dissertation on for your Ph.D. [at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan]?  What was your--
Speaker 2: I became interested in motivation and my P, my dissertation is on motivation, trying to find out what motivates people and I was more interested in kids and their learning and whether or not how you could get them motivated and I discovered that someone had come up with a theory that, that talked about I think it was related to whether or not you would, you could reinforce a kid best by supporting them personally or by some sort of monetary process and so I structured mine in such a way that I had kids with spelling words and I said you know for every word that you spell correctly you'll get a dime--these were young kids--and so they would go, you know get on that and go very well.  Then for the other, for the other group I said these are good words to know and I think it would be, let's see, let's see if you can learn these words and spell them.  And what I discovered was that, which I found very interesting because I had assumed that kids would learn better for some external force, but in the process I discovered there are kids that are reinforced primarily by personal interactions and these are internal motivation, motivating forces.  And then there are the external ones and that when I found, and I, I measured the kids in terms of, of their sort of personal quotient, those who, who, who could be reinforced more by people versus those who could be reinforced more by, by external forces.  And what I, what I discovered was that if a kid is reinforced more by people then money doesn't make any difference.  And then there are those who are externally motivated and people makes no difference to them.  So, if you get a kid in a classroom you, you need to know, look at them more carefully to see what they're motivated by, and if they have external motivation, you can use all kinds of stuff, but you can't do anything in terms of the personal contact.  Those that have high quotients for personal, personal contact giving them money makes no difference at all.  What makes a difference is people who can reinforce them and so I thought that there would be like a central motivator and what you discovered is you gotta know the personality of the person to know what motivates them and different things motivates different people.
Speaker 1: Did you devise or is there a test to determine what kind of person--
Speaker 2: Well, we, we had--there's a way that you, you could get a quotient, whether you, whether the person was--I can't, for some reason I've lost the, the term, but those that are motivated more by people and those that are motivated more externally, and you couldn't measure that and so I had them and divided them and I looked at them in that manner and then I tried reinforcing, the reinforcements across the personality, and it turns out that as I said for a person who can, for a teacher who could be supportive for the person who is motivated by people will do very well.  But, when you get, like grades for example, grades meant nothing to those people.  You can't tell them you're gonna flunk them, it doesn't matter, but what, what it means to them is that if you withdraw your support that's what matters to them and they need that support, so you really need--a lot of people walk around saying what's reinforcing to people, even at work you say well maybe give them a raise.  Well, for a person with, with a high quotient for personal contact, raise doesn't really, won't do it.  You mean you're doing a tremendous job with this company, we really enjoy you being here.  You see the productivity go up.  But the person who is tied to external, he needs money.
Speaker 1: Does the praise mean anything to that person?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  Praise just won't mean, mean nothing.  It just rolls off like so what.  And so, but, but for a lot of time when I was coming through I thought in the classroom one of the things that we use, we use grades for kids and you could see the kids you say why is you don't mind getting, getting a D.  It doesn't matter.  That's an external motivator, and so I thought that you could use one thing to motivate kids and my, what I came out from my dissertation was you need to know the personality structure of the person before you think about what motivates 'em.
Story_ID: 252599
Speaker 1: In doing this study, did you, can you give us any idea of what proportion people fall into?  I mean how many, what percentage of people are, are internally motivated versus externally?
Speaker 2: No, but I, I think that it's done pretty randomly, but I think it also comes from the way people grow up.  If you look around you'll see very young children saying I need a dime, I need a nickel, I need, or will you do something for me; I will if you give me something.  You, that, that's where you begin to see these differences because in, in others, just because you're you, you know.  Just because you're so supportive of me that that what's get me going versus the person who needs the external one.  And this is why if you're, if you're on a job for example and you say well some of my employees are very productive and some are not, how do I get them motivated?  That's where you gotta know what the personality is.  And what motivates them and not assume that giving everybody money will motivate them.
Speaker 1: One size doesn't fit all.
Speaker 2: Right, absolutely.
Speaker 1: But, what I was asking did you have any, did you have any sense of what the proportion is of people that, I mean, are most people internally motivated or externally motivated?
Speaker 2: Most people are externally motivated because I think that's how we're socialized.  If you do this, you'll get something for it.  There's not, there's not a lot of just because you're you.  So, I think that's why I think the majority of the people tend to be externally motivated.
Speaker 1: I know recently since the maybe the late '80s [1980s], early '90s [1990s] that philosophy, philosophy has been kind of vulgarized in, in the community as you know you find kids talking about getting paid rather--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --than going to work.  I want to get paid.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they never say I wanna do this in order to make a living.  They say I wanna get paid.
Speaker 2: Right.  And I think it's increased, I mean, we, you get into that what's in it for me kind of syndrome.  What do I get out of it is where I think we've arrived, and I think for a lot of kids we, we've probably gone too far in that direction.  That kids learning or doing things just because it's the right thing to do.
Speaker 1: A friend of mine in Ohio, in fact he was president of Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], used to always encourage the students by saying you can have a Cadillac and you can have that big house when you earn your Ph.D. or an MD or become an attorney.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That was the motivation--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, that's what I just said.  I think our culture has, has now really spun more and more of that whereas I think early on when people were closer to each other the, the love and support of someone was much greater than getting money or getting grades for example.  I just found it interesting that the, the threat of a grade very often meant very little to kids who had the internal motivation and says so what, you know.  But, the threat of a teacher being unhappy with you is what it is.  See I think that when I go back to my childhood and I overheard my mother [Gladys Travis Bates] telling her friends how proud she was of me because I was so capable, somewhere built into that was always a notion that I had to continue to do well because that's really when I got more support from my mother, much more support from her and so I think some of that had to do with how I got to where I am because I certainly did not want to disappoint her and I guess as I far as I could tell there was never any major disappointments for her in that regard.
Speaker 1: Do you, do you have a sense of, you may not have actually studied this, but I don't know if, do you have a sense of whether people are come in the world either one way or the other internally motivated or externally motivated or is it socializing that determines or a combination of socialization and, and some natural bent towards some natural disposition towards one way or the other?
Speaker 2: I think if we left it alone most people would be internally motivated.  I think it's only after you see kids at three or four when we start to tell them if you do this, this is what you get and then we start to expect that and then more and more expected.  So, I would say we probably start out probably internally motivated, but it gets socialized down the other track.
Story_ID: 252600
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about this, it just popped into my mind.  There's a discussion we have in Chicago [Illinois] a lot about the Mississippi Syndrome in Chicago and so you know Mississippi is often, is, the Mississippi population in Chicago is huge, Mississippi and Arkansas, Mississippi primarily, and Mississippi has a reputation in other states--(unclear)--I used to send my father to the barbershop and they talk about Mississippi as being the lowest place you can be from and they talk about how bad--well let's pause for just a second.
Speaker 2: All right on the Mississippi Syndrome.
Speaker 1: Yeah Mississippi Syndrome is that people, black people in Mississippi are so, were so deprived at a certain point that when they came into Chicago and Chicago is a business mecca and the theory of some of the Mississippians is when they get to Chicago instead of having ten chains on you, you only have three, so (laughter) you're able to you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I mean, but you're really aggressive about acquisition and so forth because there's nothing that you can have there.  I mean it's so little you can have in Mississippi--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and when you get there you really go after it.
Speaker 2: And what sort of discussion do you have about that?  You, in other words, the chains get identified as sort of the external validation of who you are.
Speaker 1: The chains are those external constraints that keep you from things that other people would, would ordinarily be able to do.  White people in Mississippi wouldn't have the same constraints they could vote.  They could do--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh I see, I got it, I got it, I thought you were talking about the gold chains.
Speaker 1: --you know so when you come out of Mississippi, no, no I'm talking about like actual chains--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of bondage--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know so when, when black folks would come to Chicago with three chains instead of ten--(laughter)--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: So I mean Chicago is not paradise, but it's better than Mississippi was--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --so they go, their, their load is lightened--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, some of this and as you've heard that they say that you can take the man out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the man or woman so to speak, and there, there, there's lots of conditioning that has gone on in the black community that I don't know that we've ever really talked enough about it.  Did you know the old story in the circus that with the elephant that all you had to do was to put just a slight rope on the leg of an elephant and tie it to a pole and they would, they wouldn't try to break it because before that you had a huge one that he couldn't break and then you do that long enough and then you take that off and you just put a shoestring on, he still thinks that it's there and I think that black people in this country have been socialized in a way that we find it very difficult to get rid of all of the chains and, and so for a lot of people as you, as you must know right after slavery when they said you're free, what do you mean, what am I going to do, you know, I don't what freedom is, I know what's all about.  And, and in most of the northern states, Detroit [Michigan], Chicago, New York, you, you've had that.  It's sort of like there's a mentality that it's hard to get over and, and the analogy that I use is relates to the, the house slaves and the field slaves and, and those were differences that somebody thought that the house slaves were better than the field slaves and what we didn't realize is that the commonality is that we're both slaves.  The fact that I'm in the house and you're in the field is almost irrelevant, that nothing else has changed and so we've been socialized over time to a point where it's been very, very difficult to get people, especially those who are fifty and above, to shake some of the things and, and ironically some of its passed, passed along and, and it's picked up so at some point we've gotta get rid of all of that and, and who knows when we're gonna do that, but we perpetuate it and it's been perpetuated that the house slave, field slaves got, got shifted to, to good hair, bad hair, you know, the light skin, dark skin.  All of those were differences 'cause whoever said it years ago that the way you control a people is to find the difference among them, highlight that difference and you can control them forever.  They'll control themselves.  You don't have to control them anymore and now that's a lot of what I think we have when we leave the chains.  We're like the elephant, we still think, we still think it's there.
Story_ID: 252601
Speaker 1: The old story my grandfather [Percy Bates, Sr.] was used tell when we were crabbing you know he'd say that black people are like crabs in a barrel, you don't have to cover it 'cause every time one gets right near the top those claws are interwound, inter, interwoven and they reach up and pull him right back down, you're not, not going anywhere.  One of the things that I used to when I was living in the South even as a child to recognize to where you say to yourself that when you keep a man in a hole, you can keep him there, the problem is and he's not going anywhere, the problem is you're not going anywhere either 'cause you gotta stay there and watch him.  I mean, there, there so many fallacies in, in around racism in, in the South.  I mean when I was six years old and I told you earlier that my mother [Gladys Travis Bates] was a domestic worker how smart do you have to be when you're in the South to hear all the myths about the rift between blacks and whites and how whites feel about blacks and they're not, just not, they're only half human or quarter human, and then you look around as I did and I say what are the things that people pride most, their children and their food.  I says now who's taking care of most of the children, the black mothers, the black women.  And not just taking care of them, they're wet nurses.  Now how can I hate you and turn my child over to you to suckle at your breast, I mean, who are we kidding.  And I say that's hate, my food, if I hate you, if I hate you, you're gonna cook my food, come on.  Now, something is wrong with this picture.  So, even as a child I could say what's going on here.  I mean somebody is manipulating this system, and this isn't real 'cause as I said I knew who was cooking the food and taking care of the babies, so how bad can this be, you know, and, and all the way along the line and this is when I said to you earlier even in the earlier years I, I, I needed to understand things.  I can't learn things until I understand them.  I was telling somebody the other day that, that as a teacher I hear a golf instructor who says to me you gotta hit through the ball.  I said what do you mean hit through the ball?  The ski instructor says keep your weight on the downhill ski.  If you're on skis we're headed downhill, which is the downhill ski, aren't they both.  I mean these are things that people do that I stop and say did you hear what you just said, I mean, if you understand what you just said I just think it's important for anybody's learning that you got to be able to understand what it is.  Once you understand it, then learning to me is instantaneous.  It's not, they say he's a slow learner, he's a slow learner because we haven't put all the pieces together.  You don't learn slowly.  When all the pieces come together, you learn immediately, instantly, but until most, until our schools get to the point where we understand this I just don't think we're going very far, and it's just over and over again you see these things and this is why as a child and even as an adult it's important for me to understand it.  And when I understand it, then I know what it is, but just to hear it and to see people assuming I understand it doesn't go anywhere.

Speaker 1: Well tell me about your career now when, when you, now after you got your Ph.D. what did you, where did you go next with your career?
Speaker 2: I was, I got my Ph.D. at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] and at that time we had a rule that we didn't hire our own Ph.D.'s, but that was in 1968 we were right in the middle of a frantic search for minority persons.  In fact, we had just had a student strike here on campus and I had been teaching while I was working on my degree, and the dean said didn't make much sense for him, for me to go someplace else while he's looking for minority professors.
Speaker 1: Let me put this in perspective a bit.  This is like '68 [1968], this is right after the or just before the assassination of [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  He was assassinated--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: -in '68 [1968].  A lot of students are calling for reform on campus and black studies programs.
Speaker 2: Oh, we shut down the, the University of Michigan was shut down.  It was called the BAM strike, the Black Action Movement, and the university both black and white students was shut down completely, and we had, they had placed ten demands on the table, one of which was to increase the minority faculty and students on campus and that's when I became an assistant professor here at the university.  When I moved from that to I was a program head, I became an assistant dean with a couple of deans, in the end of the [President James Earl "Jimmy"] Carter [Jr.] administration I was appointed as a deputy assistant secretary in the U.S. Office of Education [U.S. Department of Education] and I took a leave of absence from the university and when I left that, then I came back here.  In addition to that, I've been involved in athletics here on campus.  I'm also the, what's called the faculty athletic representative for the university to the Big Ten [Conference] and the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association].  So, I've been doing that now for about fifteen years as well.
Story_ID: 252603
Speaker 1: Let me go back to the student strike [at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], so you were appointed an assistant professor at that point--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --right after the student strike?  Now you were perfor- appointed a professor in the education department?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you taught--
Speaker 2: I taught special education, school psychology--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which was my specialty areas--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay and were you any kind of advisor to students during that period of time?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I was an advisor to undergraduate master's [degree] and doctoral students.  I was also very involved with the students generally on campus who was involved in the Black Action Movement [BAM], and that was I thought was very successful.  I think we, unlike other places where they had student riots and like, we did not have that here. We had more of an orderly arrangement where the president sat down with the students and negotiated the ten demands, and it worked out really, really well.
Speaker 1: Who were the students during those days and can you remember any of their personalities and who was the president and what was he like?
Speaker 2: Well, the president was Robben [Wright] Fleming and I have now been here, I started, I taught my first course in '65 [1965], and I think I've now had let's see I came here 1, 2, 3, I think this is my seventh president now that I've seen.  Robben Fleming was, was and still is my favorite.  He came to us from [University of] Wisconsin[-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin] with a background in labor negotiations, and when students had demands he knew how to negotiate with them.  And in those dose the student strategy was the get the adults, really to get under their skin, skin and get them upset and President Fleming just simply said let's get to the table, let's negotiate all the other stuff is really a distraction.  In fact, etched in my memory is that the students wrote him, no he wrote the students a note and it was handwritten.  He bought it out to them, right out of his house, and they were all lined up outside, and it was handwritten.  The student looked at it and said this is handwritten, not, you really don't think much of us.  And he said oh I thought that would be much more personable, but if you'd rather have it typed.  And the student took the note, rolled it up, and threw it in his chest and he reached down, picked it up, and he said if you'd like to have it typed I'll go back and we'll have it typed.  He went right back inside, got it typed, and brought it back out.  The governing body got somewhat upset with him because they thought that he was not tough enough, and his message to them was you hired me to run the university, I'm running the university the way I think it ought to be run.  When this is over, we can sit down and talk.  Now, there were rumors that at time that suggested that the board of regents were getting upset and they might want to get rid of him and if they had, I mean I have never observed a teaching lesson and where people interacted where the students gained respect for him.  One night there was, he had promised that he would not release anything to the press that had been, that they had discussed.  The newspapers got something, got wind of something, they published it.  He went over to our Rackham Graduate School [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] with a mass meeting, stood before the students, and he said I know I told you that nothing would get out.  He said something got out and I'm here tonight to apologize to you for that.  Now, this, their admiration for this man was growing by leaps and bounds, so when, when you get to something, when you get to something like that as I said he, it was a good experience for the students, it was a good experience for everybody involved.

Speaker 1: I was asking you about the students [at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who were involved in it [Black Action Movement (BAM)] and what they--
Speaker 2: As I said, I, I don't know that I remember the names of some of the, but the leaders were in my view, I mean that was a time when you were really taking a risk.  You didn't know whether you'd get kicked out of the university, but they were committed enough to--(unclear)--they were very, very bright.  I know that Elliott Hall who was a vice president at Ford Motor Company his daughter was one of the people who has now gone on.  She's a, she's a lawyer, and so they, they, they were very unusual students and I think with the combination with the president [Robben Wright Fleming], and as I said as I think about over the range of presidents that we've had, a few of them would have been able to manage the way, the way he did.  We had, in fact there was a group of militants who came from Chicago [Illinois] and wanted to join us.  The students say we don't, we don't need that.  We had a local very conservative sheriff who showed up on campus to support the president, and he met him right down the street there and said we don't need you on campus this is our problem, we're gonna deal with it.  So, it, it really was, and I'm, I'm surprised that more has not been done around that activity because as I said it was really I think a marvelous lesson both for the students and for the university, 'cause you remember schools like Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin] they were rioting.  There were fires and so forth.  We had none of that here.

Speaker 1: Tell me about working for the U.S. Department of Education [U.S. Office of Education] during the [President James Earl "Jimmy"] Carter [Jr.] administration.
Speaker 2: I was a professor in special education at the time [at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], and I got a call from someone that asked if I would be interested in, in going to Washington [D.C.] if asked to do so, and of course I thought that to be quite an honor and I agreed and went down through all of this stuff that you go through in order to, to be appointed and you get grilled and heavily interviewed and I was, I was only there, it was the end of the Carter administration, so about a period of a year, a little less when--
Speaker 1: Since 1979 I guess or so.
Speaker 2: Correct, '79 [1979], '80 [1980] is when I went down and took a leave from the university and I was assistant secretary, deputy assistant secretary in the Office of Education and was in charge of the Office of Special Education [Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services] at that time that handled, you know, gifted kids, kids with learning problems, behavioral problems, et cetera, and that was the role that I had there.
Story_ID: 252606
Speaker 1: This special role that you play now you've been doing this I think for through, through the early part of the '90s [1990s] I guess representing the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] with the Big Ten [Conference]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --with the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: So what do you actually do as a faculty representative from the school?
Speaker 2: Well, the, as a condition membership in the Big Ten Conference, each per, each school must designate a faculty person to, to be their representative.  The, the theory behind it is that in the early days when we were first starting intercollegiate athletics the faculties on campuses did not want to get involved in, in it and with under pressure they said okay we'll agree with it as long as the faculty is in control of it.  So, now you can see where it is now I think television is in control of, of it, but the intent was to have the faculty manage intercollegiate athletics and so as a requirement of membership you still have to have a faculty member who represents the university in matter of voting, rule, making rules and all that sort of stuff and so in addition to the conference that you ran you also a representative for the university for the NCAA, so legislation, rules, all of that comes by way of the faculty athletic representative.  I have to for example sign off on the eligibility list for all of our programs.  Now that's in conjunction with the registrar's office we have to go through to make sure all the grades are right, that everybody is eligible, and then we both have to sign off on it so that each time a team participates at the beginning of a season we have to have a list of eligible students who can participate and I have to sign off on that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're kind of the police on that part of it--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so if a person is academically ineligible and they're found playing then it's--
Speaker 2: Then that's, that's my fault.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right and how has the University of Michigan done in that regard and how was it before you took over and have you been able to improve it?
Speaker 2: No I think, I don't know that we've improved it, but we've sort of maintained a level, I think, that few other schools have attained.  I've been doing this for fifteen years, but as far as I know the history we've only had two major violations.  When I first came into it fifteen years ago, we had a violation in hockey where as I understand it that the coach was selling things and using the money to get to the students and then the only one was with the Fab Five that we had just a few years, that we just recently gotten you know managed.  Other than that, we've not had any major violations, so we've been actually pretty good in the process except for those two and of course the, the basketball one was a major one.  There was lots of money involved and we just somehow didn't, didn't catch it.  I think we all got caught up in the Fab Five and these freshmen coming in and going to the final four and with all that hoopla I think we lost sight of what was going on, and we, we've learned a lesson from that, that even when there's hoopla you have to go behind the scenes to find out what's really going on, and we've tightened up the rules.  I mean we used to have in, in the [Crisler] Arena [Crisler Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan] you know we have a tunnel where the players and people go in we don't do that anymore.  You gotta be, we gotta, anybody who comes through that tunnel we know who they are, so they're no boosters with money and whatever coming through there.  We've tightened it up and we've actually as I said done a pretty good job with exceptions of those two cases, so I, I think I'm pleased with our accomplishments.
Story_ID: 252607
Speaker 1: What's the graduation rate like for black athletes that come to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]?  Is it, is it--?
Speaker 2: It's not where we would like for it to be.  Now, the graduation rate is only an issue in basketball and football, and it's better in football than basketball.  Basketball we can't get a grip on it because they come and they leave.  They come, they got you know and some stay one year and leave, some stay two years and leave.
Speaker 1: If they're real good, they can be drafted by the NBA [National Basketball Association] right out.
Speaker 2: The better they are the less likely they are to stay is, is the way it goes and so we are constantly working to try to improve that, but I mean in football when a kid becomes a senior and they go to a bowl game, then they go to [NFL Scouting] Combine and you may not see them again.  Well, that's not somebody who graduates, I mean, we read about the Isaiah Thomas' or the one we had Juwan Howard who promised his grandmother that he was gonna graduate.  But, when you, when you looking at X million plus a degree unless you've promised somebody you're gonna do it, they're certainly not there to help you get a good job 'cause you already have a good job and so some of that is the real struggle and what I do and when I kid comes in being recruited and very often I will talk to them and I say look here's the situation.  We are going to use your ath- your athletic ability, there's no question about that, that's, that's part of the exchange, but in exchange for that we're capable of giving you as good of an education as you can get anywhere in the world and it's your responsibility and my responsibility to see that you hold us to our end of the bargain.  There is no question every Saturday or every night when your dribbling the ball you're gonna be on display and we're gonna use that, that talent, but we have an exchange; that's what this is about.  And, and I tell them and, and, and between me and them is to try and help you get that.  And it's a tough sell, I mean it's a tough sell because these kids walk through the door with people that have been giving them stuff on platter.  I mean one of our basketball players said to me one time from the time I was in the eighth grade and taller than everybody else people have been doing things for me.  I didn't ask them to do it, but somehow they start doing it.  That's what makes it so tough and, and when I first as a faculty member got involved in this, I thought the universities were not doing enough to support the student athletes.  Well, sometimes we do too much for them and it's not a matter of the university it's getting the kids to get out of bed to go to class. I mean sometimes that's your hardest job because it's just not an easy thing because so many of these kids do not start out thinking I wanna get an education.  They see college as a way, as a stage to get to the pros.
Speaker 1: External-
Speaker 2: One of our athletes one time, I think it was Robert Traylor, at this signing, Robert said oh I think I'll be at Michigan maybe a year, maybe two.  I said Robert we don't give degrees in two years, I mean how can you do that?  You know he looked at me with this look on his face like where's this guy coming from.  But, part of the idea is to say that it's a stage for that and, and, and I try as hard as I can to say listen look what you're missing here.  There is an opportunity here and not only are we doing it because we want to, we're doing it because we owe it to you.  This is a tradeoff here.  You give us this, then we'll give you this.  That's what this is about, and, and to get their attention over to say I want to do it it's absolutely amazing and some of them--I had a student who broke his leg who said to me afterwards he said you know it's only after I had time to sit back and look and look around to see all the resources that are available to me, and he says and, and, and I was not taking advantage of it.  You know he said--
Speaker 1: Yeah the University of Michigan is a fantastic institution.
Speaker 2: It's all here.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, he said and I didn't know where most of it was, but when I broke my leg I had time to look around and stop, you know.  You're not getting ready for a game, you're not practicing, you're not, and in between you try to study a little bit, but from, from his vantage point, now that I've slowed down I can see there's a lot more here to this than what I thought.
Story_ID: 252608
Speaker 1: But, this is an interesting--and I have to tell you that for my role as a faculty athletic rep [representative at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] it's, it's, it's, a dual role.  It's one to serve the purpose, but I also feel a special obligation to the African American student athletes to try to get them to understand that you know the only thing between them and poverty is a busted knee, that's all you need, and, and, and you go nowhere, and, and then you have no education and a busted knee and now where do you go.  And, and to get them to really understand and this is why sometimes when kids get hurt is when they realize that this could happen, this could happen and I would not get that contract and then where am I.  That's when I think it, it's, it, it's driven home to them.
Speaker 2: Do you think as I heard you, hear you talk about this, do you think there should be some sort of workmen's compensation almost agreement with student athletes where if they agree to come to a school and, and they commit to play on these teams where their, their talent is exploited and they get hurt, should there be some sort of commitment on the part of the school to, to still follow through to help them complete their degrees?
Speaker 1: Oh sure and with that, that we do.  The, the student is on a scholarship and they get hurt they keep their scholarship and that commitment is there.  The other part has to do with the way insurance works.  If, if you have a product that's good enough to sell, the insurance company will insure it.  We have these, these, these, the blue chip athletes who actually have insurance, but that's all predicated on the fact that once they're done and they have these multi-million dollar contracts they can then cover whatever the cost of that insurance is.  It's like going to a bank and the bank says, says I'm gonna make a lot of money one of these days are you willing to back that up.  The bank says yeah, I mean I'll back that up.  Now the bank is taking the risk 'cause if you don't make it you know there's a problem and now the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] can also cover some of the insurance or they can back up, back it up, so that some of these student athletes really do have insurance, but you gotta be at a level where the insurance company recognizes that you have something you know that they in fact can insure.
Speaker 2: But, it's not something that the university guarantees--
Speaker 1: No, no, no.
Speaker 2: --anybody that plays for them.
Speaker 1: No, the only guarantee it has to do with the scholarship--
Speaker 2: Scholarships.
Speaker 1: --and the education part of it.
Story_ID: 252609
Speaker 1: Tell me what, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, my cer- my, the greatest concern that I have has to do with what we call the achievement gap that, that we simply are not doing much along that line, and the kids seem to be getting further and further away from it and just getting the kids I think to understand that an education makes sense.  That's the greatest concern that I have.  Beyond that, I think we're just losing kids.  I mean, you know, this is--Bill Cosby talks about it, this is what a lot of people are talking about and as an educator it's just frustrating not to be to anything about it.  When you look at a city like Detroit [Michigan], you know, I mean the dropout rate, the achievement gap it's just horrendous.
Story_ID: 252610
Speaker 1: What did you think of Bill Cosby's remarks?  I mean did you think that--he was widely criticized and then some you know then praised by others, but what did you, did you think?
Speaker 2: Well, I wrote a little piece for The Detroit News.  They called me and asked me about it, and I said one I thought that what he said was on target and that it needed to be said and it needed to be said by someone that someone would listen to.  My disagreement with him is that he focused on those with the least amount of resources.  I would have been much more comfortable had he focused on the black community as well that we all have a role to play in this.  As many blacks desert Detroit [Michigan] to get to the suburbs as whites, and that what you have left with the people with the least amount of resources and then you expect them to pull themselves up by the bootstraps and it can't be done.  And my belief is that, that's, that's the responsibility of the total black community, not just those who are left and as I said I tried to say that, that it's okay what he said, it's a group for me that he's focusing on.  That if he had said that black people need to rally around and get your act together I, I applaud him wholeheartedly, but you can't zero in on those with the least amount and, and expect them to be able to do anything when those who have "made it a little bit" decide I'm like everybody else and, and run off and leave them and then turn around and blame them for their inability to go anywhere.  That's my disagreement with Cosby, which they published last week in the Detroit News.
Story_ID: 252611
Speaker 1: Tell me when you look back on, on your career thus far and you're still, you're still teaching [at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] is there, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I, I think that my career what I did was developed on the basis of what my personality and what I could do.  My fantasy sometimes is that I might have been more of an activist and to get right into the community and do more directly.  What I've tried to do has been more indirect, and, but I think that's because of who I am as to why I did it that way, and then as I said when I reflect upon it sometime and I say well maybe I could have affected more people and done more had it been more direct.  That would be the only kind of regret that I would have, but I would, I'd wind up seeing that as a choice that I, I chose to go that way and to try to do it in another way.
Story_ID: 252612
Speaker 1: Now have you been here longer than any other black faculty member at the school [University of Michigan School of Education, Ann Arbor, Michigan] would you say?
Speaker 2: Oh, certainly within the school that I'm in.  There's nobody there that, in fact [HistoryMaker Charles D.] Moody [Sr.] was there for I don't know how long, but I was there when he came and so, and I'm pretty close to being here longer than any black on campus, at least in the academic arena.  I don't think of anybody that was here academically when I came.  They've all, they've all left.
Story_ID: 252613
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look back on everything you've done up to this point what would you consider to be your legacy at this point?
Speaker 2: My legacy is that every black student or any black student on this campus [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] who feels that they have been mistreated somehow make their way to me, and sometimes people say well how did they get over in education, they're not students in education.  Somebody sort of says go and talk to [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Percy] Bates if you feel that way, and so I think the legacy that I leave would be that I've been a very good support system for the black students on this campus, not just in my unit, but on this campus, and I think it's been sorely needed.  I mean, I think there is, there's nothing like having a feeling that there's somebody I can go to versus I don't know what to do, there's nobody here that'll listen to me.
Story_ID: 252614
Speaker 1: The thing that I would say about affirmative action, and I, I said this I guess shortly after we [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] had the court order [Gratz v. Bollinger, 2003], the order from the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  There have been a few places where I've worked where I felt really proud of that place and the effort that they put into the affirmative action.  I mean, we had signals all along that said you guys are wasting your time.  I mean some of the best legal minds in the county said don't do it, just give in, do what they tell you to do and the people said we've started down this road and we just not gonna stop.  They had reason to stop, I mean, some alumnus were yelling what are you doing.  I'm not sure the faculty was necessarily that supportive, I mean 100 percent behind it, but the administration said this was the thing to do and we're gonna go with it, so I've said publicly that it's one of the few places where I've worked where I could stand up and say I'm really proud that I work there.  I'm a firm supporter of affirmative action.  I am also a supporter of people when given the opportunity will put in the effort.  I say to students black or white students on this campus that I will do whatever I can to help you, but you gotta work at it.  You can't come in and say breathe a sigh of relief because you have a black professor.  That's not gonna help you.  I will only help you if you're willing to work, and so most people view affirmative action as giving someone something.  I view affirmative action as saying give me a chance.  If you give me a chance, I'll work at it, I'll make it work, and as I said I just this whole notion when I hear people say why do you blame me I didn't have anything to do with it.  I'm not blaming anybody, I'm just simply saying we didn't start at the same place, and, and you can't put a sack of sand on my back on a 100 yard dash and, and expect me to race you to the end of the line.  Take that off.  Give me a shot at running, that's all I'm asking you.  And, and for the kids who come here when they get here I say the same thing to them.  Just because you're here now doesn't mean you don't have to work.  You're gonna have to prove that having taken that sack off that now you can catch up, and you can help run this, and you can run this race.  And so from that point of view we are, we are fighting it, I'm a supporter of it.  We have another, now they wanna have it, we have an initiative to put it on the ballot, to put it up to the state.  We're gonna fight, we're gonna fight that one as well and so we'll just keep fighting it because as I said I see this as one of the premiere universities in this state and certainly minorities ought to have an opportunity to attend this university.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: As I said it's not, it, it may look like a private institution, but it's a public institution.

Speaker 1: Tell us about your family now.  We've haven't, we haven't talked about your family.
Speaker 2: I have a son and a daughter, and my daughter has two girls, fifteen and twelve.  My son has a daughter who is now just about a year old.  That's my immediate family here in Ann Arbor [Michigan].  Both children are here in Ann Arbor, all the grandchildren are right here in Ann Arbor, and I see them on a regular basis and I spend lots and lots of time with them.  We go skiing together.  We play golf together.  We play tennis together, so we do lots together and my daughter went to [University of] Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] got a B.A.  My son went to Eastern [Michigan University, Ypsilanti, Michigan] got a B.A, came to Michigan got a M.S.W, and now we're trying to get the girls, one in high school, ready to go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we'll keep it moving.
Speaker 1: All right, now did your mother [Gladys Travis Bates] get a chance to see you become a Ph.D.?  Did she?  Did she?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, what did she, how did she feel about that?
Speaker 2: She called me [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Percy] Bates even when I told her not to.  She still called me Dr. Bates, so she was very pleased and very proud of that, that accomplishment and as I said I, I, I give her credit for a good portion of it.
Story_ID: 252616
Speaker 1: Is there anything we haven't asked you, you think that you should, you should address or?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  I, I think you've covered lots of ground in this process.
Speaker 1: Okay, there's probably always something we--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --could ask, but my last question is similar to legacy, but different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That's an interesting, interesting question.  My kids kid me a lot about wanting to be, to be a teacher.  I find if we're on the ski slopes and somebody falls I need, I am drawn to them to stop and help them and to show them what they're doing wrong.  No matter where I am, where if there's something that I can do and I know and they're not doing it right, I, I'd like to, to stop and to try to help them do it.  And so my kids often say to me do you know them?  I said now I don't know them I just feel that I can help and I believe that I will be remembered in that manner.  One of my students who has gone on to be fairly successful now is setting up a scholarship in my name, and it's interesting to me that she feels that I was instrumental in her success and in her growth and development and that I mentored her.  I don't have a memory, a vivid memory of what that interaction was, but whatever happened she feels that I mentored her and mentored her well and then her son came here [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] and she wanted to make sure that I had an opportunity to interact with him and to mentor him to some degree as well.  So, when I think about it, that, that's the way I think I would like to be remembered as, as someone who is always willing to help.

Speaker 2: I'm right in the, in the middle there.
Speaker 1: Right here?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's me right there.
Speaker 1: This is a meeting in Cleveland [Ohio] of the, that was the local association of black school educators and I'd participated on a panel, and that's me with the coffee cup there.  We just finished our presentations and someone decided to snap me while I was having a sip of coffee.
Speaker 2: This one is from '99 [1999], another show from the Orange Bowl.

Speaker 2: Now this is a picture of my first year on the faculty at the University of Michigan, and the person on my life there was my faculty advisor while I was working on my degree and he was advisor and a colleague.  He's now somewhere in California.
Speaker 1: This is a picture was taken last November at the NASBE [National Alliance of Black School Educators] convention.  The fellow on my left is almost a lifelong friend.  That's Hugh [J.] Scott on the left as I face it, and he was a dean of education at Hunter College [New York, New York] and just recently retired and blocking on the young man on the, the right who was my competitor in the quarter mile when we were in high school out of Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 2: This is a picture with me and some little kids, and I don't know where we were except I was very young and probably in my first few years as a professor at the University of Michigan.  I pulled that out this morning and said I don't remember where that was.  It was a tent behind us, and it's obviously winter 'cause I have a topcoat on.  I think there's a year on that picture though at the top.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE:  What was the date again?
Speaker 2: March 1963.
Speaker 1: Aaron, Aaron, Aaron.  The guy in the picture I could remember his name was Aaron.  This is at the U.S. Open Tennis Tournament [U.S. Open Tennis Championships, New York, New York] in about 2000, just sort of standing outside.
Speaker 2: And here I am at home just chatting on the phone and somebody decided to take a picture.  That's probably in 2003.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my current staff in my office.  I direct a project called the Programs of Education Opportunity [sic. Programs for Educational Opportunity (POE)], and that's my staff with me in the middle of the group.  That was our holiday party.
Speaker 2: This is a picture that I have cherished over time.  This is when Wilbur [J.] Cohen, who was the head of HEW [U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services] in the [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy administration, was dean in the [University of Michigan] School of Education [Ann Arbor, Michigan], and this was the executive committee and I am on the right there just in front of the person with the checkered coat and he gave us all a copy of that picture with best wishes from Wilbur Cohen who is now deceased, but he was a great man.
Speaker 1: This is a picture with Rod Paige who is currently stepping down as the [U.S.] secretary of education, and I was invited to participate on his commission on opportunity in athletics for the study of Title IX [Title IX Commission on Opportunities in Athletics], and that was a photo opportunity that he afforded the members of that commission.
Speaker 2: Just this past year?
Speaker 1: This past year we just finished.
Speaker 2: This is a, is a friend in the foreground is a longtime friend of my from the time I was in graduate school and as you can see it goes back quite a ways 'cause I was a relatively young man and I'm on the right there.
Speaker 1: This is another photo opportunity that has to do with the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association].  Vice President [Dick] Cheney spoke to a group of us who were in the executive committee for the NCAA and afterwards we had a chance to, to chat with him a bit and to get a photo with him.
Speaker 2: This is the Greater Flint Afro-American Hall of Fame [Flint, Michigan].  A group of men from Flint [Michigan] decided to recognize a number of African Americans who participated in Flint who were great athletes, but came along at a time when they were not going to college, they were not being recruited, and they've created the Afro-American Hall of Fame and I've been very supportive of their operation and have worked with them since they started.  And last year they gave awards to both Michigan and Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan], and I was there to accept the award for the University of Michigan and the gentleman in the middle accepted for Michigan State.  And this gentleman [Don Williamson] on the left is, was the mayor then of the City of Flint.  That was in February of this, of '04 [2004].
