Story_ID: 656414
Speaker 1: So we're going to start with some very simple questions, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Pink.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Well, I like sweets, probably chocolate, if you consider that a food (laughter).
Speaker 1: And when you go on vacation, do you have a favorite destination (clears throat)?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: (Clears throat) What about the time of the year?  Which time of the year do you like the best?
Speaker 2: I like early fall, late summer, early fall to travel.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, I--going to paraphrase [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou's, "I wouldn't take nothing for my journey."
Story_ID: 656415
Speaker 1: Let's start with talking about (clears throat) what you know about your family history. And so we're going to start on your mother's side, okay.  So tell me your mother's name, spell it for me and when and where she was born.
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Freddie Mae Williams, Freddie Mae Jones Williams and, F-R-E-D-D-I-E, M-A-E, J-O-N-E-S, W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S, and she was born in Waynesboro, Georgia, Burke County.
Speaker 1: Do you know what year she was born?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  I'd have to refer to my husband [Edwards Maynor's second husband, William Maynor] (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's okay and--all right.  So did your mother share any stories about her growing up with you?
Speaker 2: Yes, very few.  She was a quiet spirit, you know.  She didn't talk much about her childhood, but we learned to live her childhood because every summer we would visit her hometown in Waynesboro, and we do know that she left--her family moved from Burke County very early due to some issue with my grandfather [Fred Jones] and some of the, I guess, white residents in Burke County.  The story that we were told because his--he was biracial and I think there were some issues there that caused them to have to leave the county and move to Savannah [Georgia], and she was very focused on education and she would tell us about her having to teach the other children in the school and that it was like her, like she was being a teacher at a very early age.  So we do know that about her but mostly she was quiet, quiet spirit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your grandparents.  Tell me their names and what you know about them.
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was Gertrude Jones, Gertrude Hankerson Jones and G-E-R-T-R-U-D-E, H-A-N-K-E-R-S-O-N, J-O-N-E-S.  She was a petite, chocolate brown lady, very pretentious, she loved to dress up, and she loved red lipstick.  She was not your domestic type of person.  She was kind of prissy and I think it partly had a lot to do with her upbringing because from what we understand, her father, Tillman Hankerson [Tillman Hankerson, Sr.], was one of the largest landowners in Burke County.  In fact his will is on file at the courthouse today and, so I don't think she, I think she lived a rather, rather privileged life because she didn't work.  Just a number of things you would think a mother, a woman would do during her time, she didn't do and when they moved to Savannah, my mother's family stayed here for a short period of time, and they all migrated to Boston, Massachusetts.  So she was the only sibling left in Savannah and I guess that was partly due to the fact that she was married to my father [John Williams, Sr.] and by that time, I guess, she maybe had about four or five children.
Speaker 1: Do you know how her father acquired the land that he had?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  You know, you have these oral stories that your relatives would tell you that he supposedly came to the states from South America, they say Puerto Rico, somewhere, I'm not sure, but he is listed in the Burke County records as being a mulatto.  So they tend to think that he may have been a privileged person and that's how he acquired the property that he had.
Story_ID: 656416
Speaker 1: So let's talk about your dad's side of the family.  Tell me your father's name and when and where he was born.
Speaker 2: My father's name is John Roger Williams [John Williams, Sr.], J-O-H-N, R-O-G-E-R, W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S.  He was born in Burke County [Georgia], also, but the town he lived in was Sardis, Georgia.  Now his side of the family is somewhat of a mystery because my grandfather's name was William Henry Williams [William Williams] and, in fact, my grandfather and my husband [Edwards Maynor's second husband, William Maynor] (laughter) have the same name except for the last name.  And so, he spelled his name, W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S [sic.], H-E-N-R-Y, W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S, and we don't know much about him and my grandmother, but I don't know, didn't know much about her.  When she, when I was born, I think she was deceased.  I don't rem- I don't have any recollection of her.  I understand that she was quite a matriarch, and it appears as if she was in charge of the family that my father's father apparently may have been absent from the home, and we never got our--his siblings to talk about him.  My daddy's youngest sister [Lucy Williams West], who lived to be about ninety-three, we would ask her questions about him, but she would never, you know, was always very--nothing, but they talked a lot about her mother and they were A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal], and I do know that she was very active in Bethel A.M.E. Church [Savannah, Georgia] and had a lot to do with the organizations in the church--very spiritual person.  Other than that, that's mostly stories I know and that she baked very good sugar cookies (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Ida, Ida Sapp Williams.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  All right, so let's now (clears throat)--oh, and your father's, your father had how many siblings?
Speaker 2: I think it was about twelve of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your mother [Freddie Mae Jones Williams], how many siblings did she have?
Speaker 2: It was six of them.
Story_ID: 656417
Speaker 1: So let's talk about you.  What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Oh, I have plenty of those.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, you know, growing up in a segregated time, you had to make do with a lot of things, create a lot of things.  I was very inquisitive, liked to talk to adults, liked to read, daydream about things and I remember having to drink from a colored water fountain, white water fountain, learning that there was a difference in the privileges that we had as, you know, versus what others had and going into stores and realizing that you were limited in what you could do, gave you the courage, I would say, to realize that you had to be better than, better than most.
Speaker 1: Was there an incident that you can remember, something that stands out in your mind that happens, that happened early on in your life?
Speaker 2: I recall being in Sears department store [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] and coming out and going, this is when I realized that I couldn't drink from the same fountain, and we're about to approach the fountain that said white only and was told by--they had attendants in the stores, (clears throat) in the one, in the Sears that we had here in Savannah [Georgia] and came over and said to me, "You can't drink from that fountain," and I couldn't real- understand why and then my mother [Freddie Mae Jones Williams] explained to me, you know, that's because you are colored and they are white and I, you know, that left an impression that I knew that at some point in time that some change had to come about.  I wasn't active (clears throat) in the Civil Rights Movement because our parents feared that our, for our safety but I was vocal when it came to getting prepared to vote and participated in the voters rights activity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We'll, we'll talk about that a little later, okay.
Story_ID: 656418
Speaker 1: So tell me how many siblings you had and if you could name them and the, you know, and the order and where you fit in?
Speaker 2: Okay.  There were nine of us.  I'm number seven.  My older sister's name is Jean Margaret Williams Golden [Jean Williams Golden].  My oldest brother's name is John Roger Williams, Jr. [John Williams, Jr.].  The second, the third sibling is Helen Delore- Delores Williams Tindal [Helen Williams Tindal].  The fourth sibling is Roland Edward Williams [Roland Williams].  The fifth sibling is Lee Watts Williams [Lee Williams].  The sixth sibling is--was Alvin Carl Rufus Williams [Alvin Williams], he's deceased.  The seventh sibling is Virginia Ann Williams [HistoryMaker Virginia Edwards Maynor].  The eighth sibling is Marcia Willett Williams Anderson [Marcia Williams Anderson] and the ninth sibling is Yvonne Curry, Williams Curry [Yvonne Williams Curry].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had a house full of fun.
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Story_ID: 656419
Speaker 1: So tell me what life was like growing up in your house.  Can you describe the house, and do you remember the address where you grew up?
Speaker 2: Yes, in fact I have a picture of the house that I, where I was born.  My parents lived on the Eastside prior to my birth and they lived 21 Culver Street and then they moved to the Westside to 2201 Ogeechee Road and I was born there April 1, 1945 and the--we lived there until I was four and from that point we moved to Cann Park [Savannah, Georgia] which is where Beach High School [Alfred E. Beach High School] is located.  The elementary schools were not within--in the neighborhood, initially, when I started elementary school.  We had to walk about, I would say, three miles or more to school and then in 1953, they built an elementary school, DeRenne Elementary School [George W. DeRenne Elementary School; George W. DeRenne Middle School, Savannah, Georgia] in our neighborhood and I attended that elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So describe the house that you grew up in and the neighborhood in which you lived.
Speaker 2: Mostly Cann Park.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I grew up in Cann Park, and the house that I lived in was a modest home.  My parents were blue collar workers so we were not in, wasn't in--not an elaborate home, but it was a home that--where we felt loved, it was warm, a lot of excitement because there were nine of us there for a while.  My oldest sisters and siblings were all gone by the time I graduated from high school in 1963, so I became the eldest.  I was the baby for six years, and I would guess I was comfortable in that spot until I got knocked to the side with Marcia [Marcia Williams Anderson] (laughter), but we were loved.  It was a very disciplined home.  My father [John Williams, Sr.] was a--very, very present in our lives, and he ruled.  My mother [Freddie Mae Jones Williams] was very strict also, so I came up in a very strict environment.  One of the things I appreciate more than anything, the encouragement that we were given along with the love and the insight of our life in general, what we needed to do to prepare ourselves as we grew older and some of the challenges that we would face.  My father was an automobile painter, and my mother was mostly a housewife, you know, occasionally she worked but not all, not all--very often that she worked.
Speaker 1: When she did work, what type of work did she do?
Speaker 2: Some was domestic and then she eventually worked in a doctor's office as, not a, not as a medical assistant but as a receptionist.
Speaker 1: What--how much education did your mother and father have?
Speaker 2: Both finished high school.
Story_ID: 656420
Speaker 1: So if you were to walk a square block around where you lived, tell me who lived there, what stores and who owned the stores, who some of your friends were, and what their parents did for a living, if you know?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Well, let's see.  I lived next door to my high school math teacher which was a very good relationship, but I didn't enjoy math, so I had to (laughter) separate my dislike of math from him as a neighbor, and he had two sons, Edward Bruce McLean [ph.] and Alphonso McLean [ph.], and Alphonso was the oldest, and he was probably the age of my brother, Roland [Roland Williams], which is about seventy-eight, and Edward was my age, close.  We were contemporaries, and his mother was a teacher.  Then there were the Burns [ph.] family who were, I guess, just blue collar workers, and Mr. Burns was a hunter.  He had a duck pond which I did not like because when I went in the yard I had to smell the ducks and all this stuff, so there were times I'd get in trouble because I would disturb the ducks.  Then we had a confectionary in the, in the neighborhood.  Ms. Maisy Davis [ph.], she was very nosy, so (laughter) whenever kids went into the store to purchase things, she would question you about your family business or any other neighbor business.  So there was this day that I really was upset with her, you know.  We were friends, supposedly, and I would take her news (laughter), which I wasn't supposed to do, but this day she asked me a question about something, and I didn't want to answer it and, so when I left her store, I got upset with her so I--she had beautiful flowers.  In fact, in the neighborhood, everybody planted flowers.  There were flowers on the porches.  On Saturdays, people were out doing yard work, gardening and that kind of stuff.  So I knew she loved her flowers.  So I decided I'd just pull some of them out and take them home and plant them in my yard.  I didn't know a neighbor saw me and told her, so by the time I got home and planted them in the yard, she called my mother [Freddie Mae Jones Williams].  So my mother asked me, did I take Ms. Davis' flowers.  I told her, no, but now those flowers that I planted were not in our yard, I had none.  So when my mother saw them she asked me, where did I get the flowers from so then I had to confess what I had done.  So I got a nice whipping, and I had to pull the flowers up and take them back to Ms. Davis.  So I learned a lesson, one, you don't lie, you don't steal, and you don't put yourself in a position where you disrespect an adult, so that lesson was well learned, and I carry that today, you know, but we had a very warm neighborhood.  The adults in the neighborhood felt comfortable questioning your behavior, correcting you if necessary, we got along.  And, so I would say that the Cann Park neighborhood [Savannah, Georgia] was a mixture of professional people, individuals, blue collar workers, but you wouldn't know the difference because they all worked together, it was a very cohesive neighborhood.  Even today when I go back in the neighborhood there's still some individuals who still live in the neighborhood in their family homes.  We had a park in the neighborhood, Cann Park, and that's where we gathered for activities, summer activities.  Not far from where we lived, we had a recreational center with the swimming pool, and we had swimming lessons during the summer and a water show and to culminate the summer, you know, activities.  Our high school was across the street.  I lived right across the street from the high school I graduated from, Beach High School [Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia].  So the neighborhood was a very friendly, cohesive neighborhood.
Story_ID: 656421
Speaker 1: What other activities were you involved in?  Did you belong to any organizations like, maybe the Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America] or any organizations?
Speaker 2: I was very active in school.  I was a Brownie, I was a Girl Scout, I was in the garden club, it was called the Jonquil Garden Club.  I won prizes for my flower arrangements.  The student council, interschool council.  I held offices in those, president, when I was in elementary school [George W. DeRenne Elementary School; George W. DeRenne Middle School, Savannah, Georgia] of our student council.  In high school [Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia], I was secretary of the student council, honor society [National Honor Society] in high school and, let me see.  I think that--
Story_ID: 656422
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your elementary school.  What was the name of the elementary school?
Speaker 2: DeRenne Elementary School [George W. DeRenne Elementary School; George W. DeRenne Middle School, Savannah, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And were there any teachers that you remember that might have been encouraging to you at that time?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have my third grade teacher, Ms. Laurel Webb [ph.].  My fourth grade teacher, Ms. Mary Counsel [ph.].  In fact I have a picture of her and a letter she (laughter) wrote me and Thelma Thorpe [ph.], my fifth grade teacher and my seventh grade teacher, Wade Medica Simmons [Wade Simmons] was--well, I was in love with him.  I couldn't concentrate on math for looking at Mr. Simmons and one day he called my mother [Freddie Mae Jones Williams] and told her that I was not doing well in math.  I didn't like math anyway.  So after lunch every day I had a headache, that was math.  So it came down to me boning up and doing enough to pass or else I would be sent to summer school, and I didn't want that because one of the things that we did not want growing up is to be retained, we called it being left back, but I didn't want to be retained because that was like having a blemish, you know.  People, they would tease you, and we did a lot of teasing growing up, too, and people had nicknames, you know.  So you didn't want anybody to tag you with a name.  So I got busy and boned up and did enough to pass math and got over that crush of Mr. Simmons.
Story_ID: 656423
Speaker 1: What is your favorite class?
Speaker 2: Social studies, the humanities, really.  I mean in elementary school [George W. DeRenne Elementary School; George W. DeRenne Middle School, Savannah, Georgia], of course, you didn't call it that, but I enjoyed reading, I loved spelling because I could rem- out spell most of them, writing, a lot of communication skills.  I wasn't, I wasn't too much of an abstract learner, so I'd like to--hands on engaging in--with people.
Speaker 1: At that age, what types of books, since you said that you liked to read, what were you reading?
Speaker 2: 'Childcraft,' I read all of those and mostly books out of the library.  There weren't--I can't recall any particular author.  If I went in the library and I saw a book that I liked, I read that.  Even today I don't have a particular author, just what I think I might want to read.  In fact I'm in a book club.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you go to the library often?  Do you remember when you got your first library card?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was in elementary school and we had a library, Carnegie Library [Savannah, Georgia], that was the library for African Americans, and it was on the Eastside of town, East Henry Street, and either you walked to there, which was quite a distance from where we lived or if you had the money, you rode the bus, but most of the times we walked to Carnegie Library, and as I said, the books that I liked, I read.  I'm--liked reading biographies about people, and one of the books that I read that was the life of Mary McLeod Bethune, and I liked her philosophy about education even as a little girl and, so that would be one example.
Story_ID: 656424
Speaker 1: What did you think that you might want to do when you grew up?
Speaker 2: I had this idea of being a psychologist at first, and when I realized that Savannah State [Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia] was a college that I was going to attend, they didn't have a degree in psychology, so I ended up majoring in social work, but I also wanted to be a teacher and when I--my oldest sister [Jean Williams Golden], when she finished school, she was a teacher.
Story_ID: 656425
Speaker 1: Tell me more about activities at home or maybe even traditions during the holidays since you had a large family.  Was there anything that your family did as a tradition?
Speaker 2: Well, the tradition was family coming home for Christmas, our parents [Freddie Mae Jones Williams and John Williams, Sr.] gathering in the kitchen, aunts coming, cooking, baking, putting up a Christmas tree, the--just all of the traditional things that people do to enjoy the holidays.  One of the things that was a tradition was making our Christmas ornaments because like I said, you know, you didn't have a lot of money, so spending money on Christmas decorations was not a priority.  So in school, we made our decorations, and at home, we decorated the tree and I think the main real traditional thing that we did was have Christmas Eve together as a family.  My sisters were married at--by the time--well, when they got married, they came back.  My mother's tradition was to bake biscuits, and she was a good cook.  We'd gather in our dining room, sit around, tell stories, bring people up to date on where we were in our lives.  I have a brother who loved to joke and tease, so he would sit and share his antics with us.  So our really tradition was coming together as a family, annually, for Christmas.
Story_ID: 656426
Speaker 1: Now as a elementary school age child, what type of games and--did you have a TV or radio in your home in--if you did, did you have a favorite program?
Speaker 2: We had a TV, radio, both a radio and television.  I watched the soap operas with my mother [Freddie Mae Jones Williams] (laughter).  My favorite show was Happy Dan, that was a local, 'Howdy Doody' ['The Howdy Doody Show'], 'Pinky Lee' ['The Pinky Lee Show'] and when--what was that, 'I Love Lucy,' when it premiered and the thing about that is, talking about our neighborhood [Cann Park, Savannah, Georgia], we were not the first family to have, to get a TV, but there was a couple in our neighborhood, Ms. Cameron [ph.] (unclear).  They didn't have children, but they had a television.  So in 19--I think '58 [1958], I think that's when 'I Love Lucy' premiered, I believe.
Speaker 1: Fifty-three [sic. 1951].
Speaker 2: Fifty-three [1953], well, in 1953 when 'I Love Lucy' premiered, we were all sitting on the floor in our, in the Camerons' home watching 'I Love Lucy.'  So until other families, to include mine, received--got a television, the Camerons would let us come in and watch television in their home, and we'd all be on the floor, different kids in the neighborhood, around the television watching their television, and it would be early in the evening so we got to see at least two, 'December Bride,' 'Ozzie and Harriet' ['The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet'], 'I Love Lucy,' those shows until we had a television.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what type of games did you play?  I know most kids played outdoors.
Speaker 2: Hopscotch was one, jump rope, those were the two main--oh, hide and seek, too (laughter).  So those are games we'd play.
Story_ID: 656427
Speaker 1: What year did you go to junior high school?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-eight [1958].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was the name of that junior high school?
Speaker 2: Cuyler [Cuyler Junior High School; Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia].
Speaker 1: All right.  So tell me about your teachers and friends and activities in junior high school.
Speaker 2: My homeroom teacher was Catherine Mathis [ph.], and she was a very spirited teacher.  I--she was one I really liked and encouraged me to excel and to participate in school activities.  The student council seemed to have been the most--my favorite activity.  So at Cuyler, I was secretary of the student council there.  I wasn't athletic, so when we took PE [physical education], I guess I was the last person somebody would choose to be on the team because they wanted to be, they wanted to win so I--they couldn't do that with me.  So the PE teacher would have, would make somebody select me to be on their team, particularly playing softball (laughter).  That just was not my thing, playing, being athletic.  So most of my junior high years were spent being in leadership positions like student council, mainly, planning activities like, social activities--the prom or a dance, serving on committees in that way.  As far as my studies, I liked home ec [home economics], but I didn't like to sew.  I liked the (clears throat), setting the table, all the (clears throat) things that dealt with social etiquette and my (clears throat), excuse me, home ec teacher I really liked, she was Mrs. McKinney [ph.], and we went to a competition, I recall, in Macon, Georgia one year, and she selected me to go with her, and I believe we placed in that competition, it was a home ec competition of some sort, and I really enjoyed home ec and social studies and English, not math.  My math teacher was not very nice.  Her name was Ms. Fuller [ph.], God bless the dead (laughter), but she was not--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --very good.
Story_ID: 656428
Speaker 1: So in--in elementary school [George W. DeRenne Elementary School; George W. DeRenne Middle School, Savannah, Georgia], you talked about maybe when you grow up you would be a psychologist.  And, so, now in junior high school [Cuyler Junior High School; Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia], what are your aspirations now?  You said a psychologist, but was there any one in your life that would make you choose that occupation?  I mean, was there some--how did you come up with the idea of a psychologist?
Speaker 2: It sounded good, it sounded like something that had some prestige to it, and everybody in the neighborhood, teachers, that were black teachers, ministers, postmen, and it was an area that you didn't hear that many black people went into, and I would tell some of my friends that some of them needed some help (laughter), and I was constantly asked my opinion about things, my advice on something because my brother, who I told you that likes to joke, he likes to tell the story that I never had a childhood, said I was like Michael Jackson, you never had a childhood.  So (laughter) I always had a mature outlook on things, so I said, "You know, maybe I ought to be a psychologist, and I can help people improve their lives and give them--," particularly, you know, black folk.  So that's how I came to that decision (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So in, so in junior high school, you still had this ambition--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to be a psychol- okay, all right, okay.  So what happens?  Are there any--do you continue with your extracurricular activities as Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America] or any other organizations as well in junior high school?
Speaker 2: No, and it wasn't, I guess, fashionable to be seen in the Girl Scout uniforms after a while.  (Laughter) So I--think my last year as a Girl Scout was in seventh grade.  Yes, Ms. Nancy Walker was our scout leader, and she was a teacher at the elementary school, and she did a lot with the students.  She showed a lot of interest in us and would, on Saturdays, come and get us and take us to our student council meetings, interschool council meetings.  In fact, she reminded me quite a lot of Mary Mc- Mary McLeod Bethune, and her focus on education was very encouraging.  She was a good role model, Ms. Walker was.
Speaker 1: So you always believed that you would go to college?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  My, in my home, that was--my daddy [John Williams, Sr.] had five girls and he said that one of the things we would not do would work in white folk's kitchens.  He said my, he could teach my brothers a trade, and he was a master painter.  He worked for Bob's--Bob Garage [ph.] and there were, and he was self-employed, too.  He and a friend of his had a co- an auto body shop together, but his philosophy was that his girls would never be subservient and, so we all went to college.  In fact, if a guy dated us, the question was, what are your plans?  And if they had no plans, they couldn't come back to our house.
Story_ID: 656429
Speaker 1: Were you in- involved in church?  What church did you attend?
Speaker 2: Butler Presbyterian Church [Butler Memorial Presbyterian Church, Savannah, Georgia] and what's interesting about that is, my family for years were Methodist, A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal], when they were on the Eastside.  When they moved to the Westside, it changed.  My family decided to become Catholic.  I didn't want to be a Catholic, and I started attending Butler Presbyterian Church, which was in our neighborhood [Cann Park, Savannah, Georgia], actually, with some of my friends at school, Sunday school, and church was a church that welcomed young people and had quite a number of activities for young people, and I enjoyed the spiritual climate in the church.  So I asked my mother [Freddie Mae Jones Williams] if I could become a Presbyterian, and they agreed that I could.  So I became Presbyterian while they converted to Catholicism.
Speaker 1: And what were some of the activities that you were involved in at your church?
Speaker 2: Bible school, summer camp.  I was chosen by our church to be one of the representatives to go to a summer retreat (clears throat) for--it was an interracial group.  And in fact, it was not far from my mother's hometown, in--outside of Burke County [Georgia], Boggs Academy [Keysville, Georgia] (clears throat), excuse me, and that was the first experience I had in terms of any interracial interaction with the young people, and the white kids came to us from Indiana, and the interesting thing was, and this was another incident that stayed with me, was in Louisville, Georgia, was a slave market where slaves were tr- traded and the group, they planned a field trip and when we gathered for the field trip, outside of Boggs Academy we could not ride together.  All the white kids had to be in one car and the black kids had to be in another car and, of course, we got to be friends, and we couldn't understand, well, why we can't ride together.  You know, kids can't ride together, and they said we would be arrested.  So, you know, those were hard things to fathom without developing (clears throat) some feelings of hate, you know, and that's where our parents came in to help us understand that you don't get anything accomplished by hating.  You learn to think and plan and, so, you know.

Speaker 1: We had dances at our church [Butler Memorial Presbyterian Church, Savannah, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Okay.  We can talk about that too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Go (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.  And, so were there other activities as well at your church?  What kind of music were you listening to (laughter)?  Did you like gospel music or in Presbyterian, they didn't have so much, that type of music did they?
Speaker 2: No we had hymnals.
Speaker 1: Hymns, okay.
Speaker 2: Hymns, and my favorite time of the year was Mother's Day because our minister's wife, Mrs. Patterson [Willie Mae Freeman], was an outstanding vocalist, and she would sing 'Mother Machree,' that was one of my favorite songs, and one of the other songs I like is 'Great is Thy Faithfulness.'  The church, to me, was a refuge and because I grew up in a spiritual environment, it was just common practice to feel, you know, the, just the spiritual- ality of what life was all about, and I helped plan the Martin Luther King day tea at our church, that was an annual event.  I was a part of the youth group.  I wasn't in the choir.  (Clears throat) I wanted to be in the choir but I was shy, I wouldn't, I didn't want to sing before anybody, so I never followed up on that but that was a desire I had to sing and be a part of the choir.  I taught bible school as a young adult in the church and then on Friday nights we would have youth activities.  Sometimes it would be a dance, sometimes we'd have a movie, and we planned and coordinated those types of activities.  Easter we planned the Easter egg hunt for the kids, younger kids we called it and it--we had a, our church had a kitch- a social hall, and we did meals, learned to prepare dainty sandwiches.  So it was a church that welcomed young people and, in fact, when we had nighttime activities, we had one of our members, Ms. Simmons [ph.], they had a station wagon and she'd come around and pick us all up, and we had a children's home, Greenbriar's children's center [Greenbriar Children's Center, Savannah, Georgia], that was in our neighborhood, and I was friends with some of the kids at Greenbriar.  So when Ms. Simmons would go and pick them up, she'd come by my house to pick me up.  So a number of people thought I was (laughter), one of the children from the children's center and I had to explain, no, no, I don't live at Greenbriar, but I'm friends with young people--some of the children who lived there.  So Butler was a good place and still is a good place.
Speaker 1: So you still attend there now?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 656431
Speaker 1: That was in 1960 when you went to elemen- to junior high school, is that right?  Or you go into high school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fifty-eight [1958]--
Speaker 1: Fifty-eight [1958]?
Speaker 2: Fifty-eight [1958], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right (clears throat).  So you go on to which high school?  There are--how many high schools are available for you to go to?
Speaker 2: We had Alfred E. Beach High School [Savannah, Georgia], Tompkins High School [Woodville-Tompkins Technical and Career High School, Savannah, Georgia] and then later Johnson High School [Sol C. Johnson High School, Savannah, Georgia], but Beach was my assigned school and actually, before we leave junior high, we went to Cuyler [Cuyler Junior High School; Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia] for one year, eighth grade and then they built Beach junior high, so that we wouldn't have to walk as far.  Again, based on segregated rules, white kids were bused but we were not, we had to walk, and the rule was that I later learned that if you lived more than one and a half miles from a school, you had to provide transportation, and we clearly lived more than one and a half miles from Cuyler.  So when Beach junior high was built, it was built in our neighbor- in the Cann Park [Savannah, Georgia] neighborhood as an annex to the high school, so we started Beach junior high in 1959 and then transitioned into the high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know who Alfred Ely Beach was?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was a northerner and a philanthropist who put--promoted education for African American children.
Story_ID: 656432
Speaker 1: Now we're into high school [Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia] and you still want to be a psychologist (laughter)?  Okay, so tell me if there are any, who are your role models at this time, and what activities are you participating in?
Speaker 2: In high school?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: My role model was my counselor, Mrs. Mattie B. Payne [Mattie Beverly Payne].  We were very good friends.  Her husband [William K. Payne] was president of Savannah State College [Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia], and I was in honor society [National Honor Society].  We had a girls club called the Excelsiors [ph.] and the Excelsiors was supposed to be what we would call Little Sisters for AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] (laughter).  Our colors were pink and green.  We had an initiation that we had to participate in, and you had to be vetted to be in the Excelsiors.  It was quite an honor to be a part of the Excelsiors.  I held an office in the Excelsior club.  I was a part of the student council.  I served on the annual staff, and I think I worked with the school newspaper also.  So those were the activities that I participated in in high school.
Speaker 1: What other extracurricular activities?  I know that you said that at the church [Butler Memorial Presbyterian Church, Savannah, Georgia] they had dances.  What type of music did you like, and did you like to dance?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, no.  I wasn't a good dancer.  I list- I sat and listened.  I guess you could say I was more like a wallflower on the sideline watching others dance but had a good time and had a good time.  Whatever--the music of the day is what we listened to.  James Brown, I really was a romantic.  I liked romantic songs.  Carla Thomas, 'Gee Whiz.'  What else?  That's mainly what I--
Story_ID: 656433
Speaker 1: Let's think about signs--sounds, sights and smells of that time.  What sign--sights, sounds and smells would take you back to that time?
Speaker 2: I'd like to hear the train that would come through our neighborhood [Cann Park, Savannah, Georgia] but in a--distant from us.  I like the smell of lea- not--the smell of food cooking in the neighborhood, especially on Sundays.  I like the fall of the year, the changing of the leaves.  I like the sound of just the--I guess, if it makes sense, hustle and bustle of life, and I love the smell of flowers, all kinds of flowers.
Story_ID: 656434
Speaker 1: So were you on the committee because you said that you were--for junior high school [Cuyler Junior High School, Savannah, Georgia], on the committee to plan the prom?  So did you, were you on the prom committee for high school [Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia] as well?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was.
Speaker 1: And who took you to the prom?
Speaker 2: My husband, my first husband took me to the prom.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was that like?  I mean, what was the theme?  What do you remember about that time?
Speaker 2: It was Arabian nights, that was the theme for the prom and again, I said my parents [Freddie Mae Jones Williams and John Williams, Sr.] were strict.  I went to the prom and home.  So we enjoyed the prom and that was the theme, and our teachers were very conservative too, so the prom was a very conservative prom.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You know, it was (clears throat), excuse me, to say that there were, that we did this, we did that, my memory is going to the prom, dancing, going home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was the theme, Arabian night.
Story_ID: 656435
Speaker 1: So what about football games and going to the movies, that type of thing in high school [Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Saturdays were movie day, and once we did our chores, my girlfriends and my cousins, we'd go to the movies.  The Star Theatre [Savannah, Georgia] was the theatre that we were allowed to go to.  We had three theatres, the Star Theatre, the Dunbar [Dunbar Theatre, Savannah, Georgia] and the East Side Theatre [Savannah, Georgia], and the Dunbar didn't have a very good reputation, so our parents [Freddie Mae Jones Williams and John Williams, Sr.] forbade us from going there, and the East Side was too far to go, so the Star Theatre was on West Broad Street at the time, now Martin Luther King [Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard], and that was considered the premier theatre.  So on Saturdays we went to the Star Theatre and cowboy, Westerns, I love Westerns, that was the day for Westerns, and my mother and I would go to the movies together.  One of the movie- movies we--the first movie we went to was 'Imitation of Life.'  Then we went to see 'The Ten Commandments.'  So I went to the movies with my mother, quite often.  So, yes, we had--movies were one of our favorite things to do.
Speaker 1: Do you remember how much it cost to go to the movies?
Speaker 2: Ten cents, until you reached a certain age, then it went up.
Story_ID: 656436
Speaker 1: What about football games or any act- you know, sports activities at the school [Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went to some of the football games with my friend, Lorraine [ph.].  Her father was a photographer for the school.  So they would come and pick me up, we'd go to the game and then come home.  Most of my activities were chaperone things.  You know, I didn't have a lot of freedom to go and do things like other girls may have done, you know, just go out with the girls.  It had to be, who you're going with, how you're going to get there, any adults around, you know, very, I guess you could say, traditional (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did your family own a car?
Speaker 2: Yes, we did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember what kind of car it was?
Speaker 2: Yes, we had a Hudson and a Dodge.
Story_ID: 656437
Speaker 1: So what else happens in high school [Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia]?  How do you begin to prepare to go to college?  Did you know what college you wanted to apply to?
Speaker 2: I knew I would be going to Savannah State [Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia] because that's where I could afford to go, and scholarships were not readily available.  There are very limited scholarships, and the counselors that we had, I guess, decided who would get the scholarships and who would not.  So when I graduated from high school, going to college was, in terms of financial aid, was really based on what my parents [Freddie Mae Jones Williams and John Williams, Sr.] could afford to do and then later, while, years in college, I received financial assistance to complete my college education.
Story_ID: 656438
Speaker 1: While you're applying to go to college and getting prepared to go to college, actually, we're now in the 1960s, and the Civil Rights Movement is in full swing.  What's going on in your community, and is your family or you involved in any way?
Speaker 2: I was involved with the voters registration activity under the minister Reverend Louis Scottsdale [ph.].  We were bused to the Chatham County Courthouse [Savannah, Georgia] to register to vote and during that process, they wanted to deny us the right to vote and one of the things we had to do was recite the Preamble to the [U.S.] Constitution and if, and we knew it and once that was done, the registrar would come with something else that they wanted you to do.  They would ask you then to recite the Declaration of Independence.  Then if that wasn't it, then it would go to, do you know the Emancipation Proclamation, just to stress you out and cause you to react and that way they would have a reason to dismiss you from the courthouse before you could finalize the registration process.  So that was one of the activities that I participated in but other than that, I wasn't a part of the marches or any of the sit-ins or some of the other activities invo- during the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 1: So when did you actually get your vote, get registered to vote?
Speaker 2: That day.
Speaker 1: You did get through that day (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, that day because we challenged them and one of the ladies and I really got into it, so I almost was arrested, you know, but it didn't happen because Reverend Scottsdale was very persistent and, so--
Speaker 1: Do you remember the very first time that you voted?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  I, I don't remember who I voted for, and I think it was a local election.
Story_ID: 656439
Speaker 1: What were your thoughts about Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy]?  Well, Kennedy was the president by this time, he's killed in '63 [1963], that's the year that you're graduating from high school [Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is on the scene.  What are your, what is the conversation, or is there any conversation about these things in your home?
Speaker 2: Yes, there was.  In fact, when President Kennedy was assassinated in November, I was coming across campus at Savannah State [Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia] and there were kids--as I was going across the campus and meeting those who lived on campus, they were crying, and I stopped and asked one girl, "What's going on?"  Well, she said, "The president has been assassinated," and all classes had been cancelled, you know, at that point and when I got home, it was very solemn, I mean, my parents [Freddie Mae Jones Williams and John Williams, Sr.] were really distraught because they--the Democratic Party, we saw as friends to, not only African Americans but liberal minded, free thinking individuals who were going to keep the pathways open for our progress and for that to have happened, to them it was a setback, you know, and the Kennedys had endeared themselves to many people to include my family.  So, yes, it was, it was a painful time.
Story_ID: 656440
Speaker 1: And your thoughts about the King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and the nonviolent movement?
Speaker 2: I believe that Martin Luther King was a man of principle.  I think he opened the doors for black folk and white folk to sit down and communicate, to talk about the issues, but I don't think all the time nonviolence was the way to go.  A peaceful transition can be made, I think, once you realize and you discuss all avenues.  Sometimes those persons who want to be in control, white people, will tend to take, I think, a nonviolent approach as somebody being passive, and they can, in my opinion, remain in control by keeping you in control.  I think there are times when you have to be very forthright, and sometimes a little violence might not hurt.  When I say that, I don't mean in a destructive way.  Well, I'll put it like this, in a harmful way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, someone like that that wasn't agitated, did you know the local leaders here like, well, W.W. Law and Hosea Williams was in Atlanta [Georgia], in Savannah [Georgia], as well.  So what were your thoughts about the local leadership here?
Speaker 2: Well, in my church [Butler Memorial Presbyterian Church, Savannah, Georgia], actually, Hosea Williams was a member.  When his daughter [HistoryMaker Elisabeth Omilami] spoke last night and she said they were Presbyterians, I had to laugh because my--our minister, Reverend Pickens A. Patterson, Hosea Williams and those started the Crusade for Voters [Chatham County Crusade for Voters] in Savannah, and I think that their philosophy was different from Martin Luther King and that's where the divide was, and Hosea Williams left Savannah.  I believe, from my understanding, because they--the--there were some leaders who took this nonviolent approach to addressing the racial issues in Savannah and that created a split, but Reverend Patterson remained very dedicated to improving the quality of life for black folk within hou- public housing, I know for one, it's one area.  Mr. Law, his legacy speaks for itself.  I think that in Savannah, because there was what you, the protest, I'll put it like that, was quelled by people coming together to solve issues but there was still an angry crowd out there.  They felt that they, their issue had not been addressed and when jobs opened, there may have been some cherry picking as to who would get the jobs, and maybe those persons involved in the roundtable discussion made those decisions and left some others on the outside.  So I think there are some unresolved issues in our community related to racial issues that still create a have and have not.
Story_ID: 656441
Speaker 1: You're now at Savannah State [Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia] as you stated before and, so tell me more about what's going on with you and--as you're pursuing your degree at Savannah State.
Speaker 2: While at Savannah State, I was devoted to my studies.  I didn't pledge in any sororities while in college.  My participation in school activities were limited because my main goal was to complete my education.  I did work while attending school.  I worked in a nursery at Hunter, it was Hunter Army Airfield [Savannah, Georgia] at the time and then in 1966, I got married and completed my college education in December of 1967, but I didn't march until 1968 and at that time, I joined my husband, at the time, in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  He was in the [U.S.] Air Force and I taught in South Carolina school system from nineteen six- '69 [1969] to '70 [1970], and he was ordered to Vietnam, and I came back to Savannah [Georgia], and I taught in South Carolina for one year from nineteen sixty--the latter part of '69 [1969] into the spring of '70 [1970], and I was hired here in Chatham County [Georgia] and started teaching, actually, at the junior high school where I started, at Cuyler Junior High School [Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia].  And then they decided that, I taught social studies, but I'll back up a minute and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's--I want to put some dates here.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So you--what year do you get your B.S. degree?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-eight [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay.  In '68 [1968], okay, and that's from Savannah State?  Had it changed to Armstrong [Armstrong State College; Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus, Savannah, Georgia] then?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: All right, so, so you got your B.S. in '68 [1968] from Savannah State in psychology?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: Social- sociology.
Speaker 1: Sociology.
Speaker 2: They didn't have a psychology (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) -chology (laughter), okay.
Speaker 2: --degree so I got a degree in sociology.
Story_ID: 656442
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966] you got married and, and then '68 [1968], is that when you went to South Carolina or that was '69 [1969]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1967] I went to South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Sixty- sixty-seven [1967], okay.  And that's where you worked in the school system there?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that was your first teaching job, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So tell me about that experience.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: And where was this?
Speaker 2: This is in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I started teaching at the, at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base dependent school.  What was interesting about that is that when I went for an interview with the principal, he said that African Americans and Indians [Native American] were, we were inferior, they said this in the interview and that I needed to demonstrate to him that I could teach.  So I was hired as a teacher aid.  It was Woodlawn Elementary School, Myrtle Beach Air Force Base [sic. Woodland Park Elementary School, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina].  And, so I asked him why did I have to practice, you know, under somebody, a white teacher?  So he said, "Well, then you can be an assistant art teacher."  I don't have a background in art, but I needed the job.  So I accepted the position as an assistant art teacher until I could navigate my--through some of the issues in the--a very racist town.  And, so I--they gave me a cart the day I (laughter)--my first day at work, I was presented with a cart where I had to go from room to room to teach art from a cart to some elementary kids.  That was how I got started.  That was another experience with racism.  And later in that year, well, in '68 [1968], I got a job in the, in the civilian schools in Myrtle--in the civilian school in Myrtle Beach [South Carolina], Chestnut Consolidated High School and that's where my teaching career actually started, professionally, rather than as a, what I considered a non-professional position and at that time, we had to take a national teachers exam [National Teacher Examination; Praxis Series] to be licensed to teach and in South Carolina, they graded you on the exam and in other states like Georgia, you had a numerical score that you had to make and in South Carolina you were paid based on your grade.  Most blacks were failing the test, so you had A, B, C and D grade (laughter), and if you made a D, you made very little money from what I understand, and if you made a A--A and B, well, that speaks for itself.  So I was able to get a job in teaching in South Carolina and then when we moved back to Savannah [Georgia], I got hired here.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So this, so, and what subject did you teach at that school?
Speaker 2: In Chestnut Consolidated High School?  I taught social studies, and I taught in the elementary grade to third grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So then, and then that was in '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 656443
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sixty-nine [1969] to '70 [1970], you were where?
Speaker 2: In Savannah [Georgia].
Speaker 1: So you came back to Savannah and where did you teach here?
Speaker 2: Cuyler Junior High School [Alfred E. Beach High School].
Speaker 1: Cuyler, that was your alma mater?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you taught what grade and what subject?
Speaker 2: I taught eighth grade social studies.
Speaker 1: So tell me about the comparison in the school systems and which one did you feel more comfortable--well, that's not a good question (laughter).  I think I can answer that myself.  Just tell me your experience about moving back to Georgia.
Speaker 2: Well, I finally felt being at home which made me feel good.  I didn't have to commute to work like I had to when I was in South Carolina.  So being at home I felt that I was at home and very happy to be at home.  My teaching position at Cuyler, I was there for a year, and my supervisor came in and observed me and the next year I was moved to Savannah High School [Savannah, Georgia] which was a racially, more racially mixed school.  Cuyler did not have, what is that?  Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Cuyler did not have--they were trying to integrate Cuyler.  They had two white students, and their father was the caretaker for the cemetery.  Cuyler--location is kind of, is adjacent to Laurel Grove Cemetery [Savannah, Georgia].  And, so the kids would tease those two young people, which was not nice, but that was my first experience teaching with an integrated--well, Cuyler was considered integrated (laughter) with two students, but the approach here was that they integrated the faculty first and then slowly transitioned into integrating students because I don't know when the court order to desegregate the schools and then mandatory busing was implemented.  I don't remember the date for that, but the year after I was at Cuyler I was sent to Savannah High School.  Savannah High School at that time was a premier high school in the State of Georgia.  In fact it was the largest high school in southeast Georgia.  The principal at the high school was Dell Knight, and everybody was afraid of Mr. Knight and, so quite naturally I was nervous about going to Savannah High School to teach but as (laughter) it, as they say, God was shining on you.  My brother-in-law was director of recreation for the county.  So we had a summer program, and I happened to meet Mr. Knight's son in the summer program and--a little kid, elementary kid, and we got to be friends.  So the day I had to go to Savannah High to meet Mr. Knight, I was coming up the stairs, and all of a sudden his son saw me and he broke loose from his dad and ran up to me, and his name was Tommy, and Tommy Knight [ph.] put a hug around me and his father looked at him and said, "How do you know this lady," and when he told him, that just opened the door for me (laughter) to walk in comfortably at Savannah High School as a teacher, and I taught seventh grade social studies and English at Savannah High School from 1970 to 1974.
Story_ID: 656444
Speaker 1: So when do you go back to school to get your master's degree?
Speaker 2: It was in 1972, and I completed my degree, June of 1974.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So while you were working at this school, you were going to, which college?
Speaker 2: Armstrong [Armstrong State College; Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus, Savannah, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And there's a history about Armstrong by 1974.  So this is now integrated.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And do--well, of course, you know how the school was integrated.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).  Did you want to, how did you feel about that or do you remember anything about when it was integrated?
Speaker 2: I do remember when it was integrated.  As you--[HistoryMaker] Otis Johnson, our former mayor, was the first black student to integrate Armstrong College [Armstrong Junior College; Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus, Savannah, Georgia].  So by the time I got to Armstrong, I think that the tone and tenor regarding African American students had somewhat mellowed.  There were still some professors there who were not yet ready to accept the reality that there were smart and capable black people, and I had one professor, a Dr. Stokes [William W. Stokes], who had to understand that, and I helped him understand that and then I had another professor who--at the time of my graduation, I had to write a paper, and he questioned the paper.  In fact he tried to hold up my graduation, my participation in graduation because he said that he didn't believe I wrote the paper.  So that was a challenge that I had to overcome, but in the end he realized that he was wrong.
Speaker 1: How did you make him realize that?  What did you have to go through?
Speaker 2: I said that we would have to go before the president, and I think they had a student grievance committee that you could appeal to.  So when he realized that I was going to take advantage of that process and he would have to defend before others, his position, I think he realized that I was not going to be easily dismissed because of his prejudicial, you know, views and his deep seated racism would certainly surface, and I'm sure he realized that.
Speaker 1: What was your paper about?
Speaker 2: It was about the Reformation, that's what it was about.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now in 1974, you state you were going to then leave that school and you have, now have your master's in, what degree (laughter)?
Speaker 2: History education.
Speaker 1: Education, okay.
Story_ID: 656445
Speaker 1: So what's next?
Speaker 2: Next I was selected to--well, promoted actually, as a curriculum specialist, so I was moved from Savannah High School [Savannah, Georgia] to Windsor Forest High School [Savannah, Georgia] as a curriculum specialist, and I worked in that position from '74 [1974] to '78 [1978], and those jobs were not funded by the board for the upcoming year, which would have been seventy--school year '78 [1978], '79 [1979].  So I returned to the classroom as a middle school gifted teacher in Myers Middle School [Lee Roy Myers Middle School, Savannah, Georgia] and taught there from '78 [1978] to '81 [1981] and was promoted assistant principal to a high school, Jenkins High School [Herschel V. Jenkins High School, Savannah, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in--as a curriculum specialist, what does a curriculum specialist do (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, we were supposed to help with the implementation of the quarter system which the school district had decided to go on a quarter system rather than semester and there were courses that had to be written and implemented, and each high school had a curriculum specialist.  I was not the only one in the district.  And, so we had to assist in the implementation of the courses for--and review of courses for the quarter system and work with curriculum committees within the school, as well as the district curriculum and instruction department.  So that was our job.
Story_ID: 656446
Speaker 1: Then as an assistant principal--well, before we do that, so what's going on in your, your personal life because we talked about you getting married, did you have any children, anything else going on in your personal life?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have any children and, you know, sometimes your parents know better than you know as to who is best for you and my first husband, my mother [Freddie Mae Jones Williams] had all her doubts about that, but I prevailed, and I think that part of it was that if my parents had not been so strict, and I had had the opportunity to get to know guys, you know, I may not have made the decision that I made, but along the way we realized, I realized that it was time for us to move on into different directions.  So in 19--after twenty-three years of marriage, we divorced and, so--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  All right. So what else is going on?
Speaker 2: Personal?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I was happy to be able to be a free spirit and get to know who I am.  Before I really didn't know and have that sense of freedom about me and where I need--wanted to be, and I took time to learn me and at the same time, there were things happening in my professional life that continued to just, just move.
Story_ID: 656447
Speaker 1: When I was an assistant principal, I had the am- the desire to be the district social studies supervisor and my supervisor, Bernie Hirshberg [Bernard A. Hirshberg] was his name, he also wanted me to replace him, he was my mentor.  So when he announced his retirement, I applied for the position.  Well, there was the lady who was over the department for the division of instruction that did not want me to have the job.  So when I interviewed for the job, I was the only black applicant and met all the criteria that's listed on the job announcement, and the committee recommended me, but she went in and talked with the personnel director and had them to change it, and they gave the job to a white guy, and I filed a suit against the Savannah-Chatham County Board of Education because of that, and my attorney and I worked through the EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission], and they thought that I was not going to get a favorable ruling because it went through the EEOC, so they got comfortable saying, "Oh it'll be years before she gets this," and there are people out there saying, "Oh, she'll never make it in the system," even black folk.  Some of them distanced themselves from me, and when the board received the final ruling from the EEOC, they had a choice to give me the job and--on all the back pay that went with the job, and at that time we had a new superintendent to come in, Dr. Ronald Etheridge, and he (unclear) called me in for an interview, a meeting, and he asked me, he said, "Tell me what you want in terms of a resolution."  He said, "I know what they're recommending."  I told him I didn't want the job because I would have to work with the person who worked against me, and I doubt if I would be successful in the position.  So he said, "Well, we have two principalships open," and he said, "You can select the school that you want."  So I selected DeRenne Middle School [George W. DeRenne Middle School, Savannah, Georgia], the elementary school that I attended [George W. DeRenne Elementary School] had become a middle school.  So I got to be the principal of DeRenne Middle School as a part of the resolution to that civil suit (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Suit, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that I brought, and in fact my house that I lived in was in front of the school that I grew up in (laughter).
Story_ID: 656448
Speaker 1: So what school did you, were you the assistant principal of?
Speaker 2: Jenkins High School [Herschel V. Jenkins High School, Savannah, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Jenkins High School (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Herschel V. Jenkins.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what was it like transitioning from being a teacher to an assistant principal and then from a prin- the assistant principal to a principal?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, it was a challenge because I've been, spent most of my time in middle school--elementary, middle school.  I didn't like high school.  And, so when I went to Jenkins High School, I actually replaced a white football coach, Terps Behr [ph.], I mean he was a legend.  So the kids, when they saw me, I was much smaller than I am now.  "Oh, that little lady, oh, we're going to run all over her.  We--." Oh, I was a joke for a minute.  So one day we're in the cafeteria, and I was on duty, supervising the line and this, I guess star basketball player, he jumped the line, so I went up to him and I asked him nicely, I said, "Young man, you need to get back there, at the end of the line."  He told me he wasn't going anywhere.  So (laughter) I laugh, I tell people, like Moses I parted the water.  I told that and the whole line to just step back, and he was standing there just by himself.  I said, "Now I'm going to ask you, the line is open."  He told me he wasn't going to move.  So I just reversed the students and he ended up at the end of the line and by that time, I told him, "I'll see you in my office," and when he--all the kids looked, "Whoa, whoa, she's mean."  So I became known as the ditch witch (laughter) because, because I could catch them when they would slip off campus to go to McDonald's, you know, to get their hamburger fix or whatever, they'd get suspended.  So they learned early that I was about business, and they didn't want to come to my office because I would have something nice waiting for them, you know, and some of the kids who were African American kids would come down there to ask me, "Why are you so mean?"  I said, "I'm not mean, I just want you all to do and be the best that you can be," and one of the issues I had to deal with was one day a black guy--boy and a white boy got into a fight and I asked him, I said, "Why?"  He said, "He called me a nigger."  I said, "But nobody heard that but you.  When you socked him, everybody saw what you did but they didn't see what he did."  I said, "One of the things you're going to have to learn is that that's going--those things are going to happen but you're going to have to learn how to deal with it."  I said, "The next time it happens, you whisper something back to him and you keep walking and then let him be the aggressor, and if he chooses to be then you have something to stand on and if he chooses not to be, then, you know, you let it go."  So I think in the end they learned who and what I was about, but it was a challenge for me and for them.
Speaker 1: All right, so, let's see.  So this is--and you stayed at DeRenne [George W. DeRenne Middle School, Savannah, Georgia] until '81 [1981], you say?
Speaker 2: No, I went to DeRenne in '82 [1982].
Speaker 1: In '82 [1982].
Speaker 2: I went to Jenkins in '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you stayed at DeRenne until what year?
Speaker 2: Eighty-nine [1989].
Speaker 1: Eighty-nine [1989], okay.
Story_ID: 656449
Speaker 1: So you stay as a principal at that school [George W. DeRenne Middle School, Savannah, Georgia] until 1989 but in the interim, I know you have been involved in lots of organizations bef- before this time and after so let's talk about some of the organizations that are near and dear to your heart that you have been involved in, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I've served on Greenbriar's children center's [Greenbriar Children's Center, Savannah, Georgia] board and to me that is one that is near and dear to my heart because Greenbriar, using just a common phrase, was an orphan home for African American children and it was established by the A- Alpha Phi Alpha Sorority [sic, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], well a group of ladies, Gamma Sigma Omega [Gamma Sigma Omega Chapter], members of the Gamma Sigma Ome- Omega Chapter, Alpha Phi Alpha Sorority.  Prior to Greenbriar, children who were neglected and abandoned were housed at the Brown's farm which was considered like prison and they, then they moved from the Brown Farm to a location near Savannah State College [Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia] at the time.  Martha Wilson, who was the wife of a local dentist [J.W. Wilson] and a group of ladies got together and organized and they worked with a philanthropist, her name was Adeline Graham and Greenbriar's children center was organized to take in a- abused and neglected African American kids and today it still is in operation but like most nonprofit organizations, social service type organizations, it has to really struggle to keep the doors open and for funds.  I served there as a fundraising chair for the center and one year we, with my, under my leadership, raised over forty something thousand dollars to assist with the operation of the Center and I served on the board for, I think, from 2001 up until 2000 and, maybe '10 [2010] and I still assist and make donations to Greenbriar and I feel passionate about it because of the people that I know who lived and grew up at Greenbriar during my time, went to school with them and if it had not been for Greenbriar, I don't know what would have happened to them and a number of them have become very successful people in their own right, you know, and, so it now serves as an emergency shelter.  I think residential wise, I don't know how many kids are there at this point because some of the residential, that component of the Center I think is in need--going through a transition, is the best way to put it.
Story_ID: 656450
Speaker 1: I served on Hospice Savannah board [Hospice Savannah, Inc., Savannah, Georgia] and worked with--on the personnel committee and to me that was another very endearing board to serve on.  I learned a lot about transitioning--life transitions I should say and I still support Hospice Savannah.  I served on the United Way allocations committee [United Way of the Coastal Empire, Savannah, Georgia] at one time.  I still support that.  I raised, at one time, at that time, the most money--the local American Diabetes Association at their Kiss a Pig campaign, I participated in that and raised about sixty thousand dollars to support that and the joke was, you know, had I ever kissed a pig before, I said, "Yes, a two legged one" (laughter).  It would be my first time kissing a four legged pig but anyway (laughter), and I've served on Ronald McDonald House board [Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Coastal Empire, Inc., Savannah, Georgia], oh, so many boards I've served on.  The civil rights museum [Ralph Mark Gilbert Civil Rights Museum, Savannah, Georgia], not the board but a special committee to evaluate some of the programs at the civil rights museum.  They--so civic engagement is near and dear to my heart and I readily participate and assist whenever I can and do willingly because I think they hold quite a bit of value and, and certainly serves to improve the quality of life of our residents.
Story_ID: 656451
Speaker 1: Have you worked with, with The Links [The Links, Incorporated]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm an alumna member of The Links now and, but I was a member of The Links from 1997 until 2016.  I served as president of The Links and we did quite a few programs in the, in the school system.  During my time, we created a partnership with Savannah-Chatham County public schools [Savannah-Chatham County Public School System] and worked to take program--mentoring programs and healthy start programs into the school.  We worked with a local group called, Summer Bonanza [Summer Bonanza Partnership, Inc., Savannah, Georgia] which deals with--address young people in the community activities.  It was founded by our county commissioner, Priscilla, Dr. Priscilla Thomas.  That was her contribution, I guess, to working with young people.  So we provided leadership workshops for the group of kids, we sponsored them to Space Camp during my time as president of The Links.  So The Links is a very noteworthy service organization, national, international.
Story_ID: 656452
Speaker 1: I also saw that there were two organizations that I did not know and maybe you want to talk about them.  Now it says, B-A--B-A-P-S, like BAPS?
Speaker 2: Yeah, BAPS.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Books Are for, Are for, books are for preserving the spirit, that's my book club that I made up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's--so what type of book club?
Speaker 2: We read for fun and--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and pleasure and we select the book that we're going to read and then we host, you know, the book discussion and I last hosted the book discussion in--last month, actually, January.
Speaker 1: What were y'all reading last month?
Speaker 2: We read 'After You' [Jojo Moyes].  It was a book, a love story, actually.
Story_ID: 656453
Speaker 1: Savannah [Georgia] chapter of the MOLES?
Speaker 2: That's a social organization.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But it's a, it's a national organization.  It was--the birthplace of the MOLES is--was, oh, Norfolk, Virginia and we get together and have fun.  They have a conclave each year in different, in a different city.  We hosted the MOLES national conclave in 2014 and we just have so many business meetings and then we have social activities that we do.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Dinner and dancing.
Story_ID: 656454
Speaker 1: Is there any other organizations that you would like to speak about?
Speaker 2: No, those--when I retired, I decided to really retire but I do have a love story to tell that I didn't tell.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  So what year are we in for this love story?
Speaker 2: What year are we in, 2009.
Speaker 1: Well, we're still in '89 [1989], so let's hold, let's hold that, let's go, let's go over to you becoming superintendent (laughter).  So you're principal [at George W. DeRenne Middle School, Savannah, Georgia] and you're, and, so how do you get selected or how is it determined that you would become superintendent [of the Savannah-Chatham County Public School System]?
Speaker 2: Well, in 1989, I was promoted to executive director for secondary schools and from that I was promoted to deputy superintendent of schools.  Being the deputy superintendent, there were three individuals that reported to the superintendent that was considered to be his top leadership team that included me, a CFO, chief financial officer, and a deputy superintendent for school management and facilities.  I was the only black person, the other two were white males.  It never dawned on me that I would ever be superintendent of schools and that was not a career path that I charted or even thought about preparing for.  I was reaching my thirty years in education and that's where I planned to stop, I was going to retire with the thirty years.  I was at home recovering from the flu and I received a phone call from the school board secretary that the president of the school board wanted to meet with me.  I had learned that the current superintendent's contract was not going to be renewed and I thought that she was calling to meet with me to say that one of the white males was going to be appointed superintendent and at that time I was going to share with her that that was fine with me because I would be retiring.  Well, to my amazement, it was not that and she said to me that the board, the president of the school board, that the board met the night before and that they had decided unanimously that they wanted me to serve as interim superintendent.  And, so I said, "I'm not even prepared, you know, to do that."  It just seemed overwhelming, you know, and the superintendent that I've worked for did not allow us to--didn't mentor.  Either you knew your job and you did it and that was it.  So I was encouraged by some of the other board members to accept the interim position, which I did, and we had a crisis at an elementary school where some of the students had claimed this white teacher had used some racist terms with them and I was asked, I had to deal with that and dealt with it in a way that did not create any--a great deal of controversy and the board, at that time, was pleased with the way I handled that and the work that I had done previously as deputy superintendent.
Story_ID: 656455
Speaker 1: So I was asked to serve as superintendent in 1999 on a--which would have made the--my tenure, a three year term as superintendent [of the Savannah-Chatham County Public School System], including the interim term and I agreed to do that, however, the board changed.  The president, the person who was president when I was appointed--term ended.  One of the board members that supported me passed away.  So I ended up with a different board.  Two of the board members who were white that opposed my appointment, initially, still had time on the board.  So they saw an opportunity to do their political maneuvering and to create so much controversy, politically, you know, it became quite a challenge for me.  I'm not a political minded person and my position was, either you're a board superintendent or you're a district superintendent.  If you're a district superintendent that means you're looking out for the welfare of the people who deserve your support and you have to have the stamina to stand up and be supportive of those people and having come from the trenches and knowing what teachers do and having had an appreciation for that, knowing what principals do and having an appreciation for that, I felt my first priority was the schools and not to help board members grandstand and politicize public education and we had too many kids in our school district, and particularly African American children, who were struggling and my time didn't need to be spent dealing with their foolishness, as far as I was concerned.  There was not a meeting of the minds with that, with my belief and theirs.  So my term would best be described, as superin- superintendent, what I would say was contentious and the progress that we made was overshadowed because of that.  There were some who did not want me to be successful and they created situations where it could appear that that was the case when in fact it was not and I was the second African American person to serve as superintendent and the previous person was a male and his tenure was contentious and I think Dr. Carter's [Cecil F. Carter] term may have been--I know it was less than mine because they bought his contract out and I served out my term and what they--knowing that I was going to retire, it was no secret.  They decided that they would hire a superintendent while I still had time on my contract and when that happened, they wanted me to leave and serve as superintendent emeritus and superintendent--so I told them I wasn't doing any of that, that I signed a contract and I was going to be there until it ended and that's what I did.  They signed both of us on and there was a cartoon in the, a political cartoon in the paper, two headed superintendents.  And so, and then, more than that, when I became superintendent, my salary was lowballed.  They said that I had never been a superintendent before and therefore they weren't going to pay me to do on the job training.  So my salary was--when I left, it was $115,000.  They hired--my successor came in with less experience, never been a superintendent before and before he even started, they voted to raise the salary by twenty-five thousand dollars more.
Speaker 2: How did that make you feel (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Glad I was leaving but to, but I think the lesson learned was, I truly was not someone that could be bouth- bought and directed.  I had a mind and I was going to use it.  We could discuss things and come to some agreement but I was not going to let them control me to the point that I would lose sight of what my real purpose was and who I am.  That to me was more important than being superintendent of schools.
Story_ID: 656456
Speaker 1: Let's talk about as--let's just step back a little bit and because you're first deputy superintendent [of the Savannah-Chatham County Public School System] and I want you to talk about what it was that you accomplished in that position, if you might?
Speaker 2: One of the things I accomplished was im- implementing a reading warranty that guaranteed that the students would be reading by third grade.  Some of that was happening at the time I became superintendent but it was dismissed, you know, because that--it was a political thing, you know, so the other is, I think, that principals felt supported and that I was a superintendent that was for the best benefit of the schools and as a deputy superintendent I worked to accomplish that.  I also worked to train school leaders.  We had an in- internal school leadership program.  In fact I have a little plaque in there that some of the graduates, when they finished, remembered a lecture that I gave and they summarized it about tips on being a leader.  I think my greatest contribution as a leader was being, setting a good example for what leadership was all about because programs come and go and they can be very political and the impact this made is actually in the schools with the principals and with the students and I think that the reading warranty was one of the things that we im- that was impacted and also I--we implemented the, what's it, the early childhood education program where we had family advocates for children in the kindergarten program.  We--that was implemented.  It was successful, too, because it helped to guaranty that kids would be ready to start school, first grade.  Let me see.  I think those would be two of the things that I would point to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So even though you've had a challenging term as superintendent, what are you most proud of as superintendent?
Speaker 2: I would say I'm most proud of the fact that I did not lose my dignity nor did I compromise my principles while I tried to do--and I won't say try, why I did the best for the schools in the school district and the children.  There were gains made, there were accomplishments and I think I, not think, I walked away feeling that there were lessons learned and as--one of the things that stood out was when I was, I took the oath.  The headline in the paper was "Dream the Impossible Dream" and I think that that was an impossible dream (laughter), a dream that I didn't think was possible and to walk away with, one, no money mismanaged, no scandals, the only thing that could be said is that there were some that just did not get along with Virginia Edwardss [HistoryMaker Virginia Edwardss Maynor] at the time and to me that--the most important thing was to leave that--a position as contentious as being a superin- and as political as being a superintendent.  When you can walk out the door with your dignity intact, that's an accomplishment as far as I'm concerned because you have to live beyond that.
Story_ID: 656457
Speaker 1: So even though your, your path that you didn't actually see yourself as becoming a superintendent--still by the activities that you did outside of your job as well, even as a young person you said that you gave advice and, you know, you wanted to be a psychologist, whatever, I'm sure you found yourself in the position to help and mentor and sponsor other women of color to higher positions.  Can you speak about what you feel you have accomplished in that area?
Speaker 2: I'll--today, I could name them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The ones who remained in the school system, credit me for be- setting the tone and being an example, not only being an example but I've actually gone, I'll just use a common phrase, to bat for them and to encourage them to improve themselves, educationally, you know, education wise, and they're doing that.  During my leadership, I can say there are, through--four, five more who became principals, one is now a deputy superintendent.  There--
Speaker 1: You can mention their names if you'd like.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  Vanessa Kaigler Miller is now, Vanessa Miller-Kaigler is now deputy superintendent.  Vicki Bryant became principal of Thunderbolt Elementary School [Thunderbolt, Georgia].  Rebecca Ball became princ- principal of Jacob G. Smith [Jacob G. Smith Elementary School, Savannah, Georgia].  Even a male, Gerald Jacobs, became director of personnel, human resources as we call it now.  Beverly Oliver became an executive director for elementary schools.  Maggie Walker [Maggie Walker-Zeigler] is now a retiring, a principal who will retire this year, elementary school principal.  Renae McCullough [Renae Miller-McCullough] is principal of Garris- I mean of Garden City Elementary School [Garden City, Georgia].
Story_ID: 656458
Speaker 1: So there's quite a number of people who you have been involved in, in their lives and their careers.  So there is a difference between mentoring and sponsoring so did you do both?
Speaker 2: I did both.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in so doing, I recommended them for the positions that they hold and today those who are still working, some still call me and ask me my opinion and I honestly share it with them.  I think one of the hallmarks, I think that they would cite would be that I'm honest and very direct and that if they ask me, they're going to get the truth and if you're not doing it, you're going to know it and if you are doing it, you will know it and I think that's one of my qualities that I think endear them to me, personally and professionally.  Some of them actually, we are friends as a result of that, of me working with them and encouraging them and advising them.  So, yes, I not only sponsored but mentored.  In fact the mentoring came before the sponsoring (laughter).  So, yes, to answer your question.
Story_ID: 656459
Speaker 1: Now let's talk about the love story.
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).  Well, in 2009, I went to a class reunion [for Albert E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia] that I had not planned to attend but my aunt encouraged me to go and she said, "You need to go," you know.  I'd been single for twenty-one years and she said, "I'm--you just don't know who you might meet."  I said, "There's nobody in my class that I would ever," (laughter), "think about meeting."  So I--when we were talking on the phone, I was actually in the bed watching a Lifetime story so I didn't plan on getting up to do anything but I finally told her, I said, "Okay, I'll go."  When our conversation ended, I said, I'm not going, then I said, oh no, you can't do that 'cause you told her you were going.  So I got up and I put on something and I did go and sitting there, this young man come--came into the room and I looked at his side profile and I asked one of our classmates, I said, "Isn't that William Maynor," and somebody said, "No, that's not him."  I said, "Oh, I think that is him."  So later in the evening, he came--went to look at some pictures on the memorial wall and turned around and he saw me and when he did, he just, "Oh, is that you?"  We hadn't seen each other in forty-six years.  When we were in high school, we'd wave and smile at each other but we actually met in the Star Theatre [Savannah, Georgia] in 1958 when my girlfriend and I were there watching, I think it was some Western movie, I don't even remember the movie, but he and his friend were sitting behind us and they were being very sickening, pesty, you know, and our parents taught us, you just don't--these boys here.  Oh, they tried to come up and sit next to us and I didn't see him anymore until junior high school and then high school, but we never talked on the telephone, we never even talked on school grounds, it was always from a distance, a smile.  And in 2009, here we are and we started courting, talking about our past experiences.  His wife, unfortunately, passed away.  And, so it was just like, somebody said it was an O-M-G moment and we got married in 2010.  So that's the love story.
Speaker 1: Oh, very nice, very nice.
Speaker 2: But when he tells it, it's a lot more dramatic than me (laughter), than when I tell it, but it's been very good.
Speaker 1: That's, that's very nice, and I'm very happy for you.
Story_ID: 656460
Speaker 1: What about your travels?  Have you traveled?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My sister and my cousin and I, we went to Italy in 2007 and had a good time.  In fact, my cousin's husband's aunt was the executive director for the World Food hunger organization [World Food Programme] and she hosted us in Italy and, so we really had a VIP trip because she had her assistant plan out our activities and our trip so we didn't have to do what most tourists do, find or feel their way around.  Everything was scheduled and well planned and laid out for us and we stayed at her condo in downtown Italy.  So we were right there in the heart of all the happenings, so to speak.  We did take a day trip to Florence [Italy] on the train and that was my first trip, international trip, was to go to Italy.  And I went--I've been to Canada several times, Toronto and Windsor.  My sister lives in Detroit [Michigan] so right across the (laughter), the water there.  Let me see where else I've gone.  Cancun, Mexico, a number of cruises.  I don't care if I ever see the ocean again (laughter).  I've been to Boston [Massachusetts], Connecticut, let's see, Minnesota.  I have a cousin who is actually, now he is definitely a civil rights activist.  In fact, he and Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] were close.  His son [Stokley Williams] is named for Stokely Carmichael.  In fact his son has a group called, Mint Condition.  I don't know if you've heard of that group or not.  Well, the lead singer is my second cousin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I've been there.  North Carolina.  So I've, I've traveled.
Story_ID: 656461
Speaker 1: Is there something that you have not done that you are looking forward to doing?
Speaker 2: Yes, my husband [Edwards Maynor's second husband, William Maynor] and I--actually, we drove across country twice 'cause--when he graduated from high school [Alfred E. Beach High School, Savannah, Georgia], just to back up a minute, he left Savannah [Georgia] and joined the [U.S.] Navy so he was away from here forty something years.  So I had the opportunity to do that and always wanted to do that, to drive across country and see other, just see, just see the world, you know, at a, in a different way 'cause I would fly just about every place I went, San Francisco [California] and wherever but what we want to do is take that--the train ride across country, that's on our bucket list to do, so yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So what else is next for you?
Speaker 2: Well, actually day by day (cough) I look forward to the time that I would not have to have a planned agenda.  Excuse me.  So I don't focus like I once did on, oh, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do--I get up happy and I say, "Let's be a good day to do this," or, "Let's plan to do this."  I'm a dreamer.  I might--my husband would say, "Oh, what you thinking about now?"  Oh, I'm getting, oh, I can be very spontaneous, you know.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So right now other than, you know, wanting to do that great train ride--I like to travel and I don't mind driving.  I like to drive and before I got married, it didn't take much for me to take a trip and do some things.  I have two girlfriends, we get together and we do a girls weekend and go and it's up to the individual to decide where we're going to go.  So the last trip we did was at Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], to a jazz concert, and, and we've been other places too.

Speaker 1: In your lifetime, I know because you were so involved in getting the right to vote, did you think in your lifetime that you would see an African American president of the United States?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Tell me what your thoughts were during the election for Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama]?
Speaker 2: If--it was an out of body experience (laughter) and I tell you, you asked me about the MOLES.  In 2008, we had a conclave in Washington, D.C. and the Washington, D.C. chapter gave us these chocolate--white, it was white, the White House and white chocolate and inside it had dark chocolate.  I kept that in my refrigerator for as long as I could (laughter).  I wouldn't eat it.  It was edible but I wouldn't eat it.  I thought that that was the most amazing--a blessing.  I was so proud, I cried, and my father's [John Williams, Sr.] last living sibling, my aunt [Lucy Williams West], who died at ninety-three, lived to see that.  Now that--I just couldn't imagine a better gift, life gift for her as well as for us, you know.  And then the most, I think, impressive thing is that he left the White House in dig- with dignity, poise, principle, his entire family did and that just say to me that we need to do everything that we can possibly do to uphold that legacy by being active participants and making sure that the things that Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], the Hosea Williams, Medgar Evans--Evers [Medgar Evers], Malcolm X, all the things that they did to shape the conscious [sic.] of this country to get them to realize that we are important people, that we are an integral part of the American story.  We can't go back, we can't, and I think Barack Obama and Michelle Obama do a lot of--is--should be given a lot of credit for helping us really get--I mean, James Brown said, "I'm black and I'm proud," and I am sure if he were alive, that would be a true testament (laughter).  I am black, I am proud.

Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That I'm black and I'm proud and I would want my legacy to be that whatever I did I did it with honesty, dignity and with principle and I owe that to the way I was reared and I thank my parents [Freddie Mae Jones Williams and John Williams, Sr.] every day for the things that they said to me, did for me and encouraged me to be the person that I believe I am today.  So I would want young people to see that we came from a long way with a very challenging and sometimes troubling history as a race, a people, and the things that we accomplished, when we couldn't go to McDonald's, you know.  We didn't know what fast food (laughter) was about.  We couldn't sit anywhere we wanted to on the bus.  The privileges that they enjoy today are gifts and the lack of gratitude is so disappointing because they don't know their story and the parents are not teaching them and that's disappointing and hopefully in some way we can restore the mindset and the focus towards them understanding and if they're not careful, they're going to have to walk that road again but they're not going to have the support, the foresight and the insight that we had unless they wise up, you know.

Speaker 1: Is there anything that we have not spoken about that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I am troubled by what is currently going on in our country.  I know my past and I'm living in the present but I am very worried about the future.
Speaker 1: What word would you have for--what do you want to say to the future generations if--because you know that this is going to be available for a hundred years from now for someone to look at, even twenty years from now.  What message do you want to send to the future generation?
Speaker 2: I would say the best gift that they can give themselves is to read and read with understanding and not compromise who they are but come to understand first, who you are and if your history isn't taught to you, you teach it to yourself because we are losing our way if we don't do that.  You'll lose your way if you don't do that and, two, live life spiritually and with an attitude of gratitude, is what I would tell them.
Speaker 1: Good to know.
