Speaker 1: All right.  My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Observing is Lester Davis and Evelyn Pounds.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Chaka Fattah.  C-H-A-K-A; F as in Frank, A-T-T-A-H.
Speaker 1: All right.  And--while on the name.  Now, is that your given name?
Speaker 2: My name was changed when I was a child by my parents [Falaka Brown Fattah and David Fattah].  And so it is the name I've went into adulthood with.  It's my legal name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  I just wondered because it's an African American name, you know, that's pronounced Fattah.  Right?
Speaker 2: Chaka Fattah.
Speaker 1: And what is the significance of the name?  You have any--
Speaker 2: The--I was named after, obviously, a great figure in African history, Shaka Zulu, and I think it was because my parents hoped that some of the traits of, particularly the notion of discipline, you know, among others, would be--would burden me through life.
Speaker 1: Okay.   And Fattah, what about that part of the name?
Speaker 2: This is the last name of my parents.  The first follows, you know, the second.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there's no--Fattah is not a Zulu name or not an African name as such (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  It's the family name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born November 21, 1956, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am a public servant, a United States congressman.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Representing the 2nd District [2nd Congressional District] of Pennsylvania, principally Philadelphia and a small part of Montgomery County [Pennsylvania], Cheltenham Township [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is the fifth month, the fifth day of 2005 [May 5, 2005].
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in the Rayburn House Office Building in the nation's capital [Washington, D.C.] in my office on the third floor, 2301.
Story_ID: 297963
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, I'm required to ask five short People magazine-ish type questions that only deserve a short answer.  And the first question is:  Do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  (Laughter)  Yeah, I happen to like seafood.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about color?  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Black.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I love the summer and spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I'm more likely to want to be home than anywhere else.
Speaker 1: All right.  The last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No, not particularly.
Story_ID: 297964
Speaker 1: --Well, I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  We'll start with your mother's side of the family first.  And can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Falaka Fattah.  F-A-L-A-K-A.
Speaker 1: Is that her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Her maiden name was Brown.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: December 28th, and born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you give us a year?
Speaker 2: I don't think my mom would appreciate that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, okay.  All right.  Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She's in her early seventies.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, we understand the nature--we don't--you know, a lot of people don't like to give their birthdate.  But what do you know about your mother's side of the family in terms of the ancestors?  How far back can you trace the ancestors on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not a family historian in that sense, but my grandmother [Louise Carlyle West] on my mother's side was born in Virginia, went to Saint Paul University or College [Saint Paul's College, Lawrenceville, Virginia], and graduated in 1923, and came to Philadelphia.  My grandfather [Percy Brown] was an Episcopalian priest at St. Philip's [Episcopal] Church in Richmond, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, can you go back any further than that?
Speaker 2: Yes, I can, but it kind of skips over.  I don't know all the details, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What are the stories, you know--
Speaker 2: Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, who was a very well-known person in African American history, is in our bloodline, and is, I believe the correct terminology would be a great-great-great-aunt of mine.
Speaker 1: Now, that is significant.  I mean she was a very important (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --abolitionist, spokesperson, a poet.  Right?
Speaker 2: And the first daughter in each generation was named Frances Ellen.  My mother's original name was Frances Ellen before she changed her name.  So she was Frances Ellen Brown.  And, for instance, my daughter, who is the first daughter in my generation, is Frances Ellen Fattah.  So it all stems from Frances Ellen Watkins Harper.
Speaker 1: Now, are there any stories about her that have passed down through the family?
Speaker 2: You'd have to probably talk to somebody a little older in the family.  But, you know, there are.  You know, obviously, we pay close attention to her poetry, her writing.  She wrote for a number of the abolitionist newspapers of her day.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  She appeared on the rostrum with Sojourner Truth and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --Susan B. Anthony and other people.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: There's a famous picture of her.  Now I'm going to ask you this question, you might not know the answer, but when I see this engraving of Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, it appears that she has braids.  Is this true?  I mean, have you seen--
Speaker 2: It gives that appearance.  You know, I don't know exactly what the hairstyle might have been called at that time, but it gives that appearance.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  I thought it might be--
Speaker 2: I'm familiar with the picture.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So any other stories about her or any other of your ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: You know, it's just that I think that the point is, as illustrated both by her and my maternal grandmother, you know, who as I say, graduated in the 1920s from a historically black college [HBCU].  And, you know, we traveled back, before her death, to Saint Paul's.  I took her back.  I was to receive an honorary degree and giving the commencement address.  It was a very happy moment for her.
Speaker 1: Now, was she the--I take it she wasn't the first person in your family to graduate from college, your grandmother, that came out of Saint Paul's?
Speaker 2: Well, I really don't know.  But I believe that there weren't many African Americans at that time or many people in America who were graduating from college in the 1920s.
Story_ID: 297965
Speaker 1: So did your mother [Falaka Brown Fattah] talk about growing up in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?  Did she grow up in Philadelphia, too?
Speaker 2: She grew up in Philadelphia.  My mother spent her early years at--well, for twenty years she was a journalist in Philadelphia and wrote--she was the women's editor of The Philadelphia Tribune, which is the oldest African American newspaper in the country.  She wrote for a number of publications.  She then moved into public relations.  She was the person who handled public relations, for instance, for Otis Redding and a number of the entertainers that were moving about at that time, and then established along with my stepfather [David Fattah] a magazine called the Umoja magazine, which came out of the--a conference, the black power conference [National Conference on Black Power], which was held in Philadelphia at the Church of the Advocate [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in 1968-ish or so.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now that was a big deal in those days.  I think the first one was held in '66 [1966] and another one in '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was Gary, Indiana, and kind of moved through, and then Philadelphia.  Right.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  So, Umoja magazine was a product of the black power conference?
Speaker 2: It was--it came--it was established by resolution at the conference.  And a group of African American journalists were concerned about, you know, images that projected, you know, African ancestor people here in the United States.  And so, the magazine was published for many years and as an outgrowth and part of some of the realities of circumstances in Philadelphia and among some of my siblings.  My parents established the House of Umoja [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which is a home for African American young men, which has been in existence now for more than three decades.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this--the House of Umoja is a school or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's an urban boys' town.  It doesn't--it's more than twenty properties in a neighborhood on a single block in the heart of West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and it's a home away from home for young men who, for some number of reasons, may need a place other than home to live.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They may be adjudicated dependent, they may be orphaned, they may be adjudicated delinquent.  There is a kind of a mix of young people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, your mother went--where did she go to college?
Speaker 2: She went to Temple University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Temple.  Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Philadelphia.
Story_ID: 297966
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Russell Killingsworth Davenport.  He's deceased.  He died in his forties.  He was in the--he had a very tough career.  He was both in the [U.S.] military at a point.  He was a cook at a seafood restaurant, which is why I love seafood; Fisher's [Miles Fisher's Restaurant], which used to be on North Broad Street in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  He also had a part time job driving a Good Humor ice cream truck.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I can't actually reference that in particular, but he was born in Philadelphia (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --at about the same time that my mom [Falaka Brown Fattah] was born.  So he would be if he was alive in his early seventies.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But he died around--
Speaker 2: He died in New York in his mid-forties.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you--I get the sense that you didn't grow up with your father.  Is this true or did you?
Speaker 2: Well, I both grew up with father, and they were--at some point, there was a divorce, but he was still very active, you know, actively involved, 'cause we could get free ice cream off the truck, and we could go up to Fisher's and eat all we could eat.  So I never got the sense that, you know, he was not around.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How old were you when your parents split up?
Speaker 2: I was probably ten or eleven or so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was around a while, at least.
Speaker 2: He was around quite a while.  But he had--again, he had a diverse career.  He drove an eighteen-wheel truck across country at times, so he was gone for days and then back.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's see.  Now, did he have a chance to finish school and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: He went into the service as a young man.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he did not go to college.
Speaker 1: Did he serve in World War II [WWII]?
Speaker 2: I don't believe that he was in a war situation.  He was in one of the units back here in the [United] States.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But was it during the time of World War II or the Korean War or--I mean, the '40s [1940s] or '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: I really can't put it in sequence.  It was when he was in his young twenties.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay.  What do you know about your father's side of the family in terms of the ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: Not much.  I mean, they were Philadelphians.  And, you know, he was just, he was different from my mother's side from Virginia.  They were really Philadelphians.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there's no--as far as you know, there's no other origin from that side of the family, you know, outside of Philadelphia?  I mean, that's as far back as you can go?  You can't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  I wish that you were speaking to my mom.  She can tell you the whole history, but I can't.  So, yeah.  I don't want to be inaccurate.  So I can't really, you know, lay it out in that sense.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But he was born and grew up in Philadelphia, and his parents--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Because, you know, because of his early death and their separation, I really don't have that much of a texture to it.
Story_ID: 297967
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Falaka Brown Fattah and Russell Davenport] met?
Speaker 2: Is there a--there is a, you know, in terms of my stepfather and my mother, a great story.  They met at the black power conference [1968 National Conference on Black Power, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And she had six boys, and he wasn't deterred by that.  And they've had a great love affair ever since.  So, you know, my mom was married young originally, you know, to my father.  And she wanted to have a little girl, she ended up with six boys.  She had two other pregnancies that did not come to term, one, because of an accident; and the other because of some other circumstance, the baby was not born alive; and both of them were boys.  So she was trying to have a little girl.  She never seemed to be able to manage that.  She just kept having boys, and that wasn't enough, so she set up a boys' hall [House of Umoja, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And now she--and now there's another six thousand or so young people who she's played an important role in raising.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you mentioned your stepfather.  Let's get his (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think that's a fascinating story (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, let's get your stepfather's full name.
Speaker 2: David Fattah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  David Fattah.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He's probably eight, nine years younger than my mom.  He was born in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  He went to Sulzberger Middle School [Mayer Sulzberger Middle School; Mayer Sulzberger Junior High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and West Philadelphia High [School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  He went on to Temple University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  He's got a couple of degrees.  And he's been in education leadership, and he was a teacher.  He taught at the middle school that I graduated from, Shoemaker [William H. Shoemaker Junior High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  He's just a great guy, I mean to have married a woman with six children, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Older than him, too.
Speaker 2: --who was a little older than him.  And then put up with this desire to bring in any other young men who may have needed a place to live.
Speaker 1: Now what is--I know I asked you about your name in the beginning, but David--is Fattah like an Islamic name or what kind of name is Fattah?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: Well, there are a number of origins to it.  I mean, there're some in the Arabic world who--this is a very common name, slightly, you know, may be pronouncing it in a different phrase, so.  It is a name that at least in terms of the only definition I'm aware of in Arabic, means revealer.  But, you know, I think in our context, we're not Arabs, so.  You know, I'm not sure that we take that so far here.
Speaker 1: Is he a Muslim?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he's not a Muslim.
Speaker 2: We're all--I was raised as an Episcopalian.  And now I'm a Baptist.  I'm a member of a church right in our neighborhood, Mount Carmel Baptist Church [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And my father's a member of Vine Memorial Baptist Church [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  So--now, I think that the African centered names have to do with a sense of consciousness about our historical origins.  And a rejection of the notion that we should allow other people to define us or name us or speak for us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah.  I understand, but I was wondering was his name a conscious--consciously changed or was he born (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --David Fattah--
Speaker 2: No.  It was consciously changed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he had another name in the beginning.  It's not necessarily--
Speaker 2: He changed his--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --he married my mom, she changed ours.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we went on.
Story_ID: 297968
Speaker 1: What aspects of all these parents influenced you the most, I guess?  'Cause I usually ask who do you take after.  But your stepfather's [David Fattah] has had a big influence on you as well.  So I just, you know, of these parents, like, how did they influence you?  How do their personalities and traits influence you and, you know, or what traits influence you the most?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, first, my father [Russell Davenport] has had a big influence on my life, because as I've raised my own children, I have remembered in great detail his interactions with us, me and my brothers as we grew up.  So even though he died young, he had an impact.  Everything from--even when it may have been desired on behalf of others being unwilling to physically spank us, you know, six guys can do a lot of damage to a (laughter) household.  So he would take us upstairs and make us holler as if we were being, you know, spanked in order to communicate to my mom [Falaka Brown Fattah] that, you know, he was taking care of business; but he never put a hand on us.
Speaker 1: Now, that's interesting.  That's really interesting for those days, you know.  I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.
Speaker 1: I'm a little older than you, but I remember those days, and people did whack their children as they still do today.
Speaker 2: Oh.  My [maternal] grandmother [Louise Carlyle West] didn't have any problems whacking us or grabbing us by the ear.  But so, well, my dad would always, you know.  So he was very--he was a very cool operator.  And he was a great storyteller.  And, you know, he would--and one of the things that I do all the time with my children is, you know, I can make up any story you want about, you know, some role I played in some other life.  And he was able to do that.  I mean, he was able to just to be very creative.  And so, but my stepfather's had a big impact.
Speaker 1: Now how did he convey the sense of discipline without whacking you?  Now, I know, I can see the part where he's got your mother thinking he's doing this, but at the same time, how did he impart, you know, a message to you about what you've done?  I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, he was capable of being very stern about whatever the circumstances may have been, you know.  We were playing, you know, ball in the house and it broke a window, you know, whatever the case may be.  But he just didn't believe in corporal punishment in that sense, so.  He got his message across.
Speaker 1: So you--it sounds like maybe he was--he had kind of, but having this secret with you all, he was, like, building his bond with you.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean, that kind of strengthened his bond with you.
Speaker 2: Indeed.  And so, you know, I think that in terms of my, you know, my stepfather, again, I've always respected this, you know, his willingness upon the death of my dad to, you know, to step in, to take on that kind of responsibility.  It elongated, you know, I'm sure, much of his efforts and other regards, like it took him, you know, probably more than a decade to finish college, 'cause he was going to college and, you know.  So he had to go to work, you know, 'cause all of a sudden he had a ready-made family of a wife and six kids.
Speaker 1: And you say they met at the black power conference [Conference on Black Power, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --was it '66 [1966] or '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968].
Story_ID: 297969
Speaker 1: Was he [Fattah's stepfather, David Fattah] a member of a specific organization in those days?
Speaker 2: He was involved a little bit with SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, you know.  And, again, and my mom [Falaka Brown Fattah] was a journalist and she--and a public relations person--and she had done some work, you know, for a number of the kind of figures of that day.  So, you know, it was, it's a great romantic story.
Speaker 1: It is.
Speaker 2: But in terms of your question about traits, you know, my view about politics is that--which is why I said earlier I'm a public servant, is that I see this as really nothing more than an extension of the same level or same type of community work that my parents have been involved in, you know; just through a different vehicle, 'cause I'm able to impact public policy, but it's really targeted in the same direction.  So the notion that we should be involved in the community and that we should be involved in trying to make a contribution, is a trait from both my mom and my stepfather, and their willingness to sacrifice, you know, for the greater good, you know.  So, yeah, and just in terms of--I remember my brother was in the [U.S.] Air Force, came home, the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944], he could afford a nice house in a very nice neighborhood in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]; and he says, you know, he wanted my parents to move there and not live at the boys' home [House of Umoja, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  I think they moved for about a month, and they couldn't take it.  They wanted to be back over with these young men, you know, because their conviction was that you really couldn't impact their lives if you viewed it as some kind of job that you came to versus really trying to create a home life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you've got eight brothers.  Right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: Six brothers.
Speaker 2: It's six brothers.
Speaker 1: Six brothers.  I'm sorry.  I'm adding--
Speaker 2: That's right.  Yes.
Speaker 1: --two (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So six brothers.  And where do you fit in in the order?
Speaker 2: There're three older than me and two younger than me.
Story_ID: 297970
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Do I have an early child--I have a lot of childhood memories.  I can't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You have a first childhood memory?  An earliest one?
Speaker 2: You know, I can--yeah, I have pieces of memories, you know, from when I was, you know, five or four or I think six.  I can't really remember.  You know, my parents [Falaka Brown Fattah and Russell Davenport] bought me a piano and had me taking piano lessons.  You know, I remember, you know, spending a lot of time hanging out with my brothers (laughter), doing things.  So, you know, I mean--you know--but, you know, in the early part of your life, it's hard to like, kind of put a sequence in--one of the more difficult things I have is trying to figure out the time slot that things fall in.  I've had a fairly exciting existence.  So picking out the date or the time--I remember, you know, my first day in school, you know, in kindergarten [at the Western Community Day Care Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  You know, I remember that kind of stuff, so.  But can I remember more about it than it was the first day of school and, you know, walking into class?  Not really.
Story_ID: 297971
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  Maybe this will trigger something, but what are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, schooling was a big part of my existence.  My [maternal] grandmother [Louise Carlyle West], who helped raise us, had a viewpoint about school, which was that you had to go to school unless you were dead or dying; not feeling well was not enough.  So, I mean, school was an essential ingredient in our existence, and church was on each and every Sunday at St. Philip's [Episcopal] Church in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], the same name of the St. Philip's [Episcopal] Church in Richmond [Virginia], 'cause as they moved into Philadelphia they created a church there.  And, you know, so I remember that.  I remember, you know, all of my brothers had--my older brothers had paper routes, and it was, like, kind of passed down from the oldest to the next to the oldest and I, you know, when you got into the age slot, you went out and delivered the papers.
Story_ID: 297972
Speaker 1: I was asking you about some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up.  Maybe if you could give us a sense of what--where you grew up, you know, what it looked like and how that was different from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I grew up in--yeah--
Speaker 1: --what somebody might see today as a kid growing up.
Speaker 2: I grew up in South Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which is the part of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] that was like, the hub of the kind of African American existence in Philadelphia.  There was a lot of culture, a lot of music.  As a young child, I remember going to the Western [Community] Day Care Center [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] on South Street, around the 1600 block of South Street where we would get, you know, if they had like a--it was some kind of--we had kindergarten, I think, there before I went on to elementary school.  And they had this little swimming pool that was probably no bigger than the size of two bathtubs (laughter).  I remember that.  And, you know, I remember learning how to swim at the Christian Street YMCA [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which is the oldest Y [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)] in the country in which African Americans were first able to attend.  It was on the 1700 block of Christian Street in South Philadelphia.  And I remember being taught how to swim there.  And the method used by Mr. Scott [ph.], who ran the Y and was the swim coach, was to throw me in the water.  And that's how he was able to convince people that learning how to swim was vitally important.  So--and he was a figure in--of a large part of our growing up, because we spent a lot of time at the Y, basketball, boxing; you know, all manner of sports.  I remember going to a lot of camps in the summer time.  You know, we would go to day camp at the Y, or we would go--eventually as we got older, in sequence we'd get a chance to go away for a week at camp or two weeks at camp.  We were so good at camping over time, both my older brother and myself became, in our older years, like, counselors and junior--I was a junior counselor.  You know, I was a lifeguard, and I had very significant swimming abilities.  And so, at Camp Pocono in the Pocono Mountains, you know, it's a couple hours outside of Philadelphia.  So, you know--so we kind of, we got to be campers for years, and then we got a chance to work at the camps because my parents, particularly my mom [Falaka Brown Fattah] at that point, wanted to make sure that we had summer activities that were, you know, enriching.  So I remember piano lessons at the Heritage House [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which was an African American community institution, which is--later is now the home of Freedom Theatre [New Freedom Theatre, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which is an African American theatre production company and school in Philadelphia in my district.  You know, and going there once a week for piano lessons and doing well enough that I eventually got my own piano.  You know, so, I remember a lot about my childhood.  Not necessarily the dates or the years, but I remember a lot about it.
Story_ID: 297973
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a kid growing up?  Now, I know you had, like, this unique situation of having, you know, six brothers.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What were you like and what did you like and what didn't you like growing up?
Speaker 2: As is true now, there's not anything that I can remember not liking.  I kind of enjoy life.  Enjoyed it then, enjoy it now.  I have a zest for, you know, what any day may bring.  So I had a ball as a child.  And I was afforded a lot of opportunities.  I was, at least in my mother's [Falaka Brown Fattah] words, I was the favorite among my brothers.  They kind of fought over who could take me places and do things with me.  You know, I'm talking about my older brothers, once I was kind of moving into the kind of toddler stage.  So, you know, and my brothers were protective.  I remember going into school, and through elementary and middle school, you know, I did well in school.  I also had a, you know, at times could be involved in anti-social activities; had a few fights at school.  I was always in the right, I'm sure.  But I was--if you go back now and look at, you know, for instance, I spoke at my elementary school graduation.  I have friends now who I went to first grade with on through college.  A lot of the people around me are people who I've known forever; you know, ten, twenty years; you know in some cases thirty years.  So, I mean, I believe in relationships.  I'm, you know, somebody who's enjoyed important meaningful friendships over my lifetime.  So--and I was true even when I was young, you know.  I remember there were a lot of, you know, odd kinds of things.  I remember my first job was at a pizza shop.  And I was probably, you know, thirteen or fourteen, Towne Pizza [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], 19th [Street] and Pine Street.  And my pay was twenty-five cents an hour to fold the pizza boxes, and all the pizza I could eat.  And I was very happy about that.  I was in my element, you know.  I remember, you know, all kinds of--we used to do a lot of biking, a lot of riding.  So when my son [Chaka Fattah, Jr.] was growing up, we did a lot of biking.  We did a lot of long distance biking.  And now I bike with--I have a six year old.  And even though I got a lot of gray hair, we do a lot of biking.  We've got a tandem bike, and she can pedal when she wants and I pedal when she doesn't want to (laughter).  And we get around a lot.  So, you know, I mean, there's not much from my childhood that's not present in my life now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you say you play the piano.  Did you--there are a lot of famous piano players from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Not that you had to be famous playing (laughter), but was music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: It was a big part in terms of--my mom decided that I'd be very good at playing the piano.  I think I got one or two recitals out of the deal.  And by the time I was, you know, moving into adolescence, I was no longer interested in the piano.  But here, again, for my six-year-old, I bought a piano, she has piano lessons, you know.  And I think it's just a continuation of this cycle of hoping against hope that there may be something there that can be developed.

Speaker 1: What grade school did you go to?
Speaker 2: I went to Durham, D-U-R-H-A-M, Elementary [Thomas Durham Elementary School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] at 16th [Street] and Lombard [Street].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It is, Mrs. Snead [ph.] was the principal.  And it was a great experience for me.
Speaker 1: It was like an all-black neighborhood school at that time?
Speaker 2: It was an all-black neighborhood school, that was a great school, and we learned a lot.  And I still have friends who I started that--I started the first day, that term with Mike Joyce, who's a friend of mine.  We went to elementary school on through up to our college days together, and Barbara Upshaw [ph.], a host of people.  So it was great.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Reading.  You know, I spent a lot of time in the library, both at the school library and at the main Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], what we call the Free Library of Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  So I was an insatiable reader, still am.  And, you know, just, you know, seeking information.  It didn't to me whether it was a comic book I was reading or the encyclopedia.  If it was there and I hadn't read it, I wanted to read it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, is that a trait that all your brothers shared?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think evenly, but, you know, we all, there're brothers of mine who did a lot better in math or, you know, better in some other something else.  I loved to read.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And were there any particular teachers at school that were important in your development?
Speaker 2: There were teachers throughout, you know, my elementary and middle and high school years [at Overbrook High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] who had an impact on me.  Mrs. Snead, who became the principal--but when I first started, I mean, she was, like, she was our teacher.  She was--somehow she was our homeroom teacher, I think; our first grade teacher; she had a big impact on me.  Shirley Jean Waites, who was a teacher who in middle school had a big impact on me.  So, you know, I think that--and most importantly, my mom [Falaka Brown Fattah] was kind of like our main educator in a sense.  Not only would she, like, kind of prescribed for us to read or learn, she would go in painstaking detail over concepts and issues well beyond the classroom.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you were about ten, you said your parents were divorced?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, so you're ten years old (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When I say divorced, I--you know, a better way would be, probably separated and then my father [Russell Davenport] died, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he wasn't--he didn't live (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --much past--okay.  So this is 19--it would be '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 2: Oh, he lived past there.  But I don't think--I'm not--I can't really say that they were technically divorced, I guess is my point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think they were separated until his death.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they were separated in '66 [1966] or so?  I guess you were ten?
Speaker 2: See, now, you're trying to get into these set years.
Speaker 1: Well, you were ten if you were born in '56 [1956].  Ten years is--
Speaker 2: I was born in '56 [1956], around that time.  Right.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's all.  I'm understanding (laughter), trying to--but, so, now your mother was involved in politics and culture (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  See, I want you to follow this.  Right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They were separated.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My stepfather [David Fattah] and mom met each other at the black power conference [Conference on Black Power, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: My father died later on, you know, a few years after that.  Okay.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This in sequence.
Speaker 1: But I got--I was just--when you, I'm just saying that when you were in school, now that was--that couldn't have been a great time, you know; but at the same time, there were a lot of other things going on in the, I guess, in the school environment in those days.  I think you may be the first generation that had black history taught in grade school.  I mean, for a long time.  I mean, one of the first groups where it was really a focus, you know.
Speaker 2: We had black history taught in grade school.  We had in our home, books galore.  Actually, like history books, Encyclopedia Britannica; anything that my mom could find and she thought could be useful was available, you know.  I mean, from Ebony magazine.  Black families use a lot of different kind of tools.  But, you know, there was a lot of information around.
Story_ID: 297975
Speaker 1: Were you aware of the rich history that Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] had in terms of African American people and some of the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean you have a lot of firsts there in the city, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Philadelphia has made some very significant contributions to African American history, you know, from Richard Allen on through.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were you aware at the time that you were one of the first generations to get a lot of education in public schools about black history?
Speaker 2: I was aware, because, for instance, my [maternal] grandmother [Louise Carlyle West] wanted to be a teacher.  But when she first came from Saint Paul [Saint Paul's College, Lawrenceville, Virginia] to Philadelphia to be a teacher, they wouldn't allow African Americans to teach in our schools.  So she went off to work for the federal government, which was an opportunity.  She worked in the [U.S.] Social Security Administration for twenty years.  Then she taught for twenty years.  Then she, you know, she had a number of careers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell me about high school.  Now--or did you go to middle school first?  Was there a middle school?
Speaker 2: I went to what was then called junior high school.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: But it's now called middle school, Shoemaker Middle School [William H. Shoemaker Junior High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Well, first for a year I went to middle school.  This is like in a transition period.  I went to middle school at Vare Junior High [Edwin H. Vare Junior High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in South Philly [South Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] for the first year, which would have been seventh grade; and then the latter two years, eighth and ninth grade, at Shoemaker Junior High, because my family moved from South Philadelphia to West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what's the difference between South Philadelphia and West Philadelphia in terms of population?
Speaker 2: I'm sure people would draw a lot of differences, but, you know, basically, I mean from a broader perspective, I mean, they're both, you know, kind of row house, working-class neighborhoods.  West Philadelphia was a, you know--there was a--you know, it was a kind of a step towards kind of something you maybe might want to consider upward mobility a little bit.  But it was still a middle-class neighborhood, and--but, yeah, there were some people--there were people in that neighborhood within a block of us who were, you know, the first African American to be an elevator operator or Avon salesperson or the like.  So, you know, there was a, it was more--where we moved, it was an integrated neighborhood, versus where we had moved from, which is--now if you look at it now, you know, South Philadelphia is much more integrated than West Philadelphia.  So I would say with time things changed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So around the time that you're in junior high school, that's when your mother [Falaka Brown Fattah] met your stepfather [David Fattah].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, you know, people were all over the country, I guess, talking about black power and, like, it's more of a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: --yeah, African-centered environment.  Where did you get your name?
Speaker 2: My parents got married--my father said that they got married, they changed their names and changed ours.  That was the deal.
Speaker 1: So they just told you that?
Speaker 2: There wasn't--it wasn't a democratic process.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there a ceremony involved in it?
Speaker 2: No.  There was no ceremony.  It was a discussion, you know.  And, you know, it was a new--and we moved, we moved into a new home, we moved into a new, you know--it was much more, rather than a kind of a family that was centered internally; it was now centered much more in the broader community.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, rather it was the magazine [Umoja], you know, rather it was that the early beginnings of the boys' home [House of Umoja, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which, you know, was kind of started when one of my older brothers was involved in some antisocial activity, that's now referred to as gangs.  And I think that my parents, mother and stepfather, had the impression that maybe others of us might follow in that direction.  And they felt that they needed to be more aggressive.  And so they took my brother and his whole cohort of associates and just invited them to move in with us.
Speaker 1: All of them?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Now, how big a place did you have?
Speaker 2: So that this whole gang from South Philadelphia was transplanted into West Philadelphia.
Story_ID: 297976
Speaker 1: That's the beginning of the House of Umoja [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  You know, so we had one house, we bought another one, and another one.  In my teenage years, I helped secure another ten properties.  I think it was fourteen.  I went in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So--wait a minute.  They started out with one residence.  Right?
Speaker 1: Right.  And now it's almost (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How big was it--
Speaker 1: --the whole block.
Speaker 2: Was it really big?  A big house?
Speaker 1: No.  It's a row house.  When I say one residence, and everybody was there, it was like sleeping bags.  She took all the furniture out.  My parents [Falaka Brown Fattah and David Fattah] kind of cut this deal, which was that she would--she felt that in order to get my brother out of, you know, this situation--it was at this point of time, there was probably seventy or so gang deaths in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] each year during this period.  I mean, gang warfare was getting to be a major issue.  And so this was a fairly aggressive attempt to both transport her one son she was concerned about, out of the neighborhood in which this gang activity was going on, into a different part of town.  And since he wanted to continue to hang out with some of his friends, she just took them along.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, this is--the way you described it.  I'm doing this for the sake of history, 'cause I grew up in a situation where there were no gangs, you know.  We just, we had, like, tough guys talking no gangs in Dayton, Ohio.  But, in Chicago [Illinois], gangs have thousands of members.  You talk about the Conservative Vice Lords or the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The federal government estimates there're about eight hundred thousand gang members--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the country of various types.
Speaker 2: Black Disciples and the Black Gangster Disciples [Black Gangster Disciple Nation] in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You're talking about lots of people.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: P. Stone Nation [Black P. Stone Nation], they have, like, thousands of members.  So when we talk about a gang here, by definition (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, she was--
Speaker 2: --your definition--
Speaker 1: --we're talking about--
Speaker 2: --of a gang in those days was what, just a group?
Speaker 1: This was a very small--this was, like, fifteen--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --to eighteen.  It depends, you know, 'cause somebody's in one day and out the next.  So, you know, kind of as a floating--but it was a--to get into a row house in West Philly [West Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], it was really, it was a lot of people.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Okay.  But it's a--I mean, when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: --people hear gangs in different--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --cities they have different conceptions of what that is.
Speaker 1: So, you know, so that this need to interact, you know, which was kind of driven by my brother's activities, kind of broadened this thing into, well, we're going to have to--we're going to save him--I'm speaking now in my parents' voice.  They felt they had to do something with the whole group.  And then that broadened from that activity to the House of Umoja becoming like the centerpiece of the cities addressing the gang problem.  I mean, we--when I say we, the House of Umoja hosted--because I was a teenager at the time--the first, I think it was a no-gang war conference where all the gang leaders were invited, and the sit-down.  You would have thought it was the UN [United Nations], you know, around (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Are these mostly small groups like this group of fifteen members?
Speaker 1: No.  No.  Many of the other ones were very large, you know.  So what I'm saying is that the House of Umoja moved from, you know, kind of that, helping these fifteen to interacting with the gang problem all throughout the city and in other cities over time.
Speaker 2: Now, that's quite an undertaking.  And I mean that--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --takes a lot of commitment to do that.
Speaker 1: They are unusually committed.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Now, Umoja means--
Speaker 1: Unity.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In Swahili.
Speaker 2: That's right.  And so, you know, you got the House of Umoja, and you said it began to grow and you were going to buy other properties?
Speaker 1: Right.  Now it's like twenty-six properties, twenty-four properties.
Speaker 2: So they bring on a staff of people--
Speaker 1: There was a staff--there's a staff now.
Speaker 2: And they lived in the houses?
Speaker 1: They lived there.  And every single day, even to today, they send the kids off to school, and they interact with them.  They take them to--they are parents in every sense of the word to these young people.
Story_ID: 297977
Speaker 1: Now, how did you feel as a teenager?  Now, teenagers have a me first concept, you know, which the process of maturity thins out.  I mean, to be mature is to think about more than just yourself, you know.  But the people--how did you feel as a teenager, you know, with a house full of other teenagers, with all these people being in and out of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I loved it.  These are the guys--you know, I was in the kind of teenage years, and these were older teenagers who I looked up to, you know, and I learned a lot from each of them in different ways.  And so it really wasn't--you know, it wasn't--it was more of an opportunity in that sense, you know, in the sense that I couldn't really hang out with them, but I could learn a lot from them.  And, you know, I think that it was an experience that prepared me in many ways for the life I lead now; that is, that I've always had a sense of variety of perspectives.  You know, so there's this guy who was dodging the draft, and here's a guy who was going off to Vietnam, or going off to the war [Vietnam War], and the debates around the kitchen table about that, you know, and the whole host of issues that young men have to deal with as they grow up, so.  And as I've traveled through my adulthood, all of these young people who I grew up with in various walks of life.  So there are, you know--there's a young man, Mikel Jones, who we grew up on Frazier Street at the House of Umoja [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Now he's now a lawyer out in West Palm Beach [Florida].  Before he went there, he helped me with my first campaign when I ran for [U.S.] Congress.  We have, you know--and there's Curt Jones [Curtis J. Jones, Jr.]; he's a big shot in the city administration helping small businesses.  He grew up at the house.  So there is a host of people, thousands literally, of what are in all other respects other than biological, brothers of mine and involved in all manner of activity in industry, and situated in different circumstances around the city and around the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did you have to do to be part of a House of Umoja?  Did you have to do anything special, I mean, in the--other than stay out of trouble or something or did you have to--were there problems?
Speaker 2: No.  It was a family in the sense that, whatever the circumstances you got help.  But, you know, the only thing we did was there was a family meeting, which we used to have where there was just the six of us, and now it's just a broader meeting every week.  And it was kind of like, what happened last week, what's going to happen next week; somebody's got a doctor's appointment; somebody's got a problem at school; did somebody--and now and in this bigger group, somebody's got a court case, you know (laughter) that comes up next week; and that kind of thing.  So it was kind of--it was order, and there was, as far as--speaking on behalf of my parents [Falaka Brown Fattah and David Fattah], I mean, their view was that they were going to treat all of these young people as if they were their kids.  So--and that--and if you go by there today, it's the same thing.
Story_ID: 297978
Speaker 1: In those days, I mean, did some of the political figures involved in the black movement, like, come by, you know, and participate or help [at House of Umoja, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: There were a variety of people who helped at times.  I wouldn't say there weren't necessarily political figures, but there were people involved in the, what you might want to refer to as the movement, everyone from Queen Mother Moore through, you know, Amiri Baraka.  I mean, you know, you could go through the--who, because of the connections to the black power conference [Conference on Black Power], you know, spent time in and around.  There was Imari Obadele, the president of the Republic of New Afrika, who spent time there.  So, you know, there was this connection via the magazine [Umoja] and then there was this, you know, this home for boys, and then, it was kind of merged together.  And then as--the staff at Umoja decided that helping fifteen or so young people wasn't enough, that there needed to be a broader outreach around this whole issue of youth violence and gang warfare.  Then there was a series of conferences, you know, and campaigns, the No Gang War in '74 [1974] campaign; and the Stay Alive in '75 [1975] campaign, which were, in many respects, like political campaigns.  I mean, there were posters and there were leaflets, and there were rallies and conferences, and peace talks.  And so, I mean, you could roll up the front page of The [Philadelphia] Inquirer and see me in '74 [1974] on the front page with a group of young men in Wynnefield [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], the Wynnefield section of West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], negotiating with my father [David Fattah]--when I refer to my father, my stepfather--you know, a peace agreement.  They had kind of had some arguments and in the result of this argument, two young people had been killed.  And, you know, we went over--that is, I went over with my stepfather to try to see to what degree we could find some meeting of the minds.  So I was involved in these matters, you know, in a variety of different ways.  I was young, but I got lot of exposure to a lot of things in my early teenage life.
Story_ID: 297979
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about Umoja House [House of Umoja, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] again before we move on to something else.  But, when all fifteen of the young men involved in a gang moved in with your parents [Falaka Brown Fattah and David Fattah] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --what did their parents say?  What are their parents saying?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a lot of approval about getting these slightly older young men out of South Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]; that is, out of harm's way.  And, so there was a lot of support for this.  I mean, this approach is a very different approach.  And it's somewhat akin to some of my education policies and programs, like the GEAR UP program, which we'll talk about much later.  But it's a unique approach among education policies in a sense that it provides services to every single student in the grade levels.  So all seventh graders or all eighth graders and ninth graders, and eventually the whole school, because if you go back to the whole House of Umoja concept, the decision was that my older brother was so inextricably intertwined with his peers, that if there was going to be a successful intervention, it would have to be broad enough to kind of lift all of them out of their circumstances.
Speaker 1: Yes.  It couldn't be a tug back and forth.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It had to surround all of it.
Speaker 2: You know.  And if my parents would say--my daddy would say they would say they'd made a simple deal, which was they would try to keep all of them alive and fulfill whatever needs they had.  And, if there was anything left over, they need to figure out he they could do about the wants.  There used to be a chalkboard where my mama put a line down the middle.  She put needs on one side, wants on the other.  And you know, you kind of work through it.  And if you got over there and there was still something left, you know, you might get to go to the movies.  But if somebody needed, you know, whatever they might need; you know, a pair of shoes or--you know.  If they had a court case and they needed a suit to wear, you know.  So it was like parties versus desires.
Speaker 1: So did your mother and your stepfather come up with all of the structure for this themselves?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, did the boys that were involved, did they have a chance to contribute to the structure?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was that we had a family meeting each week.  And all of the rules were set by the group.  And that even if somebody did something they may not or should have done or failed to do something they should have done, any decision about what ought to happen about that was made by the crew of all of the young men, including myself, who lived there.
Speaker 1: Now, to those who were around in those days and involved with people involved in African-centered activities now in the black communities, they would see--we would see that as being African-centered; that kind of approach.
Speaker 2: And if you went to the House of Umoja today, you would see--in the middle of urban Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], you'd see African architecture, and you'd see this--these concepts kind of actualized.  So, you know, it wasn't so much that, you know, people wore or didn't wear, you know, dashikis or had or didn't have African-sounding names.  It was in the living of it.  This notion that was talked about after the black power conference [1968 Conference on Black Power, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and it's talked about even today, you know, that all of us should be the parents of all of the children in our midst versus just our own children, you know, which was the--but this was an actualization of it in a way that is unique.
Story_ID: 297980
Speaker 1: There's a brother from Philadelphia [Philadelphia], John Churchville, had a school that was focused on when Bill Cosby did this special on black history, 'Lost, Stolen, or Strayed.'  Him also being a Philadelphian.  But do you remember John Churchville?
Speaker 2: I remember him.  And I remember the special.  I mean, there are, not just my parents [Falaka Brown Fattah and David Fattah], but a host of people who come out of Philadelphia who've made very substantial contributions both in working with young people in education or at international affairs, you know, whether Leon Sullivan or Bill Gray [HistoryMaker William H. Gray, III] with the South African divestiture bill [Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986]; him and Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] worked on when they were here in the [U.S.] Congress, you know, it's--[W.E.B.] Du Bois wrote a book about the Philadelphia, what he called 'The Philadelphia Negro.'  There is, you know, I mean, Philadelphia is a fascinating part of African American history in every respect.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So today there're like--Umoja House [House of Umoja, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] still exists, doesn't it?
Speaker 2: It exists today.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The same way it existed, you know, in the 1970s. Every single Saturday morning, the young people who lived there, there's this meeting that's an opportunity to kind of rehash the week and look forward to the next week.  And at the tail end of it, people are given assignments relative to either individual circumstances or to, you know, the facility itself, towards the things that need to get done.  And it functions today as it did then.
Speaker 1: Do you think your life would have been different had you not been exposed to that, I mean, to Umoja House, growing up?
Speaker 2: I think my life would have been very different.  And I think that the exposure has everything to do, for instance, with my success and my ability as a lawmaker.  You know, the key to being a lawmaker is, you got to find ways to get other people to agree with you if you want to get something done.  And you got to take people who come from very diverse backgrounds and diverse places and, you know, mold--if you want to get a bill passed in the Congress, you got to get 218 votes.  So, you know, you got to have some ability to not see things just from your own eyesight.  You have to be able to see it from other people's eyesight in order to then fashion a dynamic in which you can get some agreement.  So I think that we enter that situation where, if we were going to watch TV, there had to be some agreement about (laughter) what we might watch.  Or if we wanna, you know, go to the movies or--whatever we were going to do, there was a lot of us.  And so, the need to negotiate and to discuss and then kind of reason together, you know, was important.
Story_ID: 297981
Speaker 1: Tell us about Overbrook High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Now you went to Overbrook, and it's--a lot of people know it as the school the Wilt Chamberlain went to.  And that's a famous high school in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Guion Bluford went to Overbrook, first African American to go off into space.  And Willie [L.] Williams, who became a police chief in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and in other parts of the country.  Overbrook has produced--yeah, Will Smith.  So it's had a very proud history.  It is a neighborhood high school, different and distinct from a magnet school or school that requires some special ability to be, you know, or talent to be admitted to.  So if you live in the neighborhood, you get to go to Overbrook.  And it's rich in the sense that it's got a rich history.  It's what we refer to as a castle in the hill.  It's up on the top of this hill and on 59th [Street] in Overbrook [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And it's probably not different from, you know, essentially all African American high schools in cities all around the country.  And, you know, it was, I was there in the early '70s [1970s], and it prepared me in important ways for the rest of my academic life.
Speaker 1: Did you get involved in student government or clubs or club activities and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I was involved in the student union with Curtis [J.] Jones, Jr., who was at the House of Umoja [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] with me at that time.  He was the president of the student union.  We ran--I got involved with politics because we decided that there should be a young person who runs for the Democratic--a delegate to the Democratic Convention [1976 Democratic National Convention, New York, New York], and so we ran Curt, he was eighteen, to be a delegate once we found out you only needed to be eighteen to run.  I was his campaign manager.  Overbrook is, like, a long--it's got, like, a long trail to it all the way up to now, because we did kind of, like, move from the--every significant person in my campaigns and other respects are from Overbrook or from the House of Umoja or from my earliest years.  You will--so, you know, the guy who--so anyway, we ran Curt for a delegate of the Democratic Convention as an uncommitted delegate.  It was, Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] was running, and I'm trying to remember who was running against him at that time, but there were a number of people in the field, and we didn't want to be committed to anybody.
Speaker 1: And Gerald Ford [President Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.], I think.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm talking about in the Democratic primary.
Speaker 1: Oh, the Democratic primary.
Speaker 2: And I don't really remember, maybe Scoop Jackson [Senator Henry M. Jackson].  And I can't remember who else was in there.  But we didn't want to be committed to any of them.  We ran--so I was his campaign manager and ran him.
Story_ID: 297982
Speaker 1: But we also--but even before that, we went and took over the citywide student unions, and so, citywide student unions.  We had a political convention for young people in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in which I remember we got [HistoryMaker] Eddie Williams, who was the head of the Joint Center [Joint Center for Political and Economics Studies, Washington, D.C.], to come in and speak to this group.  We had about--we thought we were going to have, you know, five hundred high school students.  When we picked him from the train station and checked in back at the convention, where we were having the convention, you know, we had about fifty kids.  So we were scooping kids up off the street so that we'd have some audience for him to speak to.  Yeah, we had, you know--we went up, rounded up the guys at the House of Umoja [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], got them there (laughter).  Yeah, yeah.  So we were involved in a lot of--we started some group that was called the Youth Movement to Clean Up Politics [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Got a little office.  And, you know, we were, I'm sure, an aggravation to some of the more established political figures.
Speaker 2: The Youth Movement to Clean Up Politics?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Wow.  That--so you all were, you know, not getting into regular teenage trouble, you all were causing a different other kinds of troubles, huh (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  And when we were twenty-one, me and Curt [Curtis J. Jones, Jr.], he was at Millersville [Millersville University, Millersville, Pennsylvania], I was over at Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  We ran for a citywide--I ran for something called city commissioners.  And we ran as a team.  The top two finishers would win.  It was a field of twenty-two.  I placed fourth, he placed, I think, sixth, you know.  But we got on the ticket of Charles Bowser, who was the first--this was the first significant race for mayor of an African American.  There were other races.  I won't say the first significant.  This was the first race in which somebody really had a, you know, a reasonable opportunity to be competitive.  And we were--got on his ticket, because there was another conference.  There was a black political convention in that year, like in '75 [1975].  They endorsed the ticket and so--
Speaker 2: Did you go to the National Black Political Convention in Gary [Indiana] in '72 [1972]?
Speaker 1: My parents [Falaka Brown Fattah and David Fattah] went.  I didn't go.  But the point is, is that--so we ran for office when we were twenty-one, and we didn't win, but we placed very well in the process; couldn't wait to run again.  I ran in--a couple of years later, I was twenty-three--for the state house.  Curt ran my campaign.  It's kind of, we kind of flip-flopped.  We set up our office at 59th [Street] and Oxford [Street], right across the street from Overbrook High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And if you go and read the newspapers from the day I won, you will see a picture that says, and this--you know, talk about my victory and says, you know, "The Pied Piper of Independent Politics."  Right?  And the reference was to, like, four hundred kids from Overbrook, essentially being the army for this campaign.  So we had all these young people, including Will Smith, who was in Overbrook at that time that I campaigned.  And the whole campaign was made up of, even though we were in our early twenties, in large measure to younger people who were, you know, 17, 16, 18, who were at Overbrook.  They were, like, the army that we beat the entrenched the Democratic incumbent.  Mayor Frank Rizzo, at the time, was quoted in the Sunday paper after this victory saying that I had groups of young people dragging senior citizens out of their homes and go vote on Election Day.  And that was the only reason I beat the incumbent at that time, Nicholas Pucciarelli.  Now dragging was probably not the term that I would have used, but it was a very assertive campaign in which I think the community was impressed that there were so many young people, some of them who could not even vote themselves, who were actively engaged.
Story_ID: 297983
Speaker 1: And to roll the tape back a few minutes, when I was at Overbrook [Overbrook High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I was picked even before I was eighteen, before I could register to vote.  This is at the same time that young people got the right to vote.  It was, like, this was the first presidential election in which eighteen-year-olds were going to be able to vote.  So there was something that was created called the Youth Citizenship Fund based here in Washington [D.C.].  And they picked a group of young people around the country that they were going to train in voting registration.  I happened to be the person selected from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And there were other young people brought in.  And Maynard Jackson and [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond and a whole group of people, mainly from Atlanta [Georgia] for some reason--I guess that--I'm sure nobody would admit it, but it probably was some kind of forerunner to the Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] race that was going to come down the road, but that this was just a non-profit activity that was dedicated to getting young people registered to vote.  And, anyway, I was selected out of some process that led me down here for training.  So, you know, I was probably, like, seventeen or sixteen at the time, and I was trained in voter registration techniques and sent home.  You got, like, a little budget and you got a little stipend and you were--your job was go get young people registered to vote.  And then eventually the young lady that I had--they picked a young person to run the thing--run it is a liberal use of the word, 'cause they had some slightly older people, who were really running it; you know, Ron Shapoli [ph.] is a name I remember, good friend; he's now in Atlanta.  He said, "I'll tell you this whole thing has something to do with Atlanta."  Anyway, she for some reason, after being selected to be the youth leader of this program, in a couple of weeks had to depart.  And so, while I was going to at Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] running the voter registration, they brought me to Washington to run the whole, at least in title, run the whole thing.  So I got to travel around, and to see activities that were being put on by these other kind of youth voter registration coordinators that were part of the same group they had been training over the early course of the summer.  So, I came to Washington as a very young person in that capacity while I was a student at Overbrook, and got to be involved in a way with youth voter registration nationwide.  I was entitled the director, and I mean, I had some input, but I didn't have to control over the budget, which kind of disturbed me.  But it was a lot of fun.  We got a lot of stuff done.  And I remember coming to Washington even in a different capacity.  It was a hearing held by Congressman Conyers [HistoryMaker John Conyers, Jr.] for youth gang violence, and my parents [Falaka Brown Fattah and David Fattah] were going to testify.  And I drove them--I believe I drove them down here.  It was like sixteen or something, you know.  And so I got to visit the [U.S.] Capitol [Washington, D.C.] and see [U.S.] Congress people at work.  I was quite impressed with a number of them.  I was particularly impressed with Yvonne Burke [HistoryMaker Yvonne Braithwaite Burke].  I thought she was beautiful.  And as a young man, I was, "Maybe I want to be a congressman.  I would meet her."  So anyway, I, you know, I mean, so I--you know, my young teenage life was full of these kinds of activities.
Story_ID: 297984
Speaker 1: Seems like a rich and a full educational life outside of school even.  Now, in school, I mean, did you--what was your favorite subject in school?  Was it political science--I mean, social studies or history or what?
Speaker 2: I had more interest at parts of growing up in outside activities.  But in school, what happened was I did get an inspiration.  There was this counselor on my first day at Overbrook [Overbrook High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], when I got to be an Overbrook student, who had decided that I should go into wood shop, and that I shouldn't go into the academic tract.  And my mother [Falaka Brown Fattah] was energized about this, including--and also my stepfather [David Fattah].  And they had decided I should go into the academic track in part because my mom had went to South Philadelphia High [South Philadelphia High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which is just like Overbrook, but it's a South Philly neighborhood [South Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], they had decided that she shouldn't go into a college track.  In fact, as you go around, and you can check this with all these other interviews you do, you'll find that almost in every instance, African Americans are deterred from, you know--Wilson Goode [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. W. Wilson Goode, Sr.] with John Bartman [John Bartman High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which is just like Overbrook, except it's in southwest Philly, it's a neighborhood high school, before he got to Morgan State University [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], when it was his first day in high school, he was told he shouldn't go--so anyway, this particular counselor had decided this.  My mom had decided something else.  So I was going to high, you know, I'm going along, going along.  And then I, in high school, enrolled--but I was a high school student in community college in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and started taking courses there, which, again, if you jump forward, I'm the leader in the [U.S.] Congress on what are called early college programs, and doing enrollment for that is getting high school students enrolled in college.  The Gates Foundation [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation] has done a lot of research on this--and one of our--the consensus is that part of the problem in high school, these kids are bored.  They're not academically challenged, particularly in poorly funded schools.  They don't have the rigors that you need.  So anyway, and I have all over my district now, I have the most aggressive early college program anywhere in the country.  I mean, I have high schools, the same kids in the same neighborhood that I grew up in, now are in tracks in which they can finish high school and get their associate's degree at the same time.  But anyway, so I started community college.  I was a dual student.  I was at Overbrook, I was at community college.  I used to revel in harassing this counselor at Overbrook, you know, with my community college book bag and my ID.  And eventually, you know, I went on to University of Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  I harassed her some more.  And when I got to the Kennedy School [John F. Kennedy School of Government] at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], the woman just retired.  I mean, that was about it for her.  So, you know, I say all that to say that I was involved in an eclectic group of both educational activity in the sense that I was both in high school and in college, which may sound unusual, but it's actually not in upper-middle class households.  In large numbers, kids are taking college credits while they're in high school, having some experiences.  And I took the same track with my own children, and it's both my oldest son and daughter; one who's now--my daughter [Frances Fattah] is a lawyer and practices in Philadelphia; my son [Chaka Fattah, Jr.] is finishing at Drexel University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], his undergraduate work. Both took college credit courses at college while they were in high school.  And now they've introduced legislation that has provided across the country early college opportunities for, you know, well over a million children.  Because I think that we should be pushing our young people forward rather than holding them back.
Speaker 1: That makes sense.  So--
Speaker 2: So you see again, this kind of, the early activities kind of flow into the activities now.
Story_ID: 297985
Speaker 1: You have any stories about Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was at Penn in--first in a program--entered through community college into a program called the Community-Wharton Education Program, which was a reach out program to people in the community, who might not otherwise meet the mark, but to kind of let them come in and take credits in the evening school.  Me and Mike Joyce got in.  We went to first grade through--on through--the same Mike Joyce--we got in, in part, not necessarily being motivated by academics.  We were very interested in the evening college basketball team at Penn and getting involved in evening college basketball.  We played a lot of basketball at that time.  So, but we also took the courses and it was great, and then rolled from there into the regular Wharton [Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] program, and then--and also became a parent very early, you know, and so, and also got a master's [degree] eventually from Penn.  Now, I didn't the undergrad.  I kind of left that and went to work for a while, and when I came back, I got the--I went into this master's program at the Fels School of Government [Fels Institute of Government, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] at Penn, and I kind of--
Speaker 1: You got the master's without getting a bachelor's degree?
Speaker 2: That's what I'm saying.  I'm always kind of jumping ahead, you know.  So I went back, but it was, like, a little bit later.
Story_ID: 297986
Speaker 1: I was now twenty-four.  I was elected to the State House of Pennsylvania [Pennsylvania House of Representatives] at 24, 25.  And the speaker of the house was an African American, K. Leroy Irvis, who I really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How do you spell that now?
Speaker 1: Irvis, I-R-V-I-S; K; Leroy Irvis.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There were only two African American speakers at the time; one was Willie Brown [HistoryMaker Willie L. Brown] of California; and he really had a lot of, you know, attention.  Irvis didn't.  But he was just as effective in many respects.  But, anyway, he decided when I first got elected to the state house in my early twenties, that I was going to dedicate my career, he decided, to education.  And he appointed me to the House Education Committee, then he appointed me to the board of Temple University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], to the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, let's go back a little bit.  Now, when you were twenty-five when you won this election, you described earlier how--
Speaker 1: Well, I started running when I was twenty-three.  I ran for a year before the election.  Got elected when I was twenty-four.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And you get elected in November--
Speaker 2: And then you serve, start serving--
Speaker 1: --and got sworn in January.  And my birthday was in November.  So I became, I think, twenty-five; become the youngest person to serve in the State House of Pennsylvania--
Speaker 2: So at the time--
Speaker 1: --in history at the time.
Speaker 2: --you were at Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] when you were elected?
Speaker 1: I was at Penn in the evening school--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --left to go run.  I ran for a year.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And also (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And you came back--
Speaker 1: --had another--
Speaker 2: --to Penn--
Speaker 1: --and then I had a second child--
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: My son [Chaka Fattah, Jr.] was born right before I was sworn in.  He was born, like, in the end of November before I was sworn on in, in that January.  So--
Speaker 2: Now, where did you meet his mother?
Speaker 1: We were, you know, high school sweethearts.  She didn't go to my high school [Overbrook High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  She went to the Audenried High [Charles Y. Audenried High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  But I didn't hold that against her.  But the point was--this is the point, I got involved in education policy because the speaker decided that I needed to focus as a young lawmaker on a subject matter.  He decided it was going to be education.  And he gave me all of these, like, major appointments.  I mean, he appointed me to the House Education Committee, to the Temple University board as his representative.  Keep it in mind I didn't go to Temple.  And I looked like I was still young enough to go to Temple when I showed up at the board meeting.  But I was eventually appointed by him to the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency; the Temple University board; Penn State University [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania] board, which was on the other side of the state; Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] board; and on and on and on and on.  And so it had created the foundation from which you see all of these kind of activities that I'm involved in now, and the success that I've had in terms of education policy.  But to go back, in my first term the speaker felt that I needed to learn more about the public policy process.  And in my first term, he sent me to the Kennedy School [John F. Kennedy School of Government] at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in a specialized program they had there for state and local officials over the course of the summer.  And while there, I really kind of reenergized my interest in learning in academic research relative to public policy, how policy worked.  And so I came back home and applied for and was admitted into a master's [degree] program at the Fels School of Government [Fels Institute of Government, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] on a special advisory that allowed me to non-matric at first, prove my ability and then be admitted.
