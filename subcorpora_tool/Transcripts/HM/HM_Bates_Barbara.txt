Speaker 2: My mother's name is Vera Bates. V-E-R-A -B-A-T-E-S. And my father's name was Elvin Hicks, E-L-V-I-N H-I-C-K-S.
Speaker 1: And what is your mother's maiden name?
Speaker 2: Actually, Bates is my mother's maiden name.
Story_ID: 3123
Speaker 1: Your grandparents, you remember?
Speaker 2: My grandmother is Lilly Bonds and actually Bates was her maiden name.  And my grandfather I never had a chance to meet.  I just have, you know, stories.  And my mom [Vera Bates] was a little girl when he died.  So I know a little bit, but not as much as I'd like to.
Speaker 1: And your Dad's mother (unclear)?
Speaker 2: My--my father's parents I never met.  They, they died early.
Story_ID: 3124
Speaker 1: And what is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Black (laughter).
Speaker 1: And your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Maybe cotton candy is probably my favorite thing to eat, but I don't know if you'd consider that a food. And watermelon.  So you can see I like sweets.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where is your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Right now I would have to say Anguilla.  There's a place called Cap Juluca.  And that's, that's my favorite place.
Story_ID: 3125
Speaker 1: Let us take -- oh, let's a trip back to your grandparents for a moment, and you were kind of closer to your mother's --
Speaker 2: Exactly, right.  Um-hum.
Speaker 1: parents.  Tell me what story do you remember most about your grandparents?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was extremely religious and actually, she was a Missionary.  And I can just remember never wanting to go to Mississippi cause that was like the awful vacation.  You know, we'd have to go there every summer, but I would do my best not to go there because she lived in a, like, you know, out in the country.  And you had to go to an outhouse.  And she would drag us to church and she would pray all day and all night long.  And I would just think, you know, that's not really what I want to be.  But I can also remember her telling me that, something like, you're not the prettiest of my grandchildren, but you've got the greatest personality.  And that's what's gonna take you where you need to go.  And I was like, thanks a lot (laughter).  But, of course, now I know that, you know, where I am in life had to do with the prayers that my grandmother laid down.  But I, I didn't know that then.  And I guess the one story that sticks out most of all is how we would always send her things when we were teenagers, like send her, you know, five dollars for her birthday or handkerchiefs.  And whenever I would send her something, I would call back to find out how she liked what I sent.  And she would tell me that, oh, thank you for sending me the handkerchiefs, but I gave them away to someone down at the church or I gave them to the next door neighbor. And she had like a running habit of doing that.  And I told my mother, I said, I want to stop giving her things because she doesn't appreciate them.  She always gives them away when we give them to her.  And actually, that spirit has like taken over me.  My friends say that I give (unclear) away (laughter).  So that's my, that's, that's my grandmother, Lilly Bonds.
Story_ID: 3126
Speaker 1: Those summers in Mississippi.  Which ones stand out the most for you?  There's a sharp difference between urban and farming or --
Speaker 2: I, I mean, they, they all stood out because I didn't want to be there.  And I can still like smell the dirt and, and at that time, there was something about eating dirt that people did or something about picking up the red dirt and eating it.  And I can, I can almost like taste that.  And I could smell the pine cause we used to walk a lot, wherever we had to go, to the store.  It was a long walk.  And I can remember walking on the red mud and smelling the trees.  And that was probably the nicest thing about it.  And other than that, nothing excited me.  I didn't like the food because I wasn't a soul food eater.  I was a junk food eater.  I liked french fries and candy.  And she [maternal grandmother Lillie Bonds] would have greens and grits and smoked sausages.  And I hated feeding those pigs because they, they would stink.  And I hated going out there to feed chickens because they would cluck you.  So, I didn't like it at all (laughter).  And actually, when I became about, maybe like eight or nine [years old], I was able to weasel out of vacations.  I had a, I had a aunt who I was very close with, and she actually raised me.  I grew up in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] for a few years.  And that's how I got out of going to Mississippi.
Story_ID: 3127
Speaker 1: Do you remember much about your granddad?
Speaker 2: He was just real easygoing.  He was, and he was henpecked.  He did everything she [grandmother Lillie Bonds] said.  (Laughter)  I've never heard him raise his voice, ever.  He was just pretty much nondescript.  My grandmother was like the focal point, you know, part of the family.  They loved each other very much.  I mean she, after he passed, she passed like thirty days later and she wasn't sick or anything.  But I think she just grieved and missed him.  And, and she passed like right after that.
Speaker 1: How old was she when she passed?
Speaker 2: About seventy-four.
Story_ID: 3128
Speaker 1: And how many kids did she [maternal grandmother Lillie Bonds] have?
Speaker 2: Three daughters.  And actually, my grandfather was not the father of my mother [Vera Bates] and her aunts.  My grandmother, of course, lived during the times when they had situations where white men had black women that lived off on the farms.  And my natural grandfather was actually someone from Germany.  His name is Eugene Wesby (ph).  And he was the father to the three children that she had.  But it was something that she never liked to talk about.  It was almost as if she was like ashamed about it because she was so religious now.  So we have to get the information, you know, from, from other people to find out what was going on.  But he was very much a part of the life of my mother and her sisters.  I mean they remembered always being with him.  And he was killed on -- in a trucking accident.
Speaker 1: Did, did your mother have any stories about your natural grandfather?
Speaker 2: The only story I remember her telling us, how he would, like, put her on the back of the pick-up truck when he would drive to go get lumber.  And, and that's really the one story that I remember most of all.  My mom was probably about five when he passed, so that's the most vivid story that she had that, you know, his face -- she could still see his face.  And that he would always be around.
Story_ID: 3129
Speaker 1: What did kind of relationship did you have with your mother growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, my mother was the gang-leader mother [Vera Bates].  She didn't take any mess (laughter).  My mother was tough.  My mother was super tough.  She would curse and call us names to keep us in line.  Of course, now, it was a household with four girls [Barbara, Elaine, Cynthia, Elizabeth] and one boy [Michael].  And so she had to do a lot of that, and my mother was a single parent.  My dad [Elvin Hicks] didn't live in the house with us.  And, but she was -- I mean she was a great provider.  You know, growing up, I mean even in grammar school and elementary school, people always knew me for dressing in a kind -- certain kind of way.  My mother always kept all of us looking wonderful.  And, but she was hard.  I mean you would -- you didn't want to get out of line because you knew you had a whipping coming.  She was, she was a rough sister.  My mother was beautiful.  She was a very beautiful, beautiful woman.  But she wasn't very well educated.  And that was the one thing I always remembered about her is how it's great to be pretty, but it's nice to have an education too.  And so  she never worked.  You know, she was a housewife, but she had, she had wonderful common sense.  And she had like great visions, you know.  She could see things and she can see into your friends, things that we didn't see about our friends.  And she would tell us.  And, of course, we'd never listen, but they would always come to pass.  She would say that she was born with a veil over her face, and since she was born in the South, that meant something to her.  We would just laugh at her (laughter).
Speaker 1: That was quite an honor, actually, to be born with a veil over your face.
Speaker 2: That's what she says.
Speaker 1: Your mom, you say she never worked, but she was hard on the, rough and tough love --
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: -- not hard on you in a mean way.  But what do, what do you remember going through your mind when you saw all that your mother did on a day-to-day basis to keep her kids on the straight and narrow?
Speaker 2: I just always remembered, you know, -- I, I knew that I wanted to have a big family, you know, when I got married.  But I also knew that I wanted to work.  I knew that I wanted to have something of my own.  I didn't want to have to depend on a man to give it to me because my mother always depended on somebody else to help provide for us.  And I just knew that was just one thing that I would never do.  I would always want my own.  And, and that's probably like just one of the things that, that I remember.  Other things, life just went on and you don't really sit back when you're a teenagers and look at it and say, "Oh, I don't want to do this or that."  So I really can't, you know, remember those things.  But the one thing that I remember that I got out of it was, have your own.
Speaker 1: Did she ever have any time to nurture herself at any time?
Speaker 2: Then?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: You know, back then, women weren't into, you know, manicures and pedicures. I mean she'd get her hair done and, but -- and she always dressed. My mother was an incredible dresser because she was so beautiful. She was always in hair shows and, you know, that kind of thing. But she never like, you know, spent excessive money on herself. She was pretty, she she's more of a high maintenance person now than she was then. (Laughter)
Speaker 1: So you taught her how to nurture herself, obviously.
Speaker 2: Probably, yeah, because my mom had never had a pedicure as a grown woman. She was, "I don't want to spend that kind of money for somebody to come and do my feet." I'm like, "Ma, you'll love it." So, now, of course, she needs it. You know, she can't live without it.
Story_ID: 3130
Speaker 1: Give me the order and names and ages of your siblings?
Speaker 2: Okay, actually, I'm the oldest and then I have a sister, Elaine.  Elaine is forty-six.  We're like nine months apart because she was a premature baby.  And then my brother, Michael, who is forty-four.  He's the bad seed of the family.  And then there's my sister, Cynthia, who's about forty-three and Elizabeth, who's about forty.
Speaker 1: So it had to be a lot of fun growing up in the Bates' house.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: (Unclear) girls and (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Well, actually, it was fun because everyone has a sense of humor in my family.  Everyone has an incredible sense of humor.  I mean we could have taken our show on the road, but for me it wasn't fun because I was the oldest.  And not that I had to lay down rules.  I've always been into fashion and clothes.  And so, when I got older and I was able to like work, I would buy clothes with my money.  But I had sisters who were all bigger than me.  And they would sneak and wear my clothes.  And so that's the one thing I remember about growing up, is how I would catch them on the bus with something of mine on and want to fight on the bus or, you know, I'd come back and they'd have breast prints in my clothes.  And I knew they weren't mine. Or they'd have on cologne.  I could smell them in it.  Sometimes I have nightmares that I'm back home with my teenaged sisters, and, you know, they're sneaking and wearing my clothes.  But other than that, we were, we're very close.  We were very close then, and we're very close now.
Story_ID: 3131
Speaker 1: What kind of child were you growing up?
Speaker 2: See from me being the oldest and then leaving going to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], I was actually born with club feet.  And my mother's oldest sister noticed it when she came to visit cause I'm the oldest of the grandchildren.  And she said there was something wrong, you know, with my feet.  And my mother's like, well, I don't know.  And she's like, "Let me take her to the hospital cause we need to find out what it is." And so after they, you know, did the corrections with -- and they had to like break my, you know, break the legs.  And I had the cast and the braces.  Then my aunt decided, "I'll take her back to live with me in Pittsburgh."  So I left my mom [Vera Bates] probably at about -- I was less than a year old.  And I lived in Pittsburgh with my aunt.  And meanwhile, my mother had children every year.  But I lived in Pittsburgh with my aunt who had her own business.  We had a driver to pick us up and, you know, take me to the babysitter's.  And I mean it was like a wonderful life.  And then I would go to visit with them [in Chicago, Illinois] in the summers before I went back to living with my mom permanently.  But I never thought that I was better than my sisters or brothers, but I knew that I was different from them.  And, but growing up in Pittsburgh was good because it gave me, it gave me another side -- it gave me just another side of life.  Like my sisters only knew one side, but I knew two different sides.  But I never held that against them.  I mean we were all the same as far as I was concerned.  And then I came back to live in Chicago [Illinois] when I was about seven [years old].  It was actually when my mother said that, that she wanted me back home.  And I was rebellious when I came back because I had to sleep in a bedroom that all the girls were in and I had to share a bed.  And I never had to do that before.  I think even for the first few months I called my mother by her first name instead of calling her Ma, cause I didn't want to be there.  But, you know, I rapidly got right back into the swing of things.  And that was behind me.
Speaker 1: And you said you were how old when you came back?
Speaker 2: I was seven years old when I came.  I was in the second grade.  So I actually went to school -- my first couple of years were in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Story_ID: 3132
Speaker 1: And what elementary school?
Speaker 2: I went to Leif Ericson Elementary School [later Leif Ericson Scholastic Academy] on Central Park and Fifth Avenue [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: What do you remember about your elementary years?
Speaker 2: I remember telling a lie in the third grade that President [John F.] Kennedy was my uncle, and then he passed right after that.  And everybody was mourning me, like a (laughter).  And I remember a teacher named Ms. Bagley (ph) who I still, you know, remain close with.
Speaker 1: What did she teach?
Speaker 2: Actually, she was -- she taught a, our fourth grade class.  So, of course, she taught everything.  But she had a group that she -- of like four girls, there were four of us, and she would take us on weekend trips, you know, without the class knowing, you know.  We were like -- she didn't, she didn't have children, and she was never married.  But she was fond of us, and I remember going back to visit the school in later years, and she had become the principal there.  And then after I started designing and, you know, became, you know, Barbara Bates, the Fashion Designer, she was at a fashion show once.  And when I came out on stage, she said, she knew the name, but she had no idea.  And she came backstage and when I looked over at her, it was just like great cause I hadn't seen her in so many years.  And she had a book that she had saved that I had done in the fourth grade, 'What I Want to Be When I Grow Up.'  And it was made out of construction paper and it was a fashion designer.  And I had no remembrance of it at all.  But it was just great to have it.  It was unbelievable.  And we were on the -- and actually we were living one block from each other.  Actually, my studio waas at 1010 South Michigan and she lived at 1130 South Michigan [Chicago, Illinois].  And she had saved this thing for some, gosh, it had to have been like twenty years or more.  But she wouldn't give it to me.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Teacher knows what to save.  That's wonderful.  That is a wonderful story.  So how did that make you feel when you saw, saw that write --
Speaker 2: And then it, then it made me just reflect on that a lot of young people, you know, have an innate ability to do certain things, but they don't follow through on them because they don't have people encouraging them or, you know, they don't think that it's possible or that, that -- or that they can do it.  And that it's a good thing to recognize it early because that's something that may turn into what it is that you're gonna do later.  And it, it's become very true in my life and in my children [Eugene, Kristopher].  It's, as a matter of fact, I know it's, it's just living proof.  Things that you're good at or great with and you stick with it, they become part of you.
Story_ID: 3133
Speaker 1: So you were like really on a path right from birth, I mean being around your mother [Vera Bates] --
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: -- who liked to dress and look good (unclear) --
Speaker 2: All, all, I just always loved to --
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) You had a natural interest and then --
Speaker 2: I would -- the thing that I wanted most were Barbie dolls, and when I lived in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], I had cousins, twin cousins, and they had the dream house and the car and all the clothes. And when I would go to spend weekends with them, that's what I would do just all day, just play with the Barbie dolls. And we would go to stores, to like go to a drugstore or something, I'd go to the section where they had the Barbie doll clothes hanging, and the clothes intrigued me more than the dolls. And then I would also cut pictures of Montgomery Wards and Sears [department stores] magazines, just cut clothes out and say I'm gonna get this one day.  I'm gonna get this.  I remember doing all of that.  I remember always being fascinated by clothing, and even with my aunt, living with her, she had so many purses, and I would like match up her purses with her shoes and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: And did you do that playhouse thing and dress up everybody else around (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, I never did a lot of that.  I, I never did.
Story_ID: 3134
Speaker 1: So is there anything else about your elementary school years that sticks out for you?
Speaker 2: The science fairs.  I won the science fair every year from sixth grade through eighth grade.  I dissected animals.  And (laughter), and so, that was strange because I was like such a -- I was so artistic on one end, but I had this other weird thing going on on the other end with the animals.  And actually, a teacher had gotten me into that and because I just got so much notoriety from it the first year, I thought, "Every year I can win a science fair if I do something unusual like this."  So, but that's something that I certainly remember about elementary school.
Story_ID: 3135
Speaker 1: Did you, what was life like in your aunt's household [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] for those first seven years?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know, a certain time that you get up.  You eat breakfast every morning, and because I was a very bad eater, at dinnertime, I'd be like just sitting there, like stuffing food in my pocket if she walked away 'cause I didn't want to eat it.  But she was very strict about timing.  You know, we have breakfast at this time, we have lunch.  Those were like great years.  I mean when my uncle would get up to go to work in the morning, when I would go into his room -- because they had separate rooms -- I would go into his room and he would leave money on the dresser for me.  So I always would just go in there and see what he had left for me today.  When he would take his vacations to go play golf, when he had came back from the airport, I knew I had something coming.  He would always bring both of us back some sort of a gift.
Speaker 1: What kind of work did he do?
Speaker 2: Actually, they had a bar.  I remember going to the bar, and always we would have big canisters, big cans of potato chips and pretzels.  And that's my favorite, that's one of my favorites.  And I would love potato chip dip, and, and I just remember like, you know, always having whatever it was that I wanted.  I mean I just had, I just had whatever it is that you could want. But I wasn't a spoiled child because I still went home and I saw a difference there.  So I never, I was never like, you know, too good for anything.  I always knew how it could always turn different for you.
Speaker 1: So you were just like your grandmother said --
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  You're a good child.
Speaker 2: What were the quiet moments like with your aunt, just when it's you and her?
Speaker 1: I don't, I can't really remember them.  I know that, I know, I could just think about, I know that she like loved me as if I was her own.  And we're still very close right now.  I don't, I don't really remember like quiet times.  You know, if she would a -- you know, I can, I can see her combing my hair, but I don't really remember anything that sticks out.  I'd have to like think really hard on that.
Speaker 2: And the, the aunt you stayed with, she was the second oldest.
Speaker 1: She was the oldest.  She was like the oldest.
Speaker 2: Oh, she was oldest.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Okay, and your Mom was --
Speaker 1: My mother [Vera Bates] was the baby.
Speaker 2: And you were the oldest.
Speaker 1: Um hmm.
Speaker 2: So you [unclear] not only having had such a varied experience so early (unclear).  I'm sure that helped shape you.
Speaker 1: It did.  It truly did.
Story_ID: 3136
Speaker 1: Now, we're in middle school.  You're back in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: What is life like now?
Speaker 2: Okay, now I go over to Marshall Upper Grade Center [later John Marshall Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And I was always a good student.  I mean I was on every honor roll, and I excelled at everything I did.  My sisters [Cynthia and Elizabeth] and brothers [Michael] that came behind me, they were the ones who got, "You're Barbara's brother and you mean you can't do" -- and they were very rebellious about that.  But school was very easy for me.
Speaker 1: Where is Marshall?
Speaker 2: Marshall is on Kedzie and Adams.  So I went there for seventh and eighth grade.  It was very uneventful.  Seventh and eighth grade was no big deal.  My friends were, you know, the friends that I had that were close, they were starting to like, you know, find themselves, like, you know, smoking cigarettes, you know.  If they had easy parents, they got to stay out late, but my mother [Vera Bates] didn't go for any of that.  And none of that ever, none of that ever excited me because I had like cousins that had drug problems, and I saw what they did to people.  So I was never enticed by drugs or alcohol.  That just, that didn't excite -- that was just something I liked to stay away from.  But I did like to stay out late to go to parties and dance.  And that's what I would like to do.  So seventh and eighth grade and ninth grade was just, it was like, not a big, not a big deal.
Story_ID: 3137
Speaker 1: What were the popular dances out when you were out?
Speaker 2: Gosh, I remember that I used to like bop really well.  Yeah, and, they call it stepping now.  But I was really good at that.  And I don't know, the easier dances, I'm not really sure.  I could probably do them better than say the names.  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 3138
Speaker 1: Did you have any special teachers in, in middle years?
Speaker 2: No, but actually there was a, a history teacher that I had, Mr. Kyle, and I got a phone call from him maybe five years ago.  He said, "I've been following you for the past fifteen years.  I know what you've been doing, and I've got some students over here.  I'd like to come and visit you."  I couldn't believe it.  And he sent some students down.  And I, I haven't had a chance to see him, but he remembered me which, you know, how do you remember one student through all of that.  But he did remember me, and I remembered him because he was a different sort of a teacher.
Speaker 1: What class did he teach?
Speaker 2: He taught a history -- a social studies class, actually, right.  I remember having to take his class.  That's how I came up with, I think when you had to get scores for, oh, like a [United States] Constitution test, yeah.  He was the teacher for that.
Story_ID: 3139
Speaker 1: Did you keep up with your interest in science?
Speaker 2: In seventh and eighth grade, yes.  I won both of those.  I won the City Science Fair [Chicago Student Science Fair] in eighth grade.  I won Regionals at the other ones, but I actually won the City Science Fair in eighth grade because dissected a cat that time.  (Laughter)  I kept getting bigger and bigger with the ani -- I started with a, with a mouse, then a frog, and then the cat.
Speaker 1: And so it's so funny that you didn't -- do you use any of your science side?
Speaker 2: And see actually, my mom [Vera Bates] thought, she was, you know, we -- she thought that I was going to become a doctor.  But I really didn't like school.  I, you know, I wanted to hurry up and get out of school.  I wanted to be grown.  I just wanted to hurry up and get this over with.  So.
Speaker 1: So, it was just your natural, --
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it was natural.
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) ability.
Speaker 2: I didn't know where it came from because at that point, I still -- I had not met my natural father [Elvin Hicks].  So I don't really know where it came from.  My mother, she wasn't a dummy, but to me she was country.  She was so southern.  You know, and she wasn't the kind of mother that helped you with your homework or anything cause like she didn't know what we were doing.  So I always had this interest in meeting who my dad was to see where other things came from.
Story_ID: 3140
Speaker 1: When did you meet him?
Speaker 2: Actually, I met my father [Elvin Hicks] when I was twenty-one years old, cause I always knew of him or -- and my mother [Vera Bates] would tell me things like, you know, like say, "Oh, you remind me of Billy Hicks."  Oh, so I always knew a name, but I didn't anything else about him.  I knew that he played the piano and I knew that he used to play with Ahmad Jamal.  And -- so that was like something that I held onto all through high, you know, all through high school.  And even actually, when I was in my senior year, we tried to find him.  My sisters [Elaine, Cynthia, Elizabeth] helped, you know, tried to help me to find, cause I'm the only one that has a different father.  Everybody else has the same dad.  And they tried to help me with it, but I was unsuccessful at it.  And then when I was twenty-one years old, I moved to Detroit [Michigan].  And a friend of mine called me out the clear blue, and said, why don't you come to Chicago [Illinois] this weekend?  Ahmad Jamal is in town.  And he says, "I remember you told me story about Ahmad Jamal that had to do with your dad.  Maybe you could  approach him."  I said, "That'll be great."  So I drove back to Chicago, and I missed the engagement for whatever reason.  I was doing something.  I didn't connect with my friend, but I knew where he was staying because there was a club at that hotel.  It was a hotel over on Michigan Avenue [Chicago, Illinois].  And, and I called the hotel and I asked for his room, and they gave it to me.  I was like, "Whoa, now what do I say?"  And when he came to the phone, I just said, you know, I said who I was.  And I said, "And I have a very strange request for you."  I said, "This is going to sound strange, but don't hang up the phone on me."  I said, you know, my, my father -- "Do you know a man by the name of Billy Hicks?"  And he says, "No, I'm sorry, but I don't."  And I said, oh, because -- I said what about -- and I said, I, I asked him if he knew a man named William Hicks because I figured that my Mom didn't know that my father's name was William and she called him Billy.  He says, "I don't know a William Hicks."  I said, "What about a Billy Hicks?"  He says, "Yeah, I just talked to him."  I was like, "Oh, my God."  And I said, well he does --  "I know you're not going to know anything about me."  I said, "I'm his daughter, and I've never met him before.  I've always known about him, and I just wanted to know if you would be able to reach him so that, you know, I could talk to him, and just -- I don't want anything from him, but just so I can know who he is and he can know who I am."  And he goes like, "Of course, I can.  It's not a problem.  Give me the number where you are and I'll call you back."  And I waited for like -- no, actually, then I said, well -- I was like so nervous, I was crying by that time.  I said, "Can my mother talk to you?"  And so my mother got on the phone, and she told Ahmad how she had met him, you know, some twenty-something years ago at a place called the Persian Room or something like that.  And, and so he got me back on the phone.  He says, "I'm going to contact him, and I'll call you back."  And so I waited for like two days and he never called me back.  So I figured he probably thought it was some ridiculous phone call.  And so I wrote a letter to take to the hotel.  And I called, and he was still there 'cause I had to go back to Detroit to go to work.  And so I wrote this letter, and I just said that I just wanted to know who he was, and I didn't want anything.  And I'm sure he had a family.  I didn't want to interrupt anything like that.  And there were two things in my life that I always wanted to do, learn how to drive and meet my father.  And I had just learned how to drive.  And so I took the letter down to the hotel -- (crying) and the receptionist at the desk said -- she said -- I said, I want to leave this letter for Ahmad Jamal -- I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: I'll get a tissue.
Speaker 2: I'm okay.  My dad just passed.
Speaker 1: He did.  When did he pass?
Speaker 2: A year ago today.
Speaker 1: And you were able to keep up a, a relationship with him, I take it.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Story_ID: 3141
Speaker 1: So, and like two days had passed and [musician] Ahmad [Jamal] had not called me back, and I had to go back to work in Detroit [Michigan].  So I just wrote the letter, and I took the letter down to the hotel receptionist.  And I said, "I'd like to leave this for Ahmad Jamal."  And she says, "Oh, you can give it to him yourself."  And I said, "Why, what do you mean?"  And she says, ""Well, he's in his room."  I said, "Oh, I don't know him.  I don't know him personally.  I just wanted to leave this for him."  She says, "I'm sure it'd be okay."  It was like she was insistent that I would see him which, receptionists, you know,-- a person at a hotel doesn't do that.  You know, they take your letter and they boot you out.  And so she called up to his room.  She says, "He's in the room."  She says, "Hold on, I have a Ms. Bates here."  And I got on the phone.  And I said, "I'm the young lady who called."  He says, "I remember."  He says, "I'm so sorry, I forgot to call him.  I never got a chance."  He, he says, "Come upstairs to my room.  I'm on the Penthouse Suite and there's a knocker with a -- inscription of a lion head on the front."  I remember him saying all that.  And I said, "Come now?"  And he says, "Yeah, now, just come upstairs."  I had a friend that was with me.  I was like, "He wants me to come up to his room."  And so I went upstairs to his room.  And, of course, in my mind, I was thinking, "My mother was probably a floozy and had sex with all kind of guys and doesn't have a clue who my father is.  And I'm making a fool out of myself.  And it may not really have been him, may, you know, I don't even, you know, -- why, what am I doing here?"  And so when I got upstairs, and I knocked on the knocker, he came to the door and he opened it up.  And he looked at me and he said, -- and I smiled, and I said, "Hi, I'm Barbara Bates."  And he says, "Yep, you're his [father, Elvin Hicks] daughter."  I said, "Really?"  He said, "Come in."  And, and he says, "This is unbelievable." He said, "So you haven't seen him in a long time?"  I said, "I've never seen him."  I said, "He doesn't even know that I exist."  I said, so.  He's like, "Well, I know that cause I did just call him.  And he doesn't know you or your mother."  I said, "It's been so many years."  I said, "He wouldn't." He said, "But you're his daughter.  I can tell you that." And he says, "I'm going to call him right now."  And so he got on the phone and he called him up.  And he says, "You know, Bill, I've got this young lady sitting here, Barbara Bates."  And he said, "You and I have been friends for twenty-five years.  I was the best man in your wedding.  You know how far back our relationship goes."  He said, "We've traveled to Egypt and Africa and we've seen a lot of people and met a lot of people.  But I'm sitting here with your daughter."  He said, "She has your teeth and your smile."  And so he said, "I want you to talk to her now."  Well, by that time, I think I was like hysterical cause what was I gonna say?  And, and I just got on the phone, and he was so, you know, very soft spoken.  And he says, "Well, I'm going to come down there where you are."  And he says, "Can you tell me your mother's name?"  And I told him my mother, and I said, "You used, you used to work on the train."  I told him everything about his self.  I said, "You have other children.  You had a son and a daughter at the time my mother met you.  And you were divorcing your wife."  And he said, "Yeah, I did."  And I told him about how old  they would be.  And he says, "You're right."  And he, and he said, "I did work on the train."  I said, "My Mom met you coming -- she was coming back from Seattle, Washington."  And then I guess it was slowly coming to him.  So he says, "I'm gonna come down there, but do me a favor.  I'd like for you to have your mother there also."  And he says, "I'll be there shortly."  So, you know, Ahmad said he had to go someplace and he couldn't stay there, but he said I was welcome to stay in the hotel until my dad got there.  And he hoped everything worked out.  And he left.
Story_ID: 3142
Speaker 1: And it took a long time for him [father, Elvin Hicks] to show up, but he finally came.  And when he walked through the door, he was everything, you know, that I expected him to be.  I expected to see myself walk through the door, and that's what happened.  And he walked right over to the sofa where I was and I stood up.  And we hugged and embraced.  And we went in the bathroom to talk 'cause my mother [Vera Bates] was sitting there, but he didn't really acknowledge anything about her.  He just took me like privately away 'cause I had another person there.  And, you know, he just took my hands, and he looked at my fingers, like inspecting almost like I was a newborn baby.  And he says, "You know, I, I really don't remember your mom, and, you know, and, but we're going to work this out."  And we developed a relationship from there.  I was able to meet, you know, my other brothers and sisters and his new wife.  It took a little time to get in on that one, but that worked out.  I flew out to California to meet, you know, to meet everybody.  I mean everybody -- I met everybody.  I wasn't like hidden away.  It took time to break the story and I was like the missing link.  Everybody said, Have you met her yet? do you know what she's" -- and since I lived in Detroit [Michigan], he had a sister that lived in Ann Arbor [Michigan].  And so I, I met everybody.  We just, and we were close until, you know, the day that he passed.  And that's why I know that every -- where everything came from because my father was very well educated.  He got his master's [degree] when he was in, like his fifties.  He was a school teacher at Schoop Elementary  School [Chicago, Illinois], and there's another part to this story you're not gonna believe.  But he was a teacher there.  And, and he was just, he was very bright and he was just a very bright person.  He had MS [multiple sclerosis] and it slowly just deteriorated, but by -- but when he passed he had no movement, but he always had his right mind, I mean from the time that he closed his eyes, he knew who he was.  He never complained, and he was the type if you say, "I love you," he'd say, "I love you more."  We had a closer relationship verbally than he and my mother had cause I had never said those words to my mother.  But I would say them to my father all the time.
Speaker 2: Did he ever remember your mother?
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.  When he went out and looked at her, then it all came right back.  He remembered everything about her. But he was a very handsome man.  I'm sure he had seen many women in his day. (laughter) But yeah, he remembered her.
Speaker 2: How old was your father when he died?
Speaker 1: My dad was seventy-six when he passed.  He passed a year ago [2001].
Speaker 2: And how old was he when you met up with him?
Speaker 1: He was about fifty-five. It would have been like twenty-five years ago.  He was in his fifties, early fifties.
Speaker 2: It was (unclear) wonderful (unclear).
Speaker 1: And he actually knew at that time he had MS [multiple sclerosis], but he was like swimming in the morning.  He was, you know, he would go to the gym and all that.  He was a small-framed man, like, he was small.  But he would, you know, he knew that it would be affecting him, you know, more and more.  So.
Speaker 2: So as your grandmother [Lillie Bonds] would say, that was an answered prayer.
Speaker 1: Right, exactly.
Story_ID: 3143
Speaker 1: So you -- what happened immediately in your life, kind of after you hooked into your father [Elvin Hicks], what kind of things were happening personally with you?  I'm sure you were feeling very good and what else?
Speaker 2: Actually, I was still living in Detroit [Michigan] at that time, and I hated Detroit.  It was so slow compared to Chicago [Illinois], but it was a nice get-away.  And --
Speaker 1: Why did you move there?
Speaker 2: Just to get away from -- it was just so much going on in Chicago.  I just seemed to be caught up, and I wasn't doing what I know I -- it was more for me to do, but I couldn't get to it for whatever reason.  You know, by that time, I had already had a child that I was raising.  And I just couldn't seem to get a handle on what it was that I really wanted to do.  So I followed a boyfriend to Detroit.  That's actually how I got there.  And then I landed, you know, an incredible job taking him to work one day.  And I went past personnel and they asked who I was, and that's how I got a job working for General Motors.  And I mean after, I mean after that, it was just like trips back and forth to Chicago constantly then cause I wanted to know about him, and they wanted to know about me.  That kind of thing went on for -- actually, it still goes on.  You know, there's always somebody new that's popping up that didn't know me or whatever and so that, that still goes on.  But it gave me more of an insight about me.  I mean I knew why I loved music so much and growing up I would hear me, myself playing the piano although I never took lessons.  But my Dad was a piano player and I just thought that was so strange.  And, and I knew that he, you know, that, you know, school work came easy for him like it did for me, so I knew that that came from him.  And my father had this outrageous laugh and, you know, the radio stations have used my laugh a few times for voiceovers or whatever.  So I knew the laugh came from there.  And I, I mean I just saw that, you know, that was me.  And even the other children that he had, you know, they would look and say, "Gosh, you look just like Daddy," and it was so easy for them to accept me.
Speaker 1: That's like people used to say, "He spit you out."
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.  (laughter).  And, by, by that time, I was trying to get back to Chicago.  I wanted to come back, I wanted to come back home, you know.
Story_ID: 3144
Speaker 1: Okay, take me back to your high school years.  You, you, you're this excellent student, what happened?
Speaker 2: I was, I was actually at Marshall High School, and I was in my sophomore year.  And in October, I found out that I was pregnant.  I was actually terrified to go home and tell my mother, but the day that I was coming home to -- I don't really think I was going home to tell her.  I was just going home to go sit in the room and do more and more crying.  She told me.  She was like, you finally done it, you're pregnant.  And she'd always say, if anybody brings a baby in this house, you're out of here.  I'm not raising another child, blah, blah, blah.  But my mother, my mother was the best mother through the pregnancy.  I mean it, it killed her, you know, she, she cried.  She fainted.  She was really good for fainting cause I had a brother who was a bad seed so she had fainted so many times on him.  But this one made her faint too.  But, you know, she, she moved my brother out of his room and gave me my own room.  And I stayed in school.  I left my high school and went to an alternative school, called Family Living Center.  And that enabled me to stay in school without missing credits.  And I was able to go back to my high school.  I had my son that June, and I was a Junior.  And when I went back to my high school in September, they said, you've got too many credits.  You can actually graduate this year.  So it was like a blessing.  It was unbelievable.  I was able to graduate from high school in three years with Honors after I had had a baby.  So I was 16 when I graduated from high school and that was just like what I wanted.  I was like, uh, I wanted to get away from high school cause I never did any of the stuff.  I never went to games and I just wanted to be out of high school.  I wanted to be some place working and my own money and trying to figure out what it was I wanted to do.  My mother was there when my son was born, and she raised him.  Well, he -- she raised when he was like about 7, he moved to Detroit with me for a couple of years, but she was really like the backbone for that, you know.  And -- so that, that was kind of -- high school was just very quick for me.  Actually, in high school, I worked a, a work-study job.  So I would go to work in the morning at Sears for 4 hours and then go to high school.  And I got credits for that.  So that's how I ended up getting all these credits, you know, and plus I had like summer school credits I took when I was pregnant.  I had extra classes.  So I had taken everything.  There was nothing left for me to take.  They were like, you can graduate.  So I had a boss at Sears, Mr. Davis, who, you know, who encouraged me and said, you know, you'll be graduating from high school.  You can always stay here with us at Sears and in 10 years you'll be making $5.00 an hour or something ridiculous.  I was like, okay, thank you.  And actually, Mr. Davis, later on in life became the grandfather of my second child.  (Laughter)  That's strange.
Story_ID: 3145
Speaker 1: So after high school, what I did was, I went to -- I didn't have like any, like skills so I went to a secretarial school and I learned how to type.  And then I left Sears [department store], and I got a job, it was like an administrative assistant.  And I did like clerical work for, like typing, I was like a secretary.  I did that kind of stuff for a while.  But I always hated that.  I knew there was something else for me to do.  I knew it was the fashion thing.  You know, I was supposed to be doing something in fashion.  Like even in my senior year, Herb Kent [radio personality] would come to our school [Marshall High School, Chicago, Illinois] every year, and they had something called the Sharpy Dance, and I was the person who won the best dressed person at the high school.  But I knew I wanted to do something in fashion, but there weren't black people doing that.  And my mother said, "Because you've got a little common sense and you're bright, you know, do something other than this fashion thing.  I don't see that going anywhere."  So when I gradated from high school, I was so sick of school, even though I hadn't been there long.  I didn't want to go to college.  I felt, "I have creative energy and college isn't for me."  But I knew that it would be easy for me, so I still -- I went to night school at Loop Junior College which is now Harold Washington [College, Chicago, Illinois].  And I worked during the day.  It was important for me to have money, so I loved having a full-time job.  I wanted to be a full-time employee, not a full-time student.  And my jobs would always pay for all the classes that I took.  And that's, that's kind of that.
Story_ID: 3146
Speaker 1: So when you came back [to Chicago, Illinois] from Detroit [Michigan], you must have been kind of in a good place.  You had met your dad [Elvin Hicks].  You had had an experience of, I imagine making considerably more money at GM [General Motors Corporation] that your other jobs.
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) Right. Right. I knew how to drive.  I had my own car.  (Laughter)
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) And you had a handle on the other thing.  How were you feeling and then were you also -- is that when you were turning your attention more to your fashions?
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.  That's exactly when I did.  My first fashion show was actually in Detroit, but when I came home, people would notice the clothes I was wearing.  They'd ask me where I got them from.  And I had a husband and wife couple who were sewing for me.  So they would -- I would design it and buy the fabric, and they would bring it to life.  And so people would always ask me where I got what I was wearing.  And I would say, "I made it."  And that's where the ti -- title 'Fashion Designer' came from because I didn't know how to sew.  I still don't know how to sew.  But I know how to take measurements.  And I know about fabric and I knew what fabric could do.  I just had, it was easy for me.  I knew what it could do.  And --
Speaker 1: And you saw yourself, all of that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You, you never took any fashion courses?
Speaker 2: Never.
Speaker 1: Okay, on automatic pilot as far as execution.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I never -- and then when would go to work, you know, girls would ask me, "Where'd you get that from?"  And I'd say, "I designed it."  They'd say, "Could you make one for me?"  And I'd say, "Yeah."  So on the fifteenth and the thirty-first [of the month], which were the big paydays, I would meet them in the bathroom, take their measurements and then, you know, bring their clothes back to them.  And they'd give me half the money, and then I'd bring them back the other half later.  So I was, I was working for major companies, you know, doing secretarial work, which I hated, but on the side I was making money selling clothes.
Speaker 1: How many years did you do that before you --
Speaker 2: Probably about, probably like five years I did that.  And then one day I just said, this isn't me.  I'm not getting any younger.  And at that time, I was thirty-one, and I was miserable working for other people at those big companies.  I said, "I'm gonna start my own business."  And I didn't have a business plan.  I didn't have a, I didn't have a tailor.  But I said, you've got to do it.  Then my mother's [Vera Bates] tune had changed.  It wasn't, "There aren't black people doing this." Then she was like, "Whatever you're going to do, you need to do it now because you're not getting any younger and life doesn't wait for you."  And so I did it.  I quit my job.  I just quit my job.  I had a friend, you know, who believed in what I was doing.  He said he would go into business with me and he would put up the money.  And we'd be fifty-fifty partners.  And so I didn't even know what kind of sewing machines to buy.  There was another designer in the city named Reginald Thomas.  And I went to him, and he befriended me and took me around.  And then I put an ad in the newspaper for tailors.  And after like the first three months of, you know, a little bit of business, the guy I went into business with said he wanted the money back that he had given me to put up, that he didn't want to do this.  The money was too slow.  And that was great because about, in less than a year later, I had [professional basketball player] Michael Jordan as a client.  (Laughter)  And then he came back, I was like, "No.".  So I paid him his money back and got rid of him and it was all my company then.
Story_ID: 3147
Speaker 1: So, so how did you get over with celebrities?  What, what launched you in that --
Speaker 2: Once again, just, you know, I was already on, on a path that I didn't know about.  And it was like the Lord was using me.  He was like I'm going to give you all this, but later on I'm a come back, and I'm a need something from you.  And the celebrities all just, I mean I never even did advertising.  I just didn't advertise.  I didn't have those kind of dollars.  My sister would hang out at the basketball games and that's how I met Michael Jordan through her.  She would say, I have a sister that does so and so.  So he knew my name from her always standing outside trying to get autographs and talking about her sister who does leather.  And she came up, she said, well, I met Michael Jordan.  He wants you to make him a pair of gloves.  I'm like, I have tailors working here.  I'm not going to make him a pair of gloves.  I'm, I'm not going to do that.  And, and I actually, and I ended up meeting him maybe months later at a party with Juanita.  They were just dating then.  And when they came into the room, she walked over and introduced him to me because she had seen my card on his dresser.  And I guess she wanted to know, have you met her?  And he goes like, no, but I want to.  I hear she can do leather clothes for me.  And I'm -- that's how I met him, at this party and, and the rest is like history.  You know, I started doing stuff for him.  I got good publicity from Chicago [Illinois] because of Michael Jordan.  And, and I think that publicity that I got, it was never so much about the fabulous clothes I did.  It was about the fact that I was doing stuff for Michael and then the story unfolded on how I was the teen mom.  I mean that's when other things really start evolving.  You know, my fashion was the focal thing that got me in there, but there was something else that I had to do with it.  And people -- Michael just started bringing me people.  I mean I was doing like, everybody from NBA [National Basketball Association], Black guy, I mean I was just doing like so many people.  It was unbelievable.  And then I started meeting people in the Gospel, you know, world.  And I started doing things, you know, for, you know, a lot of Gospel people.  And then rap musician -- just, it just started coming.  You know, they were more excited about seeing me than I was about seeing them.  But it was all through word of mouth.  And then I remembered what my grandmother said.  You know, so it was like, people are going to buy you first.  And that's what people were doing.  They were buying me first and my personality.  What I was doing wasn't that unusual.  A pair of pants is a pair of pants.  But I would win them over with, you know, I was, -- one time I would say is that I'm just gut bucket.  People come and they look for Barbara Bates, but they don't find that.  You know, when they get there, they hear this loud laugh, and I'm very easy and that's not what they were expecting.  I don't know, just kind of regular.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's really wonderful.
Story_ID: 3148
Speaker 1: So in this period of intense growth, what kind of things were going on inside of you personally?
Speaker 2: I was still, I was, actually, like my -- the, the first year of my business -- well, actually, you know, the first year of my business, right before I started the business I had a child.  I had another son [Kristopher].  And, and so I, I wasn't spending as much time, and I felt that, you know, I'm doing the same thing I did with the first one.  My mother [Vera Bates] raised the first one, and now I'm getting off the hook again.  I don't have to raise this one cause he was the first grandchild.  And, and actually, his dad was a student of my father's [Elvin Hicks] in elementary school.  He saw a picture of my dad on the dresser, and he's like, "I know, that's Mr. Hicks."  I'm like, "That's my father."  And he was like, "He was my teacher in elementary school."  And then when I went to his house to meet his parents, I'm like, I know your father [Mr. Davis].  He worked with me at Sears [department store].  He was my supervisor."  It's like, yeah, so that was like so weird (laughter), that twenty-something years later, all that would come, like right back together.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Talking about a marked path.
Speaker 2: Exactly. So, so I had this young child, but I had a -- his father was in my life.  And even though we didn't marry or anything he's, he's always, you know, been around.  So he was help, he was a great help.  And he helped raise him, but I still felt like my career is really important, and my son'll be around.  So I chose the career first, and I thought boys are easy to take care of so as long as I'm around.  I never abandoned him or anything.  He was always with me.  But I felt I could work all night, cause I did.  I had to work all day and all night to keep that business going.  And, and so I was, I was just feeling like, you know, I could be a better mother. And then I had a teenaged son [Eugene], you know.  My oldest son -- my children are twelve years apart so my other son was a teenager by this time.  But he was a good kid, never had any trouble out of him, never had to go to jail for him, you know, none of that kind of stuff.  But there were still other things going on in the street, and I just felt I really couldn't be a real mother because I was too young to know what he was up against, and my mother still had to take that roll.  You know, but I still wanted the respect as a mother.  So I was like really just fighting with the thing like I wish I could be, you know, a better advisor and talk to my children better.  But I didn't really know how to do that cause my mother didn't do it with me so I've always been, you know, lost for words, you know, when, when it comes to like trying to send them down the, you know, the right road, things to say.  I, I'd always ask somebody else to say it for me cause I didn't know what to say.  I was fighting with that.  And then I was always terrible with money.  I, I'd have money come through my hands, but I've never been great with that.  I've never -- I've always just like spend -- you know, live every day like it's your last cause it might be (laughter).  I've never been like great with, you know, planning with money, that kind of thing.  And I was always just looking for that, you know, 'knight in shining armor.'  I still -- you know, I'm, I'm one of those hopeless romantics.  I was just always thinking, you know, you know, "I'm so honest and I'm such a good person.  Where is that, you know, how come the right person isn't around?" You know, to -- I would always be worried about, you know, those kind of things, but, you know.  But I still, I didn't have -- I still didn't have the Lord in my life then.  I wasn't going to church.  And, but in the back of my mind, I, and I always heard, "You'll be in church later."  And I only came up with that because I, I notice when people get older, they have a tendency to gravitate towards church.  So I thought, you know, "I'll get to it later."  You know, "I'll get to it later. It, it's coming soon, but not right now.  I'm having too much fun. I don't even know what I have to give up."  So I was fighting a little bit with that.  And, and just trying to keep that business afloat.  It was diff, it was very difficult.
Story_ID: 3149
Speaker 1: When the business challenges, because it -- there are certain challenges that just naturally grow out of any business --
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: -- but certainly, particular challenges with fast growth, being, just being in the channel of the growth.  And then if you don't have that business foundation --
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) Right, exactly. Right.
Speaker 1: How did you meet those challenges?
Speaker 2: I had a person who act -- was actually my babysitter growing up, but she was also my cousin [Diane].  And she came in and saw how it was driving me crazy.  I couldn't even sleep at night.  And I was just like losing sleep, you know.  I could hear customers saying, "Is my suit ready?  Is my suit ready?"  I'd take more orders than I could, you know, fill properly and timing was always off. I always had business.  I was never at a loss for business but managing it properly was difficult.  And she came in, and she sort of like took over.  She was the warden.  And everybody hated her at first because they were used to easy me that they could trample over.  And then she came in and like, "You don't get to see Barbara anymore.  You get to see me now."  And, but after a while people began to -- they respected her and respect, respected what she did.  And she helped me out a lot.  She helped me out a lot with that.
Speaker 1: Is she still working with you?
Speaker 2: Actually, she passed two years ago.  Worked up until the day we took her to the hospital from the shop.  She had cancer and she never told anyone.  And the day we took her to the hospital, she never came out of the hospital.  It was unbelievable.  If I have a cold, I'm going to tell you.  So that was like super shock.  That's what sent me to church because after she passed, and it was just -- I had never seen anyone die from cancer.  I had always heard cancer, cancer, cancer, but I had never seen it.  And after I saw what it did, and how fast it did it, and I knew that she wasn't in church either.  I thought, "If something should happen to me today or tomorrow, and it easily could since this is what happened, I wouldn't even have a pastor to stand over me."  And so a friend of mine, you know, I was telling her about it.  She says, "Come go to church with me."  And she picked me up, and she, she drove me to her church.  And I told her, I said, "I've been here before."  I said, "I came here about ten years ago."  I said, actually, "I got baptized here.  But when they took me in the receiving room, I didn't understand all that, and I never came back."
Speaker 1: Which church was it?
Speaker 2: [Bishop] Dr. Horace Smith on 38th and Indiana, Apostolic Faith [Church, Chicago, Illinois].  So it's so ironic that ten years later, she would drive me to the doorsteps of the very church that I had got baptized in.  I said, "There was a guy named Horace Smith."  She said, "He's in here right now."  I said, "He's still" -- 'cause I thought pastors moved around like people move around their jobs.  And, you know, that was like unbelievable.  I mean she had been going to that church for I don't know how many years.  And I got accepted in there, sitting next to the first lady [Susan Davenport Smith].  I mean, they -- I have, I have a very close relationship with my pastor and his wife.  And that was like a blessing.  When the door opened up, my girlfriend -- after I went there, I really enjoyed church.  And then I went back the next week and she wasn't there.  And so I went closer to the front, I wanted to be closer to hear what was going on.  And I saw Pam Morris.  And she was sitting on the row where the Pastor's wife sat.  And they hadn't come out yet.  And she asked me to join her, you know, on the row.  And then that's how I met Susan Smith and Dr. Smith personally.  And they, I mean they like entered into my life like, very, you know, right away.  And I just kind of like, understood what it's all about now.  And then I started putting it all together.  Now, I know why I've been able -- know why I have to touch these young people's lives.  It's like, "I saved you, but not for you.  I saved you so you could save others."  And that's kind of been my mission.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 3150
Speaker 1: So the two, so then the two years since --
Speaker 2: Diane [cousin and business manager] was her name.
Speaker 1: -- since Diane was with you, you've been able to bridge that gap?
Speaker 2: Actually, I just hired a business manager about four months ago.  She and I go back to third grade.  We went all the way through school together, got pregnant at the same time.  And we've always remained in contact throughout the years.  And she's not one of my best friends.  We don't talk back and forth, and we don't even see eye to eye, but she's good for me.  I don't need a 'yes person around me,'  I need someone who knows how to tell me, 'no,' and knows how to handle things.  And she has made it easy for me to sleep at night because she's on top of things.  And I want the business to go in another direction.  I don't want to work as hard.  I don't have the same stamina any more.  I don't want to chase after basketball players.  I don't have that in me any more.  I want, you know, I have grandchildren now.  And I missed my sons [Eugene and Kristopher] growing up, but I'm not going to miss them growing up.  I'm not going to miss that.
Speaker 1: And how many and what ages?
Speaker 2: I have two grandchildren, Justin and Jessica.  Justin is eight and Jessica is six.
Speaker 1: And this (unclear)
Speaker 2: It is, 'cause you can send them home.
Speaker 1: (unclear) Change that takes place (unclear). And everything is very different.
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) Oh, gosh. When my son first told me that his girlfriend was pregnant, I cried.  I was in Las Vegas [Nevada].  I mean I cried.  I was like, "But why is she having a -- you don't need any children."  He was about twenty-four [years old].  He was like twenty-four when his child was born.  I thought well, "At least he's older than I was." Although that didn't mean he was more responsible 'cause they're like my children.  I wish they were mine.
Story_ID: 3151
Speaker 1: So, in the two years you -- okay, Diane made her transition, you were able to open up to your spiritual self.
Speaker 2: Exactly
Speaker 1: So then you were able to absorb that adjustment, business wise, of being without Diane.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  It took a while.  I mean I still -- just yesterday I called out her name.  I was like Diane, they're worrying me.  (Laughter).  So I still have communications there.  And people are used to be me doing it now so they just look over at me and they're like, okay, leave her alone.  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 3152
Speaker 1: And, and somewhere in all this, you did marry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got married.  I got married, I got married after, after I went back into church.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: In 1999.
Speaker 1: And who was that lucky person.
Speaker 2: Otis Wilson [professional football player].
Story_ID: 3153
Speaker 1: Okay, I like 'how did you meet?' stories.
Speaker 2: Okay, I know nothing about football, and I didn't know Otis Wilson [professional football player] from Adam's house cat.  I mean I was just -- I knew the names.  But I would -- seen him before, but I was never -- I never dated athletes.  And so I had -- so he was never appealing to me for, for whatever reason.  But he came -- actually, I was at a birthday party for Tom Joyner [radio personality].  And I hadn't been dating anybody for probably, oh, I don't know, about a year or so.  And I happened to notice him.  But what I noticed about Otis was his stature, how straight he stood.  And he had on nice shoes.  And he was dressed in a nice black suit.  It wasn't a Barbara Bates suit, but it was a nice suit.  And I thought, "You know, he's not a bad looking guy."  And I knew he was a [Chicago] Bear [of the National Football League], I just didn't know which one.  And maybe minutes later, Tom -- Otis was walking that way and Tom says, "Oh, Barbara, do you know Otis?  Have you met Otis?"  And as I said, "No," Otis said, "Yes."  And I said, "No," because I never remembered having a formal introduction with him.  But, of course, over the years, we know each other, you know, because Otis was a good friend of Michael Jordan's [professional basketball player].  And since Michael was a client, I'd be out and maybe Otis would be there, but I would talk to Michael cause I still didn't know Otis like that.  So we knew of each other.  And, and I went, I went back to my girlfriend, and I said, "I have just met the man of my dreams."  And she said, "Who, you?"  Because I hate everybody (laughter).  I start calling security when guys start talking to me.  I don't like anybody.  I can find something wrong with you.  And I said, I said, "The guy, Otis Wilson."  And she says, "He's marr -- he's married."  I said, "Yeah, I know," but I said, "He sure is the man of my dreams."  And I said, I -- everything about him was just right.  And that was in June.  In November, I went to a wedding and I saw him there.  And I, and I told my girlfriend, I said, "This is him, he's standing right behind us."  And he was standing behind us.  So she turned around and she acknowledged him and she met him.  She was like, "Yeah, he is a nice-looking guy."  That was in November.  In December, like the next month, a friend of mine was working for me part-time, and she says, "Girl, guess what?  I have a blind date today with this guy."  She, I, she -- and I said, "Who is it?"  She said, "Otis Wilson."  I said, "You can't go out with him.  He's the man of my dreams, plus he's married."  And she's like, "Nope, he's separated from his wife.  And Regina just hooked me up with a date with him."  I was like, "Oh, wow."  So she says, "Well, I -- it's tomorrow," she said, "so I need something to wear from the shop."  And she came in the next day.  And she had on some pants.  They were too short, and they had wrinkles in them, and her hair was standing on top of her head like Pebbles Flintstone [cartoon character].  She was like, "How do I look?"  I said, "Great."  So he came to the shop and met her, and they went to lunch or something like that.  And we came in.  He acknowledged me and everything, and we hugged and it was like no big deal.  I was like, "Oh, well."  I knew I was never aggressive to date athletes, and I knew that athletes like a certain kind of girl.  And I just never thought of myself as being that.  So I just let it go like, "Oh, another one gone."  And when, and then when she came -- when he brought her back, when she came back, she said, "He wants to get some suits made," because he would always tell me when he saw me in the street, I want to get some suits from you.  Well, I just thought that was just Hollywood-talk.  I was like, "Yeah, yeah, whatever."  So he came back that next week and -- to get some suits made.  And she was there, my -- she was still working with me, just part-time.  And, you know, he let me pick out the stuff for him and, you know, all that kind of stuff.  And so then I had to schedule a fitting date for him to come back.  But by that time, I had had enough of her so I booted her, and it was after the Christmas season.  I didn't need her anymore.  I was just helping her out cause she needed work for Christmas.  And it was in, it was in February.  And, and he came in for the fitting.  And Diane [cousin and business manager] came back and said, "Otis wants to know if he can take you to lunch."  I was like, "Yes, I will go to lunch with him."  And so we went to lunch and we talked for like a couple of hours.  He told me about he was going through a divorce and, you know, all that stuff.  And, I mean we talked for like two hours.  We went Tuscany's [restaurant, Chicago, Illinois] for lunch.  And then, by the time we came back, it was -- work was over.  All my employees had left.  It was in the evening.  He says, "Michael Jordan is having a birthday party tonight.  Do you want to go?"  I was like, "Yeah."  So we went straight to the birthday party.  And that was like the first time people had seen us out so that's when the rumors started flying.  But then, I didn't like him as much the next week because my girlfriend, Laurie, was like really upset about it.  She thought cause they had gone out once, that he was like hers.  And so it put me in a bad situation.  And he was like, "But it was nothing.  I just took her to lunch.  It was like, you know, no big deal, nothing like that."  And then, then I just, I don't know, I just didn't like something about him then anymore.  I just wasn't liking him because it started confusion.  And so she and I, we still remained cool, but it was little something that went on there for a moment.  But she got over it and I got over it.  And so then I was like, "Okay, it's okay to go out with him"  And then when I started going out with him, he was too country to me.  His hands were too big.  His neck was too fat.  His shoes were run over.  His clothes were -- I mean he was just country.  I didn't like nothing about him, nothing.  But the nice thing I did like about him is that he was a easy date, when I needed a date to go someplace, he was a great date to have.  And he would bring me right home, and I would jump out of the car.  There was no kiss, no hug, no nothing.  He would just -- it was no pressure.  He knew that I was very uncomfortable, you know, with all of that.  And he never pressured me about it.  And that, that's what I would love.  He was easy to call.  We were almost like, well, you could think of it like I was one of the guys, but I knew he liked me another way.  But I would nev -- I didn't like him that way.  And so he was like cool with that, you know, 'cause he didn't have a hard time getting a woman.  So it was like, "I'll hang, you know, I'll hang out with you."  And we did that for like seven months.  He didn't know if I was a man or a woman (laughter).  And then after I started looking at him differently, I was like, "Well, it doesn't look like anything's coming my way, and he is a nice guy."  My mother [Vera Bates] was like, "You need somebody to look after you.  And here's a nice guy.  There's nothing wrong with him."  And then I, by that time, I was disinfecting him and cleaning him up.  He had Bates, you know, Bates designs on.  He was looking much better.  And I just like help him buy his shoes.  I was like, "Okay, well, I've got him pretty much where I want him now."  Then he started looking, you know, like cotton candy to me.  (Laughter).  So we went to a Michael Jordan Golf Outing in South Carolina together.  And by the time we came back, we never separated after that.
Speaker 1: When (unclear).
Speaker 2: Until three weeks ago.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Three weeks ago?  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Story_ID: 3154
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a sad part to this wonderful story, yeah.  I don't know if it's going to be the end of it, but this is like the ugly part of it.  Actually, my husband [Otis Wilson] filed for divorce on our anniversary, like how can you be that mean, like right around Christmastime?  And we're in court, like right now.  I'm -- we're on Phase II I guess.  And it's, it's uncomfortable for me to be in court, so actually I have an attorney that will like do all of that.  But, you know, my whole thing is, if this is what you think you want, then, you know, this is what you could have.  You know, I humbled myself and I looked to the Lord for help.  And, and actually, after -- Otis got saved in church first because he received the Holy Spirit before me.  But I, I went back to the receiving room, like (unclear), you know, right after that.  And my experience was such that they, they sent people to tape it.  So I was like I know that I have the Holy Spirit.  You know, it's like, I don't know if you received it or not, but with that, and the both of us giving our life to Christ, and there with the First Lady [Barbara Davenport Smith] and the Pastor [Bishop Dr. Horace Smith, Apostolic Faith Church, Chicago, Illinois], they were so very close to us.  I mean, they went on our honeymoon with us.  Whenever we travel, they go with us.  They were a very close part of our life.  And they never actually had friends that they traveled with like that.  Then that meant that we were fair game, you know, for the devil, and we were.  I mean it came from all ends.  He, you know, it was, it was almost like, you know, like he went to the Lord, he says, "Okay, I want, I need to test these two right here and you know, see what they've got going because, you know, I just want to mess with them."  And so we had it coming from like all angles.  I knew that.  But Otis is -- even though, because he was on every, every committee, and because he never missed a Sunday and he was at Bible Class and Foundation [for Spiritual Growth, Apostolic Faith Church, Chicago, Illinois], he was doing, you know, the fundamental things.  You know, I, on the other hand, it was much deeper than that for me.  I could see through things.  And I, you know, and I had a fear of the Lord, you know.  And my fear was like "I would never shame you or embarrass you so that, you know, the enemy could get the glory."  But Otis's was more, well, "I've -- I went to a prison and spoke and I" -- he doesn't, he doesn't really understand that that's not what the Lord wants.  He doesn't want you to do those tasks.  That's not it.  He wants you to walk the way that he walked.  And, you can't tell that to a person because it looks like that's how you're trying to plead your case.  They have to find out on their own.  And so it was, you know, we had it coming from all ends.  And my Pastor and First Lady really tried to work with us and, you know, it, it has just like come to this. And it's diff -- it's very difficult because, you know, when Otis comes to church, he still wants to sit in the same seat.  And I don't want like breathe the same air that he's breathing.  So I haven't been to church in a few weeks.  And actually, I talked to my Pastor last night, and he's like, "You can't let that run you away from God."  And my response to him was, "The same God that's at your church is right down the street at another church." And my Pastor was like, "I think you're crazy."  So tonight I'll go to Bible Class, and they're trying to figure out a way to get me, you know, "Well, then come to Bible, you know, come to Bible Class or come to Sunday School."  But, you know, maybe I'll become more comfortable with it a little bit later.  I love my husband and, and it's, you know, it's, it's a struggle for me, but I've gotten to the point now that, you know, since I, I've moved away, that I can breathe again.  I feel like something's been lifted off of me.  And I'm like, "If this is what he wants to do, you know, if he's not gonna honor his marriage, then he'll have to deal with that later on.  I know that I've always done the right thing, and I'm gonna continue to do the right thing.  And that's something he'll, he'll have to live with."  So I had a real rough period there for a while, but it's like I, I can't -- I have my joy again and I can laugh from down here again.  And that's very -- it's something I was missing.
Story_ID: 3155
Speaker 1: And I'm just praying that it won't be too late.  I mean I, I don't want to stop living, you know.  I got to -- now, I, now my fear is grow, you know, growing old.  I don't know if that's just something that naturally happens to women, but, you know, I'm forty-seven and really, that's -- you might as well say you're fifty.  I know, I know, but still (laughter).  And I hope I have double this amount of time, but it's like, now, I'm back where I started from again.  Where is my 'knight in shining armor,' you know, where, you know, we're, you know, that -- you know, right now I'm just thinking that, "You're okay by yourself.  You're cool.  You got your grandkids, you got your children.  Your mother's [Vera Bates] still alive.  And, you know, you have friends that love you and, and you have people just in general outside who love you."  I mean when it came on the newspaper that [professional football player] Otis [Wilson] and I, you know, were having problems, you know, one of my saints at church said -- because actually [journalist] Stella [Foster] called me and she asked could she print it.  And I told her I would love for her to do it because he needed to stop hiding behind, behind it, making people think other things.  And, yes, I wanted her to.  And one of the people at church came to me and they said, "I am so glad that you had that printed in the paper because now everybody gets to pray for you. You know, and it's not just something you got to handle by yourself."  And, see I, I, you know, I thought that is just so great that people rally around, you know, that would rally around you like that.  And I'm, I'm really, I'm okay with it.  Really, I am.  I wasn't for a long time.  I was like balled up in a corner some place.  And I thought, "No, that's not what He -- that's not what, what this lesson is about."
Speaker 2: And your path is so marked, this is something you really won't have to worry about.  I mean that's easier to say sitting over here, but I, but I think you know what I mean.  Everything in your (simultaneous) --
Speaker 1: It's already a test (unclear) it's like unbelievable, cause I was like, at this stage of your -- at this stage of my life, I do not want to smell somebody's new breath, see their butt and touch their toes.  I don't want to do that.  I don't want to be bothered with that.  There's -- I'm too picky.  There's nobody in, I don't like, you know, I don't want to be bothered with all that.  And I couldn't think of anybody in the world that I'd, you know, I'd want to be bothered with.  And then, here comes like somebody from the past that I was very close with and they stumbled to my shop on accident.  And not to say that anything is going that way, but this person gave me my joy back to let me know people love you, and, you know, you're a nice person.  And, you know, that was just nice.  I had forgotten that that went on, you know.
Speaker 2: So when you get through this -- let me ask you this way, what's beyond the, the immediate challenge for you?
Speaker 1: Right now, it's so confusing for me, you know.  I'm in a, I'm in an apartment that I just moved in three weeks ago.  I don't know if I want to stay in an apartment.  And I'm in an apartment that I could say, scream out the window and say, Otis, could you move to the left, I'm trying to watch your television.  (Laughter)  I moved, I moved out of my house, across the street into a high-rise building, you know, because it was convenient.  It was there for me out of the clear blue someone had, you know, one of my neighbors knew what I was going through.  And they had a brand new place that had never been lived in.  It was fabulous and like, "This is yours.  Go there and stay so you  won't have far to come back to."  I was like, "I don't even want it for that reason.  I just need my own space."  So that was like laid in my lap.  And I'm, I'm confused, I don't know really what I want to do.  I don't know, do I want to go buy something so I could have everybody come and live off of me cause my family would do that.  Or do I want to stay here and enjoy me.  I'm really kind of crazy right now.  How do I get back into church where I can walk in and sit back next to the First Lady [Barbara Davenport Smith, Apostolic Faith Church, Chicago, Illinois], you know, instead of trying to hide and go to a difference service and all that.  You know, how do -- so I, I have to look for some direction.  I need some quiet time to figure that out, which I don't give myself a lot of that.  So I'm, I don't know.  I'm like flying by the seat of my pants right now.  I need some, I need some direction, but I've got to sit down for a moment.
Speaker 2: Your vacation helped you get --
Speaker 1: A little bit.  It helped a little bit, but the thing about that is that I catered to everybody that went.  Even when I took a room by myself, by the time I got to the room at night, I was dog-tired, and all I could do was fall out.  And I, and I took fifteen women on the vacation and I was responsible for them.  So it wasn't the vacation that I had, had the first time I went to this place.  So, yeah, it didn't, it didn't work the way it worked the first time.  The first time I went with a group, and I was just able to relax on my own.  This time I had, it was like taking a group and you've got to be responsible for activities and things.  I planned, I wanted to make sure they had a good time.  And so that's what I did on this vacation.
Story_ID: 3156
Speaker 1: So important question, is there some growing for you to do as far as giving away too much?
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.  That's, that's like -- I mean that's one thing that [former husband] Otis [Wilson]  would always say about me.  "You cannot save the world, and you work too hard.  You leave when it's dark. You come home when it's dark.  And why are you, always feel you have to help everybody."  And I just -- I don't know how to say, "No."  I'm the type though that, you can keep on, like you know, coming at me to get things from me, and quietly I'm telling you, "No, stop, leave me alone, stop."  And, but if you don't hear me and you let me bounce up against the wall, then there is another side to me as nice as I am.  There's another side and most people have seen it cause they've taken me there.  They take my kindness for weakness.  And it's not that.  But I've made up my mind, I'm not gonna change.  I am easygoing, and I'm nice, and that's me.  I'm not going to just be rude and act another kind of way to throw people off.  I'm going to learn just how to say, "No," which I have started doing.  But I enjoy helping other people because I do silly things.  I mean, you know, I'm, I'm not going to buy a pair five hundred dollar shoes this week.  I'm going to pay, help So-and-so pay their rent because they really need it.  Those things -- you know, buying the stuff -- and I buy materialistic things.  My teenage son [Kristopher] is that and I know why he is.  When, when I look at it in him, it's ugly.  I don't like it. But I'm that way.  I like things, but I will also stop with things to help somebody else.  I have a tendency not to give of my time as much and to give money or things, but I'm learning how to give a little bit more time.  And to give -- that's just, the giving is just me.  I'm not really sure how to get a hold, you know, a hold of that just yet.  Actually, when I came back from vacation, I had, you know, I had a period, a couple of days, I was like, I'm so tired of people sucking the life out of me and draining me.  But I say that, and then I go right back to doing, you know, what it is that I do.  So.  I don't know how to stop that just yet.  I'm not sure.
Story_ID: 3157
Speaker 1: So you, in addition to your work, and, and the [Barbara Bates] Foundation work, have you been aware -- which we'll come back and talk about the Foundation --
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: -- have you, how have you been affected being an African American fashion designer?  And has that had an effect on you?
Speaker 2: No, I, I have to honestly say, I have never felt any effects of being a black woman, ever.  If I have, I've been -- because I am such a do-do-do-type person, they went right over my head, and I didn't know that it was going on.  I've always seemed to had it relatively easy.  And even when, you know, in my darkest hour, you know, when I just think everything is about to fall apart, it just comes right back together again.  I mean I know I've had like close calls on all kind of stuff.  It looks everything was about to fall apart.  I just always come out of it.  And my friends just always say how "You are such a survivor and you are so strong." And then I have to look back and I say, "That's a great characteristic that I get from my mother [Vera Bates], being strong and being able to, you know, just bear with all."  And, you know, failure doesn't bother me, but the fear of failure keeps me like strong and keeps me hustling the way I do to keep things, you know, like right where they need to be.  And my mother, my mother is that way.  I mean we never had shut-off notices or lights turned off or phones turned off.  That, none of that ever happened.  She's, she's like a great provide -- she was a great provider and she, she knew how to manipu -- you know, struggle.  She knew how to struggle and it keep, you know, where everybody was okay with it.  You know, --
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) A good manager.
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) and I think that, yeah, I think that I got -- I, I'm not sure what it is.  It just reminds me of like the strong Negro slave out in the cotton field.  This is the one who can stay out here twenty-four hours and doesn't have to go in.  You know, my mother said she picked cotton before too, but I, I -- she just reminds me of a strong black woman.  I think that that's what I got from her.  I mean these last few months like even the, like the, like this whole year from the beginning to the end, like going through the divorce stuff and still trying to like, you know, change his [former husband Otis Wilson] mind and all of that.  It was very humbling.  It was something I had never done before, but I had heard that the Lord does not like pride and that I should humble myself.  And so I went through all of that, and when that still wasn't working and I thought I had done everything that I could do, now I said, then I said, "Well, it's time for me to move on."  And it's still like, it's still like the same thing.  I know that I did everything I was supposed to do.  Now, I'm moving on to the next phase.  And, and I was pretty strong through it.  I mean, you know, I would cry every fifteen minutes but it was like, then I'm just keep on, you know, keep on moving on.  And, and now it's almost like -- I haven't forgotten that part of my life, but it's easy, it's sitting so far in the back, I'm wondering like, "What's wrong with me that I could dismiss all of that so quickly?"  It's almost like the Lord, you know, "You asked me to give you peace and this is what I'm giving you.  Now, don't question it."

Speaker 1: And so business-wise, do you see, do you have -- what other goals do you have for your business now?
Speaker 2: Right now, I really want to do more manufacturing.  I want to work more with department stores and with a young teenaged son [Kristopher] -- actually, he's in college now -- but seeing how they spend money, 'cause our generation now, we give our kids money to buy whatever it is because we figure our parents didn't do it.  So we're gonna shower you with money so you can have the best shoes and the blest clothes -- the best clothes.  That generation spends a lot of money.  And I'm thinking about doing something on a younger line, something that my son -- so my son can come back and, and do something with.  But custom [fashion design] is nice, but it requires so much.  And I want to try to get away from that.  That's, that's one goal I have for my business.  And I think it would free me up too.  I'd have more time for me.
Story_ID: 3159
Speaker 1: Do, do your sons intend to work in the business?
Speaker 2: No, actually the youngest one [Kristopher], he says, "Yes," but he's on another level.  He says, "I would never take my personal time and stand and measure somebody.  This place needs to be manufacturing.  There's a lot of money out there to be made."  He's on another wavelength with it, and I'm agreeing with him.  My oldest son [Eugene] actually was the young kid who used to walk around with forty-fives, with the plastic records.  He would like take his bike and turn it over and spin records on it.  And he was like -- the time he went to sleep with records.  It was a real weird obsession, but actually, my son is a producer now.  He's a D.J. [disc jockey] and he produces music.  So that's how I can go back and see the things you're doing when you're young come right back.  So, my son is actually in the studio right now.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's good, really good.
Story_ID: 3160
Speaker 1: Have you had any inclinations as far as, maybe not inclinations, but participation in any kind of political kinds of things or
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) Not really.  Not anything that stands out.  You know, I'll go to fundraisers and write a check, but nothing that's -- no, I haven't burned a bra or marched with anybody, no.  (Laughter)
Speaker 1: Do you have a kind of social or civic or social service organizations?
Speaker 2: It must be on half the things that they have.  I mean the League of Black Women, I work with them.  And there's a list of organizations that I'm on that, you know, what they get from me is a check, you know.  Or they'll get, they'll ask for, they'll ask for a donated item.  And that's easy for me to give somebody an item, go pull it off the rack or either make it for them.  So that's mostly how my participation goes in.  A lot of time, I never find myself doing.  I don't really do a bunch of that.
Speaker 1: Are you active in church, I mean in a general sense beyond --
Speaker 2: With the young women I am, and not as much as they want me to be.  I've done like a couple of things with the young women, and now they want to turn into something else.  And I figure that I don't know what it is that I need to know yet.  I don't know how to speak their lingo yet.  I could just tell them what my experiences are and, and go from there, but I don't, I'm not sure -- I don't know how to apply the Lord to that yet for them.  So I'm -- you understand what I'm saying? I'm still trying to work with them.  It's like the young girls in the church, they grew up in church.  And I tell them, I say, "You are so fortunate, you guys grew up in church, and I've only been in church two years.  So I know that I don't know anything.  I don't really know what I could tell you guys."  But when I tell them my story about being a teen mom and just doing what I want to do, that's a story for them.  And it's old news for me.  What they've been doing all these years is, like how do you get a young person to go to church every Sunday?  That's unbelievable to me.  So, yeah, there's something -- they have a waiting for me with the young, with the young women.  I'm just, I don't know how to, I don't know -- I'm not sure how I'm supposed to approach it yet.
Story_ID: 3161
Speaker 1: This question is coming a little too early for you, but I'm going to ask it anyway.  What do you think you'll be remembered for?
Speaker 2: It's kind of unfair to ask that of, you know, the person themself.  I would almost like to hear another person, you know, ask somebody else, "What do you think that I'll be remembered for?"  (Laughter)  You get more of a, it's more -- a little bit easier.  And I'm not sure.  Well, of course, with the [Barbara Bates] Foundation work that I do, a lot of people, you know, that know Barbara Bates, they know, they know about the work that I do with the, with the prom children.  My sisters [Elaine, Cynthia, Elizabeth] are like, "If I have to hear that story one more time, I'm going to throw up."  And, so I think that the work that I do or that I've done with, you know, with young people.  Or, and then, of course, you know, the thing that people like to hear, my association with, like, you know entertainers and athletes.  That's, for other people that's like something that's great to hear.  For me, I know that it's, it's just a headache.  And I'd rather it be just anyone from the street because they're a client like anybody else.  But for other people trying to blow something up, they'll remember that I worked with athletes and that, you know, entertainers, that kind of stuff.
Story_ID: 3162
Speaker 1: What is your fashion design philosophy?  What makes a Barbara Bates creation a Barbara Bates creation?
Speaker 2: Because I do custom, I do a little bit of this and a little bit of that.  I don't have like a, I don't have like one thing that I flow with, which is good.  That means I get to go all the way around the board.  But for me, if I think about a Barbara Bates creation, I think about textures.  I like to use fabrics that you can play with and touch while they're on your body.  And I like to mix fabrics.  I like to mix leathers with fabrics since leathers is what people know me for.  That's what I started with.  I like to hold onto that.  And I like a great fit.  I mean, you know, full-figured women still have a body.  And if something fits properly, then that's a great, you know, that's a great outfit.  So my philosophy is that it be well made so you could turn it inside out -- because they figure since we're sitting in a shop, making it, it's got to be something, you know, that you can tell it's been handmade.  It's mammy-made so to speak.  And so I like impeccably clean tailoring and I like wonderful fabric.  And it's got to be like some sense of style, not trendy.  I don't go with trends.  Like if they say the color is pink this year, then well, you ahead and wear pink.  But I like to do what makes a person feel good about themselves.  Women, I think, dress for other women cause men really don't notice you unless you're wearing a belly top.  And, you know, but other women will notice what you're wearing.  And for me if another woman notices what you're wearing, and she's knows it's a Barbara Bates, then for me, I think of the business end, that  she's going to come to me for business.
Speaker 1: And what is the range, the price range for your fashions?
Speaker 2: It can go anywhere from, you know, one hundred forty dollars for a blouse to two thousand dollars for a shearling coat.  I mean I work, I don't really have a certain price that I work with.  You know, in order to keep business and to keep people happy and to deal with everybody, I'll ask somebody, you know, what's your budget?  We can work around that, around that. If I can do it, then this is what you can get out of.
Story_ID: 3163
Speaker 1: Okay, let's talk about your [Barbara Bates] Foundation.  And tell me how it got started and its process of growth and where it is today.
Speaker 2: Actually, about my third year in business, by that time I was working with [professional basketball player] Michael Jordan and I was getting a lot of press from the paper.  And I got a phone call from someone who wanted to know if I was the same Barbara Bates that went to 'family living center' [Chicago Public Schools alternative school for pregnant teens, Illinois].  And I told her, "Yes, I was."  And she says, "Well, I went there with you, and I, and I read the article.  I want to congratulate you on your business and what you're doing.  And I work with the young teen moms."  Well, the one thing you have to remember about when I was a teen parent, after you have the baby and you reach a certain age, then it can't bother you any more.  Like when you're -- of course, when you're a teen at the bus stop with a baby then, it's very embarrassing cause people are looking at you a certain way.  And even when you're twenty and your child is four, people are saying, that's your child or even when you're, you know, twenty-fve, I mean, and you, they -- you say the age, they can still look at you and say, "Oh, you had a child so young."  But after you get to a certain age, then it doesn't have to bother you like it did anymore.  So it was out of my life.  I never, I never had to go back that way at all.  It was just over.  And, and so I said, you know, but I, I was never not admitting that, that part of my life.  It just never came up.  And so I said, "Yeah, I did, you know, I am that person."  And she says, "Well, I have a group of girls, and we're at [Advocate] Bethany Hospital [Chicago, Illinois]" -- and I grew up right around the corner from there.  "And I'd like for you to come and speak to them."  So I had no intentions of going to speak, and I told her, "Yeah, I would."  But when I got off the phone, I said, "I'll call her back and I'll cancel this." I forgot to cancel.  And they called me the day I was supposed to be there, a few hours ahead of time just to confirm I was coming.  And then, it would have been like too unprofessional to say I wasn't gonna come.  So I went on over there.  It was the first time I had gone back in that neighborhood in a long time, and I didn't have anything ready for them cause I hadn't really -- I had, wasn't going to do it.  When I got there, and I walked into the room, I saw about fifteen teenaged girls, I'm talking younger than what I was, young girls.  And they were all pregnant, you know, from the inner city.  And when I stood up there, my grandmother [Lillie Bonds] took over after that.  The whole story was, you know, I grew up not far away from here.  I used to remember walking down this block, you know. when I got pregnant.  You know, what happened, how it affected my par -- my mother [Vera Bates], you know, my sisters [Elaine, Cynthia, Elizabeth], how it affected me.  And I just found myself finally confronting what I threw in the back and never had to talk about.  I mean never talked about it, never.  And, and in telling the story, it started unfolding that there was a story to tell.  I had no idea that this was something that somebody wanted to hear, and that it could help somebody.  And I just told it like it was.  And then by the end of the thing, of course, and I was -- it was very emotional for me.  At the end of the thing, I said, you know, "You just, you all just don't know how important it is.  There's something other than the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], you know.  It's, there's an area called Michigan Avenue [Chicago, Illinois] you got to go see."  And I said, "This is not just it, living right here.  And some of you are going to get out of here and some of you aren't."  I said, "But if I can be of a help, you know, to be some incentive, whoever stays in school and graduates, I'll make your prom dress for you for free."  So that's kind of how that got started.  And my grandmother gave away some dresses that day and, you know, the girls did call me like that year.  And I probably did about three dresses.  And then the next year, you know -- I would go back, and, of course, after that, this woman went and told somebody how I spoke.  And I became a speaker all of a sudden.  I was getting so many phone calls from Chicago Public School system [Illinois] to speak, it was unbelievable.  And then I like, burned myself out on the story.  It's like, "Oh, I can't stand the story anymore myself."  (Laughter).  But I knew that there was still help, you know coming from it.  And so when I would go and speak, I would do the same thing.  If I was in the room -- I was in high schools.  So the pregnancy was gonna come up or either they were sitting there.  That was my gift to them, that if you just do the right thing, and you'd be surprised that if you just stick with it, that you'll come out of this okay.  You sound, it seems really bad right now, but you can come through it, and it'll be all behind you.  And so I started doing dresses that way.
Story_ID: 3164
Speaker 1: Give me the year you first spoke and then the year you actually formalized the [Barbara Bates] Foundation?
Speaker 2: Okay, the year that I spoke [at Advocate Bethany Hospital, Chicago, Illinois], it was the summer of 1987.  Yeah.  1987.  And the actual Foundation wasn't formed until probably like ten years later, the formal Foundation.  Every year I gave away dresses, but nobody knew about what I was doing.  It's, wasn't important for anybody to know.  Someone actually found out about what I was doing who was -- they were an acquaintance at the time.  She's a very dear friend now, and she came and said that she would like to have something written up on it and if they could interview some of the girls.  I said, "Well, you know, I can ask about it."  And it turned into a story that they ran in the ['Chicago] Tribune' [newspaper].  And they actually did something on television with it.  And a, an executive from Kraft [Foods corporation] wrote me a letter and said, "I saw, you know, what you were doing with the prom girls."  And, you know, she include, include -- enclosed her personal check for like fifteen hundred dollars.  And she said, "I'd like to have this -- give you this so that next year you can, you know, do this again.  And if you ever decide to formalize --
Speaker 1: So she gave you the fifteen hundred dollars (unclear) (simultaneous) --
Speaker 2: Right, and then she said, "But all I'm going to ask is that you include full-figured girls, you know, in giving the dresses away next year with your teen moms and -- because I was full-figured, and I couldn't find a dress.  And if you ever decide to go formal with this, I have other friends who are in Corporate America who would rally together, who would help you raise money to do this."  And so I told my attorney about it, and she says, "Yeah, you can start a foundation."  And that's how the Foundation got started from this letter that came from -- actually, her name was Paula Sneed.  She was an executive at Kraft.  And she's been very supportive all through it.
Story_ID: 3165
Speaker 1: And from there, I started going to the high schools soliciting girls.  I'll just, you know, I just get girls -- I don't have a formal way I get young girls, you know.  I may ride through the projects and see somebody in Harold's Chicken [restaurant] and say, "Do you have a girlfriend that's a teenager."  You know, there's nothing formal about it.  I'll ask other students to, you know, help me with girls and I just like to pick the girls that are the unlikely ones to get something because I found that a lot of my easy times in life -- and I hope that, that I'm not being offensive saying this, but a lot of my easy stuff came from being light skinned and having long hair.  I got things that I didn't deserve because of that.  Like I can remember things I got picked for in school and I wasn't the best at that, but I got picked for a different sort of reason.  And I always thought, even though I accepted it, I always thought that is unfair for other people.  And so, and that's why I felt that if there was something for me to give, that -- in young people, I had to be able to weed out, you know, the people who always got stuff and go straight for the one who is really struggling, and they were going to make it despite.  So that meant, you know, they're not an A student, and they're not gorgeous and they're not rich, but they got, you know, they're just the one that you're not eating lunch with or they just got left out.  And the students have, that come to me and buy dresses I ask them to go get those kind of girls.  And they're like, "How can we tell them that we don't like them, and they're baldheaded and ugly.  I don't think that that's fair."  I said, "You'll figure out a way to get them in here.  You'll -- just get them here and it's got to be somebody who will appreciate what I'm doing."  So, you know, I, I just go for the people who get left out.
Story_ID: 3166
Speaker 1: And what kind of stories have you heard from these young ladies?
Speaker 2: I mean I have a young girl -- some of the stories.  There's one young girl who was walking to the restaurant to go to a, a chicken place or something, got caught in the crossfire of gang shooting.  She has like eleven bullet wounds in her body from her abdomen down to her legs, and we found that out because she wanted something made that was a two-piece prom dress.  And I said, just teasingly, "Okay, I hope you don't have bullet wounds and keloids and stretch marks from babies and all that."  And then she told her story.  And I mean she laughed at it.  She thought it was funny, and they never showed where her dress was, but that was just one story.  She was in the hospital for, you know, quite a long time, but she came through.  And she graduated and went on to college.  I have another girl.  This is my, my, well, actually one of my favorites.  I have another young lady whose full-figured.  She was probably about four hundred pounds.  And I made her a prom dress -- and the prom kids can drive you crazy.  You know, "This isn't exactly what I wanted, blah, blah, blah."  And so my sister was working me at that time, and she comes in the back.  She says, "One of the prom girls is up front and she's crying."  I'm like, "These girls that are getting the free dresses are more trouble than the other girls."  So I got up front, and she's crying because she looks so pretty.  And I just thought that was just incredible.  My sister and I were like boohooing.  We're like, "Oh, my God."  I get a letter from her after her prom with a check in it, a money order for fifty dollars because even though she was someone who could have afforded a prom dress, she couldn't have gone anywhere to buy a nice prom dress.  And so, just, you know, as a gesture, her mother -- she and her mom thought that that's what they would do for me.  And she was like she felt so special, you know, that particular, that particular night.  And it's, that's actually like one of my favorite ones.  I can still remember her name.  So.  But there're children that, you know, that have parents that are drug users or a parent.  Very seldom anybody comes from a home that has both parents in it.  Or, of course, the girls that are teen moms, and they stay in school -- like this past year, I had a girl who had three children.  It's like, "How do you have three children in high school?"  And so, of course, I had to sit down and talk with her, you know, prior to, like, "This is it.  And I don't know what people are telling you, but this is not going to be a easy road."  And, but she still grad -- she stayed in school and she graduated.  And everybody was telling me, "No, that's just ridiculous.  Don't give her a prom dress."  But it's like, "No, I can't -- she's got to get one."  So.
Speaker 1: And she stayed the course.
Speaker 2: Right, she stayed her course.
Story_ID: 3167
Speaker 1: How many dresses do you give away, and when you did you get formal help?  Do you get formal help other than the fifteen hundred dollars?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, what I do is -- well, after I started the [Barbara Bates] Foundation, then I got a board of women together who are friends and associates.  And I asked them to sponsor a dress for every girl.  And so I probably had like, you know, twenty people, so they each paid for a prom dress, which is the cost of the fabric and the labor of the dress.  And so it's still, you know, mediocre, but the prom dress can be as fabulous as they want it to be.  Then, then after milking my friends for a year or two, I found it hard to go back and keep asking them for money.  So I did a -- last year was the first year I did like a big fashion show fundraiser.  And I raised, I raised money to have the dresses done. Although the tickets were expensive and we raised a lot of money, I had never done a fundraiser before so the costs outweighed everything that came in so I still had to pay for the dresses out of my pocket again.  And so, I want to --  I'm getting better at it.  I'll have -- you know, I know the things to do now. You have sponsors come in and help you, but -- and even though I had that done, I still -- I wanted it to be so nice, I went someplace very posh and wonderful and it just cost a whole lot of money.  So.
Story_ID: 3168
Speaker 1: So is there anything that, when you reflect on your life, what kind of things come to mind?
Speaker 2: I guess if I were just to sit and really reflect on everything we've gone over, all of those things that you touched on are important things to me.  So they all come back.  I mean I start with, actually, I start with my, you know, my uncle who lived in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], you know, with, with my aunt.  And I'll start with him, and then I go with my grandmother [Lillie Bonds].  And I just come all the way up the ranks, you know, with teachers that were close to me.  You know, my mother's [Vera Bates] like my big, biggest fan.  My mother's like such a cheerleader.  And, you know, I reflect back on, you know, how I didn't do all the right things with raising a child.  You know, there was like no book for me to read from, but I know I did the best that I could.  And --
Speaker 1: Do you have a good relationship with your sons?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my, my children are -- we're very close, yeah.  We talk, we too much every day.  (Laughter)  But my oldest son [Eugene] always has a thing of like the youngest son [Kristopher] got more than he did.  I said, "That's 'cause I was at a different place in my life when he came along, you know.  You and I struggled together.  I was already, you know, I was doing pretty good when he made it through."  But --
Speaker 1: But all older sisters and brothers say that about the babies.
Speaker 2: Right (laughter). I just, you know, I reflect back on, on sayings, "just keep on living."  You know, 'cause I, I always think about how, you know, I was twenty yesterday and I'm going to be fifty tomorrow.  It's like it's not waiting on you.  I always thought some miracle drug was gonna come in and I could stay thirty for forever, but that's not gonna happen.  So now I just want to, I want to have a quality life when I'm older.  Like I went to a senior cit -- a senior citizens' dinner on Sunday, a banquet.  And I will go back again.  It was just like so much knowledge in that room.  And that kind of knowledge we won't get again, you know, with the next group that's coming.  Well, maybe, with the next group -- but my group you're not gonna get it (Laughter).  The stories will start going downhill after that and the recipes, but that group that was in there, that was my grandmother's group, you know, people from Mississippi and North Carolina.  And they know about smoke houses and brown eggs, you know, that's the group that I sat with on Sunday, and I loved it.  It was wonderful.  I loved it.
Story_ID: 3169
Speaker 1: I'm sure there're a lot of days that your mother [Vera Bates] sits and looks at you and sees herself, the other side of the coin.
Speaker 2: She, she would never say that though.  She's never said that.  My mother is, my mother is the nervous type that throws it off on me.  My mother is just the type that's always telling, you know, the doubting, you know, she's always telling you the wrong part of something. Even though she's your cheerleader, she's always, "No, you you're gonna sick. You need to take off some time from that job and stop letting these kids worry you half to death."  And my mother's one of those type, "Oh, you all are gonna miss me when I'm gone" and "Oh, if my mother was alive today, I'd be concern" -- like there may be like some Sundays when she'll say come over and let's do something.  I'm like, "No, I'm going to so and so, so and so."  "Ah, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone."  You know, all that.  I'm like, "Oh, you're not going anywhere, Lady."  And my mother's not sickly at all.  She loves going to the riverboat, that's, that's like her main attraction of life.  Give her some money, and she'll get there on her own.  But she never really, she never says that.  And, and we're, and we're very, we're very -- I don't know. Maybe we're not very different because my mother, even though my mother is the very feisty one in the family, and everybody always says how, you know, she can turn you off by her cutting words.  You know, she'll take a stranger off the street and feed them and clothe them.  My mother is the same way.  Act, actually, all -- most of my sisters [Elaine, Cynthia] are that way except my baby sister [Elizabeth].  She won't be bothered with, you know, with, with trying to help people, but everybody else, they'll take 'em in.  You know, they'll do that.  [Former husband] Otis [Wilson]  would be afraid I would bring homeless people home.  He would say, "I was like, honey, I just met this homeless person down in Starbucks [coffee shop] and I" -- and he'd say, "Don't tell me they're in the living room."  And I'd say, "No, I came upstairs to get some clothes, and I want to know if you got any stuff I can give him too."  And he got terrified they were gonna, they were gonna show up at the door.  So she never really talks about how she sees me because our ambition levels, I think, were just so different.  But she's very, very protective of me, you know.  She always thought that Otis was the shining, you know, the 'knight in shining armor' who would protect me.  And when that didn't work out for her, my mother is, my mother's like very bitter about it.  She's like, she's more upset than I am.  (Laughter)  I said, "Ma, you gotta let it go."  (laughter)  You're gonna let this kill you, let it go.
