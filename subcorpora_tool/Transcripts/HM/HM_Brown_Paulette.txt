Story_ID: 672806
Speaker 1: So, I want to start out by asking you about your family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And your, I'd like to ask about your mother first. Her name was--?
Speaker 2: Thelma Brown [Thelma Stamper Brown]--is.
Speaker 1: Is--that's right. That's right.
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm real fortunate, yes, is.
Speaker 1: And how old is she now?
Speaker 2: She will be eighty-six this year, yes.
Speaker 1: So, can you tell me what you know about her family background? How far back, you know.
Speaker 2: I only know back as far as my--her [maternal] grandfather [Samuel Austin]. I don't really know, never really heard much about her grandmother [Silvia Austin], but her grandfather, from North Carolina. And her mother [Pauline Austin Stamper] went to boarding school and went to Fayetteville State in North Carolina [Fayetteville State Teachers College; Fayetteville State University, Fayetteville, North Carolina]. Then she married my grandfather [George Stamper]. She actually eloped with him and her father was very upset because he saw his money sort of going down the drain from the, from boarding school and from college. And she did teach for a little while in North Carolina until she met my grandfather. They moved to Baltimore [Maryland] and he forced her to stop teaching.
Speaker 1: Do you know the name of the boarding school--
Speaker 2: I do not.
Speaker 1: --per chance? Okay.
Speaker 2: I do not. I do--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I know it was not Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: It wasn't (unclear) right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) My son [Dijaun Brown] went to Piney Woods.
Speaker 1: Oh he did?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah that's a--
Speaker 2: By his choice (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. No, it's still, Piney Woods is still up--
Speaker 2: It's still there.
Speaker 1: --and operating.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: No when you, when they moved to Maryland, do you know approximately that year you know where would--?
Speaker 2: That would have been in the mid-'20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: So, they were part of the migration--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --up from, from North Carolina (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Right. Although, I don't know that my grandmother would have moved but for my grandfather. She was teaching in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Now do you remember, do you remember your grandfather, grandmother and grandfather on that side?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Story_ID: 672807
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about them?
Speaker 2: Sure. My [maternal] grandfather worked--
Speaker 1: And his name?
Speaker 2: George Stamper. He worked in a copper plant. When my grandmother [Pauline Austin Stamper] came and he--she didn't work at first but then she had like menial jobs and ultimately was a cafeteria worker.
Speaker 1: And do you remember their house or you know, the times of (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, 2020--2024 North Smallwood Street in Baltimore [Maryland] between Clifton [Avenue] and--I can't remember the other street right now but North Avenue wasn't far away.
Speaker 1: Okay. And now tell me about your--so were you growing up with that side of the parents then on, on your mother's [Thelma Stamper Brown] side? Was--or were both sides of grandparents?
Speaker 2: Both, both sides of grandparents. I know pretty amazing, right (laughter)?
Speaker 1: So, so let me a- any other things that you can tell me that you would associate with you know growing up with that side of your grandparents, the Stampers?
Speaker 2: Sure.  We--it, it's interesting because in Baltimore there was not a lot of apartment living. We, we all owned our houses so my grandparents on both sides owned their houses. We owned our house even though you know no, no professionals per se, but we still owned our homes. And so you know my grandmother, it's interesting, because she went to Union Baptist Church [Baltimore, Maryland] because that--her upbringing was still instilled in her even though my grandfather made her stop teaching. But she went--Union Baptist Church was where the professional people went to church. And so, she, she grew, she was a member of that church forever. And we would visit that church with her sometimes, loved to go to her house on Sundays. We would spend nights, Saturday night sometimes with her. And my mother was one of four; she had one brother who was older and two sisters who were younger. She's the only surviving one. And just great times. You know she was the truest grandmother in every sense of the word. She was--had a lot of great style, beautiful, she was very pretty; and just had a really good time 'cause she was a grandmother in the truest sense of the word.
Speaker 1: And did your mother share stories about growing up herself?
Speaker 2: Not, not too many, she, no she did not. She finished high school early, think she was fifteen or sixteen, and got married early at seventeen and started a, a business school called Cortez Peters [Cortez W. Peters Business College]. Remember Cortez Peters, fastest typist? So, yeah so she actually graduated from Cortez Peters and used it a little bit but not much.
Speaker 1: And she grew up in Baltimore (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Baltimore, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so your roots really--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know is, by the time you come around you're second generation in Baltimore?
Speaker 2: Exactly. And my father [Wilbur Brown] grew up in Baltimore as well.
Story_ID: 672808
Speaker 1: So, let's talk about your father. What is his, can you give his name?
Speaker 2: Wilbur, W-I-B- W-I-L-B-U-R.
Speaker 1: Brown (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Brown, yes [Wilbur Brown].
Speaker 1: And what about his side of the family, how far back do you know on that side?
Speaker 2: I only know about his mother and Eastern Shore, Maryland is where they're from. Her name is Ruth [Ruth Macer]--it, I, I, I never knew my father's natural father but--and so she remarried to Leewood Macer and, and then they had several children together. My father had one older sister, Winona [Winona Macer] and, and then he had several other siblings who he considered just his siblings.
Speaker 1: Okay. You know I was wondering about the name so that was his stepfather--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --who, who would, who would--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now how many kids in his family? Do you--?
Speaker 2: All, all of them?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Let's see. It's Winona, my father, Bernice [Bernice Macer], Leatrice [Leatrice Macer], Connie [Constance Macer], we called him Buddy but he's Leewood, Jr. [Leewood Macer], Isaiah [Isaiah Macer] and Mary [ph.]. How many is that?
Speaker 1: That is--
Speaker 2: A lot.
Speaker 1: A lot.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I think--was it eight?
Speaker 2: Eight?
Speaker 1: I think it was eight.
Speaker 2: Eight. Eight, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, he had six that his stepfather had, right. And several of them are gone.
Speaker 1: Did he talk about growing up? Did he share stories?
Speaker 2: He shared some stories and my mother [Thelma Stamper Brown] shared some stories about how poor they were and how he stopped school to work to help to support the family. And he has taken on a role as caregiver forever, even now. And I know that even after I graduated from college he would come to visit me and start cleaning and doing all sorts of things. But you know it's very interesting because I don't know how it got into him but you know he was, he always believed that you should treat women with respect. But he also believed that as a part of that respect that there were no really boy jobs or girl jobs. That men had a responsibility to do everything too, so.
Speaker 1: That's unusual given the times (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh very unusual. Very unusual.
Story_ID: 672809
Speaker 1: So now what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Actually my earliest memory of growing up, don't remember where I lived until we moved to the house where I grew up. We moved there, I was about two years old. I remember my father [Wilbur Brown] had a 1951 black Buick and I remember riding up to our house on Lanvale Street in Baltimore [Maryland]. That's my first memory of anything. My mother [Thelma Stamper Brown] says she can't believe that--and, and I don't know why I don't remember anything before that point. And apparently something serious happened with me shortly, kind of shortly before we moved there that my sister [Brenda Brown Forrest] and I were driving to Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] and she was telling me about how I almost lost my eyesight in my left eye and how I was in a the hospital for all of this time. And I'm, I, I just dismissed it. I said if that were true somebody would have told me this long before now because this is like thr- two or three years ago she told me this. I said someone would have told me this long before now. And, and, and so about I guess six months after that, I saw these things that looked like it was raining and I realized the spots were coming from my eyes. And went to the eye doctor and you know he said it was no torn retinas or anything just something that happens when you get older. And I was telling my mother and she said, "We should get your eye records from the Wilmer eye clinic [Wilmer Eye Institute] at Hopkins [The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland]." And that's--and, and then I said what Brenda said was true (laughter). I really was. I was in the hospital for like two weeks. I almost lost my eyesight in my left eye.
Speaker 1: Did she explain what happened?
Speaker 2: Yes. She said that I was playing outside, you know in the dirt and whatever and I got an infection in my left eye. And, and, and they didn't know whether they were going to be able to save it; and Hopkins being Hopkins, they did some experiments and they saved my eye. I have absolutely zero recollection of that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So that's earlier than age two you're saying?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: So that--
Story_ID: 672810
Speaker 1: Now, I want to go back and ask how your parents met?
Speaker 2: According to my mother [Thelma Stamper Brown], in a park in Baltimore [Maryland] is where they met.
Speaker 1: And how old were they?
Speaker 2: My mother must have been about fifteen or sixteen, and my father [Wilbur Brown] is two years older.
Speaker 1: Okay. And so they were--so do you think they lived at all with their grandparents at the beginning, or either side?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, there wasn't. So--
Speaker 2: No. No.
Speaker 1: --they were on their own from the beginning?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And your siblings, can you give their name--'cause are you the youngest?
Speaker 2: I'm the youngest, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, can you give their names or--?
Speaker 2: Oldest sister is Brenda Forrest [Brenda Brown Forrest], my next sister is Carlita White [Carlita Brown White] but we call her Ann, and my brother is Wilbur Brown, Jr. [Wilbur Brown]. He died, it will be, in September it will be four years, and he was a Jr., Wilbur Brown, and there's me.
Speaker 1: So there were two girls, a boy and a girl. So your, your father had three girls and, and his one son?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Right. So, can you talk about growing up in the Brown household, especially the--now the h- the address again was?
Speaker 2: 2909 West Lanvale Street.
Speaker 1: And how far is it situated between your two sets of grandparents? One is on Small--
Speaker 2: Smallwood Street and the other one was on, it's terrible, I can see the street. Oh, it will come to me. This is so terrible.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: But it's not far. We could walk. Actually on a good day you could walk either place. But my paternal grandparents lived a lot closer--we walked there all of the time. And, and my other grandmother, most of the time we drove but theoretically it--now I could walk it. I wouldn't think about walking it then but I walk so much now that it's, it would be nothing for me to walk now. But it was a couple of miles. It was a few miles away. But the, the--my other grandmother was like maybe six to eight blocks away.
Speaker 1: That's your--
Speaker 2: Paternal.
Speaker 1: --paternal grandmother?
Speaker 2: Correct. Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what were their name--the, the pat--
Speaker 2: Ruth, Ruth Macer and Leewood Macer.
Speaker 1: Okay Leewood Macer, okay that's right. So, so and your maternal grandparents' names were the Stamp- they were the Stamp--
Speaker 2: Pauline, Pauline Stamper and her, her maiden name was Austin, and George Stamper.
Story_ID: 672811
Speaker 1: Now, talk about the, the household though you know that you grew up in and what that household was 'cause you're the baby.
Speaker 2: The youngest. (Laughter)
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: And, and--
Speaker 2: --meaning I had to take orders from everybody.
Speaker 1: But what is the age difference? Are--
Speaker 2: It's close. My older sister [Brenda Brown Forrest] is only five years older than me.
Speaker 1: So, stair steps literally (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. Yes. Yes. And, you know it, it makes a difference when you're younger because when I was in elementary school [P.S. 145, Alexander Hamilton Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland] she was in high school. But now obviously it makes no difference. It was, it was--we, we had fun. We engaged in some mischief (laughter), things I can't believe--well, I'll say they did it. But, but it was, it was, it was good. My father [Wilbur Brown], his famous line was--because my sister was always, older sister, always sort of a rebel. She still is. My father had been in the [U.S.] Army so they lived in California, everyone except me. And my mother [Thelma Stamper Brown] said that my sister and moreover all of the wives of the officers, knew my sister because she would go up and down the street, visit and talk and, and--
Speaker 1: Is this your oldest sister?
Speaker 2: Older sister, yes. And my next sister [Carlita Brown White] was always pretty quiet and she is still pretty quiet unless you annoy her too badly. But it was, it was really pretty close. My, my father always said, my sister, I was going back to her being a rebel. She would like to always do things her way and how she wanted to do things. She was very, very, very rebellious. And so, she didn't want to--she wanted to eat when she wanted to eat. She wanted to fix what she wanted to fix. If we were having some kind of meat, she wanted to make a sandwich out of it instead of just having it regular on a plate. And my father would always say, "We all eat together, this is not a restaurant." (Laughter) So, so we ate dinner pretty much every day together and my father's an excellent cook. And we loved especially Sunday dinners because he would cook Sunday dinners and breakfast on the weekends. He would make wonderful break- before I ever heard of Roscoe's [Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles, Los Angeles, California] or Wells [Wells Supper Club, New York, New York] or any of those places, my father was already making fried chicken and pancakes for breakfast growing up. So, so you know it was good. And they were great disciplinarians also. You know you would get in trouble, they believed in corporal punishment.
Story_ID: 672812
Speaker 1: I guess because you're so close you didn't get treated differently. Do your, your siblings say that as the youngest you got treated differently?
Speaker 2: I will tell you what happened, as the youngest there were more rules for me because it's like my parents learned from what they did and imposed more rules on me. I remember (laughter), I shouldn't say this, I remember when it was time for me to start dating, my mother [Thelma Stamper Brown] actually rearranged the furniture in the living room so that the sofa would face outward so that (laughter) so that she could see everything that was going on. It was hysterical. But it was, you know it was--and, and it wasn't as though my sisters [Brenda Brown Forrest and Carlita Brown White] or anything were promiscuous or anything but it was just they got you know, you know a little stricter. And I remember my junior prom was when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed and, and my father--I, I was so excited because my date had a car. He was a freshman at Morgan [Morgan College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] and so I was so happy. And my father [Wilbur Brown] said, "There's no way he's driving you today," so my father drove us to the prom and gave me--you know they had telephone booths back then that were ten cents so he gave me several dimes to call if anything happened you know because there was disturbances going on. And so, the prom ended early because of the riots and we all decided we were going to Jackie Prescott's [ph.] house. I came outside, my father was sitting there waiting (laughter). He was waiting and not only was he waiting, he knew my friends and he was making them get into the car too. It was hilarious (laughter). So--
Speaker 1: But maybe they learned, they were young parents (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, so, so it was, yes he was--yeah he's, he's like, "I'm taking you home," Deborah Burrell. He took Jackie home, then he took me and my date home so it was pretty funny.
Story_ID: 672813
Speaker 1: Now I want to take you back a little earlier and I want to, you know probably around maybe age five and I want you--'cause you're growing up in this household. It doesn't have to be five, five, seven, but, can you describe what sights, smells and sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: I remember my mother [Thelma Stamper Brown] didn't work at that time and my school [P.S. 145, Alexander Hamilton Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland] was directly across the street. Mrs. Sullivan [ph.] was my kindergarten teacher. And I loved going home for lunch, especially on Friday. My mother would make tuna fish and we would have lunch and we would have Utz potato chips and Suburban Club orange soda. It was so good, I loved it, so.
Speaker 1: So, she stayed at home and your father [Wilbur Brown] was a, a truck driver?
Speaker 2: Right. He was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a Teamster [International Brotherhood of Teamsters], worked for B and P Motors [B and P Motor Express]. My mother did work ultimately but I think about fifth grade, she may have had some jobs here and there but after fifth grade she went to work for social security and was, was really working full time.
Speaker 1: So, those are both good jobs really in many ways (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to be with Teamsters--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and then you know working for the government.
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: But, so, let's go back to sights, smells and sounds. So, so that is I would consider a sight. Are there other sights?
Speaker 2: I, I remember one of our favorite places to go after church was Hersheypark [Hershey, Pennsylvania] and it was close. So, we would drive mostly--and my mother's mother [Pauline Austin Stamper] would go with us also, and remember the roller coaster. And, and I look at Hershey now, it's nothing at all like what I remember. I remember doing that. I remember school a lot because I really liked school and I really liked my teachers. It was all segregated of course. And, and, and I remember how close it was because the parents knew the teachers and the principal and you know everybody talked and it was--I remember those things. I remember Mr. Perry [William Perry (ph.)], my fourth grade teacher [at P.S. 145, Alexander Hamilton Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland], wanting me to skip over the fifth grade, said I didn't need it, I wouldn't learn much. My mother said no, that I could not skip over any grades. So, so I went to fifth grade and he was right. I mean the teacher was fine but I don't think I needed fifth grade. And you know I remember just doing my homework. I also remember very clearly how we used to have to stand in line to get shots and I think about that hepatitis thing but from using one--the same needle going down the line. I remember standing in line for that and not being afraid and how terrified I am now of needles. But I, I have you know I remember the dogs that we had. We always had a dog, Poochie [ph.], who died because we didn't know any better, fed him table food and chicken and the splinters. You never give dogs chicken bones because they splinter and they clog their intestines. And then we had Butch [ph.] and then Pudgy [ph.] who was famous (laughter).
Speaker 1: He was famous?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, people used to come and ask, "Can Pudgy come out to play?" (laughter). And when my parents moved, when I started my freshman year in college [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] they moved to the suburbs and the dog walked from there back to where we lived, yeah. Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's pretty amazing. How far was it?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was six, seven miles.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Um-hm, at least.
Story_ID: 672814
Speaker 1: So, I, I want to--so what about smells? Did you have smells from growing up you remember (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, my crabs. My father [Wilbur Brown], we would get like a bushel of crabs, he would cook them himself and he would always let one loose so that we could jump up in the chairs and (laughter). But I remember smelling crabs and, and I also remember the smells because I was so happy I used to eat so much my father used to threaten to send me to work down on the docks. I was so happy when I was the only one left because I got to eat more food (laughter). And my father made the best crab cakes ever and, and I would just really you know Friday nights I would love Friday nights, the smell of the crab cakes and the shrimp and, and then the smell of just the crabs. And we would spread the newspapers out all over the table and--
Speaker 1: Well do, do I remember hearing, I, I mean seeing an interview where you were talking about the crabs even going sideways down the street? Was that--?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Oh okay. Oh, I don't, I--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Maybe I--so, so, so crabs and any other smells? Any other smells?
Speaker 2: I can't think of any, any other smells.
Speaker 1: How about sounds?
Speaker 2: A lot of jazz.
Speaker 1: What kind?
Speaker 2: Oh, what we would call pure jazz like Miles Davis, Horace Silver, Coltrane [John Coltrane], you know and then the vocals--my father preferred and I was close with my father. In fact, my mother [Thelma Stamper Brown] used to threaten to evict both of us from the house and so whatever he liked, I liked (laughter) and including like--which is why I eat oysters on the half shell and have been eating them since I was little, which is why I liked steak tartare which I don't eat it anymore 'cause I don't eat red meat, but now I eat sushi. But it was, it was anything he did, that's what I wanted to do. So, so, he loved jazz. There was a place in Baltimore [Maryland] called the Left Bank Jazz Society on North Avenue where all the big jazz people would come. He would go there every Sunday but I liked the vocalists more so I liked Sarah Vaughan, I liked [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson, I liked Ella Fitzgerald, Dinah Washington, [HistoryMaker] Gloria Lynne. So, those are the sounds that, that I hear, lots and lots and lots of jazz.
Speaker 1: And then in--so you're a daddy's girl essentially is what you're saying? Is that true, or?
Speaker 2: It could be a little true and I really think my oldest sister would have been if she hadn't been so rebellious. My father still gets excited when she comes to visit. I mean he gets real excited. And they still play with each other. I remember we went there, when was it, it wasn't Father's Day, it was some other day and she was driving me and we went there. And my father said, "You can come in Paulette [HistoryMaker Paulette Brown]. Brenda [Brenda Brown Forrest], you have to stay out," you know. And so, they, they ban- they still banter back and forth. And then he, he'll actually close the door in her face. And, and then, then it's just like ah (gesture), you know they get a big laugh out of it. So, but you could say that I guess.
Story_ID: 672815
Speaker 1: Now you, you, when you were talking about your school, your elementary school is P.S.--
Speaker 2: 145 [P.S. 145, Alexander Hamilton Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: --145.
Speaker 2: And it, actually it was 145, but it was Mary Rodman [Mary E. Rodman School] at one point, it was Alexander Hamilton at one point, but it was always 145.
Speaker 1: And it's right across the street?
Speaker 2: Right, directly across the street.
Speaker 1: You know what is amazing to me is how I, I've heard two teachers' names but it seems like you know all your teachers' names?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: By grade?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what were you--is there a teacher that you liked the most of, of those teachers and that influenced you?
Speaker 2: I loved Mrs. Sullivan [ph.] and then I had two Mrs. Jacksons [ph.]. I liked the second grade Mrs. Jackson; and Mr. Perry fourth grade, he was the best, William Perry [ph.]. And then I had some teachers in junior high [Calverton Junior High School; Calverton Elementary Middle School, Baltimore, Maryland]. My homeroom teacher, Rosalie Green [ph.], had her for seventh grade, homeroom and for science in seventh and eighth grade.
Speaker 1: And were you, what were you as a student? What were you like as a student?
Speaker 2: I was a good student. I was probably a, somewhat of a goody two shoes. (Laughter) It's okay and you know one thing whereas my siblings had absolutely no fear of my parents [Thelma Stamper Brown and Wilbur Brown], I was always afraid of getting in trouble. I did not want to be in trouble. I did not want to be out of their good graces ever. So, I, I was very well behaved all of the time. I didn't--in fact I had one friend who joked, "You could be on the [U.S.] Supreme Court, you've never done anything." (Laughter) You know I had never--and it's so interesting because I had never even--although my siblings said--I don't know how they were able to shelter me 'cause I grew up in Baltimore [Maryland] in the city. You know it was not you know especially over time you know the neighborhood changed. It was really--and I had never heard of marijuana until I went to college [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]. And when I came back talking about it, my brother [Wilber Brown] just rolled his eyes at me (laughter) and, and it's like--and, and, and, and no one in college believed I had never heard of it before, but I had never heard of it before.
Story_ID: 672816
Speaker 1: So you're, you're saying that you were Miss, Miss Goody Two Shoes. Were there subjects that you found you had more proficiency in?
Speaker 2: English, English, I really liked. I liked science but I liked the foreign languages too, although I don't speak any of them well. I took about four years of French and about four or five years of Spanish. And--but I loved English and I love social studies is what we called it back then.
Speaker 1: And what did you say--you said Ms., you had two Mr. Jack- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ms. Jackson [ph.].
Speaker 1: (Unclear) You said that the fourth grade teacher had the--
Speaker 2: Was Mr. Perry, William Perry [ph.].
Speaker 1: And he had the most impact.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Why is that?
Speaker 2: He was--he just, it was like he really pushed me and pushed me and pushed me, and easy to talk to, you know. I know my parents [Thelma Stamper Brown and Wilbur Brown] talked to him a lot. But he just really pushed me a lot.
Speaker 1: And I, so in--so when you go to, you know, finish elementary school [P.S. 145, Alexander Hamilton Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland] and go to junior high school, the name of the school was--?
Speaker 2: Calverton [Calverton Junior High School; Calverton Elementary Middle School, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 672817
Speaker 1: Now in the sixth grade, my school didn't have a sixth grade so they bused us to another segregated school for the sixth grade and I had Mrs. Montgomery [ph.].
Speaker 2: So they, they--wait a minute, you're say- oh, because things are still segregated?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So, but--
Speaker 1: Even though Brown, that Brown versus Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] had come and gone this, they were still segregated.
Speaker 2: So how far was, you said Cal- how far was it away, the busing?
Speaker 1: The busing was, hm. it was on the other side of town so it was on Pennsylvania Avenue off of North Avenue so it was about a thirty minute bus ride.
Speaker 2: Do you remember that school?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, 122 [P.S. 122, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 122.
Speaker 2: Okay, so 147 [sic.] to 122.
Speaker 1: 145 [P.S. 145, Alexander Hamilton Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: One forty--okay sorry.
Speaker 1: 145 and 122. And you know there was kids who had gone to school there all along. And Pennsylvania Avenue was a notorious street. That's where the Royal Theatre [Baltimore, Maryland] was. I don't know if you ever heard of it but it was where a lot of people like Patti LaBelle, Billie Holiday. And it was also a very difficult neighborhood, so.
Speaker 2: So was that hard, that adjustment for that year?
Speaker 1: (Shakes head).
Speaker 2: No it wasn't?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay. But all your friends got bused?
Speaker 1: Yes, everybody (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --was bused.
Speaker 2: So then you--but that ends your Friday afternoon--
Speaker 1: Well my mother [Thelma Stamper Brown] by then also was working um-hm, yeah, so yeah.
Speaker 2: Now what had--so in, in junior high can you talk about that--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --the junior high? So, it's seventh to ninth?
Speaker 1: Correct.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, I was in some experimental group so all of us stayed together.
Speaker 2: Were you tracked?
Speaker 1: Probably. I didn't know about tracking back then. But all of us stayed together from seventh through nine, except for foreign language, and home economics, and shop. But otherwise, we stayed together all three years; and we had--they didn't have advanced placement back in those days that I know about anyway because this was still an all-black school. And it had four different units. It was a new school. It was pretty big. It was called Calverton Junior High School [Calverton Elementary Middle School, Baltimore, Maryland] and, and we were expected to do well I guess. And, and I believe most of the people who I went to junior high school with did go to college and so I remember them a lot more than I remember people from high school.
Speaker 2: And are any of those you're still in touch with at that junior high or would--it's more high school then (unclear)?
Speaker 1: No, I'm not in touch with anyone from high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I do know where some of them are, even though I'm not in touch with them, I do know where some of them are.
Speaker 2: Okay. And so you, you know that--junior high you know kids are just, they're becoming you know--
Speaker 1: And they're mean (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's true, they are mean. So, were they mean to you?
Speaker 1: Sometimes, but you find out every flaw that you have when you're in junior high school. And, and you, and, and you find out every flaw that people think that other people have when you're in junior high school. So yeah, I find that junior high school people are at their cruelest.
Speaker 2: And were, when you say segregated, were any of the teachers, were all the teachers black?
Speaker 1: Every one.
Speaker 2: So, this is essentially in this part of your life you know up in--and, and are you saying that's also the case when you go to Northwest High--?
Speaker 1: No. Northwestern [Northwestern High School, Baltimore, Maryland], no. All the teachers were white.
Speaker 2: They were all--
Speaker 1: Except for my algebra teacher, Mrs. Coleman [ph.].
Speaker 2: So, at this point in time you are around, you're in a totally black world.
Speaker 1: Correct (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 672818
Speaker 1: And I want to ask about, 'cause you had mentioned church, what church, what denomination or which church did you grow up in?
Speaker 2: I grew up Baptist. Wayland Baptist Church [Baltimore, Maryland] is--Reverend Payne [William W. Payne] was the, the church where I grew up.
Speaker 1: So when you think of church, what song comes to you?
Speaker 2: Well, I know my grandmother's favorite song and I like it too is: He's sweet I know, storm clouds may rise.  I love that song, but I also, from recent time from--I, I switched to A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal], which you, you may know it's not really that much--it's basically (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Difference.
Speaker 2: --the same, yes. But you know there, there are other songs that they sang that I really love, more of--
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: Like, 'God Is,' is the joy, He's the strength of my life. And I like, order my steps in your word ['Order My Steps'], um-hm, which is what I say every day (laughter). But, but I--those, those are probably my favorites, but 'He's Sweet, I Know' is--I, I love that song (unclear).
Speaker 1: Now were you a strict church going family?
Speaker 2: Pretty much, especially--my mother's [Thelma Stamper Brown] theory was if you went out on Saturday night, you definitely had to get up and go to church on Sunday. Yes, if you can party all night you can go to church on Sunday. So, so yeah we were pretty much strict churchgoers.
Story_ID: 672819
Speaker 1: So when you went to Northwestern High School [Baltimore, Maryland], so I want to go back to that because, you know, it's a--you're, you're talking about a segregated all- you know white world, which you know a lot of times like even recently when people saw the riots--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, they were, you know I think there was attention that it's still very segregated--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in that way. But so, when you go to Northwestern is this, is North- what is Northwestern at that time?
Speaker 2: It's a brand new school with all the bells and whistles, tennis court, swimming pools, oh yeah. Right on the edge of a suburb called Pikesville [Maryland]. Baltimore [Maryland], you know, Baltimore City is not in any county. Baltimore County [Maryland] surrounds Baltimore City and then the county has several different little towns. So Pikesville, it's right on the edge of Pikesville, a huge Jewish community. So, my school was probably 80 to 85 percent Jewish. And, and the superintendent's [Laurence G. Paquin] children were going to that school. I was headed to Western [Western High School, Baltimore, Maryland] before, all-girls school, until they opened Northwestern, and it just you know it had all the bells and whistles. It's, was supposed--the superintendent's children were going to that school, so I figured it should be a good school to go to.
Speaker 1: So, how did you get to that school then? That's how--was that the track that everyone was on or was it this--so can you explain--
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) So, so the boys went to City and Poly, which were the all-boys schools, pretty much that's where they went. And a lot of the girls they went a lot of different places but the boys they were really tracked to City and Poly, which were the two best schools for boys in the city, depends on which sports you wanted to play, you know. If you wanted to play football you went to City. You wanted to be more, more, more academic, you went to Poly. And it's interesting because City was called City College [Baltimore City College, Baltimore, Maryland] and Poly was Polytechnic Institute [Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, Baltimore, Maryland], and they were high schools. So--but then the girls schools were Eastern [Eastern High School, Baltimore, Maryland] and Western. Supposedly the really smart girls went to Western, right.
Speaker 1: And, but then Northwestern opened up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: And that opened up--so, you didn't have to be with any certain geographic (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, you could go to any school you wanted to go to, any school. There were fifteen high schools in Baltimore at the time and you could go to any school you wanted to go to.
Speaker 1: And there was no lottery or anything like that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no.
Speaker 1: And so, tell me your experience there.
Speaker 2: It was, it was different. The, the, the--I had an English teacher, and I thought she was probably the only caring teacher that I had. And I, I don't remember most of their, any of their names. I remember my guidance counselor. I had twins who were in my class who said they were going to Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island], and, you know, I didn't, you know, my parents [Thelma Stamper Brown and Wilbur Brown] didn't go to college. My siblings [Brenda Brown Forrest, Carlita Brown White, Wilbur Brown] didn't go to college. And so I was sort of kind of out there on my own trying to figure out. So, I said--I looked it up. I said this looks like a good school so I said that I would go to Brown as well. My counselor said, "No, that's not a good choice for you." His name was Lockman [ph.]. I won't forget him either, because he, he, he told me that wasn't a good choice. I said, "Well So and So, Jennifer [ph.] and, I for- and Jan [ph.], they're going to Brown." He said, "That's different. You, you don't need to go there." So, I, I ended up going to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], which I'm very happy I did. I got a wonderful education there. But you know those are the things--it's, it's almost--I know that I did some political things with student government. Never wanted to run for office but ran several people's campaigns. And--
Speaker 1: In high school?
Speaker 2: In high school. You know, there was a lot of black power conversation then, but then we were so few that, that, you know, a lot of progress wasn't made on that front.
Speaker 1: Well, you know what I want, I just would like to talk about this a little bit more because, you know, you're in an all-black environment. You get, you select in, there's a lot of pride at this point--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of being the first or, you know, being able to sort of move up.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What is the environment you're going into is what I'm, you know because I know that te--you know, you had talked about the guidance counselor I've heard--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, in interviews you've talked about that, you know, that--which is always that bad guidance counselor.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They exist today.
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 672820
Speaker 1: I want to just understand, you know, how that was for you at that time and who are the kids that are befriending you, who are not, you know, what, what is the transition period, and what are you talking about both at school and outside, because there's a lot of turmoil going on?
Speaker 2: Right, there is a lot of turmoil. In fact my English teacher, she's the one, you know, she on the other hand asked me, was I sure I wanted to go to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], because Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] was there, H. Rap Brown [Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin]. She said, "Are you sure you want to do that?" You know because--she was encouraging me the other way whereas the guidance counselor was encouraging me, "No, these other schools basically are too good for you." But she was encouraging me the other way. She was concerned that, one, that I would be safe, because there was so much going on in the late '60s [1960s]. And, but, you know, other than her, most of the teachers did not talk to me about anything like that. I had a lot of Jewish people who I was very friendly with, and they were very welcoming. And, and then I had a group of young ladies who I was also very friendly with, like I mentioned Jackie Prescott [ph.], Deborah Burrell. Deborah Burrell ended up going to Howard also. And, you know, we did some extracurricular activities. You know they, there were no black cheerleaders. I remember when Loretta Spivey [ph.] got selected to be a cheerleader, it was the biggest deal ever because they did not want any black cheerleaders at school. And so, you know, it was, it was interesting. There was the--pretty much the students didn't create tension. The teachers more or less created any type of tension that may have existed. And that's why I think all of this stuff is learned behavior because the--you know I got along really well. I remember Susie Cohen [ph.] and I were pretty tight. She helped me with algebra two and trigonometry and, and, you know, there was, there was a general openness. I, I, I think we've had like one or two reunions. I've only known about one, the tenth one, and I went back to it. It was, it was fine, it was fun. But nothing special-special about high school [Northwestern High School, Baltimore, Maryland] at all (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, you know the other time, 'cause you're talking about--I want to talk a little bit about the riots, you know also, because, you know, when, when the riots happened just recently I went in our archive and I was looking up Baltimore [Maryland]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, 1968, and there were, you know, there were lots of stories about the riots. So I want to know your experience. You know, you talked about the prom--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --being a little after, but I want to--
Speaker 2: I don't--remember I said that I was very sheltered. I was not--unh-uh, nowhere near it. Nowhere near it. Nowhere near it.
Speaker 1: So, you didn't even experience, nowhere--
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: What about TV?
Speaker 2: TV, yes I saw it on TV. That's pretty much it. And, you know, when people are hanging out the black things on their houses so that people would know black people lived there, so that they wouldn't bother them, we--I remember asking my father [Wilbur Brown], was he going to put the black thing (laughter)--I can't repeat what he said (laughter). But the answer was basically, "No and I dare them to come near here" (laughter). He'll give them something to think about pretty much. So, but no, no I didn't.
Speaker 1: Well, so what are your parents' messaging? What are their messaging about the Civil Rights Movement, 'cause--?
Speaker 2: You know, first of all my, my mother [Thelma Stamper Brown] very, very, very community service oriented and, you know, the--you know, we talked a lot about Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] at home and in school and his principles, the nonviolence part and, and, and how important service was in giving back to other people. That's kind of what the messaging was with regard to--and, and to stand up for what you believe in and don't back down. Don't ever back down in terms of what you believe in, especially if you know you're right. And, and, and, it's a, it's a good position, the correct position to be with. Don't, don't back down, you know. Speak your mind. Say again what you believe is the truth and don't be afraid. And that's kind of what, you know, the lessons from that were.
Story_ID: 672821
Speaker 1: So you graduate in what, 19--
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 1: --sixty-nine [1969]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. And, and you--how do you decide that you're applying to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] though? That's--is it because your other friend was going, or?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't--no, not at all. It was because the counselor sort of pushed me to that, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, that was a coun- okay, okay, I see (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. And do you--
Speaker 2: And I, I read about Howard too and I knew I didn't want to go to Morgan [Morgan College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] because I, I didn't want to stay at home. I was ready to go.
Speaker 1: And so describe the Howard you come into.
Speaker 2: Very interesting the first year, very interesting. It's, it's--because H. Rap Brown [Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin] is still around. There's so much black power. I'm like, excited. (Laughter) I am so excited. And it's just, you know, everybody is positive. It seemed everybody was positive, everybody was super smart. And, it was more downplaying, I guess, of the bourgeois-ness (gesture) that Howard had been known for. And, you know, everybody wanted to be (air quotes) relevant and, and involved in the, in the movement and, and doing things to help other, other people. You know, we all had the free Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton] posters. And, and then it was also a very close knit environment and a very strict environment. So, you know, you still had dorm mothers back then, and if you say you were going home for the weekend they would call your parents to see if you were really going home for the weekend. And, and, and there was a lot of rebellion. So, before the end of the year was over, you know, the coed visitation rules had changed. A lot of things had changed. Lots of rebellions. There was a sit-in my sophomore year. And I remember my mother [Thelma Stamper Brown] saying, "You can sit-in all you want but your grades better not change" (laughter). Same thing when I pledged. So, it was--but I loved Howard so much. It, it, it made me grow and mature in so many ways to be around so many positive people who had come from real strong family backgrounds. You know, people had been exposed to things that I never knew about. I am still very close to my roommates from college. They'll be here this weekend too. And you just developed relationships. And there was always an expectation, nobody ever said it, but that you would get a degree beyond your undergraduate degree. And I also thought that I was a great writer, that I was good in English until freshman English, and she told me my writing--her name was Professor--Mrs. Powell [ph.]. She said my writing was sophomoric. (Laughter) I was, I was stunned, but that never happened again. I ended up with a B plus in her class. But, but, and as a result I am so strict about English now. But I really thought that I was so good, and she just killed me. But it was a good lesson. And there are so many things--there was so much positive energy around at Howard. People had high expectations of you and so--and I'm always a believer that when people rise to whatever expectations or they go down to whatever expectations, so.
Speaker 1: So, was there tension between the administration and the student body during this activism 'cause--is James--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --[HistoryMaker] James Cheek--
Speaker 2: Cheek, he came afterwards, and so he was like the one who sort of brought calm.
Speaker 1: So, who was before him?
Speaker 2: Nesbit [sic. James M. Nabrit, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Nesbit, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause he was way more conserv- right?
Speaker 2: Right, yes. So, but Cheek, when he came, he was considered young at the time and energetic, and he's the one who sort of brought calm to the situation.
Speaker 1: And so you're not--so who--what, what, what is your major?
Speaker 2: Political science (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 672822
Speaker 1: So this is, so is, is it the activism of the time that what, wants you to, encourages you to think about a major in political science?
Speaker 2: No. I went to school thinking that I was going to be a social worker, and so I was going to major in sociology. I still ended up minor- having a minor in sociology. But my roommates--who got to be my roommates by pure accident. I had requested a double room. They put me in a single room in Bethune [Mary M. Bethune Annex], which I didn't--
Speaker 1: And, and this is what year?
Speaker 2: Freshman year.
Speaker 1: Freshman year?
Speaker 2: Freshman year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I thought--I'm like I don't want to be in a single room. This is my first time. I don't want to be in a single room, but I didn't realize it was a single room among a suite. There were suites. It's a new dorm. But by then I said no, I don't want to do that. So they put me in a triple room with Charlene and Peggy. They had space in their room, because Alice [ph.] didn't get her financial aid in time, so she couldn't come. She was--and Alice, I know Alice now. She reminds me of that all the time, how I took her space in the room. So, so that's how I ended up in the triple room with them. And then after first year we stayed on the same floor. We stayed in the same dorm the whole time. I moved in a double room with Debbie Tate [ph.]. And Charlene and Peggy stayed in the room together. Then I moved to a single room, and Charlene and Peggy stayed in the same room the rest of the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, and Charlene and Peggy's last names are what?
Speaker 2: Charlene Toussaint [ph.] and Peggy's name was Johnson. It's now Armstrong [Peggy Johnson Armstrong (ph.)].
Speaker 1: Okay. And they became your, your, your good friends?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were from New Orleans [Louisiana]. And so, like, Thanksgiving, it was too short of a holiday for them to go home, so they would always come home with me because I lived in Baltimore [Maryland]. My father [Wilbur Brown] would come and pick us up. And, you know, they would come Easter and, and, you know, all of the like, short holidays, so.
Speaker 1: And they--were they the ones who then were encouraging--so that's--we were talk (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They knew, they came to college knowing they were going to law school. And so yeah, so they were very encouraging in that regard. And then Judy Dimes [Judy Dimes Smith]--there was another woman from New Orleans, Aytha Reyo [ph.]. Her sister was the law librarian at Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], which was on main campus then. So, and they, Charlene and Peggy already knew her too. So, they were all very encouraging. Aytha did not really have interested, interest in going to law school. But she has been like a paralegal at Holland and Knight [Holland and Knight LLP] for a long time. Interesting. Peggy did not go to law school. She got married and--but she still got an advanced degree, and has worked, worked for the [U.S.] Department of Education a long time. And now she's at HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]. So--
Speaker 1: That's Peggy and then what about--
Speaker 2: Charlene?
Speaker 1: --Charlene?
Speaker 2: So, Charlene worked at what was HEW [U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]. We all worked there. And Charlene worked there undergrad [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]. All of us did. Peggy too, but they worked there longer. And then Charlene continued to work there while she was in law school, and worked there after. She just moved like from whatever she was doing to the Office of the General Counsel once she got out of law school and retired from there. So, she had worked there from like '71 [1971], 1971 from when we were in, at undergraduate school.
Speaker 1: So had they known each other in New Orleans or they--?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, they knew each other in New Orleans. Yeah they went to high school together.
Speaker 1: And why did they went to be lawyers? Was it the people they were exposed to, or were there anyone in their families?
Speaker 2: No, no, definitely no one in their families, no one in their families. They, in their high school, they were taught the--the kind of history they were taught, they were taught a lot more. They were taught a lot about the Civil Rights Act [Civil Rights Act of 1964], the Civil Rights Movement, you know, in a more detailed way than--I didn't get any of that in high school [Northwestern High School, Baltimore, Maryland], none of it. And, and they knew about lawyers that I didn't know about and what they had done to--during the Civil Rights Movement to, you know, the role of lawyers and, you know, how involved they were in, in the Civil Rights Movement. And, you know, they knew, you know, about the, the background story on the things that Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] had done and all of those things that I have to say I didn't know about. So, so they gave me a good education in that regard.
Story_ID: 672823
Speaker 1: And so that opened your eyes. Now, what is the relationship between--how much exposure are you having with the law school with--and the teachers at the law school or the law school students?
Speaker 2: Okay, so it's interesting, because the law school is on main campus at that time, and so a lot of the people who had graduated from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] are teaching the political science courses. And it's just wonderful (laughter). So, you have a lot of exposure to the people in the law school as well as recent graduates from the law school, and you learn about other people who had graduated from the law school and what they're doing. But, I have to tell you that even after that I learned even more once I joined the National Bar Association.
Speaker 1: Now do we know any of the names that were teaching your political science courses?
Speaker 2: Probably not, no, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay. So, you grad--so, what are you doing summers, working summers, 'cause you said you worked at HEW [U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]? Is that, is that during the summers?
Speaker 2: During the summer. So, I worked at--the first summer, I worked at Montgomery Ward in the office. And then I worked at the [U.S.] Government Printing Office [U.S. Government Publishing Office], and then I got a great opportunity at HEW to work in the office of the secretary. Of course Charlene [Charlene Toussaint (ph.)] and Peggy [Peggy Johnson Armstrong (ph.)], they made fun of me. They said, "Oh you're up on the fifth floor." So, I worked in the office of the secretary, my, the last summer and also my entire last year in college. Frank Carlucci [sic.] was the--
Speaker 1: Oh was the--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --was--right. He was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That, that is during which adminis- that's--
Speaker 2: Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon].
Speaker 1: Nixon.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The Nixon administration.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, so you graduate. Do you--you're gonna go straight on?
Speaker 2: To law school.
Speaker 1: To law school.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 672824
Speaker 1: So, let's talk about the application process too, because you also have told a story that when--so first let's, let's talk about the application process. Where--how is it, how are you deciding where you're gonna apply?
Speaker 2: Do I have to tell? Okay, so I--you said yes, I have to tell. So I did apply to Howard [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], and I knew I did not want to go to University of Maryland [University of Maryland School of Law; University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, Baltimore] because I did not want to live at home, because I didn't think my parents [Thelma Stamper Brown and Wilbur Brown] would understand what was necessary, that I had to study, that I could not do all the household chores and all of those other things, that I had to study. My father couldn't understand why I would not go to University of Maryland, but that was the reason why. But I knew someone who I was sort of dating who (laughter) went to Seton Hall. So that's why I applied to Seton Hall. I don't tell people that. And, and Howard, I just felt that I needed a change (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, he was a lawyer?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: He was a law student?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh! Wait--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh he was going to Seton?
Speaker 2: Undergrad.
Speaker 1: Undergrad, okay.
Speaker 2: Lived in New Jersey, but from Baltimore [Maryland]. And so, so that's, that's how I even knew about Seton Hall law school [Seton Hall University School of Law, Newark, New Jersey]. And then at the end of the day, they paid my entire way.
Speaker 1: Right, you got, you got a full ride?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, but when you, you were, you, you tell the story of someone also discouraging you so is that what--
Speaker 2: Oh, that was at HEW.
Speaker 1: HEW--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, Janine Connelly [ph.], I think--no, her last name wasn't Connelly. Her name was Janine though. And she said--they were giving me a nice party to go away. She told me don't feel badly when I flunk out my first year. That's what she said to me. And said it like it was just nothing.
Speaker 1: But were there other people going at that point in time off to professional careers and, you know, that were in that group at HEW?
Speaker 2: Not in my section, because I was like the only student. The other people were career people.
Speaker 1: And what was her role in that office?
Speaker 2: She worked in the legislative office of HEW. She was like second, not--she wasn't an undersecretary. She was an assistant, yeah.
Story_ID: 672825
Speaker 1: I just wanted to go back a little bit and talk about your work, you know, serving as the class president--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for your junior year, right?
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It was a good experience. It's so interesting because Elijah Cummings and I joke about the fights we had, you know, with regard to student government, because in senior year he ended up being the president of the whole student government, and what was his position when I was the president in junior class? We, we locked horns so much.
Speaker 1: On what issues?
Speaker 2: Anything. Who was in charge, that you know the men had to be in charge, you know, which direction the student government should go to, which issues we should--which were more important and more germane. You know, he and I joke about that now a lot, because obviously he's the real politician and the one, my mother [Thelma Stamper Brown] loves him as her congress person. And, and he is very good and very effective. And--but back then oh we, we were arguing all of the time about which positions to take, because I think that although I was the president of the junior class, he had some higher position in overall student government, and he did ultimately become--but it was, it was, you know, you know, when I think back on it, as many fights as we had about which positions to take, I think we were probably, probably saying close to the same thing. It's just that both of us were stubborn and really wanted the same result, what was best for the students, and, and being (air quotes) relevant, and, and sticking to you know who we should be as, as, as a people and as students at, at an institution like Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: So, now in this poster there is you and Darryl Gaines [ph.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Gaines, right.
Speaker 1: Right. So, how does the election work there? So each class has a class--
Speaker 2: Yes, election.
Speaker 1: --class president?
Speaker 2: Yes, each class--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --has a class president. And I did not run for senior class president. I don't know why I didn't, but I didn't run for senior class president.
Speaker 1: Did you run for a sophomore class president?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, just--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and what is your role when you're class president? What--
Speaker 2: Well, you become the spokesperson for, you know, the junior class. You attend like the government, the student, overall student government meetings, not so much interaction with the administration so much, although there is some, but it's the person who's like the overall student government person that has more interaction with the administration. So, so I know that there's a filtering process, probably which is where the arguments came from, me and Elijah. And, and, and, you know, how I wanted things to, to be for the class. But it's, it's a representative of the class, government representative of the class.
Story_ID: 672826
Speaker 1: Now, you know, you just came out with that name, Elijah Cummings. Who else was in school with you that we might know, that was there around that same time? 'Cause this is, this is the late, well late '70s [1970s] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Do you know Renee Higginbotham [Renee Higginbotham-Brooks]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes, she was in my class. I saw her last week. You know Debbie Allen was there. [HistoryMaker] Phylicia Rashad was apparently there, don't ever remember her from Howard. But Debbie Allen, remember 'Fame'? How she danced around? That's--she used to dance around the yard like that. So, it was, you know, I mean she was very friendly. Who else was there who you might know? [HistoryMaker] Donald Byrd was one of my instructors. Oh, Walt Frazier's sisters graduated with me. I don't know, I, I, I'm--
Speaker 1: Well you know when, when you talk about this, you think about how leadership has you know fomented out of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: --of this, you know this institution that we, you know we, we know as Howard University [Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: But there's a lot, there are a lot on the faculty there--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and there're also the people would be, you know, who would become future--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --future leaders. And I--what, what--you know, because the university has gone, you know, more recently it had some down--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, downturn even with the, the student body and things like that. But at this point this is viewed as the important years of the org- you know of the, of the institution is--isn't it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, but--
Speaker 2: I--you talking about currently and--at Howard?
Speaker 1: I'm talking about currently versus the time you were there, the difference?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think, well we--they've got new leadership at Howard at the moment. We are very happy and encouraged. And even now you see a different level of communication, different--I had the, I had lunch last week with, with the dean of How- we were talking about how great the new president [HistoryMaker Dr. Wayne A. I. Frederick] is. And they did something that I'd never seen before. There were some students who were about to graduate who didn't have the money to finish, you know, to get their degree, and they gave the list of people where they were from, what their major was, and asked alumni to contribute to help them pay off whatever they owed so that they could graduate. I didn't even get to pay off the person I picked, because it was such an overwhelming success. Everyone's debt was paid. And I'd--I'm like I didn't even get to pay my--because somebody beat me to it. And I thought I was pretty quick on the draw but, I mean, that was just--I thought that was such a wonderful idea. And, you know, and one maybe we can do it on the front end as well at this point. But it was really good to know that so many alumni were just so quick to say yes, and for the president to think of such a clever idea to, to do that I, I, I'm very encouraged.
Speaker 1: Okay. But the--now I was trying to also talk about though the Howard that you went to, you know, because this, this--these are a lot, there's a lot of activity. The organ- the, the institution is becoming more activist focused.
Speaker 2: Yes. And actually--
Speaker 1: It had been very conservative before then.
Speaker 2: Exactly, but they were activist when I went there too. And then there was a period when they were conservative, and I think that had a lot to do with--because, you know, they get government funding and so forth, and I think that that has some role in it as well. And it was a period--and now, you know, with, with, you know, with all that's going on, they have been becoming a lot more activist. And so it's like almost like when I was going there, and it's like it's come full circle in, in a lot of regards. And, you know, there's a higher level of student interest and understanding that you can get a great education and be an activist and stay true to what you believe in at the same time. That they are not inconsistent.
Story_ID: 672827
Speaker 1: So you graduate, you get accepted, you get, you get an accepted seat, and you graduate. You follow your heart and go to Seton [Seton Hall University School of Law, Newark, New Jersey], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And tell me what Seton--well, first of all, this is New Jersey.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So it's different from--you know, you've spent your, your time up to this point in the southeast part of the United States.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So what is that, what is the institution that you come into?
Speaker 2: It is not--and it was just, it was New Jersey too. It was, it was, you know, I had never been anywhere where you, where you couldn't just stop by to see someone. You had to call first in New Jersey. You couldn't just, couldn't just go by to see someone. But, you know, it was, it was different. You know, expectations were low when I got there. You know, there was again that expectation that you wouldn't do well, and even they had convinced some of the black students that that should be their expectation of themselves. It's called stereotype threat, where people tell you that there are low expectations and you start believing it. And so many of the students were on academic probation when I got there. And, and coming from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], I never had that expectation that I wouldn't do well. So--and my, after my first year people even said, "How is it that you are not on academic probation?" It's very strange.
Speaker 1: When you say people, are you talking about faculty? Or--
Speaker 2: No, I'm talking about black students.
Speaker 1: --other black students?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, can you talk about how large the--how large the law school was overall, and each class, and--?
Speaker 2: I guess we had about, they had, we had three sections.
Speaker 1: And how large were each section?
Speaker 2: Each section was about forty or fifty people. So class size was, must have been bigger than that. That part is kind of a blur. There, there were over two hundred who graduated with me and eight were black, four from the day class, four from the evening class.
Speaker 1: So sma- okay--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --small.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're saying out of those eight, everybody was on academic probation?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, or major--or the majority? Four?
Speaker 2: Most of them didn't graduate. So, so, so the, so they would have been ahead of me, the ones who were asking me that question. They would have been ahead of me. So, some of them did graduate. (Shakes head) Most of them did not.
Story_ID: 672828
Speaker 1: And who are you--so, how are the professors and the instruction and all of that? Because you're coming from an all-black environ--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, environment to a majority white environment.
Speaker 2: Some of them were okay. Some of them I, I thought were not good at all. And I can't believe that some of them are still teaching. I won't call their names. I found that, now, one person I had for something that people have such a hard time is real property, you know, the rule against perpetuities and all that stuff, Robert Diab. He was outstanding, really good, very patient, made sure you learned what it was that you were going to learn. Then the commercial paper, Sklar [ph.]. He was--I remember the ones who were good. I remember the ones who were extra bad too. But, you know, he made sure that you really learned. I felt that there was no bias in anything that either one of them did. They were only interested in knowing that you were learning the materials that you should be learning, and they graded you accordingly. I think that there were some other teachers who were absolutely biased and, and you know, one teacher who--we had the CLEO Program [Council on Legal Education Opportunity] at Seton Hall [Seton Hall University School of Law, Newark, New Jersey] a couple years. And, you know, one, one professor, I remember what he did. He--you had to walk through the faculty lounge to get to the other side, other side of the building. And one day he just sort of laid his wallet out on the table. I think he was trying to hope some, one of the CLEO students would take it. And I, I threw a hissy fit, because it was, it was, it was calculated. I knew it was. I--and I knew he had intentionally left it there, the way he left it, not just on the table folded, but it was opened up with, like, credit cards sort of sticking out, you know. So, I, I fig- I just knew it was calculated to try to get one of the students, the CLEO students to take it so that he could make a complaint.
Speaker 1: So, I'm trying to just understand with those small of numbers, you know, what your support system is, you know, because you're the first one in your family--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, going to law school. You said, well let's see, was--did you say there was another student from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] at Seton with you?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were, in fact it was very interesting. There were a couple of people--no, they weren't in my class. They were there when I got there.
Speaker 1: Okay (unclear).
Speaker 2: And there were a few people who had gone to Howard undergraduate school. And I think they actually took more people from Howard than they did from their own undergraduate school, Seton Hall did, in terms of, you know, African Americans. And, and, and I only speak in terms of African Americans, because you did not see Hispanics. You did not see Asians.
Speaker 1: Right, at that point in time.
Speaker 2: At that point in time, yes.
Speaker 1: And, and this is nineteen eight- (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, '70 [1970], '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Seventy-three [1973], okay.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Story_ID: 672829
Speaker 1: Yeah, so John Herbert [John T. Herbert] had gone to Howard [Howard University, Baltimore, Maryland], and I know him best because there was a BALSA [Black American Law Students Association; National Black Law Students Association] election almost right after I got there. And the men decided that--somebody had stepped down, and the men decided who was going to replace each person. It wasn't a real election and I'm like, "How does that work?" (Laughter) I said, "That can't work that way." And so there was, in fact, there was Irene Jones [Irene Jones Cates] and Moonyene Jackson [Moonyene Jackson-Amis] and so Irene, Moonyene, so they changed my name to Pauline [ph.] so that it would all rhyme. And we created quite a disturbance at that election. And I became the vice president of BALSA my freshman year, because (shakes head) no. But that's how I know John Herbert, because he was leading the elections. He had gone to Howard. He should have known better. He should have known that wasn't going to fly coming from Howard. So--but anyway, but yes, and then he and I became good friends after that.  And it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, and--
Speaker 1: We're still friends, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so what--I'm just--how many total black students are there at, in the whole school?
Speaker 1: Not a lot.
Speaker 2: That's, I mean if you're talking--
Speaker 1: So, in my section (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) what, twenty?
Speaker 1: --in my section for example there were two of us. And, and there were some, but most of them were white guys. And yeah, yeah, very few.
Speaker 2: So, when you say you had a BALSA chapter, how large was the chapter? Are you talking--
Speaker 1: Well see they had the evening students. There were more students in the evening class and they were four year, so they had been there. You know, some, some who were there when--and the BALSA, it wasn't that big. But, you had, when you think about four years of classes, then you have three year. So even though there weren't a lot, especially not in the day school, they were mostly in the, in the evening school. So, there were, there were, there were you know, more, not a lot, but more.
Speaker 2: Okay. Now, at that point where--are you aware or going at all during this time to the national BALSA conventions? Are you in contact with other BALSA students and other chapters?
Speaker 1: Only locally like, Rutgers [Rutgers Law School, Newark, New Jersey] and some New York chapters. I did not travel. I was never on an airplane until I graduated from law school. So, others went. I don't know why I didn't go. And I think about how the young people are now, how they go to things, how they are involved and participate. It's, it's, it's great but I, I did not.
Speaker 2: So, I mean, but BALSA was created in what year? Was it--
Speaker 1: It was A. J. Cooper [HistoryMaker A. J. Cooper, Jr.] started BALSA.
Speaker 2: Right, A--A. J. Cooper.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. And, and then Art Martin [Arthur Martin]. So that was--they are--oh, I want to say it was in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: But BALSA wasn't that old by the time.
Speaker 1: Oh no. Oh no, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You're--that's what I--
Speaker 1: BALSA was not old, no. It was not old.
Speaker 2: --that's what, that's what I'm trying to, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'm trying to think of Bob Pickett [Robert T. Pickett, Jr.]. I'm sixty-four (pause). Maybe, like, four years or so before, four or five years. No, it was not old at all.
Speaker 2: So, what are the things that your BALSA chapter's doing though, or the thing--or is it the concerns about the things going on around the country, or is it how you know the things going on within the law school?
Speaker 1: Things going on within the law school and some things that are going on around the country. It was an opportunity to get also ideas from other schools as to what they were doing, how their students were surviving in law school and that sort of thing. And also, you know, checking in with the students to see, at locally, to see how they were doing and talking to the administration about things that should be changed.
Story_ID: 672830
Speaker 1: Now, are you at all, while you're at Seton [Seton Hall University School of Law, Newark, New Jersey] during those three, three years, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, are you at all becoming aware of what's happening with New Jersey politics and the, you know, the area? Or is it more focused on getting--'cause law school can be, it's demanding.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, I'm just trying to figure out what--?
Speaker 2: So, I was familiar with, very familiar with Newark [New Jersey] politics. Ken Gibson [HistoryMaker Kenneth Gibson] was the mayor, and, and I was fortunate enough to get an internship with the Mayor's Policy and Development Office when I, really after a month or so of being in law school. I, I always liked to have my own money, so I signed up to substitute. So, I substitute taught for a couple of days, and I don't know how I knew to reach out to Jerry Harris [ph.] about some work in the Mayor's Policy and Development Office. And they actually created the internship for me. So I--and it was very flexible. And I could walk back and forth to law school to, and, and to the mayor's office. So, I knew a lot about what was going on in Newark and so forth, but not so much beyond Newark.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Even though I didn't live in Newark. I lived in, in East Orange [New Jersey] at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay. And by that time--'cause he got elected in, let's see, what year?
Speaker 2: Before I got there in the '60s [1960s], yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Be--right in the, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I thought it was '71 [1971] or '70 [1970] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It may have been '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: Seventy [1970], 1970.
Speaker 2: Exactly, because one of my good friends was from New Jersey, and I remember when he was elected. I was at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] when he was elected, yes.
Speaker 1: So he's sort of halfway through his administration at that point?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, right 'cause then the 19--and so--no, no, not halfway 'cause you're 1973.
Speaker 2: Right, but he was elected two terms.
Speaker 1: Right, so--okay, right, right. So, you--so what are you learning in that off- well first of all, you're--how many hours are you working?
Speaker 2: About twenty hours.
Speaker 1: Twenty hours. But you're going to, you're--
Speaker 2: Law school.
Speaker 1: That's a lot, okay. (Laughter) I was barely able to--okay.
Speaker 2: Huh, what?
Speaker 1: I was barely able, I don't know, I couldn't see working. I found it a little--you know, just because it was the first thing a lot of things you've never heard before--
Speaker 2: Exactly. And--
Speaker 1: --terms.
Speaker 2: --and I guess I was so ignorant about all of it, that I didn't know that I should not have been working, probably. But I didn't do a whole lot of socializing either. I did some of the parties on the weekend. There were a lot of law students who lived in my apartment building too and a lot of--most of them went to Rutgers [Rutgers Law School, Newark, New Jersey], but they were upper class people. And so I got a lot from them also. And still talk to them, especially Sheryl and Lois, who were very helpful, great mentors to me when I was in law school.
Speaker 1: Okay. And are these other black students?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, Sheryl and Lois--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Sheryl Portee and [HistoryMaker] Lois Wright.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They lived on the sixth floor in my building. And they were, they were--I, I turned to them a lot when I had questions.
Speaker 1: So, so, there really is a support network among the black students (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, even--
Speaker 2: Even though they went to a different school. They were at Rutgers.
Speaker 1: Oh, they were at Rutgers, okay, okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: But, so, so you're, what are you learning in the mayor's office? What are you learning about Newark politics and what's going on?
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm learning a lot about how they developed policies, how they decide what they're going to do in terms of zoning, in terms of schools, and the types of issues that they want to focus on is what I'm learning in the Mayor's Policy and Development Office.
Speaker 1: Okay. And are you then that summer, what are you doing during the summer?
Speaker 2: Same thing.
Speaker 1: Same thing.
Speaker 2: Same thing.
Speaker 1: Oh, so all--
Speaker 2: I worked all year there, yes.
Speaker 1: For all three years?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was great.
Story_ID: 672831
Speaker 1: So when you graduate, what are you thinking you want to do then?
Speaker 2: What I'm thinking I want to do is because I also had a very bad counselor, career counselor, in--oh, awful. She would never believe it, because I, I know her now in a different capacity. But, but she was, she was in politics. She, she wasn't a lawyer at the time. She ultimately did go to law school. But just--you know, she didn't even encourage us to like apply for the prosecutor's office. And there were no blacks in the prosecutor's office back then. New Jersey was one of the most segregated places ever. So, you know, we were encouraged to work for legal services or the public defender's office. I got really, really, really, really lucky. Nolan Dawkins' wife [Lorraine Dawkins] worked for Johnson and Johnson [Johnson and Johnson Products; Johnson and Johnson Services, Inc.], and her boss was leaving to go to work for National Steel [National Steel Corporation], which was the large- the third largest steel company at the time, in the service center division. He was going to be head of HR [human resources], and he was looking for someone to be employee benefits lawyer. ERISA [Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974] became effective the year that I graduated; and Nolan, who had graduated the year before me, called and asked me was I interested, that he specifically was looking for an African American, because he was this great liberal (gesture). So, and he knew it was an all-white environment. I think he really probably thought it was cute. But--and so I got the job. And so I got a job right out of law school in a, in a corporation. I did work at Mercer County legal services [Legal Aid Society of Mercer County] for about three or four months before that while that position was coming through.
Speaker 1: Well, I want--so, this is 1976--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --right? So, let's put this a little in historical context, because people, you know, Black Enterprise, I'm going to talk, talk on--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the business side, Black Enterprise's, is, you know, in its, in its early days.
Speaker 2: Right, because they gave us free subscriptions at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so, Black Enterprise's early days, the Urban League [National Urban League] is active--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, trying to get people in the door.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, what--tell me that environ- and who is--how do you meet Nolan? You mentioned--
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Nolan?
Speaker 2: Oh, Nolan Dawkins [Nolan B. Dawkins]--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --he was, he was a, he graduated from Seton Hall [Seton Hall University School of Law, Newark, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: So, you--
Speaker 2: I knew him from law school.
Speaker 1: Okay, but in what capacity? What--
Speaker 2: He was a student.
Speaker 1: He was a student?
Speaker 2: He was a student.
Speaker 1: But he--
Speaker 2: Nolan Dawkins. Dawkins, not Atkinson [Nolan N. Atkinson, Jr.].
Speaker 1: No, no, I--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, I got that.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: But you're saying he went there to start the--?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: He was in, he was working. His wife worked at Johnson and Johnson. His wife told him that they were looking for a lawyer. Her boss was leaving Johnson and Johnson to go to work for a steel comp- the steel company.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 672832
Speaker 1: What is the environment you come into at--
Speaker 2: The steel company.
Speaker 1: --at the steel company, right.
Speaker 2: All white males.
Speaker 1: Now, are you coming into HR [human resources] or are you coming into the legal department?
Speaker 2: There is no legal department (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: But I am working as a lawyer doing ERISA [Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974] work and employee benefits work, coming under the, the person I reported to was the head of HR.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right. But, you know, it was, but all the corporate people there. The president was there. Everyone was there. The vice president for marketing--and it was, it was an interesting environment, because they had never had any female professionals at the service center division. And, you know, they didn't really know what to, what exactly to do. There was some gender bias. Interestingly, I never felt real racial bias at the steel company. Gender bias in the sense that when they were giving out the annual reports and so forth, I didn't get one. I'm like, "Where is my copy of the annual report?" "Oh, we're not accustomed to women being able to read them and understand them." I said, "Well it's a little different now," and they never did that again. The one thing where there was true gender bias, because I wanted to move over to labor relations, and they kept telling me, promising me, "Well, you got to go in, go to the plants and visit the facilities," which I was already doing. "You got to wear a hard hat." I said, "I don't mind wearing a hard hat." And so they ultimately would never let me get involved with the union side of things. So, and I know that was pure gender bias.
Speaker 1: Okay. Is there a--who was the highest ranking African American at the, at the company? Or was there, or were you the only--
Speaker 2: Oh, I was it.
Speaker 1: You were it?
Speaker 2: I was it.
Speaker 1: So, what are they doing? So, what is the--what are you tasked with, with ERISA at that point? What are you--
Speaker 2: I am tasked with, you know, because ERISA covers all employee benefits. So, you've got all--and, and it dealt with the union too and all of their pension plans and health benefits and so forth. But, I had to do it from where I was and, and from sort of the background, but to calculate what the benefits should be, how much money it would cost to provide certain benefits to the union employees. And when it came to their contracts, you know, that piece of it and the cost of it, and calculating that with any increases that they got with their raises, making sure that the plans qualified for executives and non-executives, and different other types of, of benefit plans. So, that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you did that for how long?
Speaker 2: At that, at the steel company?
Speaker 1: At the steel, and the name of the steel company (unclear)?
Speaker 2: National Steel [National Steel Corporation].
Speaker 1: National Steel, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was, it was United Steel [United States Steel Corporation], Bethlehem Steel [Bethlehem Steel Corporation], National Steel.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were the three big ones. I did employee benefits from '76 [1976] to '84 [1984], but I went to Prudential [Prudential Insurance Company of America; Prudential Financial, Inc.] next. And then I went to a employee benefits consulting firm after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so what was the difference between--so in '84 [1984], you--eighty--1976 to 1984.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: Through '84 [1984].
Speaker 1: Okay, and then what was, what was the environment at the next company like?
Speaker 2: Awful. Horrible. I couldn't wait to leave. The plan was, is that I would learn about all of their, Prudential's products, and then, in--and their actual pension department, and then move downtown to the law department to then support the pension department. The problem was in doing it that way, you have people who came straight from high school to work at Prudential, work their way up, and did not understand how I could come in as a high level, not having worked my way up through the lowest-lowest level when I'm a lawyer, you know. They didn't, they didn't care, you know, it was just, they--it was, it was awful.
Speaker 1: And you were there how long?
Speaker 2: Too long. A little more than a year. (Shakes head) It was miserable. It was awful. It was awful.
Story_ID: 672833
Speaker 1: Exactly to a T (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wow.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Probably a lot of people's, but.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: You know, I've never--actually, when I was reading, I'm like, boy--you know, 'cause I've never--I talk about it, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But, anyway--okay, so what I, what I was--so, you said, I'm back to the job now, but you went to, after you left you were like, "No more of this"--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --right after. So, you go, how do you get your next position at the consulting?
Speaker 2: A headhunter.
Speaker 1: Head--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, headhunter. There were so--and, and, and I was a rare commodity. There were almost no other African Americans who were quote unquote expert in ERISA [Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]. And so, I--the headhunters were always calling me. And so that's how I got the position at the consulting firm in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: And so what was the consulting firm's name?
Speaker 2: It was George Buck [Buck Consultants; Conduent, Inc.]. It's now part of Mellon bank [Bank of New York Mellon Corporation].
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It's interesting. So, now how, what, what--how large is the consult- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And it had a law, separate law department. The consulting firm did. Oh yeah. It had ten lawyers in the law department.
Speaker 1: So, what was their main business, then? What--?
Speaker 2: Employee benefits. They were the largest employee benefits consulting firm probably in the world.
Speaker 1: So, how was this experience and how long were you there?
Speaker 2: I was there for almost five years. It was, started as a good experience. I kept advancing, advancing until, you know, they have a partnership, except they called them directors. And same thing, when it got close to time to get to the director level, suddenly I wasn't as smart. I wasn't the (air quotes) maven that they had been calling me in, in all of this area. And so, I'm like, you know, I see where this is going. I'm outta here. So, that's when I started my own firm.
Speaker 1: And I want to ask about that period of time. So, is that nine--I'm trying to just get the chronology right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, that's, you start there in what year and you work there until?
Speaker 2: I start there in like '79 [1979], late '79 [1979] or something like that.
Speaker 1: And you leave in '84 [1984] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Eighty-four [1984], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. And, are there any other African Americans at the firm?
Speaker 2: Yes, but not lawyers. At, at Buck, George Buck?
Speaker 1: At George Buck.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, but not lawyers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you had people. Barbara Vaughan was an actuary. And then you had people in other different roles. One woman I--you know, at the time, I don't remember, but I know we talked about going to law school. She--her husband had died, and, early and she had like four or five little children. She was, she wanted to go to law school, and we talked about that a long time. And we're, we're friends now. She was accepted everywhere: Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Stanford [Stanford Law School, Stanford, California], everywhere. She went to Harvard. And she's at a firm in--at Carlton Fields [Carlton Fields Jorden Burt, P.A.] now. So, but, and I, I have no idea what she--I think she was in like the actu- one of the actuarial departments, but I don't think she was a fully licensed actuary. Barbara Vaughan became a fully licensed actuary. And I think she's still there. But, you know, people did other things. I'm not completely sure what everyone did, but there were other blacks there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. And so, you, you leave, and then you're like, "I'm done."
Speaker 2: I'm done.
Speaker 1: And at this point in time you've been in the ERISA, you know, this area for about, like almost t- a little over (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ten, yeah.
Speaker 1: --ten years.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 672834
Speaker 1: And so what makes you think--so when you step out on your own, what are you planning to do?
Speaker 2: I am hoping that I can get small organizations to write 401(k) plans for them and things like that. And I was able to do it for a little while, then I ran out of people. So I had to start doing other things. So--
Speaker 1: So can we talk about that?
Speaker 2: Oh sure. I started doing, you know, real estate, personal injury, things, what small firms do. And then, I went to the NBA, met a couple of people, met Jim Cole [James O. Cole] who was at Clorox [The Clorox Company], met Bob--
Speaker 1: And he live- and he was out in the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At Clorox? And when you say the NBA, you're talking about the National Bar Association?
Speaker 2: National Bar Association, yeah. Met Jim Cole who was at Clorox. They had, their largest facility was in Jersey City [New Jersey] at the time. And so he started giving me a little work, and then more work, and, and so that was very nice. And then they moved to Maryland because they wanted to get rid of the unions. But, you know, he gave me as much work as he could. And then Bob Archie [Robert L. Archie, Jr.] I met, who's from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], they were doing--he had his own firm at the time. It was Atkinson, Archie and Wallace [Atkinson, Myers, Archie and Wallace]. And they were doing work for Ford Motor Company and so forth. And John Wallace [John E. Wallace, Jr.] went on the bench, and he was their New Jersey lawyer. John Wallace always lived in New Jersey, was admitted in New Jersey. And he went on the bench. So they didn't have any New Jersey person to handle their New Jersey cases, so they asked me would I serve as local counsel for them on the Ford work. And then ultimately, I started doing the Ford work on my own. But, it was because of Bob Archie and Nolan [Nolan B. Dawkins] that I got a foot in the door to do that. And, you know, then I still did some other ones, but, you know, what happens is, is that no one wants to give you any kind of corporate work unless you're already doing corporate work. So, you know, how does that work? So, so they gave me those opportunities, and if--I met them at the National Bar and, and just don't know if that would have happened. And so, so as a result of saying that I did that, and especially Jim Cole who vouched for me with other corporations, I, I don't know how I would have been able to do that. Then I, I became friendly with the mayor of East Orange when I moved back to New Jersey from New York. I didn't live--I never lived in New York. But I stopped, decided I was going to work in New Jersey. I went, told the mayor I wanted to see him, what could I do to help. Wasn't looking for any kind of position or anything like that. But, I guess it was such a shock that I wasn't asking for anything, just asking how I could help since I lived in the city and I was working in the city. And, as a result, you know, we became friends, and he created all sorts of opportunities for me. So, I've been really, really, really fortunate, I think in my life and in my career. I, I'm not rich, but, you know, I've, I've done okay. And so many people have helped me to, to get to where I am.
Speaker 1: So, in, in a lot of ways, you know, you're, you're talking about the, the bar, the bar associations and other activities around bar associations (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --that really made opportunities happen for you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 672835
Speaker 1: So, can we, can we talk about the Association of Black Women Lawyers [Association of Black Women Lawyers of New Jersey] and, you know, I th- can we talk about that organization--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and how you got involved?
Speaker 2: Right. So, when I was a third year law student [at Seton Hall University School of Law, Newark, New Jersey], Renee Weeks [Renee Jones Weeks], [HistoryMaker] Lois Wright, Sheryl [Sheryl Portee], several recent graduates, they were two years ahead of me. And remember Sheryl and Lois lived in my building.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, Renee Weeks lived in the Colonnades [Colonnade Apartments, Newark, New Jersey] when it was really nice. A lot of professionals lived there then. And, and she thought that we should have this Association of Black Women Lawyers. And it was truly I think her idea. You know, there were others present at the time, and they invited some of us law students at the time to join in, and the organization was formed. They didn't--they felt like the Garden State Bar [Garden State Bar Association] wasn't doing enough to address certain issues. And so, so we were the first women's lawyers' organization in the State of New Jersey, and obviously we're now the oldest one in the state. And Renee was the first president. And we had great activities, great community service projects, you know, looked out for the other women law students in school and so forth. And the, the organization grew, you know. We had meetings, which was also a social event, because there just weren't that many of them. I think Nina, as soon as she came to New Jersey, she became a part of it. And, and, you know, we would have--I like to cook too, so I was one of the favorite places to have a meeting (laughter). And, you know, just sitting around the living room talking, having a meeting--there were so few of us. We--fortunately there are too many now to have meetings like this. We have them at the Law Center and so forth. But, there was, there was a real closeness, and again, you know, if you were Hispanic you would join the Association of Black Women Lawyers. Margie Echeveria [ph.], Zulima Farber [Zulima V. Farber],--they all belonged to the ABWL, because there were even less Latino women to--so that they could form their own organization. And, and so there's still that connection with us and, and, and, and, and them, you know, in that regard. But we really made a big difference. We became--we got a lot of publicity over the years concerning the activities that we were involved with in the community and with, you know with young people, and young women, not just lawyers but in the schools and, and other places. So, just--
Speaker 1: So, you're, you were saying that you, in the early days you met at each other's homes?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's when you were talking about you were a favorite place 'cause you cooked?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then you were mentioning you said Nina, but that's Nina Wells [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells].
Speaker 2: Yeah, Nina Wells, exactly yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nina Wells, that's right, okay.
Speaker 2: Nina Wells, yes.
Speaker 1: So, so what are some of the issues that you're--and the Garden State Bar, is that the, the--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's the black bar.
Speaker 1: Black bar.
Speaker 2: It's an affiliate of the National Bar Association. Yes.
Speaker 1: Right. So, can you talk about this because actually here a friend of mine formed a similar organization for, you know, black women.
Speaker 2: Women lawyers, right, yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, black women lawyers.
Speaker 2: They honored me this past year, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And it's grown!
Speaker 2: It has grown tremendously. It is--their summit that they have, I mean for this to have been the second year, it is like off the charts. I'm like, we've been around for forty years and we don't do anything this great. And I went back to tell them, I'm like, "This is what they're doing in Chicago [Illinois]." I'm like, "We can do better," (laughter) you know. I--it's just, I mean, just fabulous.
Speaker 1: Yeah, no it's grown. So, it's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, so talk ab- because it started similarly--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) around the same--I mean, maybe a little later.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I--maybe it was later.
Speaker 2: It was a little later, yeah.
Speaker 1: It's later.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 672836
Speaker 1: But tell me what the issues are that you, young black female lawyers are coming together, you know, feeling it's not being addressed with the men. So, what are your issues?
Speaker 2: Okay, so they're, there are unique issues to women of color. And, you know, at, you know, little later on, I forgot how many years down the road, there was like a task force on women in the courts and how they were treated. And, you know, there were other issues that related to, you know, all people of color and things that related to women, but no one was addressing issues relating to black women, which we felt were quite different and unique--that we, we got treated really differently and with a lot less respect than the men did. And we also thought that there were, you know, some, some human rights issues that should be addressed relating to women in general that we thought that we were most uniquely qualified to address.
Speaker 1: Can you give some examples?
Speaker 2: So, we thought, you know, one, how you're treated in court; the lack of respect that we were getting. And we thought that if--as a group, we could address some of those issues. There, you know, we wanted to know that we could talk to legislative people. We wanted judges, we wanted black female judges at the time. We wanted people to have different government positions at the time. And, and those were some of the kinds of things that, that we talked about. And we wanted to make sure that we passed the bar exam.
Speaker 1: That more women--
Speaker 2: Exactly, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so that you were playing the role model--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --role that was even, that you had at Seton [Seton Hall University School of Law, Newark, New Jersey], even though it was informal?
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: So, can you give some specific examples of treatment, bad treatment in, in the, in the courtroom or just bad treatment in the work place? Can you give some?
Speaker 2: Sure. I, I know that when I first started, when I first went into private practice, you know, when I went to court, just no recognition that I could possibly be a lawyer. Was I the defendant, was I the, the, the, the, the secretary, everybody, you know; and it got down to, he went through a whole list and he said, "Well then who are you?" But even still, I can tell you something happened a couple of months ago. I was in immigration court in San Diego [California], and I went with some immigration lawyers, and the, the woman who's in charge of immigration project said, "And we have the president elect of the ABA [American Bar Association] with us." The judge was looking all around, all around. This was a couple, this is two months ago he was look--I said, "That would be me." So, you know, it, it's, it's still, it's still interesting. But, you know, you would have, you know, situations where, you know, rulings were just not, you couldn't get a ruling whenever there was any discretion. There would--the discretion would go to the other side. You know, I had had judges who told me that I couldn't speak; and one who, you know, I had a law firm [Brown and Childress; Brown, Childress, Lofton and Wolfe, East Orange, New Jersey] that was, every motion day, motion days are every two weeks. And, and they would bring a motion every two weeks, every motion day. And, and then when I would try to argue against it, the judge would just tell me not to talk, until one day I had had enough and I, I brought my checkbook with me. I said, "You can hold me in contempt, I brought my checkbook," I said, "but I'm going to speak today." So, you know she was, she was just very abusive though. Not, not just to me but she was abusive to anybody who wasn't her favorite.
Speaker 1: And I, what--this is over, a little over thirty years ago, and I, that's why I'm asking you for this, in terms of--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --because often black women, you know, would say that they were at the low end of the totem pole--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --behind the black men (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --behind the white women.
Speaker 2: Behind everybody. Yes, behind everybody, they were last, absolutely last when, in terms to any kind of positive consideration.
Story_ID: 672837
Speaker 1: And so when you look--so you became president, what--you became president of--you went by, was it ABWL [Association of Black Women Lawyers of New Jersey] you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we called it ABWL, yes.
Speaker 1: And, so what was your, what were you wanting to do as president?
Speaker 2: I wanted to create more opportunities for women in the profession. I wanted us to celebrate who we were. I wanted us to do more community based projects with schools and girls in schools. And I think at that time they also formed the task force on what, they called it minority concerns to examine how people of color were treated in the judicial system, both as lawyers and employees and, and otherwise. And so, I was on--I was reminded of that, I didn't realize it. In '84 [1984], I became a part of that task force, which was the first of its kind in the country, and became very active in that, trying to set new standards. And some have been established for both employees, you know, because I said--the one thing that I said is that we can't talk about what people should do externally if you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing internally. So we want to know what positions women held in the judiciary and were they--you know, and they gave us statistics where they hold a certain percentage but they were all the lowest level clerks. I'm like, so then I said no, we have to break it down to see where they are and so forth to make sure that everybody was getting a fair opportunity.
Speaker 1: And when you say they, who's they created the--
Speaker 2: Who, created the task force?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, actually it was Chief Justice Wilentz [Robert Wilentz] and then he wasn't justice, Jim Coleman [James H. Coleman, Jr.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is this in New Jersey?
Speaker 2: This is in New Jersey. It wasn't then Justice Coleman. But it got leaked that there had been a committee studying this. And once it got leaked, then they formed the task force.
Speaker 1: But there are literally initiatives like this going on, like, that are going on in different parts of the country, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There are now, yes. And I found out that some states still, just like Missouri, is just starting one now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But a lot of them did spring up around the country. And then they formed this national consortium, which dealt with a lot of the issues in the courts as it relates to people of color and, and other underserved people in the courts.
Speaker 1: You know, and this is, what's interesting to me is, you know, in preparation for this, I was looking at a lecture that Dennis Archer gave.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he's talking about 1983 that--1984 that there were two ABA [American Bar Association] task forces.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: One for ethnic minorities and there was a lot of discussion to keep that separate.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] did the one for women.
Speaker 2: Women, correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But, but I--so, out of your task force, what are the findings, and what are the agenda items coming out of that task force?
Speaker 2: Okay, so the findings were that, that people of color were underrepresented in the judiciary from an employment standpoint; and that people who are attempting to practice law were being treated differently and not in a positive way. Those were some of the initial findings that came out. The task force still exists. It's now a commission I think. It's still in existence to continuously study and to make sure that there's no sort of backsliding in the judiciary. It was also an opportunity to look at who was being hired as law clerks, you know, because no blacks were being hired as law clerks, you know, during that period of time or very, very few. And they were only being hired by the very few black judges that you had. So, you know, that, that was a part of what came out of it that judges would look at, at all people in term--when they were looking for law clerks, and so you did have a major increase in law clerks at that time. Not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but you also had employees advancing and being promoted, which was a good thing because they weren't doing that at all.
Story_ID: 672838
Speaker 1: You're active at ABWL [Association of Black Women Lawyers of New Jersey], and you're also become--you're also active with the National Bar Association (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --simultaneously?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And this is all around the time that, because I didn't know that--so, because Jim Co- J- James, Jim Cole [James O. Cole]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --has this senior position where he's able to help--
Speaker 2: Yes, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you know, and so you're getting, you're getting work that you wouldn't otherwise get.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, I guess what I want to--
Speaker 2: I call him Jim. His wife always calls him James.
Speaker 1: James, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right. They're (unclear)--they, they've had national impact--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that couple.
Speaker 2: Ada [Ada Cole], Ada, A- um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Aida (unclear), yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I want to--I've, I've been trying to get him interviewed.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Yes and--
Speaker 2: 'Cause you know he's the grand sire of the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh he is?
Speaker 2: Yeah um-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now?
Speaker 2: Yes, right now.
Speaker 1: I did not know that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I was just with the, the--Anthony Hall [HistoryMaker Anthony W. Hall, Jr.] who was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --maybe grand sire before him.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that. Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause they're in Florida right now.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: He's been ready. We just hadn't gotten to Florida and I--
Speaker 2: Okay, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) think I've lost his okay, information. Sorry, gone off track. So, tell me also what else is important about this period. And we're talking 1983 to, I want to say '83 [1983] to when you adopt your son [Dijuan Brown].
Speaker 2: Okay. So, so I go to my first National Bar conference in 1980. Never looked back. I'm like, "Why didn't I go when I first got out of law school?" So, and it was also Renee Weeks [Renee Jones Weeks] who got me to go and Golden Johnson [Golden E. Johnson]. They, you know, both running--I think Renee was running for vice president, and Golden had run for vice president. Delores Wilson [Delores Pegram Wilson] was at some point president of the women lawyer's division. I go in. I check into the hotel. The first person I meet is Arthenia Joyner. And she instantly adopts me right at the check in, (laughter) in the hotel. Arnette Hubbard [HistoryMaker Arnette Hubbard] is running for president that year. She beats Warren Dawson [Warren Hope Dawson], you know, who was supposed to be the next person to be president. It had been (air quotes) so ordained. And you know Bob Harris [HistoryMaker Robert Lewis Harris] had just been the, the president, the youngest president of the NBA. You know, no young people, no women. So, Arnette was elected, and it was just--and I met so many black lawyers who were doing such incredible things. They knew so much more about the Civil Rights Movement than I knew and they just, they just, they just knew so much. I was just totally in awe. I came away as the deputy regional director from our, my first--oh yeah, I did.
Speaker 1: So, that was, that's a trend wherever you are--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --you end up being in leadership.
Speaker 2: And, and it's become a joke among my friends too. Pat Johnson [ph.], she used to make jokes about me. She said, "When are you going to be in charge of that?" So, but, but I don't really go there with that in mind. Maybe it's somewhere deep in my subconscious. But, but I did, you know, I went to regional, regional meet--Region III meeting and, and, and, you know, we talked and I, I came away being the deputy regional director. And Tim Crawford [S. Timothy A. Crawford, Jr.] was the regional director, and he kind of let me do what I wanted to do as deputy, and then I became the regional director.
Speaker 1: So, what does the regional director do?
Speaker 2: So, you, you engage--the regions are broken in, down like the federal circuits. So, Region III is New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, the [U.S.] Virgin Islands. And, and you interact with the people in your region, try to get them to be interested in NBA. You hold programs for them, CLEs [Continuing Legal Education] and so forth. And I was able to convince Arnette when she was president to come to Region III. We had a big conference in Atlantic City [New Jersey] when I was the regional director. And we charged money to come to the conference, which nobody had ever done for a regional conference, and the NBA made money from it. So, I think they all kind of do it now.  But it was, you know, you just make sure your people in your region are engaged, that they're active in the NBA, that they get CLEs; and, you know, we talk about the issues that are important to black lawyers.
Story_ID: 672839
Speaker 1: So I want to understand your progression. So, you become region, regional director that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, right.
Speaker 1: --first year. And that's 19--
Speaker 2: No, deputy regional director.
Speaker 1: Deputy region--
Speaker 2: In '80 [1980].
Speaker 1: --in '80 [1980].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But by--
Speaker 2: Eighty-one [1981] I become the regional director.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then is there a typical move up, you know, within the National Bar [National Bar Association] or it doesn't work that--
Speaker 2: That--it used to be. You used to hold the, number of different positions including vice president. I remember I ran for secretary and lost to Algenita Scott Davis. I wasn't upset because she had been around a long time, and I didn't really know--had I known she was running I probably would have never run against her. But once I was in it, I was in it to win. So, yeah, no, I'd, I--it's the way I am. But I did lose. I remember Dennis telling me that I should--
Speaker 1: Den- this is Dennis Archer?
Speaker 2: Yep, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, sorry.
Speaker 2: I remember Dennis telling me well, you know, "Be the, you know, the deputy secretary," 'cause they had an assistant secretary. I'm like, "No, I don't want to do that." And I think he was a little annoyed with me 'cause I said I didn't want to do that. But I ended up doing something else. I went back on the board somehow. And then I ended up running for vice president. And--
Speaker 1: In what year?
Speaker 2: I don't remember. I really don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Allen Webster [Allen J. Webster, Jr.] was a vice president, Ernestine Sapp [Ernestine S. Sapp]. And I remember that everybody liked all of us so it was an issue of who was going to run for president elect. Ernestine said she had absolutely no interest. And so then Allen and I decided who would run for which year. Allen ran first in '91 [1991]. The California people thanked me for that. And he ran unopposed. I ran the following year in '92 [1992], and someone who I had brought into the NBA from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] groomed him, introduced him to everybody, ran against me, um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: So, that doesn't feel good.
Speaker 2: No, I was furious to tell you the truth. I was furious. I mean it would have--I would have been okay if it had been from somebody else from a different region, somebody I didn't know. Yeah, I was, I was furious, yeah, Marshall Williams, um-hm.
Speaker 1: But you won?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He got like twenty-five votes or something like that, but he shouldn't have gotten any. But anyway (laughter). I, I, I would--you know, because I, I felt it was a betrayal and, and I am, I consider myself to be a very loyal person. People know I'm generally never on the fence about things. You know, I may think things out, but I'm generally never on the fence about things, so.
Story_ID: 672840
Speaker 1: So, can you tell the history of the National Bar Association and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --and what that, you know, organization has meant, 'cause it started in 19--
Speaker 2: Twenty-five [1925].
Speaker 1: --what, '25 [1925].
Speaker 2: Right, when blacks were not allowed to be members of the ABA [American Bar Association]. And blacks were not allowed to be members of the ABA until 1943. So, you know, I think about Iowa because it was founded in Iowa.
Speaker 1: Which is so odd.
Speaker 2: You know, you know, it is odd but every time I think about something in Iowa, I said, "Oh that's so odd." But you know the woman [Jane Elliott] who did the study, the 'Class Divided' ['A Class Divided'], was from Iowa. The judge who is making his jurors do implicit bias stuff before they deliberate is from Iowa. So, interesting things happen in Iowa that you wouldn't necessarily think about. You know, as one woman who's from Iowa calls it a fly by state. And, and, and yeah so, so the founders are from Iowa. I mean, they formed in Iowa. Gertrude Rush, you know, who wrote the song, 'This Little Light of Mine' [sic. Harry Dixon Loes] in '25 [1925] when they did not, you know, the ABA would not allow blacks into (cough) excuse me, into the organization and, you know, was a, basically a civil rights based organization, you know, addressing the needs of African American lawyers trying to influence legislation and do all of those various things. And even when the ABA started allowing blacks in, in, you know, it still was in very small numbers. You know, you couldn't advance. You could just be a member. So, and, and the National Bar was very welcoming.
Speaker 1: The National Bar?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The National Bar Association was very welcoming (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, National Bar Association, yes.
Story_ID: 672841
Speaker 1: Can you give also others? So it's, it's structured along the different circuits, the judicial circuits?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay. And talk about some of the things that proceeded you and that also were during your presidency that are important things for people to know that have come out of the National Bar--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --Association.
Speaker 2: So, the National Bar Association participates a lot in the federal judicial process. The ABA [American Bar Association] is the (air quotes) official vetter of federal judges. But we've had an opportunity to weigh in on some of the federal judges, especially when the ABA has not given favorable rankings to, to African Americans. And we've been able to weigh in, depending on who's in the White House, able to have meetings and collaborate with other civil rights organizations like the Lawyers' Committee [Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights under Law], the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and NAACP Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.], and other groups like that, to, to help influence people to get on the bench, you know, work closely with the Congressional Black Caucus on, you know, legislative issues. Bobby Scott has been a member of--I shouldn't call him that--Congressman Scott has been--I've known him so long, has been a member of the National Bar Association, never misses a meeting. And it's a great opportunity, you know, for, for the NBA and the legislators to interact. And there's always been a good relationship with the National Bar Association and them, for the most part over time. The, you know, just really focused a lot on civil rights issues. And then there came a point in time where we decided to look at some of the economics. And so Cora Walker [Cora T. Walker] started the Commercial Law Section of the National Bar Association. I was still working in New York [New York] at the time, and so Bob Archie [Robert L. Archie, Jr.] would come up from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]. He would pick up Renee Weeks [Renee Jones Weeks] in New Jersey. Then they would pick me up in New York, and we would head up to Harlem [New York, New York] to Cora Walker's office. And, you know, it was sort of like us. You know, there were so few people in the Commercial Law Section. All of our names are on the letterhead. And so, Cora had this idea of how we could get together and, you know, encourage corporations to give the small black law firm's business. And, it was a great concept. She was very unselfish about it. And so, the Commercial Law Section has been going strong. It's the biggest section of the NBA right now. And they still have the corporate counsel, the conference every year, where the corporations come in and meet, you know, new African American lawyers. And it's been emulated by the Hispanic Bar [Hispanic National Bar Association], by NAPABA [National Asian Pacific American Bar Association], they've, they started doing it. And in fact, Dennis [Dennis Archer] created the demonstration project as a model from the commercial law section. So, you know, and now of course it's evolved into giving business to people of color in large law firms too. But the idea first was to empower small black law firms.
Speaker 1: Essentially, really without this there would be really not that much--it would have been hard for the black lawyer to make progress?
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: I mean when you look at it historically.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, yes.
Speaker 1: These outside organization--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, these organizations.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, especially because the law, there haven't been a lot of advan- I mean the advances have been slow, let me put it that way.  Slow, slow (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In, in some--with regard to women of color and African American women in particular, you know, you know, the percentage in law firms? Less than 1 percent. In terms of equity partner, it--women of color, it's around 2 percent equity partners in law firms, and it's been that way for the last twenty years or so (audio disturbance).
Story_ID: 672842
Speaker 1: So let's talk about your presidency of the NBA and what was important for you once you, you know won. Because it--can I ask one other question?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Between [HistoryMaker] Arnette Hubbard--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and you, how many female presidents were between the t-?
Speaker 2: So, it was Arthenia [Arthenia Joyner] next, then Algenita [Algenita Scott Davis] and Sharon McPhail.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then me.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, can you talk about what you were wanting--'cause each person has their own platform (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. Right. So, my, my, one of my big focuses was the federal judgeships--to get more African Americans on the federal bench. And there was one person, it was, it was a real, real chore, Alex Williams [ph.] had a lot of meetings at the White House because I did not--there was a trend that if there was any kind of trouble the name would be withdrawn. And I wanted to stop the withdrawal of the names. I wanted them to continue to fight. So there were a lot--and Alex Williams was one of them. He was nominated--like at the beginning the ABA [American Bar Association] gave him a bad rating. It was undeserved in my opinion, and we fought and fought and fought for him in particular, and he was confirmed on my last day in office.  Yeah, yeah. He told me I'm in his book (laughter) that he's written. But it was, it was, it was a process. And, and so I focused on that. And then a, and then a wonderful opportunity happened for me that I could not have planned nor asked for, and that was the first free and democratic elections in South Africa that I had an opportunity to lead the delegation. And that was because Gay McDougall was in charge of all of the NGOs [non-government organization]; and I had become friendly with her husband, John Payton, as a result of being president of NBA and, you know, had talked to him to see if the National Bar Association could qualify as a, as an NGO for the elections, and we, we were. And so, I led a small delegation of other NBA people. Arnette Hubbard was in the delegation and to monitor the first free and democratic elections in South Africa, so.
Story_ID: 672843
Speaker 1: It's hard to describe that extraordinary experience.
Speaker 2: Can you describe it?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So, it was first training, and I remember, I got to know Dean Ramsey. At the time, he was the dean at Howard [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] at the time, and I got to know him very well.
Speaker 2: Of the law school, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Of the law school. I got--
Speaker 2: John, what, his first name is--de- de-
Speaker 1: Henry.
Speaker 2: Henry Ramsey [Henry Ramsey, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Yes. You know he died. And so, so we had training. People were very terrified. You know they gave me a big party before I left, and one person who was a prosecutor, one of the counties gave me a bulletproof vest to, to take with me. People were very afraid for my safety. I was not afraid at all. But, and, and we learned during the course of time, because of all the bad publicity, they said you're more likely to get injured or killed in a car accident than anything else. And it was true. So, it was very exciting.  We got that training, and then we were dispatched to the Transkei area where Nelson Mandela is originally from. We stayed at a Holiday Inn. Winnie Mandela was staying there also. Yeah, it was, it was amazing. And so we got more training in New London [sic. East London, South Africa] and local areas. And so then some of the most exciting things that we did that we were trying to find where people were having rallies. And we were trying to follow these people to like a Zulu rally, and we're driving, and I'm driving 'cause I'm basically the only one who can drive a stick shift on the left side of the road. So, we're driving and, and I guess they see that we're following them and they try to lose us and we're riding through these dusty roads and we're (laughter)--it becomes hysterical. They completely lose us and we are then completely lost. So (laughter), I don't even remember how we ultimately found our way. But it was, it was a really, a good time. And so, you know, there were basically three days of elections. They did the people in prisons, the people in hospitals; and so we went to the hospitals and the prisons to observe, and they were rolling people up in gurneys to, to vote. I remember that we went to some schools to vote for the regular voting. The lines were tremendously long. And there was one place that ran out of ballots. And I remember the place we had been before they had a lot of ballots left. It was another town. I, I don't know what kind of adrenaline I got at the time, but I literally ran to the other place and got the ballots and brought them back to the other place, and everybody got to vote. So I felt really good about that. Beverly McQueary Smith still laughs at me about that. She said, "You know these children are gonna study about you in history?" I said, "I don't think so." But--'cause they, I mean, they didn't know my name or anything like that. But it was, it was just--it was like something just came over me, because you see all these people patiently waiting in line for blocks and blocks and blocks and blocks. It was, it was, it was, it was an amazing thing. And then of course Nelson Mandela wins, we're all downtown in JoBurg [Johannesburg, South African] at the Hyatt [Hyatt Regency Johannesburg] doing the toi toi on the stage, and it was just, it was just amazing; it was, to, to be a part of that kind of history it was, it was stunning.
Speaker 2: And there are people from all over the world there, right?
Speaker 1: Oh yes, oh yes.
Speaker 2: You--
Speaker 1: And a lot of people from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] too who were monitors, yeah.
Speaker 2: You know it's interesting, because lots of people in our archive talk about him coming to the states--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you know and that being historic, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: --after the election, but not many, you know. I haven't heard many stories of, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --people being there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, you were there for how long?
Speaker 1: Three weeks. Three weeks.
Story_ID: 672844
Speaker 1: Now, that actually started the move of some people, Americans there--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that stayed there for many decades (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And many decades still are there. Never moved back. And, I ended up buying a house there, yeah. Had it for twelve years. Just sold it this, last November, this past November. It was a guest house.
Speaker 1: So what, so you--were you using that for vacation or were you continuing to do other work around legal issues there?
Speaker 2: Some, some work. Not so much. But it was a guest house. And it was initially Cora Vaughn [Cora M. Vaughn] had a house, and when--the NBA [National Bar Association] does an international meeting every year. So, I was in charge of the international meeting, and I used Cora as a resource since she was pretty much living there at the time. And she was able to connect us to a lot of different things, probably that we would not have been able to be connected with if she had not been on the ground. And just, you know, people were very excited, fascinated. So, she apparently talked to Evett Simmons [Evett L. Simmons] about a house that was for sale sort of next door, 'cause the houses are big and spaced apart. And so Evett asked me and Maybelline [ph.] if we were interested in going in and buying this house. And the dollar was very strong, and so we, we did. We bought it, and it got to be a little too much, because almost for the last ten years, I was the only one going there to check on the house. So, so we, we sold it. And, it was, it was an--it was nice to have though, nice to go and visit. But it was becoming my only vacation destination, so.
Speaker 1: That's a long ways to go too.
Speaker 2: It is. Exactly.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And Nelson Mandela lived four blocks away. His residence was four blocks away. We were at 8th [Avenue] and 3rd [Street], and he was at 4th [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 672845
Speaker 1: Now, had you spent much time out of the country at that point doing any kind of work? Or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I had done some. The state department [U.S. Department of State], well this was after, the state department after the elections, I was hired by the state department to do mediation training for the Department of Human Services in Ghana. So I was there for three weeks also doing training around the country. I--they also asked me to work with different bar associations in different countries, so I worked with the Ghanaian bar association [Ghana Bar Association], the Kenyan bar association [Law Society of Kenya], Tanzania and some other bar associations in, in, in Africa.
Speaker 1: So, can I ask you what you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uganda.
Speaker 1: --what you also learned in that process? You know, because you're seeing the African American diaspora--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in that process.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: When I--let's see, '80s [1980s], yeah I'm not sure how, you know, the work that you--
Speaker 2: This was into the '90s [1990s] also.
Speaker 1: Into the '90s [1990s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, what are the work, what are, what are you seeing in the other African countries?
Speaker 2: I, I see that they don't think that much differently than we do; that the things that you read and hear about in the newspaper, most of them are not true. They are very progressive in their thinking. They don't have as many resources that we have, but they are certainly as progressive as we are in their thinking and the things that they want to do for the people where they live. It's different, especially if you're in an all-black country. I'm seeing black people in charge of everything, and that was kind of a nice thing where you don't see the different kinds of biases that affect us here that are, that don't affect them in other places. But yet they, they have this wonderful thirst for information and for knowledge as to, you know, more modernized ways that we do things here that they would like to transfer to, to their countries. They like to see how our bar associations operate and the types of activities that we're involved in, how you can get new members to be involved, and all of the same things that we're concerned about every day. It was, it was a real privilege for me to just to see different cultures, especially, and when I was in Ghana in particular, because, you know, so many of us are from West Africa, to, to, to go to those, to Goree island [Dakar, Senegal] and to Cape Coast [Ghana] and to, to have, you know, get real knowledge from people who are there, have an understanding of what actually went on there, to just to be in the actual place as opposed to reading it on a piece of paper. It was quite an experience.
Story_ID: 672846
Speaker 1: So, are there things that you came away from the National Bar Association saying that I would, that you saw maybe as weaknesses in the organization?
Speaker 2: Weaknesses in the organization (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Oh there, there are weaknesses in the organization. We have not always been clear enough in our thinking and planning ahead from a financial standpoint. I think that we rely probably too much on membership, dues and organizations just can't be sustained that way anymore. You have to find other ways to generate money so that you can exist, so that you can do the type of work that the organization was designed to do. I think that, you know, like in any organization, people run for office, and without the organization being at the forefront of the reason why they're running. And, you know, that's happened from time to time. I--this past year for example, it was like the complete opposite. I think that, you know, she was the best president for the time we were in. Absolutely amazing. I've never seen--
Speaker 1: Now who, say--?
Speaker 2: Pam Meanes [Pamela Meanes]. Never seen a president like her before, the NBA--me included--who gave it just her absolute everything and more, and, really, I think, just did so much in a real unselfish way. The organization, the NBA, was the thing that was important, the only thing that was important.
Speaker 1: To her?
Speaker 2: To her.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay. So are you saying it's in better shape now because of her leadership?  Don't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no question. No question.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: No question.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 672847
Speaker 1: When do you get involved with the ABA [American Bar Association] then? Okay, and this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right out of law school [Seton Hall University School of Law, Newark, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Right--oh you get involved right out of--
Speaker 2: Before the NBA [National Bar Association].
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So can you talk about that involvement?
Speaker 2: Sure. I am--went with the Young Lawyers Division from the New Jersey State Bar [New Jersey State Bar Association] to the ABA to the assembly, so I was a member of the YLD assembly through the New Jersey State Bar YLD. And I became involved in, that's how--you know Mabel McKinney-Browning? That's how I know her. Because I did civics education through the Young Lawyers Division. Headed that group. And then--
Speaker 1: And really, what I also understood, I'm sorry to make--
Speaker 2: That's okay.
Speaker 1: But I, what I understood is that the diversity efforts of the ABA, I think, began with the young lawyers section, am I wrong? I thought I heard Dennis Archer is sort of--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right, because--yeah, he was very active in the Young Lawyers Division. But he was a little before me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, and I ultimately stepped back from the Young Lawyers Division because of issues I had in New Jersey with the Young Lawyers di- section.
Speaker 1: So, can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah. So, so they had a, a, progression, you know, you served in various positions, and then you became chair of the Young Lawyers. Well, as I got close to it, they changed the rules.
Speaker 1: And what were the rules?
Speaker 2: The rules--
Speaker 1: The rules were that you have this natural progression?
Speaker 2: There was no more such thing. So, so I got knocked out, and I'm like this is just so racist. So--
Speaker 1: So, what year was this?
Speaker 2: This was, this was around '79 [1979], '80 [1980], '81 [1981]--something like that. I, I, I got out and actually did--stopped being, because the New Jersey bar is not mandatory. It's a voluntary bar. We don't have a mandatory bar in New Jersey. And, stopped being a member until 2003 when Karol Corbin Walker became president of the New Jersey State Bar.
Speaker 1: So, you were out for tw- is it--
Speaker 2: Of the state bar.
Speaker 1: Of the state bar--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you were out--
Speaker 2: For twenty years.
Speaker 1: Twenty years.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And was not a member.
Speaker 1: And what brought you back?
Speaker 2: Karol Corbin Walker when she became the first African American to be president of the New Jersey State Bar. I had to be a member, so I wanted to go to her installation. Ted and I were both there.  Which part, which part did Ted (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is Ted Wells [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.].
Speaker 2: --Ted Wells, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know what--
Story_ID: 672848
Speaker 1: --about your involvement there and, you know, what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The litigation section [American Bar Association Section of Litigation].
Speaker 1: --yeah, and what the litigation section does.
Speaker 2: Okay, litigation section is the largest section in the ABA [American Bar Association], it has about sixty thousand members. And it, it develops, it, it--they help to write the model rules of civil procedure. They, they, they help to write the, some of the federal rules. They weigh in on all proposed rules to civil practice and criminal practice that are proposed. And, you know, at one point in time it was mostly litigators on the defense side, but they have some other ones like Bob Clifford [Robert A. Clifford]. That's obviously not on the defense side. And he was chair at one point. And, you know, I chaired various committees. And I remember I started, I forgot which role I had. But anyway, they eliminated that. Then they put me as co-chair of the Women Advocate Committee [American Bar Association Women Advocate Committee]. And then, something--I was doing something else, and they said that they were going--they wanted me to do something with the minorities committee [American Bar Association Minorities in the Profession], and I said I don't want to do that, because I know how to do other things other than that. And they said, "Well we're eliminating the committee that you're currently co-chair of, and, you know, this may be the only opportunity." I said, "Well, then I guess I'll have to get out of leadership with the litigation section," because I can't be pigeonholed into a certain area. They found something else for me, something much bigger. So, so people say, "How did you become a director? And you've only been around--?" I'm like, "I don't know." But anyway, maybe because I have experience in other bar groups. But, you know, it's, it's still about, you know, knowing who you are. There's a guy who has been chair of, I guess GPSolo, who said he will never forget. I remember on the streets of San Francisco [California], one conference, I said, "Don't box yourself into just the diversity stuff. We can do everything. We practice in all areas, you know, of the law." And so, so he said that was the best advice anybody ever gave them. You know, a lot of people, a lot of us in particular, we want to gravitate towards diversity entities and so forth when there's so much more and so much more impact that we can have in other places. And, and so that's--so the litigation section does it. They're a powerful voice in the ABA. And so I ended up running for the council, which, which I served on the council for three years and then just various other positions in leadership in the section. Never really wanted to be the chair of the section. And they have a progression also. And then I, I--Robert Grey [Robert J. Grey, Jr.], unbeknownst to me, when he asked me, he said, "Paulette [HistoryMaker Paulette Brown], I need you to do me a favor." And you just say, you know, he's about to become president, and he's a good guy, you just say, "Okay." And I had no idea what he wanted me to do. Never could catch up with him to find out until I'm sitting in the House of Delegates and people are saying, "Oh, I'm so happy you're going on the Commission on Women. You need to straighten those women out." And so, I said, "Oh, that's what Robert wanted me to do." So, there was a couple of women. One was from Chicago [Illinois]. Then there was Sheila [Sheila L. Birnbaum], who had started raising money for that report, and it was sort of being derailed, and they had rotated off of the commission. And so, Robert wanted to make sure that it got done. And that's why I was put on the commission--to make sure it did not get derailed.
Speaker 1: So this is the ABA Commission on Women in the Profession [American Bar Association Commission on Women in the Profession] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct.
Speaker 1: So--

Speaker 1: Can you talk about this? 'Cause I recognize some of the names, you know, that were here not--well Kenya Gordon [ph.] I had, and Veta Richardson [Veta T. Richardson] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: And then David Wilkins [HistoryMaker David B. Wilkins]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, I know from law school. But can you--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --can you talk about this commission [American Bar Association Commission on Women in the Profession]? I mean why--what, what was actually sort--why this was being done at the time it was being done?
Speaker 2: So, there had been a lot of studies that had been done on women, a lot of studies that had been done on quote unquote minorities, but no studies that had been done specifically on women of color. They are never, were never and still almost never, isolated, when you talk about studies, when you talk about percentage of this and percentage of that and how people are doing in the law, you never--there's, there's no, no, no specific reports relating to women of color. And so, you know, I get so much credit for this report, but it was not my idea. I just was able to come and make sure it got done. You know, money had been raised for it. There were some women on the commission who felt that this should not be a women's commission project--that it should be with the Commission on Racial and Ethnic Diversity [American Bar Association Commission on Racial and Ethnic Diverseity in the Profession]. So, you know, there were some issues surrounding that thinking that it did not belong with the Commission on Women. And I'm like, "These are women. Why wouldn't it belong with the Commission on Women?" So, you know, so there were some difficult times. But (laughter) I don't know, I've never started any fights with anybody, so I don't know why people think that I can go and straighten things out like this. But I don't start fights, but sometimes I can finish 'em up. (Laughter) And, and this was one of those cases, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But, but so, so the, so people didn't want it within the--they were thinking the Commission on Ethnic--no--
Speaker 2: Racial.
Speaker 1: --Commission, oh, Commission on Racial and Ethnic Diversity, because, did they feel--I want to know the dot, dot, dot. Did they feel--what were the, were they, that it would get compromised with--or that that should be the natural work under that commission?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what they think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That it wasn't, that it wasn't a real women's issue. And, you know, we had some, we had some real discussions, you know, even when it came to like some, the Margaret Brent Award [Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement Award], you know. I remember some comments being made that if, you know, when a, when a person of color came up and they did a lot of things for women of color and so forth, they said, "Oh, they should get the Spirit of Excellence Award," which is the award given by the Commission on Racial and Ethnic Diversity, when they've done things for women. And so--I probably shouldn't say this on tape, but I was just so annoyed because it was just, I felt it was really one-sided. And, you know, I said this is not just for white women, this is for all women. It's the Commission on Women. It's not the commission on white women. So, and so, you know, I, I think that we've made some progress in that regard (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, well you're, you're really addressing the inherent, and I would say even now it's still the conflict between the women's movement and, and black women.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, you know, the Civil Rights Movement and black women--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that, you know, that those, the voices, 'cause you, you're not fitting in either place--
Speaker 2: That's right. Right.
Speaker 1: --in some respect. So, that's what you're--
Speaker 2: And you're not just given the opportunities, because women have had a difficult enough time. But it's--they're more accepted by the people who still have the power because, you know, they, they see them as their daughters, their wives or whatever. And even more so now that their daughters are going to college and going to law school, you know, they're more in tune, more apt to give women business, but they have really no, no real connection to us.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right. Culturally and socially (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly, that's right.
Story_ID: 672850
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your rise up through, you know, so you, you do this commission [American Bar Association Commission on Women in the Profession].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then and that's, that--how is it viewed at that point and how well promoted is the work?
Speaker 2: It is extremely promoted. And the president of the ABA [American Bar Association] chooses topics that he wants to focus on for the media, usually three things. And he, one, that was one of them.  Mike Greco [Michael S. Greco] from Boston [Massachusetts]. Very interested in the results of that, just extremely. And then, it was like, it was like a thirst of knowledge. We had--for knowledge--We had a seminar on the report at the annual meeting. It was in San Francisco [California]. And they had to let people in and out periodically, because there were too many people for the fire code to come, yes, to come in a row. So they had to wait for some people to come out so others could come in. And then, you know, there was such interest in it around the country. And I--Arin Reeves, who was the co-author and really the social scientist, she, she was sick and couldn't come to the annual meeting, right, so--which is how I got even more attention and was able to explain it more, and also because I was a practicing attorney who had experienced a lot of what was, you know, of the results that were, were in the report. And it, it got a lot of attention around the country.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what, were there, was there any, any group saying that they didn't like the results?
Speaker 2: Oh, the blogs were horrible, the emails that came in. They said it was a lie and get over it and all sorts of things. There were a lot of hateful emails that came as a result of it.
Speaker 1: And you think from the law firm--the, the law firm community? Or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have no idea where they came from.
Speaker 1: Okay. Oh--
Speaker 2: I think most of it was individuals. I don't think that anybody who was in leadership--I think that there was generally a disbelief on their part. One of the presentations I gave in, in Boston [Massachusetts], I made my managing partner come, so that he could listen to what I was saying and the results. And he was like, "Had no idea." And that's when I became the chief diversity officer at my firm [Brown and Childress; Brown, Childress, Lofton and Wolfe, East Orange, New Jersey] (laughter). Yes.
Story_ID: 672851
Speaker 1: So, can you talk about when you joined the firm? You know, the firm you're--you're still at that--
Speaker 2: That--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Different names. Different name (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But the firm merged, right?
Speaker 2: Several times.
Speaker 1: Okay, several times, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But so, when do you leave your solo practice? That's, so that--we missed that part of the story (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, the end of 1999, January 1st, I joined Duane Morris. It was Duane Morris and Heckscher [Duane Morris LLP]. And it was--
Speaker 1: Oh you did--oh, sure!
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm. Cheryl [HistoryMaker Cheryl Blackwell Bryson]--
Speaker 1: Cheryl--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I--did you know--how do you know?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yeah, Cheryl was my partner.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Cheryl was a good friend of mine!
Speaker 2: She was my partner, law partner.
Speaker 1: I see, okay. But how did you know I was going to mention her name?
Speaker 2: Because I had to figure that you knew Cheryl.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, sorry, okay.
Speaker 2: You know, it's a very small world we live in (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Small world, okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, unfortunately passed. But, okay, so--wait a minute. So, you're--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) (Unclear).
Speaker 1: --you're a solo practitioner. This--
Speaker 2: No, I did have a law firm that at one point had fourteen lawyers. Yes. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, you didn't explain that!
Speaker 2: You didn't ask me (laughter). Yeah, we had fourteen lawyers and so many, you know, you hear about different lawyers who passed through our firm, you know, who have gone on and done other things, you know, came there, got some training, moved on.
Speaker 1: But can you talk about some of them, because I, I mean most--this, that's a large black firm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry. Okay.
Speaker 2: It is, yeah it is.
Speaker 1: So, was it, were you the largest in, in--
Speaker 2: Yes, in New Jersey, yes we were. Yes.
Speaker 1: So, can you talk--okay?
Speaker 2: Oh sure, I mean, I can. So, it was, first it was Brown--Brown and Childress. Then it was Brown, Childress & Philp [ph.].
Speaker 1: Now who was Childress?
Speaker 2: Childress, Lou Childress.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Louis Childress [Louis Childress, Jr.]. And then it was Brown, Lofton, Childress and Wolfe [East Orange, New Jersey], which was--Lofton and Wolfe was another black law firm. They were, had been around longer, but then they merged with us. And then we had, oh, all sorts of lawyers to, to, to come through and to work for us at various points in time. But at that point, you know, we had the work from Ford [Ford Motor Company]. We had work from General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company]. We had a lot of work for the State of New Jersey; and it was, life was good. We bought a building. We owned a building. Then the building got to be too much, so then we moved to, back to a regular office building. But there were many people who, young lawyers who came, learned certain skills and moved on, which was not a problem. But we, yeah we had fourteen lawyers at, for a long period of time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you know, this, okay, this is, I--the reason that I'm a- you should talk more about this and the telling of your, your history because it's not any place on your, in your history I mean in the--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --in the written history.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, the reason I say you, I'm sorry I'm chiding you a little bit but--
Speaker 2: Oh it's okay (laughter). I don't mind.
Speaker 1: The, the reason that I'm chiding you is that, first of all, black firms merging, that doesn't happen that often.
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: And, and you know, and we left the story where Jim Cole [James O. Cole] was giving you business.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then the next thing, you know, you--so, how was that? I mean and, and running a firm is different than even being--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --a sole practitioner or--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: Being responsible for peoples' pay, paying the taxes, and all of those different administrative things, and also generating income at the same time, and practicing. So, yeah, it was, it was, it was a lot of work. It was a really good experience though, you know. I, I think about a young man who ran for president--well, secretary, State Bar [New Jersey State Bar Association], and you automatically become president over time, and he, at the time, he was the first black law clerk that Ann Thompson [Anne E. Thompson] ever hired in her career as a federal judge. And he should have graduated number one from his class at Seton Hall [Seton Hall University School of Law, Newark, New Jersey] but they finagled it so that he was number two or something like that. But, you know, you know, when he was running he reminded me, "Remember I worked for you." "Yes, I remember you worked for me." And, and some people who tell me later that they worked for me like, I don't always remember, and I thought I had a really good memory. But, there are a lot of people who worked for us because we were the black firm, and we would give people an opportunity when they couldn't find other work. We trained a lot of lawyers.
Story_ID: 672852
Speaker 1: Your firm you s- can you just tell me, I know you went through the names real quickly, but can you talk about the growth of it and who the clients were and all of that?  Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it started with, I was by myself when I first left Corporate America. And then Lou Childress [Louis Childress, Jr.] and I had gone to law school together [at Seton Hall University of Law, Newark, New Jersey]. He had worked on Wall Street [New York, New York]. He was, he was a night student. And so, then we became Brown and Childress. And then I don't know how Earl Philp [ph.]--Lou must have known him. Earl Philp came, and it was Brown, Childress and Philp [ph.]. Alphabetical was the, was the thing, not that--whatever. So, it was alphabetical. And then we, you know, like I mentioned before Jim Cole [James O. Cole] gave me some work. And Lou was doing more, a lot of personal injury and real estate. I didn't like either one of those things. Then I met Cardell Cooper who was the mayor, and I started doing work for the city [East Orange, New Jersey], you know, civil rights cases, but on the defense side. And, you know, he, he provided me with a lot of opportunities, and I was able to do work--I applied to do work for the state, for the attorney general's office, and started doing a lot of work for them. And then we got a really good thing, 'cause the DMV [Department of Motor Vehicles] had this program where they would suspend your license if you had so many tickets. And so we just got like all of their collections work and, and started doing that. And so, we were able to, we had enough business to sustain other lawyers. And so, you know, we were real happy to give other people opportunities who couldn't find employment. We did not look at their grades, you know, so much or anything like that. Definitely didn't look at anybody whether they were on law review or anything like that, because we weren't on law review. And, you know, and we had been afforded some opportunities and felt like you needed to give other people opportunities as well. Everybody didn't work out well. They had to be let go. But, you know, still, you know, taking a chance on people was very important. But, you know, and then Bob Archie [Robert L. Archie, Jr.], like I said, you know, I had gotten the work with Ford [Ford Motor Company] and started doing the Ford work and, but then when it came to, you know, when they started these different programs (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now when you, when you got the work with Ford, was, was the general counsel black at that point?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: They did have--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, but this is part of their diversity initiative?
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was, that was early on. So, and then, but, you know, you got to know some of the people through the commercial law section and then through the demonstration project that Dennis [Dennis Archer] started. So, that's how I know [HistoryMaker] Demetrius Carney and all those people (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, can you talk about the demonstration part, project? 'Cause you just referenced it real quickly.
Speaker 2: Right. So, there was a demonstration project, and it was basically to demonstrate that black people could do corporate work. But the only way to be in the demonstration project: if you were already doing work for companies. So, sort of like your clients had to recommend that you be in it. Because I remember I tried to get in it and I was told no, I couldn't get in it. And then Jim Cole and a couple other people like insisted that I be a part of it. And then it exposed you to other companies to try and do work too. I don't know how much work I got from that. I do know that I got work from the, from the commer- being involved in the commercial law section. But even then, a lot of the times it was, you know, people would try you out. A lot of times it would be a one-off kind of work, and it wouldn't be like the highest level kind of work that you could do. So, it would still be a struggle, 'cause you, you had to work harder to make more money because the cases were much smaller. And, you know, the theory is, is that, you know, if the case is worth more money they need, you know, the people giving you the work didn't want to put their reputation on the line with the people who are higher up in the corporation, because that--whereas the, the big law firms lose, you know, they didn't want to say, "Well you've hired this minority law firm. They lost, you know. We gave you a chance." So, so you know, you get the smaller kind of cases and the one-off cases in your region. So, it--that's what makes it harder. The grind is just harder.
Story_ID: 672853
Speaker 1: And at this point how--what is the state of black general counsels at this point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, almost none.
Speaker 1: Zero, okay.
Speaker 2: Oh almost none. Yeah, almost none.
Speaker 1: So, this is--okay.
Speaker 2: So, so, you know I think that--go ahead.
Speaker 1: Go on.
Speaker 2: I think that Jim Cole [James O. Cole] was one of the first general counsels when he went to Republic Industries [Republic Services, Inc.; Republic Services, Inc.] in Florida. That's how he moved to Florida. And they owned at the time Alamo national car rental [Alamo Rent A Car], and, you know, other groups like that, so.
Speaker 1: So, then a firm like--so a black firm then at this point in time are--black mayors are important.
Speaker 2: Yes, very important. Government is very important because a lot of work comes from government, including--that's how a lot of black people started doing bond work like Bob Archie [Robert L. Archie, Jr.]. Being in 'The Redbook' ['The Redbook: A Manuel on Legal Style'] was real important and--
Speaker 1: Maynard Jackson played a huge role (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exact- oh yes. Oh absolutely. So, that, yeah that became extremely important and important work that you could get. And that, that is how I was really able to, you know, having that connection with Cardell Cooper, and then getting introduced to people in the state. And then when the state, when there was a ruling that the state had to provide--the attorney general's office had to provide legal representation to the county prosecutors' offices, then I had so much work, so much work. And it was enough work to go around. And that's, you know, kind of the fallacy. Some of the issues I have now with some of the corporations, to me, trying--creating schisms in a sense, you know, because they're saying that, they--we want to give all of our work to the women and minority owned law firms. And then another group is saying we want to give our work to the women and minorities who are in big firms, when they got enough to do both, you know. So, it's still, you know, you're still fighting for, you know, that small amount of, of legal spend.
Story_ID: 672854
Speaker 1: So you're in New Jersey. Who are your counterparts in, you know, that are, that have these firms in different parts of the country that you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh it's, it's, it's [HistoryMaker] Demetrius Carney in Chicago [Illinois]. It's Stephen Pugh [Stephen H. Pugh] in Chicago. It's Bob Archie [Robert L. Archie, Jr.] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]. It's Otis McGee and Gary Lafayette in California. It's, oh, Steven Wright in Boston [Massachusetts]. Everybody's at a big firm now. It's--you know, there are some people at Curtis Mack in, in Atlanta [Georgia]. (Pause) They were all over.
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Cora Walker in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Was there ever any discussion of any mergers between cities? You know, like--
Speaker 2: There was. So, there was a consort--separate consortium that was formed. I wasn't in that, but it was Bob Archie, it was Otis McGee, it was Demetrius Carney, it was--who else was in that? It was, in California, it was--I was just with them last week (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, I don't know California.
Speaker 2: They're with Saggio now. They merged with Saggio Gonzalez [sic. Gonzalez Saggio and Harlan LLP]--what--Irwin Evans [Irwin S. Evans], Evans and Atkins.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or Atkins and Evans, um-hm. Nelson [Nelson Atkins] and Irwin, they went.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, but that, was it just a personality thing? Or there just wasn't enough business nationwide to make?
Speaker 2: They were the boys.
Speaker 1: It was the boys.
Speaker 2: There were no girls in there.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't know if it was intentional, but there were no girls.
Speaker 1: So, they didn't even come asking?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh. Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Were there others like you?  That's what--'cause when I think about that--
Speaker 2: Cora Walker. I think she, she was the head of her firm [Walker and Bailey]. I was the head of mine [Brown and Childress; Brown, Childress, Lofton and Wolfe, East Orange, New Jersey]. I don't know if any other women at the time.
Speaker 1: (Whispers) I see.
Speaker 2: I never thought about it until you just said it.
Speaker 1: Because I was thinking all the ones I know--
Speaker 2: Men (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) they were, I mean, I know Eileen Letts [Eileen M. Letts].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But then, you know, I think of that really--
Speaker 2: They're a little later, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. So, and, and you're large too. 'Cause I'm not sure how large Demetri--well they, I just didn't--now the--I just know that they were all men, I think, over there. But I'm not sure. Maybe they had some, but they were, it was men. Now, the thing that I, I want to ask is do you feel pressure besides the, you know searching for crumbs in terms of never getting, you know, the same kind of work? But do you feel pressure politically? You know are, are there pressures for donations and things like that, or contributions in the community? Or is it a symbiotic relationship, you know, in some respects? I'm just trying to un-
Speaker 2: You mean back then?
Speaker 1: Yeah, back then.
Speaker 2: I didn't feel a lot of pressure, pressure to donate. I did, but I didn't feel a lot of pressure to donate a certain amount, a particular amount, or anything like that, never. And definitely not with the state work, none at all, none. None. I donated to Cardell [Cooper] because I thought he was great (laughter) I mean, you know, not, you know--and, and I don't know that, you know, he may have said I'm having this or whatever. But, unh-uh, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what--
Speaker 2: Probably, which is probably why he was able to raise more money (laughter).
Story_ID: 672855
Speaker 1: So, why do you decide--so, it just gets too much?
Speaker 2: It gets to be too much.
Speaker 1: Just too much?
Speaker 2: It's just too much. Too much staff. I didn't want to be in charge of anybody. And I wanted to just be able to practice law. And I didn't think I was making enough to fully fund my son's [Dijaun Brown] college.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And I wanted to be sure that I could do that.
Speaker 1: So, what is the process then; and how does the transition work? Because a lot, lots of people talk about it being a difficult--
Speaker 2: So, what happened with me is that in 1996, Duane Morris [Duane Morris LLP] opened a New Jersey office, and Bob Archie [Robert L. Archie, Jr.] told me about it, 'cause by now he has merged his firm [Atkinson, Myers, Archie and Wallace] into Duane Morris in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]. And he tells me about it. And I go through the process. I fill out all the papers. You know you list all your business, how--what can you bring to the firm and so forth. And I go through the entire process. And then I said no, I'm not interested in this big firm stuff. I don't want to do it. So, then in 1999, I'm thinking, I can't handle this much more. And I called Bob, he said okay. So, we started the process again. They were very happy, 'cause they didn't have to use the headhunter for me. And it was funny, because when I went back to Philadelphia, David Sykes who was the managing partner, he said, "I feel like I'm having deja vu." (Laughter) Anyway, so I started there in January 2000, and, and stayed there for five years and seven months.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah. It was, it was, it was an interesting time. But, you know, the good thing is I became even closer to Bob and Nolan [Nolan B. Dawkins]. And there were some good people there. They actually gave me a party when I left. And the then chairman came up to try to talk me out of it.  But, you know, once you say you're leaving, you have to go; I don't think there's ever any turning back. And I, it was a long time to convince me, because I had said that when I paid my son's last tuition payment I was done with big firms. I was going to move on and do something else.
Story_ID: 672856
Speaker 1: A headhunter kept calling me about this firm, Edwards and Angell. And, and I'm like, they're no different than any other firm. And so she said, "Just please talk to them," I mean, months and months and months and months. And so I finally did. I said, "Well I have to meet at seven o'clock in the morning for breakfast," and thinking that, you know, that's such an obscene time; and they said okay. It was like ten after ten, the first time I looked at my watch, we were still talking. And I also told them, I asked them how many people of color they had, because I was not interested in being the lone ranger at this point in my career or blazing any new trails. So, they had, even though they were a firm of--they were smaller than Duane Morris [Duane Morris LLP], which I liked too. They only--that was a firm of about three hundred lawyers. They had three other African American female partners. Unheard of. Two of them at the time had been there eighteen years. They had grown up in the firm and made partner. Oh yeah. I'm like, they must be doing something right over here (laughter). So, I, I did join them, and it, it was just wonderful. Very collegial, very open, very transparent. And then we merged shortly thereafter with Palmer and Dodge. So we were Edwards Angell Palmer and Dodge. And I still like them. Just you know it was, you could pick up the phone and call the managing partner if there was an issue. I remember when we first merged with the other firm, we had co-managing partners, and we had a big women's retreat, and one of the co-managing partners made a blunder at the women's retreat, said something really dumb. You know, he said it innocently, but it was just dumb. The women went nuts. A first year associate went up to him and said--African American woman, "How could you say that? Do you know how inappropriate that was?" People can't believe that an African American first year associate went up to a white co-managing partner and said that. But that was the kind of firm it was. You could go, you know, you didn't have to be fearful, you know, about things. There were some things that they needed to learn, but, you know, when I came, I'm like, we got to interview at Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.]. We got to do better than this, you know. And so, you know, they let me switch things, change things. And I, I, I really liked--then we merged with a London [England] firm. Didn't change the name. Then we merged with a D.C. [Washington, D.C.] firm. Didn't change the name. Then we merged with Wildman, Harrold, Allen and Dixon.
Speaker 2: (Pause) That--Demetrius [HistoryMaker Demetrius Carney] was there too I think--
Speaker 1: Before.
Speaker 2: Before?
Speaker 1: Yeah, before (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, then he moved o-?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, now, so--'cause there are all these mergers occurring in the--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so, with each merger that didn't change the culture of the firm?
Speaker 1: The last one did. That one did. That one did. So--
Speaker 2: So, the, the other question I have--
Speaker 1: Now we're Locke Lord [Locke Lord LLP].
Speaker 2: You're Locke Lor- okay, I had read that, okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: The question I have about this is--well, one, where did the fir- your firm originate?
Speaker 1: Providence, Rhode Island.
Speaker 2: So, it's a Prov- okay. Huh.  And was it the largest firm in Providence at the--?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah. Oh, yeah, Edwards and Angell. They have these streets named after them.
Speaker 2: (Whispers) I see. And this is in direct, direct contradiction to Duane Morris in many way--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (Nods head).
Speaker 2: Was it you and Cheryl [HistoryMaker Cheryl Blackwell Bryson] at the--
Speaker 1: Cheryl and I were the only two female--
Speaker 2: Black female (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) partners. Yes. And she was there before me.
Story_ID: 672857
Speaker 1: And so, what was the experience there?
Speaker 2: There was, you know, there was the chairman, and basically what the chairman said is what happened, period. So, you know, there had to be sort of absolute loyalty to the chairman. You know, people didn't have independent opinions, pretty much. That's why I was so stunned when I had my first partner meeting in, at Edwards and Angell [Locke Lord LLP], and they said, "Any questions?" And people asked questions. I'm like, "Oh no, they're going to get in trouble." (Laughter) Because no one talked except the chairman and the chief financial officer at our partner meetings at Duane Morris [Duane Morris LLP]. That's it. Now I've got some good friendships that came out of Duane Morris, you know. But, as a firm, it was not a good fit for me.
Speaker 1: Okay. And it was Ed, Edward--Edwards as I remem- so, okay at, at your current firm--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --they've been supportive of your work with--
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) No, supportive of everything I ever did. And so, the first person I talked to, the first managing partner was Walter Reed, who was managing partner first. He's the first person I talked to, and he'll be here, he's coming this weekend also. And then there was, there was a merger, and so then it was, it was--and I also talked to Alan Levin, who was very powerful in the firm. And he said, "Why you want to do that?" (Laughter) But supportive nevertheless. And then Bob Shuftan [Robert Shuftan], who was at Wildman [Wildman, Harrold, Allen and Dixon], very supportive. Even when I had my exploratory committee meetings when we were in Chicago [Illinois] and met at seven a.m. on Sunday morning, he came. And even allowed from someone in the group an abusive question, which I thought he handled well. And then after that it was Alan Levin, who was extremely supportive. And, I mean, just--when I say supportive I mean beyond what one would expect, certainly beyond what, what I would expect, to the point where it's like anything you need for us to do. So we became a full firm member of the ABA [American Bar Association] where everybody in the firm became a member. You know, they were supportive of my family. Like, they--we get points and so forth, so they used some of the points for my father [Wilbur Brown] and his wife [Thelma Stamper Brown] to come up on the train to Boston [Massachusetts] last year. You know, the hotel was covered, you know, for, for them, for my family. In addition to the big party we had at the Boston Public Library that I did with William [ph.], then they had another party for me at the firm afterwards where the whole firm could come, and they gave me wonderful gifts; and they were all there. They were all there.
Story_ID: 672858
Speaker 1: So you, you decide, you're on the Board of Governors [American Bar Association Board of Governors]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --right, at this point; and can you talk about--'cause I think it's three years, it comes t- you know, you--the, the idea germinates maybe three years--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --before. So, how does it germinate? And why is this, is it a light bulb or is it someone whispering in your ear that this is possible?
Speaker 2: Well, Dennis [Dennis Archer] mentioned it to me a few years before that; and I'm like no, I'm not interested, so we didn't talk about it anymore. And then I went on the Board of Governors and--
Speaker 1: And does he, I'm sorry, does he mention it because he sees your progression?
Speaker 2: I guess he saw something I didn't see. And, and then I serve on the Board of Governors; and in my last year, I chair one of the three committees of the board, which looks at every entity--evaluates every entity in the organization. And as a chair I'm also on the executive committee of the Board of Governors. A lot happened that year. We fired an executive director, we hired a new executive director. A lot was going--lots of issues with the pension program, lots and lots and lots of issues going on. And so I came to know far more about the ABA [American Bar Association] and I said, hm, I think I can do this (laughter). And you know I developed the, the, some standards which they are still using on how we evaluate the entities within the ABA. And, and so then I listened to people who said, "You should probably run for president." I'm like, first I poo-pooed it, because it was never any goal of mine. This was in 2009, and you know, more people are talking. So then I called Dennis and asked him what did he think. He was like over the moon. And, and so we started strategizing. And then there were some people who were really mean to me, because you can't really say you're running for office. There is a process. You can say that you have an exploratory committee on January 1st of one year, then January--so that was January 2012 I said that, but you got to sort of create a buzz. So, January 1st, 2012, I formed an exploratory committee to see whether I should run for president elect. And at the first meeting, the only available time was--also talked to my state delegation too, in New Jersey, because they have to get on board with it too. And they were very excited. New Jersey has not had a president of the ABA in sixty-two years, so they were very excited. And so, all of them came to exploratory committee and can I tell you the young lawyers turned out for the meeting, and it was so many people at seven a.m. on Sunday morning where I could serve no food, nothing to drink. That's the ABA rules. In fact, it's called the Clifford rule. (Laughter) You know, they don't want people buying elections, so you can't, you can't serve anything. So, they came at seven o'clock. We set up for about forty people. We had to bring in chairs. Dennis was out bringing in chairs and they're like, "Mr. Past President, you bringing in chairs?" He said, "I do whatever is necessary." It was, it was hysterical. And the place was packed. And that sort of sends a signal to kind of anybody else who might be thinking about running, so then the spies are in the room too. And they go back and tell you know various people what's going on. And so I ended up running unopposed, which was a beautiful thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which is a, a beautiful and amazing thing too.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yes, it was great, yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 672859
Speaker 1: How helpful--talk about Dennis [Dennis Archer]. Because he had been the first--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --African American president.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Not female, but African American president. Did he talk about his process of becoming as a parallel for you to follow? Or was he, did he talk about his whole administration and, you know, what pitfalls? I mean, what do you come into this position having as beneficiary?
Speaker 2: Okay. Well, first of all I know Dennis from the NBA [National Bar Association] first, before I knew him from the ABA [American Bar Association] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because he was president of the NBA?
Speaker 2: Right, right. So I met Dennis in like 1981 through the NBA, and so I know him from there. And so, I know that Dennis to me has always been the consummate politician, and that, you know, he knows people. He stays connected with people. People in the ABA know and respect him, and he knows a lot more about it than I do, and so I am going to always go to him for guidance and suggestions. And he was one of the first people that I talked to and asked him what was his thoughts about me seeking the office of president elect. And, like I said, he was very happy, very enthused. He said, "I have to come out of retirement with my politics." He said, "I retired," he said, "but I got to come out for this." So, you know, we talked about it. We talked about other people who might potentially be running, and basically he was available 24/7, any question that I had. I would send him an email, "Dennis, I need to talk. Call me at this number right now." I mean, it didn't matter what time it was. Or, "I'm about to get on a plane. I'm landing at such and such time. Call me then." And so, you know, and even there were some people who criticized me, saying, "You can't just rely on Dennis." But I wasn't just relying on him, because he was telling me the other people who I needed to talk to. So, "And you need to be this place and you need to be this place and you need to stay at this place this amount of time, you know, so that, you know, people can see you and appreciate the fact that you are actually there." And just, you know, you know, there were other people who gave me advice and other people who helped too, but, you know, there's no comparison.
Speaker 1: That's like the old boys' network and the real form in the black community (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It--yeah, exactly, um-hm. And then I had Wayne Positan, who was our state delegate from the other old boys' network. He placed my name at the nomination, knocked it out of the park; and, and also he's connected to some of the other old boys, and it was just (gesture).
Speaker 1: So, you had New Jersey behind you, and you had the black community behind you?
Speaker 2: Exactly (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, because that--for you, you represent its first time in sixty-two years.
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 672860
Speaker 1: So, what do you want to do, you know, on the--this is your weekend.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, what do you want your platform to be? And what do you want to say that you contributed?
Speaker 2: Okay. So, I have three initiatives, and I am using the four goals of the ABA [American Bar Association]. The four goals are related to membership, related to the profession, related to the rule of law, and enhancing diversity and inclusion in the profession. So, focusing on one, membership. I am doing what we're calling ABA Everyday [sic. Everyday ABA]. Every day--you know, people talk about you know what is the benefit, what's the value of the ABA? Every day that I am the president, and I understand that the membership department is going to continue it after I'm gone. They've invested in software and technology so that they can keep doing it, to provide a member benefit every single day of the year. We have, we have the ABA Journal, which I didn't realize the membership department pays for two pages. One page they have, they're going to use just for the ABA Every Day, and it will have a calendar of what the free benefit will be every day. We're using social media. Nobody will get any emails. People hate emails. No one will get any emails to tell them what it is, but we'll--they'll know what the free benefits are. There will be banners that will go across the website so that people will understand the benefit of their membership, and hopefully we can get some retention at a minimum with regard to members on that front. And people really like the idea. We have asked all the sections, divisions, and entities to provide content. I said that I wanted 250 pieces of content by June 15th so that we would be ready to launch on August 5th, which the conference is over August 4th. The first benefit will come August 5th. And we got about 300 pieces of content by June 15th. The schedule is all set up for August through September as to what everybody is going to get on those days. They'll get a free chapter in a book. They'll get a free webinar. They'll get a free CLE [Continuing Learning Education]. They'll get a number of different things. Sometimes they'll get a book. They'll get various tips on things. And then, then, I think as a benefit to our members we, we have this National Pro Bono Week. Lawyers provide more pro bono services than any other profession, and so I wanted to highlight that. So, on October 30th we're going to have what we're calling And Justice for All: ABA Day of Service, where we're trying to mobilize tens and tens and tens of thousands of lawyers to provide pro bono services. So we're going to create activity all during the week: social media, tweeting, who's leading, Cook County Bar Associate [sic. Cook County Bar Association] right now is in the lead. They've got 95 percent of their lawyers who are participating. Make it a contest among like groups and give prizes too. And hopefully to let--give publicity as to the good works that lawyers do and also to encourage more lawyers to do pro bono work.
Story_ID: 672861
Speaker 1: And then I have this Main Street--AB- AB- Main Street--ABA Main Street, where I am trying to visit at least two states every month to encourage people to become members of the ABA [American Bar Association]. And while I'm visiting the states, I am also visiting a Boys and Girls Club [Boys and Girls Clubs of America]. Picked the Boys and Girls Club because there's one everywhere. And so just wanting them to see who I am, to know what's possible for them, to know the different things that lawyers do. I found that so many of them, they know about lawyers, they don't really know that they do--what they do. They think all lawyers are litigators. And so I've had some really great experiences and interactions with them. I went to the James Jordan Club [James R. Jordan Boys and Girls Club, Chicago, Illinois] yesterday. It was wonderful. And thirty-five of them are coming on Monday to walk with me to the well of the house as the gavel is passed. So, it'll, it'll be, you know--and then two young ladies will shadow me all day on Sunday. And I did the same thing in Houston [Texas]. Three young ladies shadowed me all day during the mid-year meeting. And I've had other young people come to where I'm speaking so that they can be, not just exposed to me, but exposed to a wide range of lawyers, so that they can see you know what a lot of different people do. And, it's just been a tremendous experience. And now the people who want me to come to visit them in their states, they include in their letter of invitation: "And we have a Boys and Girls Club and such and such a place that you can visit." So it's been great. And now I've got going with me to the visits, I've got young lawyers and law students going with me on the visits too. So that's been great. And finally, my big thing, diversity and inclusion. So, I've created a commission. It's called Diversity and Inclusion Commission 360 [sic. Diversity and Inclusion 360 Commission], because we're going to look at, try to look at everything. And one, we're looking internally and externally. Looking at what the ABA is doing, because again, I don't think that we can go out and tell people what it is that they should be doing without having our house in order. So we're looking at all of the entities across the association to see what they're doing with regard to their diversity and inclusion efforts and try to create uniform guidelines for all of them to follow, so that we can have true inclusion in the profession and within the ABA. And from an external point of view, we are working--we're developing training materials for judges, prosecutors and public defenders, if we have enough money left over for them, on implicit bias. Some judges have been trained on implicit bias, but the National Center for State Courts, 'cause we're collaborating with different groups including the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice].  Say that they've had some implicit bias training--they know what it is; and now that we know, how do we fix ourselves? So we're going to focus on that type of training. Now that we know about this, what do we do about it? Prosecutors, you know, it's my belief that they have--probably they're the most powerful people in the judicial system, because they decide whether you're going to be prosecuted in the first place and with what. So, by the time it gets to the judge, the judge can be limited in what he or she does. So, we're going to provide training for them, the, the--on implicit bias and develop some written material so that after their training they have something to refer to, to keep them abreast and to keep them refreshed on the impact of implicit bias. We also are looking at the economics of the legal profession and what companies can do, how they can create better programs even though there's the LCLD [Leadership Council on Legal Diversity], the MCCA [Minority Corporate Counsel Association], you know, other groups that have addressed this issue, what can we do that can be standardized, so that we can advance this in a much faster way than we've done over the past twenty years.  And so, we want to have points that--we want to see this has happened in a year from now, this has happened three years from now, this has happened ten years from now. And we want some real, tangible results. We also want to bring resolutions to the House of Delegates to recommend that states require mandatory CLE just like they require mandatory ethics credits. Believe it or not, the Code of Professional Responsibility does not have any antidiscrimination clauses in it. We're going to bring a resolution to try to fix the Model Rules of Professional Responsibility [Model Rules of Professional Conduct] to do that. And, you know, we want to just really increase the economic power of lawyers, because if we give them power, then they can ensure that younger people are retained and that they have positions of authority in their law firms.
Story_ID: 672862
Speaker 1: So these are grand plans you have?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you have how long to do it in?
Speaker 2: One year.
Speaker 1: One year?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, one year. Some things I started, like I've already been to like ten Boys and Girls Clubs [Boys and Girls Clubs of America] already, and I've been to several states already. I counted them. I've been to twenty-seven states already. So, I need to still get to--in Mississippi, they said no president had been there in twenty-three years.  Yeah. So, so I was happy to have visited there. But I'm going to North Dakota. And I'm going to Montana, not in the cold months though. I'm going to Montana, September; and North Dakota in June.  So you know and I'll probably get to Alaska where I don't think anybody's ever been and Maine and New Hampshire and Vermont, you know some of the little states where people have never been (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, you're going to be a hands-on--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 672863
Speaker 1: Now the, the thing I, I'm talking to you when the legal profession has had a lot of change.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And it goes from some people saying don't go into law school, you know, the numbers, you know, you, you pointed to the numbers earlier about--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --one and, the 1 and 2 percent.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So can you speak of--and you've had this long--you've had this long career, even outlasted the people--not outlasted, but you've gone way up where the people, you know, the two that recommended you from, you know, from New Orleans [Louisiana], you know. So, I guess I--I'm asking you where you see law as a career for someone of color as you sit here, and what your hope may be for the future?
Speaker 2: So, let me just start by saying 88 percent of all lawyers in the country are white. So, when you talk about whether people should go to law school, when you talk about our community, I would strongly encourage it, because there's still not, we still are at a very lower percentage relative to our population. There are opportunities. I think that it's time for us to start thinking in more innovative ways. There are a lot of people who are in need of legal services who can't afford four fifty, five hundred, a thousand dollars an hour for legal services. I think that when you use innovation and technology that you can get a lot more done in terms of servicing people. There are so many people who need lawyers, so many people who are underserved. And so, whereas yes, there are a lot of lawyers, but there's still places where we need lawyers, especially lawyers of color and, you know, other lawyers with, with--who have been traditionally underrepresented. I think that, you know, what I tell young lawyers is that, you know, develop an expertise in an area; and, and to me one of the best ways to develop an expertise or find out what may be on the cutting edge is to read The Wall Street Journal and the business section of The New York Times because that will tell you, give you guidance as to what's new on the horizon. Because all those business decisions will affect the law. And, and, and think of other places where you can live other than major cities like Chicago [Illinois] and New York [New York] and D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and Atlanta [Georgia] and L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and San Francisco [California], because there are a lot of opportunities in the middle of the country. And that you can stay anywhere and live anywhere for two years to develop your expertise. And then maybe you can move on once you've developed an expertise to another location that may be more suitable for you. Or, you may find that you actually like it there. You know an example is that I've had this mentoring group since the report came out with, with associates in New Jersey. It started that way but a lot of them like the report said ended up using it, using--leaving their law firms. But you know I tell them, I said don't just think of places that are you know the big cities. I said think of other places. And so one of the people in my group said, "Well I'm moving beginning of Janu- at the end of December to start a job." I'm like, "Where?"  She said, "Portland, Oregon." I'm like, "Why are you going to Portland, Oregon?"  She said, "'Cause you told me to. You told me to look outside and I did and I found the position in Portland, Oregon." And she had to come back to attend for some family business. But she said, "I can't wait to get back to Portland." She, she decided she loves it there. So, so, you know, so people have to start thinking that the only opportunities are on, in the big cities. There are many opportunities that exist outside of the big cities. And I think that for people of color, I still encourage them to--in a big way, to go to law school, because there are not enough lawyers who look like us.
Story_ID: 672864
Speaker 1: And do you, what do you want to see the future then? Okay, if this happens, if people follow your advice, what do you, what period of time will you see a different future?
Speaker 2: If my plan is effective it will be in ten years that there will be a dramatic change. There will be sustained change--that's my hope. That inclusion will maybe not naturally but will be, will more permeate all sorts of organizations.
Speaker 1: And who's going to be critical to that, to that happening?  Who, who are the, who are the participants that have to be at the table?
Speaker 2: The participants who have to be at the table are law schools, corporations--the heads I'm talking about--managing partners or chair persons of, of law firms.  Those are the main people. And the, the top heads of government agencies--they all have to be at the table.
Speaker 1: And what if that doesn't happen?
Speaker 2: It will.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: I've got them all on my commission. (Laughter) I've got a U.S. attorney on my commission. I've got three general counsels on my commission. I've got head of law firm, deans of law school, chancellor of a university. There, there--we're going to make it happen.
Story_ID: 672865
Speaker 1: Now I've spent this whole interview on your, you know, on your career.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I have to go back because I, you know we've mentioned your son [Dijaun Brown].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But I have to ask you because you adopted your son.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you were, he was eight years old--
Speaker 2: He was eight years old.
Speaker 1: --and you were forty--?
Speaker 2: Forty, forty-four maybe.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And can you tell me what was that decision and I mean how did it happen?
Speaker 2: So, I always liked children and I had threatened (air quotes) to adopt for a long time. And I was at a friend's house over the holidays, and I was playing with somebody's child. And she said, "Oh Paulette [HistoryMaker Paulette Brown], I know this nice little boy who needs to be adopted. He's about four years old." So I said, "Okay, what do I need to do? Tell me more." So, she told me he was in the system; that his mother had not given up his parental rights. And so then I found out I--what I needed to do. I needed to get finger printed. Since I represented the police in East Orange [New Jersey]. That was easy to do. They took my fingerprints right away and I registered. And then I went to--they have like an adoption resource center within the state, within the Division of Youth and Family Services. And I went and I met him in March. And we visited there. And, he--we talked for a while, and then he still had visitation with his birth mother. And we visited again and I--then they came back and told me that his mother had decided to give up her parental rights, and so then he was with foster care, and he was always with foster care. It was a horrible place actually. He had been with a good family before but they moved to Atlanta [Georgia] and couldn't take him because he wasn't free to go. That's what they say, they call it free. And so, Easter was going to be his first visit with me at my house. And I went to pick him up and the foster mother said h- "I bought him a suit for Easter because--but I took it back to the store." I'm like, "Why?" She said, "Because I fixed ziti for the children and I fixed pork chops for me and my husband and he tried to steal a piece of the pork chop." Yes. I was mortified. So, they had told me, his psychologist had told me that she wouldn't give him any snacks after school or anything like that and, you know, just stuff like that. So, anyway, so then after he came Easter--and what they, usually they just let you stay a day, but he spent the weekend.  So my whole family came up from Baltimore [Maryland]. And we had big Easter dinner and he got up and started cleaning up the table, and my crazy nephew Chris [ph.] who, both of them are here right now. They both came with me like they--my children, my--Chris is almost forty, and my son is now thirty-one. And Chris said, "What are you doing? You're setting a bad example for everybody." And he said, "You'll get over that." Anyway, it was hysterical. He's still a comedian. But, so, after that weekend his social worker, he had a really good caseworker, said, "Can he move in?" I'm like, "Are you kidding me?" I'm like, "I'm not ready!" So, she said, "How soon? 'Cause he's really in a bad situation." So, I said okay. He moved in May 1st. I met him in March. He moved in May 1st. And I felt so terrible because--I had three bedrooms, but I didn't have like boy furniture, you know. I had a guest room, and the other room was my office, plus junk. And so, you know, it was really strange, because every time somebody came to the house--'cause everybody wanted to meet him--every time somebody came to the house he wanted to take them to their room and I was like embarrassed. I'm like, "You can't keep taking people to the guest room." I said, "That's, that's not really going to be your permanent room." And as it turned out, we talked more. He said it was the first time he ever slept in a bedroom. The other woman, I found out, you could have five kids, but she was getting five kids from one county and five kids from another county. She had adult children. So, that when the caseworkers came from one county she would send the other children with her adult children to their house so they never knew she had ten children in her house. And so they slept on cots in the hallways and all sorts of stuff. So that's why he was so excited about showing off his non-room that I was embarrassed about. But you know, but anyway--and then I also went overboard because they told me you know he wasn't getting any snacks. So, I was making these full blown meals for after school. He blew up like (laughter)--and then it was, you know, it's like you can eat whenever you want to eat. But I was so disappointed when he liked smoked salmon the first time he ate it. I'm like, "You're not supposed to like that. It costs too much money." But anyway, but (laughter) he, he liked it, so.
Story_ID: 672866
Speaker 1: And he [Brown's adopted son, Dijaun Brown] was just an incredible reader. I think that was his form of, of escape. He read everything. He read everything. In fact, from when he was in junior high school, after I met Eileen Letz [Eileen M. Letts], they would compare the books that they were reading. But he read everything. I remember when I did the three weeks in Ghana, he went with me, and his teacher gave him reading, you know, books and so forth to read, he was finished them in like three days, and then he was reading my books. So--and then it was his idea to go to that Piney Woods [Piney Woods School, Piney Woods, Mississippi]. He saw it on '60 Minutes.' And he wrote them a letter. He hacked my email, because suddenly I got an email back saying that "Your son, if he wants to come here--if you want him to attend this school he can't have any disciplinary, have had any disciplinary problems. He has to be in good standing," blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, what is this? And I finally realized, he had sent them an email from my email saying, "I am very interested in my son attending your school. Kindly provide me at your earliest convenience the requirements so that he may attend." Yeah. So, then I thought he hated me. I'm like why would you want--why would anybody want to go to Mississippi to a boarding school? And so, but, you know, he said he wanted to go, and he said he wanted to go because he had never had any male teachers and he never had any black teachers, and Piney Woods had both. And so--and he saw it on '60 Minutes,' so--
Speaker 2: So, the Pine- the Piney Wood experience was good for him?
Speaker 1: It was. He didn't go there 'til the eleventh grade. I thought they had some really draconian methods, and I spoke to 'em about it. I think a couple of them they got rid of, but they had some real draconian methods. And they also operated under the, under the assumption that all of the kids, especially the boys, come from single parent, female homes who were underprivileged and so forth. I said everybody does not fit in that category. You cannot treat--even if they did, you cannot treat them this way, like you're really doing them some grand favor by letting them be here. So, so I, I knocked heads with them a lot (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So your--
Story_ID: 672867
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, your son's name?
Speaker 2: Dijaun [Dijaun Brown].
Speaker 1: Dij-?
Speaker 2: Dijaun. He change--when he was adopted, he only changed his middle name. I was so sure because when you get adopted you can make your name whatever you want it to be. And people always teased him, called him mustard for Dijaun, although it wasn't spelled that way.
Speaker 1: It's D-I--?
Speaker 2: D-I-J-A-U-N, right, which is not what was on his original birth certificate either, but that's what I was told his name was, so, we went with it. And he did change his middle name though to Michael, so.
Speaker 1: So, how was that experience though; and what, what--because you said you always wanted to have kids. But having kids at age forty as a single person and not a lot of time--that's a whole different process. You're learning a different part--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You said you had a lot of help from your family.
Speaker 2: And friends. And friends, yes, lots of help. So, I had a nine month trial. And so my two sisters [Brenda Brown Forrest and Carlita Brown White] and my mother [Thelma Stamper Brown] took turns coming during the trial. My oldest sister as usual, she's funny, because I could--my mother never did much cooking. She came and started saying--because they would overlap. One would stay 'til the other one got there. So my mother came. She was the last one to come and she said what she wanted me to fix her to eat. And my sister told her, "You have it all wrong. This is not why you're here. You're here to help her. She will not be cooking meals for you. You will be fixing things for her." (Laughter) So, my mother looked at her, and because, obviously I told you I was very obedient. I would have been doing it. Which is why I didn't go to law school in Baltimore [Maryland]. But my sister said, "No, you have it all wrong. This is what you have to do. This is the schedule and these are the things you have to do while you're here." So, my mother said okay. So--(laughter). But it was my, my older sister said, "Oh no, no, no, you have it all wrong." But that's the same thing she did when I graduated from college. She told my mother and father [Wilbur Brown], "Paulette's [HistoryMaker Paulette Brown] the only one of us who graduated from college. She did well. You had saved money for all of us to go to college. You all should get her a car. It's the least that you can do." They said, "No." So, that was the end of that. But that's what she told them, that they should get me a car.
Speaker 1: So, she's been a mother hen in some respects, even though--
Speaker 2: Some respects yes, um-hm, yeah.
Story_ID: 672868
Speaker 1: So let me, let me ask you this: what have you learned from being a parent?
Speaker 2: That it's not all about me (laughter). That it's not about me, learning to share, learning to--you know a lot of perspect- things that--you know, and it's interesting because some things just click in almost automatically. It's amazing. The, the things that you didn't know that were in you, the protectiveness, the, the, the, some of the things that you said that you would never do. For example, he [Brown's adopted son, Dijaun Brown] got scholarships to other schools, you know, and didn't want to go, so I ended up having to pay. He was accepted to Howard in the School of Communications [Howard University School of Communications; Howard University Cathy Hughes School of Communications, Washington, D.C.] where it'll only take a hundred people and I didn't have to call anybody to get him in, and he said no. I was not happy. And I, you know, before I would have said oh, no, no, no. I would have made him go there. You know, spend money instead of a scholarship?  Oh no. And, and you just learn that, you know, they will do better if they are in a place where they want to be. So, so, you know, so I mean, there, there are other things too. Learning to share and to be considerate of other people just, not just living in your world doing your own thing, just having to think about another person and their safety and their wellbeing gives you a whole different perspective on things.
Story_ID: 672869
Speaker 1: So he's thirty, you said he's thirty (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Thirty-one.
Speaker 1: Thirty-one?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, he [Brown's adopted son, Dijaun Brown] made it through college. Now what he is doing now?
Speaker 2: So, anyway it was funny, because I told him four years or graduation whichever one came first--I was serious about that I think at the time. But he thought I was serious, so he got out of there in four years, so much to the point where he had so few credits left I got some money back the last semester. So, he wanted to be an actor so he went to California right away. He got some little jobs right away, went to his head. So, then when the work dried up he--it did not go well. Ultimately I had to make him come back home. So, then he started teaching, did very well but still wanted to do this acting thing. But he's so good with children, so good with children. And so then he decided to move to New York [New York] and try to do some acting stuff. So, he gets, you know, he does some of that, he does some substitute teaching you know. And--but his real--he doesn't understand his real calling is working with children. He worked at the Crump Law Camp a few weeks ago that--the National Bar Association has this law camp. And people at the NBA like past presidents, exec- former executive directors said he was so good with the kids. And I just, you know, and I don't understand why he doesn't understand that's his calling (laughter) you know. He still wants to do this actor stuff and ain't going nowhere with it. So, but--so, anyway he only calls me every now and again. "My money ran out, I don't have any food." But (laughter), but, you know, it's less and less frequent now. Did, had to get him two suits for this week. I'm making him go to a dinner with me tonight, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right. No, yeah I had--this woman, she said she supported her son and then all of a sudden he took off so, you never know. But the--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: But, but what I--I want to--I needed to ask you about that because that is an important part of the narrative.
Speaker 2: Right. Yes, it is.
Speaker 1: And the thing is, is that a lot of our kids are endangered.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you, you know, you had, you did that to--and you made a difference in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --someone's life.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But I, I, I want to just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And he made a difference in mine.
Speaker 1: In your life.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 672870
Speaker 1: What about where the black community is right now?  You know, you came along, you know, when there was a lot of tumult.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You're a child, you know, you can call yourself an affirmative action baby (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes I can, definitely. And I feel no shame in saying it (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, but what do you see right now where we are in, in the black community and as a nation?
Speaker 2: I have been given hope in recent times that unfortunate tragedies have helped to bring us together in ways that we haven't done in a really long time. I think that we have been self-centered for a long time. People have thought a lot about their individual economic gains or other gains. Or just generally thinking about themselves more than the community at large. I think that we're changing some in that regard, and I'm very hopeful and happy about that. You know, people are thinking that, you know, before I think there was a time where some people thought, oh, that it would only happen to them; and now they're seeing that it could happen to anybody, these things. And, and, and I think that people are taking action in a way that they haven't done in a long time. They're volunteering more. They're showing up and they're, they're giving their voice more. They're--you know, social media is helpful in that regard because people can voice their opinions, they can take action in ways that they just couldn't do before. But I think that with the recent events, as tragic as they have been, they're making people rethink some of the things that maybe we haven't made as much progress as, as we believed that we have.
Speaker 1: What do you, of the recent events you know we can talk about Eric Garner--I mean it's just, it seems like almost every week.
Speaker 2: I know. And recently with Ms. Bland [Sandra Bland].
Speaker 1: Ms. Bland, um-hm. What do you, do you thi- see it as collective, or do you see that it's, it's--do you see any one event being more important than the other and the changing views because both the white and black, all communities who had to have sort of look at this.
Speaker 2: Right. So, you know it's interesting because I think that there has always been some trepidation about talking directly about race and in particular a, directly about African Americans--that people have found it a lot safer to talk about other things: about women, about Asians, about even to a lesser extent, Hispanics, the LGBT groups, they find those things easier to talk about. They have never really dealt head on. And then even if African Americans talk about it, it's almost as though we're criticized for talking about it. When everybody else talks about their heritage and so forth and why can't we? And you know why can't we do something? So, I think that to finally--and I think even before it wasn't talked about in this way that it's being talked about now. I'm like it's finally, people are, are understanding that black lives matter. And it's, it's, it's, it's, it's a good thing. I think that hopefully it's not a fad--that people will come to understand that it's systemic and that we need to, to create sustainable solutions.
Speaker 1: So, what do you think is the legacy of the children, the African American chil- I mean the children, the civil rights, the affirmative action children that you're a part of?  What, what is, what is, what is going to be when all is said and done, what is, what are people going to say about the legacy?  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I know. I'm not so sure. I don't think it's too late for a lot of us to create a positive legacy, but I don't think--I don't know how much we've left. We've let a lot of things go by us. We've let things spiral out of control without taking action. This whole school to prison pipeline issue, which we should have recognized a long time ago. We should have been paying closer attention and I'm including myself in that. I think that there's a lot more that we could have been--done. I think that we were so happy that we were given this opportunity that we would take every advantage of it without thinking about who was coming behind us and what it is that we could do for them. We didn't think enough about the people who made sacrifices for us so that we could make sacrifices for others. I mean there are some people--I'm not saying everybody was like that. I'm just saying generally that we haven't done enough.
Story_ID: 672871
Speaker 1: So, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: (Sigh) That in some small way I was able to make a difference, make somebody's life better, make a group of lives better. That people will come to understand that you need all kinds of people in all kinds of places at the table making decisions that affect everyone.
Speaker 1: And what do you want or think that the legacy of the Afri- people of African American descent or African descent will be?
Speaker 2: The legacy of all African Americans of descent?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, first of all I, I think that you have to do it in groups because you know the population will continue so they'll be continuing legacies for people. You know, I am, I have to tell you that I'm inspired by the younger generation, and I think that they'll do more than people of my generation have done to ensure that people are more familiar with the contributions that African Americans have made to the history of this country. That people--they will not be afraid to share information, with many of the atrocities we have had to suffer; and how in many instances we are still put on the back burner of things that are done to, to, to make progress in the country, so.
Story_ID: 672872
Speaker 1: I have one last question and that is--just one--
Speaker 2: That's okay.
Speaker 1: --about the black female because what would you like people to know about the black female and her role in society and especially in the professional world?  Can you, can you share that?
Speaker 2: Yes. I would, I would like to tell people to think of, to think of an iceberg and that is you know because people--as soon as you look at somebody you start formulating opinions. And when you look at an African American woman or a black woman, woman of African descent, to try to start below and look up and not, try not to formulate immediate opinions. And even if you can't help yourself from formulating immediate opinions, take some time to dig a little deeper, to talk to the person, to find out some of the things that you may have in common; and to understand that you are really not that much different, and to understand that she has the mental capacity to do as much as you or more than anyone else. Don't short change African American women because it happens so frequently. Sometimes to your advantage 'cause they play you cheap and then you just hammer them (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, congratulations on--you know.
Speaker 2: Thank you. Are you coming Monday?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh good, excellent.
Speaker 1: Yes. So, no, congratulations--
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: --'cause you make us all proud in that.
Speaker 2: Thank you. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we still--unfortunately we're still celebrating firsts.
Speaker 2: I know, that is very unfortunate; and so you know, you know, the, the deal is, is that you have to make sure you're not the only. I don't want to be a one hit wonder. So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah.
