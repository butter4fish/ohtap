Speaker 1: My name is Jacques Lesure and I'm the interviewer. Today's videographer is Matthew Hickey and [HistoryMaker] Paul Brock is the observer today. Mr. Collette could you please state your name and spell your name for me, including your middle name?
Speaker 2: Yes I can. My real name is William Marcell Collette [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette]. But then when I was a little guy, of course who knows what age, my mother [Goldie Dorris Collette] nicknamed me Buddy, you know, so that stuck with me for my professional name and I think most people know me as Buddy Collette.
Speaker 1: So that is B-U-D-D-Y--
Speaker 2: B-U-D-D-Y.
Speaker 1: C-O-L-L-E-T-T-T (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) E-T-T-E. I'm sorry that I didn't do that. But it's interesting and I would just add this, my mother had it spelled B-U-D-D-I-E, but I didn't ever like that spelling so I had the Y so that's the way that goes. But every now and then you will see it come B-U-D-D-I-E, but I've always spelled it B-U-D-D-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay. And your date of birth, Mr. Collette and the location of your birth?
Speaker 2: Okay. Location was Los Angeles, California, August the 6th, 1921 in the L.A. area near Jefferson High School [Thomas Jefferson High School], 33rd Street and Compton Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now the hardest question of the day will be, can you tell me today's date?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Today's date is April 20th [2007].
Speaker 1: Okay. And where are we doing this interview today; where are we right now currently?
Speaker 2: We are in Los Angeles. The area of Ladera Heights, and it's in the living room of my home.
Speaker 1: Okay. Mr. Collette. What is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm a musician. I'm not playing now. I had a stroke in 1998 and so I can't use both hands. I played saxophone, clarinet and flute and in order to do that, you have to have both hands 'cause you know there's a lot of fingers involved. So I still can write, I still conduct my big band and I still do concerts whenever I can. We might do three or four a year and we make videos and things. So still very active and at this point, I don't won't to be too active, I'm eighty-five years old (laughter) and still going at it. So if I do once a month or something like that. I just make sort of a festive thing out of it. You know, we just go at it, rehearse, get the guys that you like to work with and just go for it, and it's very enjoyable 'cause it gives me something that keep me busy. I try to write a new number or two or three new numbers for each concert, so I'm still very much into music and also teaching a lot of youngsters and starting things where we keep building the L.A. area and finding more great people who love the music and youngsters called, JazzAmerica, and we'll keep them going so they'll come up learning the real music, which is you know the music that was before the real jazz, the real swing and all that. We don't want that to go away. 'Cause most of the time it's not on radio and TV like it used to be and the youngsters can't go into clubs to hear it. So they gonna miss all of that. They'll be twenty, twenty-five years old before they hear any jazz in most cases, unless their parents might have records or CDs and things to play for them. So, I do part of that too because a little bit helps and I found that you find a lot of players say, "Oh, I never heard this before." I say, "Well, this is the kind of music you gotta start listening to." They have real melodies and real chords. It's not just on two or three notes or two chords. Like that's something that Al Viola said too. He said if he heard four chords, he'd be so amazed and shocked because, you know, they don't want to use anything but two or three chords which is okay, but after a while, it repeats itself and you don't hear anything new, not very much creativity with it.
Speaker 1: So, you would consider yourself a musician and an educator?
Speaker 2: Right, definitely.
Story_ID: 486952
Speaker 1: Now, what we're going to do now is we're going to ask you some li- what we like to call our light questions, our light People magazine type questions that we like to ask our HistoryMakers (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: And the first one I would like to ask you is, is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food (laughter), well, I do like food so I got probably a lot of favorites. But I would say--I do like fish. I don't eat as much beef as I used to. Fish, salads and maybe spaghetti is a part of that too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not too many things. But I'm not a real particular person on food. If you make me a good deal. If I go to a restaurant, I can usually pick over two or three things. But I don't eat too many steaks anymore. I just feel for me, I'm not a beef person anymore. I used to eat a lot of beef. Hamburgers I don't eat too much. I will eat them but you know what I'm saying, it's not a steady diet. I'd rather you know if I do a hamburger, it's usually something like a turkey burger or something.
Speaker 1: Okay, so a light diet (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) See I'm a little careful where I diet 'cause I want to keep my weight about where it should be. I'm about 180 [pounds] in weight and I've kept that same weight a long time, even though, you know, most of the time you can lose or gain, and I try to just to keep it here. I have a moderate way of eating, not as much as I can eat.
Speaker 1: Good. Now, what's your favorite time of year, Mr. Collette [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette]?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of year? You mean winter, summer and everything?
Speaker 1: Seasons?
Speaker 2: Uh, I think the spring is one of my favorite times.
Speaker 1: Okay and your favorite color? What would you say that would be?
Speaker 2: Favorite color might be green, maybe brown, those two.
Speaker 1: Green and brown.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Knowing that you traveled extensively, what would you say your favorite vacation spot is, your vacation destination.
Speaker 2: Well, from my traveling a bit, I've enjoyed Australia and Italy. So two or three places I really loved, France, those places. I didn't go, you know, to Africa or any place like that but I enjoy traveling. You meet people and you find out how they live and what their eating habits are and so, you learn a lot and find out that they're into the good music and they love to meet people like I do too so, travel period I always used to say that I think that some of the best people are the ones that travel cause they're learning all the time that they're traveling. They're not so stuck in just being in one little place all the time. You can grow as you travel, quite a bit.
Speaker 1: Wow. Do you have a favorite phrase or slogan or something that you like to use on a daily basis? A mantra that's yours that you would like to use?
Speaker 2: I don't know maybe I can think of something. Well I used to kind of throw this in to students, and this is more like the team work that I think that's what life is about too. Whether it's your own family or band or something you're into, a group. I used to say to people, you know again it's like the musician, you might figure you have to be the star, no. In other words, it's better to be a part of something than to be all of nothing. You know, so it's just a little something to make people think, you know.
Speaker 1: Better to be a part of something that to be all of nothing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Than to be all of nothing. Yeah, you may have something and it's not going at all. You running the whole company, but nothing's going on. But if you're a part of something, gosh, you may be really learning from others and building on that. In fact, if something happens to you, then it keeps going. But if you're all of that other thing, you get sick or something, it's game over; it's all gone.
Story_ID: 486953
Speaker 1: I have some questions I'd like to ask you about your family background. Your upbringing. Tell me a bit about your mother?
Speaker 2: My mother?
Speaker 1: Her name, what was her name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Goldie Marie, that was her maiden name. Dorris--no, that was her middle name, sorry, Goldie Marie Dorris [Goldie Dorris Collette]. D-O-R-R-I-S.
Speaker 1: Goldie Marie Dorris, that was her maiden name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Her father's name was Mr. Dorris [Arthur Dorris], D-O-R-R-I-S, you know, which was different (unclear), she had--her mother [Mable Dorris] died when she probably about thirteen so they put them in like a home for the two sisters, Goldie and Opal [ph.], that was her sister's name. And so they didn't see their mother very much, and--well naturally when she died at thirteen, so they had no mother after they had to go--I don't know, a little home for, you know, kids and things. So they came up that way, but she was wonderful. Good habits. So they must have been raised good there, and everything. And she was lovable. She was a very sensitive woman and didn't put too much pressure on the kids. We did our little work and stuff and would help out. She taught us. She gave us a lot of love, always give a hug or a kiss or something when you're going or coming. So this is good for a way for a kid to grow up. 'Cause also she said to me at one point when I was studying to be a musician, she wanted me to play--she was very much into the church and we'd go to church. The church was right down the street so she'd almost go every day, you know. So she didn't pressure us that we had to go, maybe one day a week or Sunday she'd have us to go. The other thing I was saying she would say to me as I was a musician, she said to me, "Well, now you don't have to be anyone great, you're my son. I'm happy with that, so you make your pick." But she also sang and my grandmother [Matilda Collette], who we didn't talk about yet, well wanted to have music in the family, so my father [Willie Collette] who was naturally her son, he had music lessons; his brother [James Collette] had them. So that whole family had--so nobody turned out to be in music. So her thing was when I came along was that maybe I got a musician this time because you know, they'd play music and I liked it. So it did work out. She used to always, used to say to me, "Well, you'll go all over the world if you play." She wanted me to be a classical pianist and I didn't want to be a classical pianist, although I loved music. So after some point, I started about eight, playing the piano and after about two years later, my brother [Patrick Collette] had a saxophone, because they were leaving him out and he wasn't going to play anything. I had a sister [Doris Collette Slater] who also played piano, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I do want to address those and how you made those transitions as a child. Where was your mother born? Where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Kansas City, Kansas.
Speaker 1: Kansas City, Kansas? She grew up there also?
Speaker 2: Well, she came here when she was probably about fifteen or so after they got out of the boarding school or whatever it was that they were in. She came to California.
Story_ID: 486954
Speaker 1: You've already described her [Collette's mother, Goldie Dorris Collette] as a very loving and kind (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very kind, yeah.
Speaker 1: --kind lady. Did anything else--did she share any stories with you about her life growing up or did she give you any ideas about what is was like as she was a child?
Speaker 2: Well, a little bit. She also told how she met my father [Willie Collette]. Now when they came to California--my father's mother [Matilda Collette] and father [William Collette] had property, in fact, they had like a whole kind of lot, from one street to the other, and two or three houses on this property. So my mother and her father, who had married another lady, moved into the house that was for rent there and apparently, she met my dad because they were all, you know, just kind of thrown together in that way. So, and also she loved music, my mother did. She could sing a bit and my dad could play piano. He wasn't a musician. He had got a little lessons. So when he'd see her, he loved this beautiful woman. She'd walk, you know, through there going through from one property to the other and she had to go that way, you know, wherever she wanted to go. And he would see her. He'd start playing his little pieces that he could play and then she would stop and say, "Hey, you can play." He couldn't really play that well but he was playing something. So, little stories like that which are kind of funny after a while.
Speaker 1: It worked for her?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: It worked for him, actually?
Speaker 2: It worked for him. Yeah, cause she liked music. So, he might've had one little song that he'd play and she'd stand there and listen to it, you know. So they got a chance to meet each other and then it goes up from there. And she said to him, I guess when they finally got to marrying, he said, well she wanted a house and kids and all that stuff, and he'd always use that. Sometimes, she'd say, "Well, you didn't do all that." He said, "You said, all you wanted was a house and kids (laughter)," you know. She had a dream that was a little bigger than that. But you know, it worked out.  They didn't get along perfectly, but we had a great family and she was able to tie it together real well.
Speaker 1: Now you said her father was still alive?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah her father was alive. He married again and it was Alice, it was Alice Dorris and Arthur Dorris. His name was Arthur. So their life changed. They didn't think that after a while. I mean, my mother and them moved away, got married and I guess, started their life on their own. But they did well and we moved to an area out in Watts [Los Angeles, California], Central Gardens it was called. It was open land. It used to be Japanese gardens and things like that and so, my dad helped build his own house. He was skilled in that way.
Story_ID: 486955
Speaker 1: But the la- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Let's talk about your father for a moment.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: I'm glad you, I'm glad you brought your father up.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Let's discuss your father. Now what was his name?
Speaker 1: His name was Wi- Willie M.--Willie H. Collette [Willie Collette], Willie Hugh, H-U-G-H, Collette, (cough) excuse me.
Speaker 2: And where was he born, Mr. Collette [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette]?
Speaker 1: He was born in Knoxville, Tennessee.
Speaker 2: Did he grow up in the same Knoxville area, or did he grow up there?
Speaker 1: Well, I think he came when he was quite young, maybe five or six to California, his parents [Matilda Collette and William Collette] moved to California.
Speaker 2: Now, his background. What more do you know about his background or his upbringing as a child? Did he tell you any stories also about his--
Speaker 1: He told me a lot of stories, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Plus he--as he grew up--I will tell you a couple of those too--as he grew up, he was a garbage truck driver for the City of L.A. [Los Angeles, California]. And so he was very proud of it, you know, because that was a good job then, especially black men and women, they had, you know, not jobs like they have now. The women usually worked in service which is in the house, you know, cleaning the house or something like that. It was work and it didn't pay very much. But, he was a proud guy, he was jolly, he was happy cause he stayed clean and when he would come home, he would always shower first and get his suit on and go out and be himself.
Speaker 2: Now, what year was would you say this was when he was driving the sanitation truck?
Speaker 1: Oh, probably the early '30s [1930s], maybe '31 [1931], '33 [1933], right in there.
Speaker 2: Now was that rare at that time for an African American man to be doing that kind of work?
Speaker 1: That work?
Speaker 2: To have that kind of job, was it rare?
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't that rare, I mean, 'cause it was very few jobs--I don't even think there was much post office jobs going for the blacks at that time. This was, you know, garbage truck, you know, refuse and whatever that kind of thing, and maybe, I didn't even see much gardening going on. But no I think that was one of the jobs that were available at that time. You could get if you were a good driver or one that could work that truck like that and, you know, handle it, so--
Speaker 2: Now what was some of the stories that you alluded to? Did he tell you several stories? What was some of the stories? One that stands out in your mind.
Speaker 1: Now the one that stands out in my mind was that he had a brother, Uncle James [James Collette], who we can talk about him too, but my father you're asking about, okay. One was like he was maybe three years older than Uncle James and so my grandmother who was his mother, always told him, "Look, you the oldest brother, you make sure," they used to hang out and swim and everything, "you stay with Uncle James." So he would do that for a while this one time they went to an area where it was water but actually it was quicksand and they didn't know that. So Uncle James when they looked for him, he was down up to his neck, and they said wow, he got frighten to death, not so much that he was losing Uncle James but that his mother was going to kill him if he came home without him (laughter). So you know, little stories that would get a laugh. He was a fun guy at the dinner table, he had many stories. My uncle could do the same thing. So they had us in stitches, so at Christmas dinner at my grandmother's house and they would be telling all these little crazy jokes, you know, and some of them would be little stories like that and my dad, he was the kind of guy, who would do those terrible things that kids can do sometimes, like stealing tires and all that, but he never wanted to get caught, he was that kind of guy. I might be on the take of the cut of the money, but I don't want to be there. So this one time, the problems came and the cops were trying to find him and he finally said, "Well, I bought these tires from a guy he died already." So he had a lot of play in him, so they couldn't track down because the guy's dead. Well we couldn't even find if it was his tires or not. So he had little stories and some were just enough to keep you laughing, you know.
Speaker 2: So, you had a very open relationship with your father and he talked to you a lot obviously?
Speaker 1: Well, yeah we talked a lot. He didn't talk too much about music, you know, but he was always surprised when I could play, like I didn't like it like I did. Plus another thing he would do, all of mine, people who were friends or not always friends of mine, I'd get a lot of calls. But my dad had more or less recommended me, even as a kid, would say, "If you want to talk about music, my son's into music, ask him the question," and I'd get a call, "Your father said you're playing music, you could help me with this," and I'd try to solve it. I was always serious with it and it was one of those things where I would always say, "Dad why do you do that?" He said, "Well, because you like to help people." And that was just the thing I've always had, you know.
Story_ID: 486956
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned your grandmother on your father's [Willie Collette] side--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And did you know your [maternal] grandmother [Mabel Dorris], she died obviously--
Speaker 2: She died. I knew the woman [Alice Dorris] that married my grandfather (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right. Your grandfather. Let's talk about your grandfather on your mother's [Goldie Dorris Collette] side - your grandfather. Did you have a relationship with him?
Speaker 2: Arthur Dorris?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Yeah, pretty good but he was a very serious kind of guy. I don't know, as far as his house immaculate. You know, the house, everything was polished, you know so we kind of even hated to sit down, you know how kids are, you come in a little dirty, but that's the way it was. He wasn't that strict with us, but you could see him say, "Be careful where you sit down."
Speaker 1: He was very fastidious.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there you go, you got it.
Speaker 1: Now, your grandparents [Matilda Collette and William Collette] on your father's side. I heard you mention earlier about Christmas dinner and those things.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you elaborate more about that?
Speaker 2: Well, we all had a little thing worked out between the family 'cause now my father had a sister named, Aunt Pearl [Pearl Collette]. And so, we-- they had it all figured out that on Christmas day, my grandmother always had dinner and all the kids in the family knew that she wanted to see you there. It was no mistake. If you're out, Uncle James [James Collette] would be in New York [New York] or somewhere, he said, "I gotta come back home because, you know, mama be mad at me if I don't come." So they all showed. That was her day. You know, you could miss other days, but don't miss Christmas, 'cause she prepared dinner. And her birthday, I asked her about that and it was interesting that it was Christmas Eve. So on Christmas Eve on her birthday, she's working to see all her family again. So it meant a lot to her that everybody showed up and so she always had that. Then, my aunt had like New Year's Eve or something after Christmas and Thanksgiving, no my aunt had Thanksgiving and we had Christmas Eve at our house. So everybody came. So they all met on those big days, you know.
Speaker 1: And that aunt was Aunt Pearl you said?
Speaker 2: Aunt Pearl. Yeah. That was my father's sister.
Speaker 1: Okay. And did your father have any more siblings?
Speaker 2: Just Uncle James, just the three--
Speaker 1: Besides James. Just your Uncle James?
Speaker 2: They had one I never met. He died early. Maybe when he was maybe two or three years old, just a kid.
Speaker 1: You mentioned your mother had one sister also, right?
Speaker 2: She had one, Opal [ph.]. Aunt Opal.
Speaker 1: Okay. Opal. Did you have much contact with her?
Speaker 2: Well, we did for a while 'cause the two sisters were very close. They'd get together every weekend or they would visit each other, you know, it was very close, which I liked too. We'd visit Aunt Opal, you know, two or three times a month and there was one of the time I almost got killed going to visit Aunt Opal. She lived on Washington Boulevard and my mother had three kids then. I had a brother [Patrick Collette] two years younger than me. I was about five and my sister [Doris Collette Slater] was two years older than me, so she was about seven. So we leaving Aunt Opal's and going across Washington Boulevard in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and the car was across the street and all of a sudden, I broke away, so I almost knew, five years old, I said, "I'll go to the car," and it really wasn't like it is nowadays, but they had the Model T Fords [Ford Model T] and things were running, you know, and I saw this car and I sort of fell down so it straddled me. It didn't hit me. But I had a sweater on and the sweater got under the wheel somehow and so my mother was screaming, "They killed him," you know, and then they walked out and it didn't even touch me, you know. Those big wheels and the sweater had somehow come off of me and went under the tires so they thought since the sweater was there, that was me, you know. So that was a earth-shaking thought kind of a thing, you know, tragedy. But I walked away said, "No, I'm not hurt," you know. So, a couple of things like that, you know.
Speaker 1: Because you had a greater mission, you had to be here to write more music?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. I was supposed to be here for something. I'm still here.
Story_ID: 486957
Speaker 1: I want to go on into your childhood slightly now.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm gonna go into--what was your earliest memory growing up? The earliest thing that you can recall and what age were you when this, when this occurred?
Speaker 2: The earliest thing I can recall?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, let me think. (Pause) Well, a lot of things but it wasn't this good. A little earlier--
Speaker 1: Surely, that was one. That event of under the car.
Speaker 2: Under the car, yeah.
Speaker 1: That was early.
Speaker 2: Well, there's a couple earlier, I don't know, around the same time, no a little later than that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So this one, I kind of almost hung myself. I must have been around twelve or thirteen. I would always take a chance, you know, whatever (laughter). So we'd seen a lot of movies, cowboy movies, and we had little posts that stick out from the roof of the house and so we said, maybe we can create that scene we saw. So they had a rope up there and we had a box that was on the steps which and--later on I knew that, you know, well I could have been gone, cause if that box, I was standing on the box and the rope was on my neck if that had tipped over, I'd been gone. And so I think my dad [Willie Collette] came home just in time to come out there, "What are you guys doing?" You know, he got me down, you know, 'cause five more minutes or so, I was still balancing myself and that rope was on there. We were going to create a scene, you know--rope, you know, so again I escaped.
Speaker 1: Wow. So I guess that was long before the days of, don't try this at home (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah. We tried a lot of stuff. But you see, you know, as I grew up, we still would try things with cars and things. I had a couple of things where we would steal gas, you know from the car. Because my grandmother gave me a car. It was an old Dodge, who knows, about a '31 [1931] Dodge, maybe something like that. Once she got a new car. They always trusted me, you know, because I didn't get into real trouble, but I did in a way, but nobody knew about it. A lot of times--my brother [Patrick Collette] would get into a lot of trouble and I was always was able to stay pretty clean. When she gave me the car, I had my friends in the car and we traveled in the area. But all of a sudden we didn't have any jobs so the money ran out all the time. So we started, you know, siphoning gas out of the cars and one night the cops came and caught us, you know, because they just waited for us. We had the can--we'd hide in the bushes and all of a sudden, they did the hide job too and they just waited to see who would come for the can, then they got us. But they didn't give us a record or anything, but they kept us and called our parents. So that was the last thing that anything like that I ever did.
Speaker 1: Are there any (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, that was a lot of excitement--
Story_ID: 486958
Speaker 1: Are there any other memories that you have of growing up [in Los Angeles, California]? What was your family life in your home, in your personal home, what was your life like with that?
Speaker 2: Well, the family was good. There's one other thing where I wrote the little story in a little book. It's about a thing called 'The Apricots' [ph.]. There was a store called Mr. Harrison's store [ph.] right on the corner from my house about a block on Central Avenue going--and my mother [Goldie Dorris Collette] and them would always shopped there. They'd give you credit if they wanted to, you know. It was a nice man and a nice store and at that time, nobody had too much money. So to go over and get some food, you know, on credit it would be great, so she would do that. So this one Sunday, she took me over there with her and she always made Sunday dinner which was great. My dad [Willie Collette] would be home, he's off from his job. And we'd go to Mr. Harrison's store, excuse me, and they're talking, cause they're friends too cause she's always there--there was no Ralphs and all that stuff, it was family store for the neighborhood. So when we got there, they were talking about he knew all the kids, my sister [Doris Collette Slater], brother [Patrick Collette] and me. So they're talking business, I see apricots. We have a apricot tree on our property too at home. So we loved apricots. She made apricot jam and all that. So I see the apricots, so I'm watching them. I didn't know they could see me from the mirror but I grabbed a few apricots and put them in my pocket. Then all of a sudden, I went outside 'cause I couldn't even wait to eat them, you see what I mean? So I walked outside and I sort of ate them and then came back in so then it was almost like they had talked about what to do about this so, I didn't know they had seen me, so she said, "Okay, we'd better go home now." So she didn't tell me what I had done, you know, because she talked to my dad about it. So they were whispering and all of a sudden we were sitting down for breakfast and so, a few minutes, I don't know how long it happened, but my dad vanished for about two minutes, so he pulled a trick on me and so he talked to the next door neighbor and all of a sudden, it was a big knock on the door, "This is the police, we want Buddy Collette [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette] for stealing apricots." And I'm about five, maybe I was about ten by then, but, I mean, just the idea, scared to death because they had come, the cops, that fast to get me and then I know what he had done later of course. He had talked to neighbor to come over and do what he had did. He would do things to cure us of doing things. Once we were smoking too. I was smoking, about maybe twelve or thirteen and he could see that were behind the fence, my brother and I and the smoke was coming over the fence, you know, the wind was blowing it. So I did, we didn't know and he was always like a little detective and he was a little old guy then but could still do that. Oh, then there's smoke, there's got to be fire and somebody's doing that. Then he looked over there and said, "Hey, what are you guys doing, smoking? Hey, that looks good." He said, "Maybe I should join you." And he always kept things in his car. He didn't smoke himself, but he'd save things. Maybe people on his job people give him cigarettes and things so he bring--so he pulled them out and put them on the table and ripped them open and said, "Let's all smoke," and he still didn't smoke. So we started smoking about three or four apiece. And all of a sudden we got kind of sick, "We don't want to smoke anymore." He said, "Well, I got more in the car, so I going to get some more." So he just cured us of that. So I didn't smoke. My brother might have smoked again. But, you know, he was always like that. But he was a great father to have because he would always challenge you in a lot of ways. Or sometimes on the piano when I would start playing, he would come and say, "Can you play this?" My uncle [James Collette] would do the same thing, they'd play tunes and after finding the record, you know, they'd say, "We'll give you," a dollar was a lot of money then--well maybe they'd give you a dollar. But, I'm saying, you know, "If you can play it, you can get this dollar," or something. So it was always challenging, you know.
Speaker 1: So your father had a very unique way of disciplining and teaching you lessons without being (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very unusual, yeah.
Speaker 1: Ways that really stuck with you?
Speaker 2: It had to, yeah, because they pay off. You know, sometimes with the cigarette, if you want more cigarettes, if he'd let you have them, he took a chance that you'd get sick of yourself. He didn't do that with drinks. He didn't smoke. He didn't drink himself. At least I never saw him do it.

Speaker 1: Mr. Collette [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette], do you know what today's date is?
Speaker 2: Today is April 20th, 2007.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, could you please spell your whole name, complete name even with all the nicknames (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The middle name--nicknames? Okay. My name is William Marcell, William Buddy Marcell Collette. William, W-I-L-L-I-A-M, what'd I say? Buddy next? Buddy, B-U-D-D-Y, Marcell, M-A-R-C-E-L-L, Collette, C-O-L-L-E-T-T-E.
Speaker 1: Very good.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And also we'd like to know, do you know your mother's [Goldie Dorris Collette] date of birth?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1898.
Speaker 1: Can you repeat the month and day?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know the month and day. Wait, yes I do, sorry about that, what am I saying, that information, let me see, December the 6th. Does that cover that or you want the date again with the year (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, December the 6th, 1898.
Speaker 2: Eighteen ninety-eight [1898].
Speaker 1: And your father [Willie Collette], do you remember his birthday?
Speaker 2: He was 1900, September the 6th.
Story_ID: 486960
Speaker 1: Now I want to go back into, we were discussing your childhood and some of your early memories growing up. Did you have any siblings, brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes I did. I had a brother and a sister. My sister was two years older, her name was Doris, D-O-R-I-S, Doris Collette [Doris Collette Slater].
Speaker 1: And her birth date?
Speaker 2: Uh, let me think about that. July 31st, 1919.
Speaker 1: Okay and your brother?
Speaker 2: My brother's birthday was--his name was Pat; his real name was Patrick Collette, and everyone called him Pat. Now his birth date was June 23rd, 1923.
Speaker 1: So he was two years younger?
Speaker 2: Right, two years younger. So we're all two years apart (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So your parents spaced them out pretty good?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're all two years a part.
Speaker 1: Good, so now what was life grow- how was life growing up with Pat and Doris in the family home, along with your parents? It seemed to have been a loving environment where your father [Willie Collette] taught by example, but can you shed some more light onto that? How was life with you and your siblings and the interaction with your siblings?
Speaker 2: Well, it was very good. My father didn't stay home, he worked the garbage truck job for the city [Los Angeles, California], so he was busy during the day and he liked to clean up and get out and my uncle, Uncle James [James Collette], was his brother of course. And Uncle James had a pool hall and a liquor store. So he kind of ran with the younger brother sometimes 'cause he was a classy guy, with the stick pins, you know, end of the money. In fact, he was making like a hundred dollars a day from his business. He has the pool hall and a hundred dollars a day at that time, and we are talking about ninety--you know, 19--gosh I probably was maybe eight or ten years old.
Speaker 1: Nineteen thirty-one [1931]?
Speaker 2: Well something like that. At least '30s [1930s], cause was born in '21 [1921]. Yeah, that's about right. So he liked to be on the town too. So my grandmother [Matilda Collette], his mother, always was trying to keep him straight. He was a good guy at heart. He didn't get into trouble, but he kind of was intrigued by it, with the gambling that his brother used to do. They were different as night and day, but they still got along in a way. But what was so funny, my mother [Goldie Dorris Collette] took so much care of us even if he wasn't around, you know, she may have took us to family, friends. We had friends in San Bernardino [California]. We had friends in San Diego [California] and places. My mother always kept us moving so, you know, we were seeing the best of everything 'cause my dad did not spend that type of time with us. He loved us and everything, but he was just so busy in his world of work and hanging out. They used to go to New York [New York], the two brothers, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They'd put money in the glove compartment. It was almost like you put two hundred dollars, I'll put two hundred dollars.  That would be their expense money. They had little ways of doing it that was so interesting to me. I would never do that. You know, you just spend your own money. But they'd say, well now you put a hundred and I'll put a hundred and they would go on a trip and if they wanted to stop and have food, then would take it out of the glove compartment and use it rather than out of their pockets, you know (laughter). They had different methods is what I'm saying. So, we saw some strange things.
Speaker 1: Saw some strange or different ways of doing things in your family (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, right.
Story_ID: 486961
Speaker 1: Now, what street did you all grow up on, you know, primarily in Los Angeles [California]? What street? Where were you--
Speaker 2: You mean when we were a family, with the kids, brothers and sisters (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Uh-hm, right.
Speaker 2: It's Parmelee. 9710 Parmelee Avenue.
Speaker 1: Parmelee?
Speaker 2: Parmelee, P-A-R-M-E-L-E-E.
Speaker 1: Could you describe your block and how that place was, how that street was at that time, during you know, your neighbors, the community? What was it like around there?
Speaker 2: Well like I said, I don't know if I told you but if seems like I told somebody recently. It used to be Japanese gardens so it was a lot of land and the land was very reasonable, I would think, compared with a lot of places and so we got all kinds of families moving there, blacks, whites, Japanese, you know, everything cause people who wanted land reasonable would come there and they heard about it. So, it was good, so you knew everybody. It was only about an area of, you know, a couple of square miles and so, after a while, you either build your own home or have one built. My dad [Willie Collette] helped build his own home. He had a few friends that knew how to do that. They did the plumbing, you know, the foundation and all of that. And so after a while you knew everybody and everybody knew your kids, they knew me and if somebody would see me doing something, which I probably didn't do very much as far as getting into trouble, "Hey you're Mrs. Collette's [Goldie Dorris Collette] son, right?" And they knew us all. So it was a great way to grow up, and also this same group went to grammar school [96th Street Elementary School, Los Angeles, California] and Jordan High School [David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California] which was junior and senior. So it started, the sixth grade was junior and it was all in the same unit, so I was going to school with my sister [Doris Collette Slater] who was two years older, the same area, not in her class, naturally, but, you know, we around older people and that sort of helped us too because they could keep us straight and look after us and so the whole area, the setup may not be happening today like that but it was good for us. So, we grew up faster and, you know, like settled. You know like your older sister and brother [Patrick Collette] running with you, would keep you out of trouble. Make sure things went smoothly for you.
Speaker 1: So you had your guardians so to speak?
Speaker 2: More or less, yes. The way it was set up.
Speaker 1: And also, you mentioned that your neighborhood [, Los Angeles, California] was very multicultural, even back then?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was great and that was the best thing about it because I don't think too many schools had that, in that area, with the land being cheap and there was a period too after, you know, some of the whites and some of the others would be able to move away. Most of the blacks stayed, you know, 'cause they didn't have as many opportunities to work other jobs and so, as the kids would grow up cause a lot of them of them weren't probably afraid of the interracial marriages and all that, and so it would just work itself out. At my graduation class, I had everybody and kids were crying because they know they would never see each other again, you know.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And, so it was wonderful.
Story_ID: 486962
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We'll get to some more of how that worked out in your school years momentarily. But, can you tell me about the sights and the sounds and what was going on? Any smells you can recall growing up, anything that triggers any memories in your mind, just through visuals, smell, whatever, sights that you can recall as a youngster?
Speaker 2: You mean in that area where we lived or just anywhere?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, in your neighborhood [Central Gardens, Los Angeles, California], and just growing up in general?
Speaker 2: Well, not much smells that I can think of except the people who did cooking. They did a little barbequing, but mainly, you know, if you're around somebody that had a certain way of cooking, people came from every place so they had some who, you know, would be cooking, you know, certain kinds of foods, sometime were something a little familiar with, but it was a lot of, who knows, beans and rice and different things that you could smell.
Story_ID: 486963
Speaker 1: Now was there any particular sound, maybe even musical that you can recall during, growing up? Was there any sound of anything that makes you think of your childhood if you were you to hear that sound today?
Speaker 2: No. The only music at that time, my parents [Goldie Dorris Collette and Willie Collette] had a couple of friends, one was named, let me think, oh well, I forgot their names now. It used to come back and it will come back. But what happened, one played the piano, one played saxophone and they, I don't know how much music they knew but then they could sit at the piano and improvise all day, you know. Sometimes--we had a piano. Not too many pianos were around but since we had the music and had piano lessons and we had to get a piano, at least my parents got us a piano for my sister [Doris Collette Slater]. She also played piano. So we took lessons from my [paternal] grandmother's [Matilda Collette]--a lady that was very active in my grandmother's church, Hazel Whitaker [ph.]. And, so she taught us piano so we had to have a piano. They bought the piano. But what I'm saying, these people, the guitarist, I think it was Brown [ph.] and Smith [ph.] was their names, so I shouldn't forget their names, saxophone players, I forgot which is which, but they'd come by and they knew all the tunes so they'd jam the tunes. You know, it was great to hear that, they could play pretty well. I don't know how great now, but they could play the tunes and so the early beginning and also a little later when I was fifteen, there's a gentleman named Ducey Williams, who lived about six blocks from where we lived and his parents owned the property, and naturally later on, Ducey Williams got into the record business and recorded people like, who knows what some of the groups, but he had his recording studio. But that's how I sort of got into music too. I was playing piano and my brother [Patrick Collette] had a saxophone and what I did there, I knew my brother wasn't into music that way like I was, he just took it because my parents said, "He's not playing anything." So, they bought a saxophone for him, right? So they were trying to be fair. And, so my parents went to a party at Ducey Williams' house 'cause they knew Ducey's parents and they were raving about me, their son, "Hey, he's playing saxophone now." And so Ducey said, "Well, I got a lot of music, maybe he want to start his own band one day." They told them and didn't tell me. So, the next morning I woke up, there's a big trunk with all the stocks in there. You know, 'cause he had the bands--a lot of the bands at the time, the companies they put out the stocks would send it to a leader, you know. These are the things we want to see if you'll play or record or something, and so the next morning, I had all this stuff, and I looked at the parts and it says first sax, third sax, first tenor and all that. So I figure, well, I'm playing now, maybe I should start a band and I got to find out what these things sound like. So I think I was about twelve then.
Speaker 1: That was an early age to realize (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I'm playing already. You know, I played piano until I was about ten or eleven or so and then I started with saxophone. I wasn't studying with (unclear) then, but I would take the saxophone to school and they had like an instrument class and the teacher would say, "Well, that's a C on the piano but that's an A on the alto." So, you know, it can all make sense every day you're taking the class and the teacher was an all-around guy. He could play violin, trumpet, anything. He wasn't that great but, you know, he knew, you know, the makings of what would do.
Story_ID: 486964
Speaker 1: Since we're on the school issue, and talking about that school, what elementary school did you attend Mr. Collette [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette]?
Speaker 2: 96th Street School [96th Street Elementary School, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: 96th Street School.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And were there any teachers there that influenced you in particular? You recall any teachers that had any outstanding impact on your life?
Speaker 2: Not at 96th Street School because then you see, I was playing a little piano and I was just probably getting to the sax and--
Speaker 1: In general, not just musical. Was anybody that taught you anything, any teacher that stood out in general, not necessarily a music teacher? Was there an English teacher or math teacher? Anybody that you can recall, somebody being a teacher that you really liked or didn't like? Was there any--
Speaker 2: Well, nobody stands out. I don't remember their names. Well, there were good teachers, you know and so we got along. We had a lot of sports playing, you know soccer and stuff. So those games we were into more than music at the time.
Speaker 1: So what kind of student were you? Were you a good student in school? Were you--
Speaker 2: Oh, I wasn't a great student. It was good. I would get my homework done and I always get pretty good grades. But you see, I think the music thing started when I was going into junior high school [David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California] or middle school they call it then, because then there was a teacher that, you know, had us in the band. We were playing music every day. Things like marches and 'William Tell Overture' [Gioachino Rossini]. There's so many little pieces of standard literature at the time.
Story_ID: 486965
Speaker 1: As a musician, sometimes musicians are different as children. What kind of child were you? Were you the well-mannered? Were you mischievous? Were you sneaky? What kind of child were you growing up pretty much?
Speaker 2: Well, no I wasn't sneaky I don't think. I don't think I was mischievous either. Well, I was just trying to, I had good habits in a way you know, because my mother [Goldie Dorris Collette] was there for me, making sure, you know, without doing it in a rough way or getting mad at us, you know, she'd give you a hug and say, "Just don't do that anymore," or something. So it was kind of nice. I was trying to behave although we also knew not to run with the people who got into trouble. I guess I start hearing that from my [paternal] grandmother [Matilda Collette]. They always talking nothing but good habits and then when you do that, you know they get to be a part of you--
Speaker 1: They stay--those things stay with you (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, my dad [Willie Collette], they all have their (unclear). My grandma was always telling my dad, he'd stop by her house everyday coming home from work cause see, she lived in the L.A. [Los Angeles, California] area and he would stop by--his route was mostly where my grandmother--she lived on 23rd [Street] near Compton [Avenue], so it a little way from the Watts area [Los Angeles, California], but he stopped every day and talked to her and she still as he was a grown man. He could've been, what, forty years old or so. What I'm saying, gosh, he stops by every day to talk to her and she'd always say, "Well, you know, don't do this." You know, but I don't think he was going to do it, but she just; that was her style so that spilled off to me, of course.
Speaker 1: So she was once mom, always mom, she don't care how old you were (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, for sure. And also Uncle Jimmy [James Collette] was a trouble maker, you know, he was always into something (laughter). He'd be in fights, you know and he liked the ladies a lot. So sometimes he'd come to the Christmas dinner, and he'd be banged up, you know, and we'd ask him. They all had humor in them. The first time, he said, "Well, my ex-girlfriend and her guy jumped on me," you know (laughter) he would be trying, you know, whatever he was trying to do, and then they'd turn on him, you know. But Uncle Jimmy was always, he was a gambler even when he was seventy-five, he was still doing what he was doing when he was twenty and I'd say, "Uncle, you can't do that," because, you know, guys would think you cheated or something and you know these young guys would break your legs or something. Who knows what the pool hall, that's a different--dangerous life. He was very good friends with Art Tatum too, who naturally was a great pianist. But they were buddies and what they'd do, Uncle Jimmy had a beautiful grand [grand piano] in his living room so Art would come.  Art lived in the area. And when I told him I was going to be in music, he said, "Well, you're not going to make any money." I said, "Well, I love it. I'll figure a way to make money." But he just said, "Well, Art, you know, one of the greatest piano players he's not making--." Art would work maybe one day a week. He would work in L.A. He wouldn't do anything, you know. But, Uncle Jimmy would bring him over and they would sit, he would sit at the piano. They'd cook up beans and rice and have, you know, maybe a case of beer and that'd be their day.
Speaker 1: So the great Art Tatum would hang out with your Uncle James and play piano, eat rice and beans and drink beer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well he wasn't busy, you know. Like I said, people didn't know how great he was, in fact, he was playing so much piano, it scared people, you know. He was good, but--and at that time, I wasn't into Art, I knew who he was but I'm still saying when I was about sixteen or seventeen or so he played, you know Lloyd Reese, the guys we studied with knew of him and they would all get together and hear him play and everything. And then later on when Charlie Mingus [Charles Mingus] and I used to go to afterhours, Art Tatum would be there and Art would have everybody play, you know all the piano players would have to play before he'd play. He would say, "You haven't play yet," and you might have only tiddlywinks, but he wanted to hear you play and how you did it. Then he'd say, "Okay." Look and everybody's played. And then he would get on the piano. The no one else followed him after that because the piano was still steaming, you know.
Speaker 1: It's amazing because wasn't Art a visually impaired? Wasn't he--
Speaker 2: Well, he couldn't see very well. I don't know, maybe he could be blind. He could kind of look like he was looking up and maybe one eye was half closed. Yeah, but I mean, the piano he could play.
Speaker 1: And we all know that he's influenced countless, countless piano players (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, he ruined a lot of players (laughter) too because he could do those runs, you see and they would try to do it and you had to be playing all the time or practicing or something to keep you limber enough to do it.
Speaker 1: I think Oscar Peterson's whole style was developed because he got a chance to hear Art Tatum.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was some piano player. That was a joy to hear him, you know. We'd go to afterhours clubs, we young guys, they let us in and we'd hear him play with Charlie Christian and a bunch of the guys, you know, when nobody heard them. But, that was the real music then, you never forgot it once you've heard it in person.
Story_ID: 486966
Speaker 1: Now growing up--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --did you have any special dreams or aspirations or things that you wanted to do? Did you know that I want to do, I want to be a musician and I'm going to do thus and such? Was there anything you wanted to be, any dreams or goals?
Speaker 2: Well at the time, you know I say, around what, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, you know, Mingus and I used to be on the Red Car [Pacific Electric Railway] and we'd jam every time we'd go from Watts [Los Angeles, California] to Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: Charles Mingus.
Speaker 2: Charles Mingus that is, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And we'll talk about him later on.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, we'll talk about him, but this is the thing that we started. We realized that music made people happy and we enjoyed playing it when people were listening and enjoying it. So Mingus used to do that. So, I was also the one that started him to play the bass only because he played cello and I had a band you know when I was still twelve and then, you know, after I got the music from Ducey [Ducey Williams], and I asked him well if you had a bass or do you have a bass. I knew he didn't have--I knew he had a cello. I said that if you get a bass, then you'd be my bass player. So it all started early. I knew at twelve, you know, what I wanted to be but I just didn't know how to get there so we just started playing, you know. And when he got the bass, then we'd go up from L.A., I mean from Watts to L.A. and we'd just jam. We heard the radio had good jazz all the time then. Well, you know, like now you don't hear anything. The bands were all Ellington [Duke Ellington], Basie [Count Basie], Benny Goodman. In fact, they opened up one of the shows with Benny Goodman's bugle blues. (Imitates trumpet) You know, so the rhythm was hot then, you know. So if you're going to play, you got to get a little of it in your soul and people on the Red Car, they recognized some of the stuff we were playing 'cause we were just borrowing what we heard.
Speaker 1: Now, the Red Car, was it trolley car?
Speaker 2: It was the troll- the car. They had the local and the--you know, they you call it?
Speaker 1: The express?
Speaker 2: The express would be a good word, yeah. The express, you know, maybe go four or five miles before it stopped. The local stopped probably every half mile or so or ever little stop sign, you know like Florence [Street], and then Slauson [Avenue] or either, you know, Imperial [Highway], or just the close stops. So it was convenient for people wanting to get to their homes and things. But, we'd take the local, which was the slow one and it had a little slow pace, in fact, we could even find a groove 'cause it had a bounce to it. (Scats) We'd be playing the rhythm and the conductor would be waving back and the people just loved it. In fact, a lot of times we'd get on, we wouldn't open up the case and Mingus wouldn't zip his bass down and people say, "You guys gone play today?" We say, "Yeah, we'll play."
Speaker 1: So, you actually played on the trolley itself?
Speaker 2: On the trolley. We get on the trolley, we had to get--that was our travel--I didn't have a car then, I didn't have the Dodge yet from my grandmother. I was about fifteen when I got that, but yeah we'd play on the train, you know, going to L.A. to practice with a band.
Speaker 1: So, Mingus would have his cello or the bass?
Speaker 2: No, he traded the cello. The story was, I told him if he could trade his cello, take his dad [Charles Mingus, Sr.] to the music, have his dad take him to the music store, trade the cello and get a bass and they did that, you know.
Speaker 1: So you all would actually just pull the instruments right out on the trolley car and just start playing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what started the music thing and we found out again, magical.
Speaker 1: People love music (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But we were like the wiz kids or something. We'd be playing, you know, blues or whatever we heard. We didn't know all the terms, what it was called then, but we could play what we heard on the radio. When the kids liked that, they can do a lot of stuff. So we played and one thing led to another.
Story_ID: 486967
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned earlier--
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: --that your family attended church or--but not--you weren't forced.
Speaker 2: No, my [paternal] grandmother [Matilda Collette] was in church you know, all the time, sang in the choir. My mother [Goldie Dorris Collette] was in church and sang in the choir. So they both had different churches and different religions probably, you know, and so but they still were very much into church life.
Speaker 1: And you went also, every now and then, occasionally?
Speaker 2: Well, we would go sometimes on Sunday, more to my grandmother's then my mother. My mother didn't push it, but she just felt that was her life and she'd go and sing, my mother always liked so many people. She'd make friends with people and so I got a lot of that from her I'm pretty sure. 'Cause, you know, nobody was a stranger to me if I met them and they seem to be nice or I read and travel and worked like in Europe with a band. I didn't know anybody, I felt at home, I mean, I was no stranger when you get it early. That's what I was saying we'll talk about the other thing about how the school worked too, you know, and all the stuff in my life happened. The main thing if you meet people and you know you giving them respect and they give you the respect, everything is straight from there on.
Story_ID: 486968
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where did you go to junior high school? You mentioned that it was--
Speaker 2: It was the same school as the--junior and senior were together. The junior high school is all called David Starr Jordan High School on 103rd [Street] in Watts [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: David Starr Jordan?
Speaker 2: David Starr Jordan, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, at hundred--
Speaker 2: 103rd Street in Watts, California
Speaker 1: Okay. And it was in Watts?
Speaker 2: Yeah. It was six through twelve. You know, where the other schools were like six to nine and then ten to twelve, so you know the grades.
Speaker 1: So, now were there any influential friends? Who were your friends or anybody was there that, was your good friend that we might know by name today?
Speaker 2: Sure, you know the Woodman brothers. The Woodman brothers.
Speaker 1: The Woodman brothers, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, you may not know all of them, but Britt Woodman, family played with Ellington [Duke Ellington]. His father, Mr. Woodman, his also was William, Sr. [William Woodman, Sr.], played trombone and Ellington when he needed a trombone player, wanted Mr. Woodman to join the band and he said, "No, I'm going to have my sons play; I'm not gonna get out on the road. I want to teach my sons." So, but he told Ellington at that time. Now, I don't know what year that was but it'll be '30s [1930s] or something.
Speaker 1: Britt Woodman.
Speaker 2: Britt Woodman, yeah, got with Ellington. So the father told Ellington he says, "Well, I won't take the job but I'll train my son. He'll be in your band one day." And thirty or forty years later, who's playing trombone, Britt Woodman, like you said.
Speaker 1: So, he was very determined (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So that's a famous name.
Speaker 1: He was a friend of yours. Anyone else that you can recall?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, Joe Adams. You know that name? Joe Adams is a manager for Ray Charles. He also was a disc jockey. You know, he's a guy that's done a lot of stuff here.
Speaker 1: Joe Adams.
Speaker 2: He was at the school and--
Speaker 1: He's featured in the movie ['Ray'] actually. They talked about Joe Adams.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right and they're doing a play and he's probably going to be a part of that too. So he was one of the students. Also, Joe Perry, the football player. Joe "The Jet" Perry. I don't know. He was with the 49ers [San Francisco 49ers] or somebody in that area, Oakland [sic.] or something. But, he was excellent.
Speaker 1: So there's quite a bit of talent in that school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, listen. Joe Comfort. You know that name?
Speaker 1: No I don't.
Speaker 2: Bass player. Did most of the records with Sinatra [Frank Sinatra], Nelson Riddle and all that. Joe Comfort.
Speaker 1: And you all went to Starr Jordan High School?
Speaker 2: Yeah. They all went the same, same time, you see, even though a couple may have been two or three years older. They're all at the same school because the junior and senior together, you see?
Story_ID: 486969
Speaker 1: How was your experience there at that school [David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California] with those guys? How was that?
Speaker 2: Well that's what I'm saying. It was marvelous for you. If you the young guy there and you got some of your heroes right there, they may be three or four years older and you're right next to them and in the band, if you can play a little bit, then you're in there with them. So, it worked to your advantage, you know. You don't have to wait 'til later to meet them, you met him right there. He say, well, "I remember you. You were in the class below me." But, that's how it worked, they didn't plan it that way but that's the way it worked. If you had a big brother or something, the Woodman brothers there were four of them actually and the three went to school. Now Britt [Britt Woodman] was the youngest one so he could have been, say twelve, or beginning to go to middle school. The other one fourteen, the other one sixteen or something like that, two years apart. So they had a little band, the best little band you've ever heard because the father [William Woodman, Sr.] had taught them. They had to come home right from school to study music. The father said, "I'm going to have them--." And they were playing as good or better than some of the grown up people because the father spent that time. He saw something that a lot of us didn't see. They had to come home from work every day right on time and practice two or three hours and they all played three instruments. The first one, Coney [Coney Woodman] played piano, guitar and banjo, you know, so at that time, he had to practice them all. William [William Woodman, Jr.], the second one, he's the only one living, I just talked to him yesterday. Two days ago. 'Cause he just called me to see how I'm doing; which I'm doing fine. But William played trumpet, alto sax and clarinet. So it takes a lot of time to get three instruments. I played three so I know the time. But they were young guys playing like twelve or fifteen years old when they started and the other, Britt the trombone player, played trombone, tenor sax and clarinet. So they had these songs, they could play pieces with the big bands, Tommy Dorsey had a thing on 'Marie' and another song that were hits and they could recreate the sound because they had the trombone and had the reed and the guitar and the piano, guitar playing in the back (hums song), 'Song of India' and 'Marie' and they could play the arrangements, you know. You never heard anything like that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And their father was very instrumental. He kind of had the same--I would compare that to how Venus and Serena's father [Richard Williams] made them play tennis. Come home and practice. So he had the same concept.
Speaker 2: Probably so, yeah. You see, when you're doing it every day when you're young enough. The father is driving it like Tiger Woods' father [Earl Woods] too, you see.
Speaker 1: So there is some validity in parents being involved in that as you can see?
Speaker 2: Especially if the kids like it and can do it. You got a combination. This man played so good, in fact, our mothers and people would go to the dances where the kids played, you know and they shouldn't have been out and all of them developed the problem of sleepiness, you know. One was a nar- what do you call it?
Speaker 1: Narcolepsy.
Speaker 2: Narcolepsy. The brothers, they would go to sleep when they're driving he said, "I can't drive anymore," and I think that was part because they were staying up all the time and had to go to school, sleeping in school, kids, you know.  And so it helped and hurt them. But, what I am saying, our parents would hear them at a party, I was playing parties too later on too, and they would say, "Boy, you guys sound good but you gotta hear those Woodman brothers." The Woodman brothers was the best band and like I said, the grown up people couldn't play any better cause they had adopted, they had achieved this. That it would take you another ten years to do the normal way, but the father would sit down with them, put the metronome, making sure they were playing in time and, "Okay, now get the clarinets and let's play that." So he was doing that with them and people would wonder, "Why is he doing all that?" Well, he knew why he was doing it. He said was going to make them to be the best there was. But it good and bad like I said, they learned so good but everybody wanted to hear them play, so they'd be playing in the middle of the week and have to go school. So the school work suffered a little bit, they got through it, but I'm just saying, it's not easy.
Speaker 1: And it worked because Britt became part of the Ellington [Duke Ellington] orchestra?
Speaker 2: Yeah, playing first trombone.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: You take Lawrence Brown's place, I mean, very few guys, Lawrence Brown was one of the best trombones, you know. We don't have players.
Story_ID: 486970
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's about 1933 and you're about twelve years old and you're going to Jordan, Starr Jordan High School.
Speaker 2: David Starr Jordan [David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Right and you're going there and some of your friends are the Woodmans who are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the Woodman brothers.
Speaker 1: Woodman brothers, who are great musicians.
Speaker 2: Excellent. Their father [William Woodman, Sr.] taught them early so and he helped them to grow and practice and everything so it did work out for them.
Speaker 1: And now 1933, that was in the middle of the Great Depression and you were studying music in high school. What was that like? What was going on for you and your family and your friends at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm pretty sure, you know, looking back at it, everybody was having a rough time financially, but my mother [Goldie Dorris Collette] was the type, you know, and at that time you had to know how to prepare your food, and how to shop and everything to keep things going and she did that quite well. You know, there are times where my dad [Willie Collette], you know, as much as he was working, he didn't leave very much money, and yet he was pretty tight with his money anyway, but was rough enough. He'd leave a dollar and we had to lunch money out of it and food, but somehow my mother would make it work. So it was tough, you know, but we hadn't experienced that before as kids, so as long as there was food on the table, and she gave you a little hug and everything, we thought it was okay. Okay as far as we were alive, you know there were a lot of little things young kids can go through if you give them certain things. They didn't give us everything we wanted but we had to go to the movies on the weekend. My grandfather also would help out. We'd go to his house over the week and study for our piano lessons and also he'd let us cut his lawn, he'd want us to do that, to make a little money. He'd give us fifty cents, my sister [Doris Collette Slater] and I, we'd cut the lawn and he'd teach us how to do that and then we'd take the fifty cents and we'd split it, a quarter a piece, and we could go to the show. First we'd get a malt, a hotdog and a malt was ten cents, hotdog was five cents and the show was ten cents. So we had a big day on Sundays. So, you know, we were lucky, we were fortunate. You know, that was a big day after going to school and having a Sunday. On Saturday, we'd go to my grandfather's house and my grandmother would have us, you know, dust the furniture and little stuff. So we were making it.
Speaker 1: So it seems like that, even through that, your family had a very, had a deep impact as far as positive thinking. You all dealt with the good side of things versus the negative side of things (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right and they kind of made us feel like, hey we still got warm food. For Christmas, I mean not Christmas, but Christmas they have a good dinner. But, I'm saying, the Sunday our dinner was like family dinner. My dad was always there. And they could make the biscuits and chicken, you know, so we were still doing--we had chickens and you know it was really exciting because they took care of us very well and I never worried about not having enough, although, we'd ask for show money sometimes from my dad, I just think sometimes he just hate to give up his money. He say, "Well, no, you didn't clean the yard right," or something. He would always have an excuse. So, I guess some ups and downs but we handled it okay. You know, we weren't that spoiled that we just had to get everything we wanted.
Story_ID: 486971
Speaker 1: So, now was there anybody during that time period, Mr. Collette [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette], that really influenced you? Was it a teacher or anybody in particular when you're twelve or thirteen, 1933, '34 [1934]. Is there any somebody that had a big influence on you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm pretty sure, yeah. Well, at twelve that's when in junior high school [David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California], like I say, the brothers were at the school and they could play, the Woodman brothers, and see they were--
Speaker 1: They were a big influence on you?
Speaker 2: They were a big influence on all of us because you see down here kids around our same age or maybe a year or so older that are playing like we wish we could play when we were thirty years old. You know we hadn't got there so these kids are doing it early. So it would either cramp your style, which means it would discourage you, or would make you, every now and then doing something so good you got to see if you can keep up with them and that was it. Now Britt [Britt Woodman] was playing higher notes then, you know a lot of the trombone players that we knew, men, you know. Louis Armstrong band that came to town, that was when I was about fourteen or fifteen or a little older but my parents [Goldie Dorris Collette and Willie Collette] took me to hear them. Now Britt was playing as good as those guys were but he was then only about fourteen years old. So I am saying (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was playing as good as the guys in the Armstrong band?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he had all the notes and his dad [William Woodman, Sr.] was the trombone player. He taught him when he was about eight or maybe earlier and so we're going to school with them and made those guys our friends. The kid, the guy, the brother [William Woodman, Jr.], he's eighty-seven now. He called me on the phone the other day, like I say, that's the middle brother, he was my first clarinet teacher so I said, "He plays so good, I'd better make him my friend." I didn't have any money. I gave him a watch or something (laughter) for six lessons. So all this is going on and I remember but you are trying to figure out how I'm going to get better. I know the guy that knows more than me and can teach me, I better make him my friend. So, you know, this is kid's thinking. Funny, it still works because I laughed and said, "You know, you're my first teacher," the other night, now that's been what, gotta be he's eighty-seven, seventy, eighty years almost, or at least seventy. And, I'm talking about it said, "You my first (unclear)." He laughed and said, "Well, no you're the guy," because now he turns and run when I tell him that. We have a book out called, 'Central Avenue Sounds' ['Central Avenue Sounds: Jazz in Los Angeles'] and it's in the book. They interviewed seven of us for the one book. So we all have different versions of what we are talking about. But when I told him, I said, "You taught me."  He said, "I don't remember that."  He didn't but I remember it. But we are growing and the Woodman brothers had a dance at their studio every Wednesday night. Their band played and the kids would come and dance. So I'm listening to people and saying, "Boy if I could ever play like that," but I'm hearing and I figured if I work hard, maybe I can.
Story_ID: 486972
Speaker 1: Now during that time period, you know, you are going to school, you're twelve or thirteen, how else did you spend your time, what else did you do, or was music your primary focus at that time, trying to better yourself?
Speaker 2: Well, music was a lot of it. You know with my musical friends like Charlie Mingus after he started playing with the band, he had a feeling for music that probably as strong as anybody you ever heard. He just loved it. He would put his bass on his shoulders and walk from 108th Street to 96th Street [Los Angeles, California], you know, a kid with a full size bass, it might have been a little smaller, carrying it on his shoulders like he was a strong guy, always big and strong. Walked in my house every morning before I'd get up in the summer, knock on the door at nine o'clock and I wasn't even up yet. He would say, "We're going to play today?" "Yeah, we'll play." So I'm saying as long as I'm around him what am I going to say, no. I love music too but you can't chase anybody down. If you love it and nobody else love it, so you're playing alone, but that was every day he had to play. Once you play, the next day was a dream too, cause you going to play some more good tunes.
Speaker 1: So you spent a lot of time playing music--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and Charles Mingus was a personal friend. How old was Charles Mingus around this time when he was coming over to your house?
Speaker 2: How old was he?
Speaker 1: Yes, Mingus?
Speaker 2: Well, he was about six months under me, so we were pretty close.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you all met at Jordan High School [David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California], at the school?
Speaker 2: We met between Jordan High School and my home. One day, I see this guy with a shine box, but the shine box is real high like this and looking like a chicken coop or something with long legs. I used to shine shoes so I saw him but I knew that I would recognize him when I saw him. The reason why I am saying this because they say, "Mingus' family plays cello and sister Grace [Grace Mingus Washington] and Vivian [Vivian Mingus Myles] they played piano and violin." They said, "Mingus is strange guy," and you know there are times in the '60s [1960s]. He might've created that period. He cut his head with a cross through the middle (laughter). He'd come to school and he'd be doing something completely different than anybody else. But the kids thought it was funny and then he would get into a fight later on, always different kind of guy. He get into a fight he'd lose and he'd say, "You're gonna fight me tomorrow, you know," (laughter) and he say, "'Cause I gonna finally beat you." He would keep fighting the guy and the kids would all be behind him like an event and they would say, "Mingus is going to fight the guy again today, he gone get whipped again," and maybe get whipped two or three days and the third day, then he beats the guy. I mean he had stuff going so this is the wild side of him and the other side, he plays music so beautiful that no one could help but smile and he loved me you know because he thought I did so much for him 'cause I said, "Get a bass," and that bass changed his whole life.
Story_ID: 486973
Speaker 1: During this time period, were you already convinced, saying okay I wanted to be a professional musician, were you at that point by twelve or thirteen? Were you convinced that this is what you wanted to do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well, I did not know that I could make a living at it. I didn't get that far at the point, I was enjoying something. I wasn't a football player or basketball player and some of my friends were that, you see, they had found their thing. But I didn't find the music thing until we started playing jobs, my parents [Goldie Dorris Collette and Willie Collette] helped that too because they started giving out--people gave house parties at these times, and we got Mingus [Charles Mingus] and myself and maybe a piano or guitar or something, a trio player and they would say, "You guys were great tonight." We got compliments but we weren't great, we were just kids trying to do it, you see what I mean? So now I am enjoying this and gosh, you can't take this away from me, you understand that one, because we found something that we got, we got only ten dollars for the three of us that whole night, you know two or three dollars apiece. Well, we wasn't making that money, but that was a lot of money at that time, you know my dad left a dollar a day so you can imagine that was a little short what I'm saying. Uh, we found something that we like, so even if I didn't make any money, I still would have done it, you see.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you loved what you did (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It wasn't enough money, a lot of kids grow up and say, "You're not going to make any money at that or have any fun either." But we were having fun on the Red Car [Pacific Electric Railway], we were having fun playing for our mothers' parties and they say, "Can you guys make it again next week?" "Yeah," so you see what I mean? I enjoy this even if I don't make any money, I'll still be playing it. A lot of people do something that they enjoy, you know.
Speaker 1: How long were you at Jordan High School [Davis Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California]? How long were you there?
Speaker 2: How many years?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well six years, I pretty sure of, from the six grade through the twelfth.
Speaker 1: So about from '33 [1933] to '39 [1939]?
Speaker 2: Well, I actually, I graduated--so it should have been that but I think I graduated 19--in fact, I just went back to the school and we took my band here just about two months ago back to the school for the kids. They have all senior now, it's not junior and senior. But I hadn't been there in about--I even taught there later on, but I--after the [U.S. military] service, but I graduated and went to '41 [1941].
Story_ID: 486974
Speaker 1: You're in the '40s [1940s], and what did you do after that? Was it college, or did you go into the service, what (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went to LACC [Los Angeles City College] for a while, a junior college, which is here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]--
Speaker 1: Okay, and you stayed--
Speaker 2: And then, I went there for a while, then I went into the service, World War II [WWII].
Speaker 1: World War II. What branch of service did you go into?
Speaker 2: The U.S. Navy Reserve, the Navy.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you went into the Navy Reserve.
Speaker 2: I enlisted in it.
Speaker 1: You enlisted, so you weren't drafted? You personally enlisted (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no. At that time, drafting was going on. My age and other young men my age were getting drafted into the cavalry and things like that. So a chief petty officer from the Navy came in town to recruit a band. They came to musicians' union [American Federation of Musicians Local 767; American Federation of Musicians Local 47], which at that time, was segregated, you know, a black union and a white union. We'll go into that later because we help changed that, but I'm saying the guy come into town and says I need a black band to be stationed in Oakland [California], Saint Mary's Pre-flight School [Saint Mary's College of California, Moraga, California], right outside of Oakland. So he recruited guys, a bunch of guys like Jackie Kelso, Chico Hamilton, no Chico Hamilton didn't go with us. He was in the cavalry, I think - Jackie Kelso, Jerome Richardson from Oakland, Marshal [Marshal Royal] and Ernie Royal and a bunch of the guys here all signed up and so we were stationed for the three years of the World War II at Saint Mary's Pre-flight. So, we liked our job, we had our blue suits on and we played for the colors, the rising of the flag and the marching cadets and stuff like that. They also needed a band for the dances on Sunday, which we played some of them but the other band played most of them.
Speaker 1: It seemed to me that was a very smart move for you to enlist because you did not have to go too far. You went to the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California] and you did not go too far from home because you were based in northern California?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a smart move but a lot of people were saying, "You guys are being duped," you know how people say. But you know when it is true when they say you guys be stationed here, you will be playing music which you can do and no riding the horse and being shot at and all that.
Speaker 1: Plus your family wasn't that far away from you--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Your family, they were still here and you were in the northern part of town, of California.
Speaker 2: Right, and every now and then I could get a leave of absence. In fact, one time they needed a baritone and I had one and most guys hadn't gotten out of service to go home for the day or so and they said, "We need a baritone sax," and I said, "I got one and I will sell it to you, I got to go home to get it." Which I came home three days, nobody had time off but me, I figured it out. But you know it was a lot of stuff going on.
Story_ID: 486975
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, now when you were in the band there [in the U.S. Navy Reserve], did you lead groups there? Were you the leader because you seem- you probably had a lot of musical experience already?
Speaker 2: Well, actually I was the leader of the second band. The first band was Marshal Royal, he was the guy that played with Count Basie later on, and his brother was a great baritone player, Ernie Royal. But reason why I got the one band, actually there were forty-five musicians all total that were in there, enlistments, you know. So they wanted to have one band cause it had a Count Basie arrangements and Marshal Royal wanted me in the best band, I was one of the better players at the time and I didn't want to work with Marshal, in fact the guy showed me a lot of research, said kind of stay away from Marshal 'cause he kind of a bad guy, you know, he could do some tricks on you which I knew later, he was right. So once I get there, they start demanding, he said, "You don't want to play with my band?" And I said, "Well, I don't want to carry the baritone," 'cause I knew what he wanted to do, he didn't want me on my sax, my alto or tenor. So what happen with that was he built the band and he started to put the bad word on the chief like I was the bad guy because I wouldn't go into the band so I said I just don't want to play baritone and walk with that and so, finally they were getting all the breaks, they were playing the dances, they would have Monday off of if they played on Sunday so those were the opportunities we wanted. We would have to do the mopping in every unit of the barracks, you know because we were the work team. I didn't have to do it, but I had to see that my guys did it 'cause I was still like a step above them in a way. They were third class, second class and first class musicians. So I was second class first and then we could work up and finally get to first class and you had to do your test and your swimming test and all those things. But what I am getting to was the idea that they did all the playing of the jobs then they could go to San Francisco [California] on Monday and have free time off. Monday we would be on the base; they had the best deal and I say, "How can we do that?" And chief did not like our band and he did not like some of the guys. Some of the guys couldn't play and had been postmen and they had been barbers and all that stuff. You know I was a real musician. I mean I had played music before I got--some of the guys hadn't seen a horn in ten years, you know. They just used the horn to get in there, you know, we're musicians. So the guy was so unhappy with us, the chief, that meant me too 'cause I couldn't prove anything, you got a bad band, you all are just like a bad bunch of apples or something and they're no good. So I talked to the guys, the guys were beautiful human beings and I said, he said, the chief said he is going to send us all away. So that threaten a lot of them, 'cause nobody wanted to get into the active war at that time. So I said, "Well guys--."  They wouldn't even let us use the hall for anything, we had to go outside the hall and so I said, "Well, if you guys would listen to me, I have been a teacher before and I can give you advice which you got to do, first you got to start practicing. I give you some studies, some scales, and intervals and things that you got to practice and we'll give you some help on the reading on all that you need," and so they all listened. Some of the guys are older than me, but a couple of the guys were professional guys but they enlisted to stay out of the war. So we said we didn't have a place to practice. I said, "We'll just practice outside, we don't need a room. The main thing you guys do the work alone," long tones, brass players--couple of them got so good, I couldn't believe it. The trombone player got so good in my band that wasn't too good, that they stole him from me and they said, "We want that trombone player for our band," that happened. So what I'm saying, the point was, I told the guys and they almost did what I said if you can believe that. "You said if we did long tones for an hour," they said, "we did three hours," and the trumpet player had got lips so strong, he would just make high notes. First they still wasn't good musicians but they did something and we realized this was working.
Speaker 1: They bought into your teamwork concept?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the teamwork and see they all work together and the loved it and they thought I was a little king or something, but I was just one of the guys. I would do the same thing but we would be under the trees, out on a rock, it was a beautiful area and they utilized it especially if you're playing outside that is a whole different thing too because you don't have the walls, like playing in the bathroom, you're getting too much sound. Out there in the open, when your song gets better when you come into a room you really got a sound. So we learned a lot by that.
Story_ID: 486976
Speaker 1: I want to just, just digress momentarily.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I need to go back for a moment. You were, you were, you switched to saxophone from piano, around twel- eleven or twelve years old?
Speaker 2: Right, somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: So now, and the gentleman, Woodman [William Woodman, Jr.] was one of your first teachers on--
Speaker 2: Clarinet.
Speaker 1: On the clarinet.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now who was your first teacher on saxophone? Did you have a teacher for saxophone or did you just start studying it on your own?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't. I had people that showed me a thing. There as a guy down the street named Elson Campbell [ph.], who was playing saxophone. He used to play just for us, he was three or four years older than us meaning that--I taught a guy, Vernon Slater when I got a saxophone, you know then, kids would teach each other. Vernon didn't have a saxophone and I had my saxophone and when I begin to play pretty good, he wanted to play and hung with me and it was very awkward because I could play and play my sax and he didn't even have a saxophone. So my dad [Willie Collette] and his mother got together. They realized what was going on, the kid wants to play just like Buddy [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette] and have a horn too, so they chipped in and bought him a horn which I didn't know. All of a sudden, he got a saxophone. I figured out later, years, he must have bought it. So at first we were playing on my horn, which is not the way. Kid supposed to have his own mouthpiece and everything. And so I would stand on one corner (unclear) the keys and I'd give him certain notes and when I play this and then you answer me, you know. So we just kids trying to figure out how to do it, learning as we go.
Speaker 1: So for the six years at the school [David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California] and stuff, you developed your whole woodwind concept, with clarinet, saxophone, flute (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well you know every now and then, for example, a lot of the concert literature has saxophone and clarinet. The clarinet parts are actually better, more like the string part or something, more interesting. So if you are a clarinet player and the guy say, "Well would you rather play sax or clarinet?" I need the clarinet more than the saxophone. You might say that you want to be saxophone. So the clarinet is the most difficult so some of them shy away and play the saxophone. So you wind up playing the clarinet and you get to be a better musician 'cause you're playing heavy literature, more notes, more--clarinet is built in twelves, so you got two or three, you get into one register and the saxophone you just put in octave key and you go up into the next register and hit a higher note, but a clarinet you put the octave key, go up a twelfth. So you got--so it's a little difficult to understand and it challenges you to be a better musician.

Speaker 1: But I want to come back forward through your enlisted years in the [U.S.] Navy Reserve and in '42 [1942] and '45 [1945] there was a lot going on racially still I'm sure and you, you said that you wanted a black band that got put together, which happened--
Speaker 2: You mean for the Navy, yeah, right?
Speaker 1: Did you experience and I heard you mention a few things that you couldn't practice in certain things. Did you experience--what was it like as far as the racial conduct between people there? Even though you enlisted, you had a band and most times you said the musicians are pretty friendly and we get along, you know regardless of color, but what was the tone during that time period for you? What did you experience?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, you see the service and all that wasn't integrated so it was separate, but I hadn't grown up that way either. You see what I am going through, I had to accept what it was. I traveled south for example, too and everybody knew that you don't go to the bathrooms, you know, I mean we couldn't go to lunch counters. Sometimes the bus driver who was white could go in a get sandwiches for everybody, so I knew all that. So we got there, I wasn't expecting anything. The band was all-black, there might have been a couple of Hawaiian guys in there or something, but as long as they were dark skinned--the cadets were all white, so it was no real prejudice. They just treated us differently and we treated them as who they were. We didn't have to do an Uncle Tom thing is what I'm saying, we all got along. They liked the music; they liked the band that was playing good dance stuff. They even say, "You guys are great." So everybody just more or less stayed in their place. But, you know, there was still problems in Oakland [California], San Francisco [California] and places like Redwood City [California]. We'd play there, on a night club is what I'm saying. That was what we were going through. We just knew and sometimes we'd put on our civilian suits. They didn't even know we were Navy people cause then if the MPs would be around, the military police, of course. They would know you or knew that you had changed your clothes; you'd get in trouble that way. But that's the only way we could work. They didn't want you working on the stand and taking civilian's jobs.
Speaker 1: I noticed that you said in your previous conversation about your life growing up--so it was very different from how you grew up, but you're telling me that you were able to accept it pretty easily and just deal with it. You were able to adjust and adapt to what was going on even though you grew up in a multicultural neighborhood [Central Gardens, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But you were able to say okay you understood what it was so you dealt with it?
Speaker 2: Well yeah, only because we knew what we were there for, we were the band, the band was a black basically and that's what they wanted. So we only did what we did well, playing for the marching, playing for the dances and everybody was friendly. But I say there was no real mingling. You didn't try to date the ladies and all that. You see, that was a little too farfetched at the moment. But I'm saying, we were friendly with people and sometimes they'll run up talk to you and you'll feel uncomfortable because there'd be people looking at you now saying, "Now, what's going on here?" And you'd just be answering questions. "Didn't we see you in a club?" And, "Didn't you work in San Francisco?" You know, you'll get those kinds of questions and some of the ladies could be close and guys would look and say, "What is this now?" But it wouldn't bother me because all the stuff I'm talking about later when the amalgamation all that got together, then we begin to see the real world, so what are they like when you really challenge them, you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Day to day and working with them and also going to their house for dinner. They come to your house and they know your kids and you know theirs, so. We hadn't got there yet is what I'm saying. This is, we're accepting just what it is. Now the service, even on the base, we didn't sleep on the base, we slept in San Francisco and wherever you wanted to live, but we had to be there every morning at eight o'clock to raise the flag. So that was what it was. We had our own cars, so it was kind of nice at that period. We talking about 1941, '42 [1942], '43 [1943] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right between '42 [1942] to '45 [1945].
Speaker 2: Yeah, '45 [1945] was when we, more or less, we were discharged.
Speaker 1: Now, where was Mingus [Charles Mingus] during this time period?
Speaker 2: Mingus didn't, he went with me to Oakland to enlist but when he got there, he changed on 'em. He complained and said, well they didn't have a string bass there in the band 'cause this was a concert band and they would have to play either bass drum or something like that and he didn't like that. Then he said he had bad feet; he just talked himself out of it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So he came, he came back?
Speaker 2: Well, he came back on home, he and a guy named Bill Douglass was a drummer, a tall drummer. I don't know if you've heard his name, he came and he didn't get in either, he got into the cavalry. But they picked me. I did an audition on clarinet. I don't know if I did that well or not, but I guess some of the players couldn't play at all, so what I was doing, I mean I danced it off and he could see that I was into music. It does make a difference, you know, if you kind of like what you're doing.
Story_ID: 486978
Speaker 1: So now we're in 1945 and you get an honorable discharge out of the reserve [U.S. Navy Reserve]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and I see that one of the perks of that experience is that you got a four year, a four year grant to go study music?
Speaker 2: Yeah, from the service to study music. Now that was available especially with an honorable discharge and I accepted that of course.
Speaker 1: Okay and what school was that? Was that a particular school you were gonna go to?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I just went to different schools. It was called, the L.A. Conservatory [Los Angeles Conservatory of Music and Arts; California Institute of the Arts] that was here. It was downtown on 7th [Street] near Alvarado [Street]. I enlisted there and there was a thing called American Laboratory [ph.] was on Western [Avenue] and near Beverly [Boulevard]. They had different teachers and also you know, if you wanted to study singing, different instruments, and writing and all that. So I had about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, at this point, you're getting serious--
Speaker 2: What's that?
Speaker 1: So at this point, you're getting serious about making music?
Speaker 2: Well, I got this four years of G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944], some people didn't take it and I was talking to Jackie Kelso, who you probably know 'cause he was playing that thing with us at the Anson Ford [John Anson Ford Theatres, Los Angeles, California]. He just said, "Well, I chose to go out on the road with Roy Milton," those jobs were waiting for you too 'cause they couldn't get a lot of good musicians in the service. And so, yeah, I was serious because I said I'm gonna stay. I had the three kids and so I had to come home and not just stay where I was. I knew I could crack the studios because the studio players were better than I was at the time 'cause they had done the work and there's a way of shifting the sound and they could do that at any point they want. The players can say, "We'll change this and we'll do more vibrato then none." Then you come in there and have to know what they're gonna do because you have to all be able to shift gears with the players that they like. The lead players can do that, you see. No vibrato, we're going to vibrate four beats to--or four vibrations to the beat, a lot of things like that. So I was ready for them because I was studying and going to the right teachers and everything, learning what is it going to be 'cause if they call me, I'm thinking this way, I know they either if they don't hire me, then that's something else. But, it won't be because I can't play. Cause I could play already (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you realize--
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: So you realized that there was a real viable entity for you to be a professional musician in the studios and you could make money in television and things around here at that point. You realized that that was the route you wanted to go?
Speaker 2: That was the route. I also wanted to show that, 'cause at this point they figured black players couldn't read, they were good jazz players. But they prove that a few times, not all the black players but a few black bands, well I don't want to name the person at this time that had the band. But Universal [Universal Music Group] called an all-black band, it was supposed to be rehearsing with Nat Cole [Nat King Cole], I mean recording with Nat Cole and this leader told me, said, "Well--." I said, "You better have some good readers in there because these guys will pull out some new music on you and you have to play it on the spot." And I saw that from wanting to be a studio player. Barney Kessel, a great guitarist, told me once, he said, "You want to be a studio player, come and go with me to the Lux Theatre [Los Angeles, California] a couple of days you'll see what you have to be ready for." And I'd watch over the shoulders. I knew how to read the music, but the guys had, piccolo and clarinet, bass clarinet and all that in front of them, the reed players played three or four instruments and then the guy would bring a new batch of arrangements and say, "Okay, you guys ready? One, two," and you'd hear the three piece go right on down, everybody play what's written and I'd say this is a thing they don't think, you know, black musicians, African American can do this. And the doubles, some of the guys would say, "I only have the saxophone." He say, "Well, you need the clarinet and the flute on this too." And, I knew that was happening so I was studying all the instruments so I could, you know, if they did call me, I wasn't gonna let anybody down.
Story_ID: 486979
Speaker 1: Okay Mr. Collette [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette], you're back now in Los Angeles, California, you've gone to--you've been discharged from the Naval Reserve [U.S. Navy Reserve], you're starting to study music around at the various schools in the L.A. area to hone your craft on the flute, clarinet and saxophone, and you are back now in L.A., back with your friend, Charles Mingus. You're back home now and did you all start any groups or anything? Did any of the groups that you started--did you get a new band together? Usually when we get back home we start a new band, what did you do?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well we basically did that and when I get in town of course I called him because he had been writing me letters. He was a serious musician and Charles' letter would say something like, he wouldn't say like, "Hi, dear Buddy," like most letters start out with, but he would say, "You told me to practice eight hours a day or something and I've been doing that and I'm getting real good here." He said, "Now I get into fights because I tell people to tune up their ears and they get mad at me," you know. That would be the letter, you know and, "I'm working hard," and he always believe me whatever I would say. I would always talk what I had learned from teachers and just thought that would be a good way. So when I came back, he said, "I'm glad you're back 'cause I got some guys waiting for you. I got Britt Woodman, I got Lucky Thompson, I got Spaulding Givens [Nadi Qamar], I got Oscar Bradley, drummer." So he had some names and so he said, "We can start our band now," it was like a dream to him that we had talked about before I went to service--he didn't go into the service, he had talked his way out like I said. So I said, "Well, let's call a rehearsal in about a week, you have any music?" And he said he had some music written and I begin to write too cause I had written in the service and then we got to Lucky Thompson, I had some Jimmy Lundy [William "Jimmy" Lundy] arrangements. Spaulding Givens was a good writer, boy he wrote a thing on the (unclear), you know the (unclear) was kind of new then.  Bbeboy it took us about a week to play it, not that we couldn't read it, but, first it had a melody up to a certain point, then someone else say, it take it away from us. It was a matter of getting that team work again. You know if you didn't come in right in time, it wouldn't work. So we just were discouraged for a while but we stayed with that and finally when it came together, man, we had never heard anything quite like that.
Speaker 1: So you all were performing around Los Angeles at that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No. Not yet. We figured we would rehearse, we rehearse every day for about two months, every day working on dynamics and all the different parts and we had some interesting music. It got so good, we would just kind of say, boy--we'd look at each other and say we've never heard anything like this to each other and were right 'cause we got the shading and all of a sudden, we would drop down, (scats), you know it was like a pot simmering on the stove. So what I'm saying is we did that and got hooked on it. Then we would take a break at noon, go over and have a hot dog at a little stand, Mingus lived about the area--West L.A. [West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] right near Avalon [Boulevard] or somewhere a little west of Broadway and stuff. But anyway, every day at his house and he had two little boys and he was married at that time, but his life was the music and he would say, "Hi kids," and then we would be back at the music. So what I'm saying is that the band got so good, somebody said, "Why don't we go and talk to the owner of the Downbeat [Los Angeles, California]." It was Black Dot McGee [Elihu "Black Dot" McGee] and Hal [Hal Stanley] something who married Kay Starr who was a vocalist, so he owned the club. So somebody called him, maybe I did, I don't know. I was acting like as manager, but not leader. So we were a corporation kind of thing. So I called him and Black Dot said, "We'd would like to come over and hear the band 'cause we'll hire you." We said, "It is a good band so you better come and hear it." So they came over one day and we played our whole repertoire, about ten tunes for them.
Story_ID: 486980
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The climate at that time must have been different because I don't think most musicians nowadays can even imagine the venue owner coming to hear them. It is usually the other way around where, where there's a lot of grappling and begging and trying to get onto a person's, or into a person's venue. So can you talk about how important music was to those venue owners also? They had to have music in their clubs, right at those time?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time it was more respect for the music, the good music musicians played, you know 'cause we knew what we were doing 'cause we were trying to get to the level where our heads were. Other people had learned, Lucky [Lucky Thompson] was naturally a great player. He had just left Count Basie's band maybe a couple years earlier. Lucky had an ego thing though, he was kind of like a perfectionist. He was as good as he thought he was in a way. The band was, we all more or less, had a chance to express our feelings about how the pieces should be played and we got it to a fine points where everybody was happy with the music and that could be softly and the drummer could almost (imitates drum), brush it sometimes and I wasn't playing flute and clarinet, I was only playing saxophone then. I played flute and everything 'cause I was studying at the time. One night I brought it in, that was when I started playing flute 'cause the audience looked at me like, "What are you playing there?" The flute had been heard but nobody played it as a lead instrument except for maybe the guy with Billy Eckstine, Wayman Carver.
Speaker 1: He was the first jazz flutist (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) First. Yeah. He played the flute on something, I can't think of the name now, it might be 'Skylark,' you know, but I'm saying you never heard a flute go (imitates flute), it was almost like a little added something, it was never like the solo instrument. We used it where you play a whole tune on it and people would say, "Wow, what is that?" "Well, it's the flute," and their mouths would hang it open 'cause they didn't know what it was 'cause it had a good sound, sounded very pleasant.
Speaker 1: So it's safe to say that you were one of the innovators of the jazz flute actually, as far as using it as a lead instrument?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah I think one of the ones out here, because I don't know what Frank Wess and Jerome Richardson, who was my buddy too from the band in Oakland [California]. He was also--we were all at that period, the flute was coming in, like Wayman Carver had recorded--we all had heard it and there was another guy name Harry Klee here that played quite well. But once you heard it you know, if were a saxophone player, the fingers quite a bit the same. If you could play that, you could go out and buy one. In fact, this is how I got mine. I mean I heard the record and one guy, a little young guy, was playing, I can't think of his name but he wasn't playing, he had put it into the pawn shop and he said, "Hey, I got a flute in the pawn shop for you Buddy [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette]." And I said, "Flute?" All of a sudden I wasn't going to go pay a lot of money for it, but he had one for about forty dollars or so he had gotten. So we went and got it and I said, "I got forty bucks. I'll give you that and give me the flute, I'll start practicing," and then in the meantime I start studying. But that band like I said, was so good.
Story_ID: 486981
Speaker 1: Let me tell you this little story because everybody--well, it's not a laughable thing, but we got so tight as a unit, we felt that, that line I told you about being a part of something is better, what did I say? All of nothing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All of nothing.
Speaker 1: Yeah. But anyway, these little things make you feel that sometimes. We were part of a group and looked like we were part of the group and we rehearse like that and we were just like a bunch of brothers, you know. Then all of a sudden we go to the--we had the Black Dot [sic. Downbeat, Los Angeles, California] and the guy come in to listen to us, we give him about a half-hour concert and he say, "Guys, that's good. That's enough, you're hired!" They were so excited and hadn't heard any band like this and so in the meantime, we said we were kind of disappointed because we got more stuff to play he says, "No, we haven't heard anything like that, it was good man, it was excellent," one of the best players I ever played with. So they said, "Can you guys come in next Tuesday?" We said, "Yeah," and they said, "We'll hire you and we're excited too." We hadn't even started thinking about work, we gotten involved in the band, you know. People don't do that anymore. We did it. We loved it. But, anyway went to the club to see if we could have a dress rehearsal, kind of a thing, you know, sound check or whatever you call it now. So we go to the club on Monday for a check, check the room and the stand and make sure--so we rehearsed and the room sounded just ideal for a seven piece band, four horns--we had a trumpet player named John Anderson, I forgot him. Anyway, four horns, three rhythms and so we played in the club and we played a couple of tunes and we said we don't have to play anymore 'cause it's so beautiful. So we don't have a name yet and so we had a little meeting and had a little lunch across the street and something and said, "What are we going to call it?" And nobody would want to take over--I didn't want to take over it 'cause we all respected everybody. So somebody said, "Why don't we call it," Dizzy [Dizzy Gillespie] and Bird [Charlie Parker] just left town, we're talking about '46 [1946] and '47 [1947] and so we said, "Why don't we just call it--they're calling theirs bebop, so we'll call it Stars of Swing. We want to bring the swing music back." You know 'cause bebop was great for a lot of music, but a lot of them didn't like it and a lot of them couldn't play it cause you had some different notes you play and the scales and stuff and they were bold with it, of course. But anyway, they start--we said that's good, we would just play real good music and that's all we would say and everything we wrote had, was melodic and nice and pleasant. Lucky [Lucky Thompson] had that big warm sound and I had a pretty sound on the alto, Britt [Britt Woodman] had a beautiful sound and the front line was just dynamite and the rhythm was just great. So, what we did, we said, "Well, there's a sign maker around the corner, why don't we get him just make a sign that says, Stars of Swing?" So we were all creating together and someone said, "Why don't we just put seven stars on the big sign," you know, big stars and Everett [ph.], the guy said here is the seven names, now you put their names whatever you want it so nobody would say my name should be on top (laughter), which happens anyway later. You'll see what I'm talking about. But anyway, the guy made the sign and he put it up, we would walk a couple of blocks--boy, we all were proud and maybe my name was in the middle, I don't know, but anyway, I was happy you know, that's our dream coming true. So now this is Monday. So Tuesday we'll see everybody tomorrow night at 8:30 because we hit at 9:00.  That was early enough. So we got there and when the guys got there, we looked at the sign and it had been changed, the sign said, "Lucky Thompson and His All Stars," and they had his name real big like that and we were just a little line, "And." So you know everybody got so angry, we had rehearsed for a few months now and it had come to this now, he's gone take the band over without even asking us, you know. And so, now the place is packed 'cause everybody heard about us, they had advertised us and we got Charlie Parker in the house, we got Eric Dolphy in the house, you know, we got people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They're all there on the first night, huh?
Speaker 1: They're there to hear us because we know those guys very well. Eric studied the same teacher I studied with too and he studied with me a while. But what I'm saying, all these people and the place is packed and the Stars of Swing and now it says, Lucky Thompson and the All Stars not even the Stars of Swing after the publicity and so the guys go in the back room and Lucky finally comes in with his chest out. So Mingus [Charles Mingus] wanted, you know, jump on him right then and said, "Man, what are doing trying to take the band?" And Lucky said, "Well, I'm the best player in the band," he had a pretty big ego and we said, "No, you're not really," and he said, "I got the best name," and we said, "No, you don't have the best name." He had come from either Detroit [Michigan] or New York [New York] or somewhere but now he's just gonna just take over and just did it in a way, like he could get away with it. He was in rare shape, he played very good, we could hardly play, we were so upset with him doing that. Mingus wanted to kill him, and we were screaming and the people out in the hall could see the guys in the dressing room are cursing each other out (laughter), it was, it was a wild night right?
Story_ID: 486982
Speaker 1: So, finally they went, "Hey guys, you got to get on the stand."  It's 9:15 already, you know we're wasting time. So we got on. We tried to play, you know. But we lost most of that stuff that we had because togetherness again, you know, if you got the team work you got a chance. Now he [Lucky Thompson] was in his own thing, he was playing very good and just running up and down the horn and it would come to me I couldn't even find my notes. I'm thinking about what he had done to me, and I'm missing and saying, this is no fun anymore. So we made it through the night, people liked it 'cause we're so good. We had a chance to drop down a little bit and still not be tossed out of the thing [Downbeat, Los Angeles, California]. So the next night we stayed around and we said, "Well, what should we do?" And we said, "Well, maybe we should try to report him to the union [American Federation of Musicians Local 767; American Federation of Musicians Local 47], we ought to do something." So the next night we stayed around and somebody said--they closed the club almost and somebody said, "Why don't we look in the back maybe the sign has been thrown into the trash." So Lucky had it taken down and put his up. So we went back there and it was still back there, the original sign, so we took his down and put this one back up (laughter). And the next night, Wednesday probably, he comes in and we're there early and he comes in and he finally sees the sign and now he loses his playing ability 'cause he's mad now, he's not going to play if the sign doesn't have his name on the top. So that night was great and then the next night he almost played like he couldn't play, just (scats), a couple of notes--he just wasn't going to cooperate at all--
Speaker 2: Sabotage (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, in his way. He's just being paid. So he would just come and play like I'm not the great Lucky Thompson, I'm just gone hit a few notes with these guys and so all this, the people were wondering what's going on. So the third night, he didn't even show up--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: So I said, "Well, I'll take him to the union, you know, report it." But the union at that time was black, all-black union, not that they couldn't take care of business, but they didn't know what to do. They said, "Well, he didn't show up, he didn't want to work?" "Yeah," I said, "he left us standing." We hired Teddy Edwards and Teddy was a good player. He went through a lot with him--
Speaker 2: The piano player Teddy Ed--
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: I mean saxophone player Teddy Edwards?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Teddy, that's what we needed cause Lucky was playing tenor. But naturally the sound had changed. We had worked a few months developing the type of sound that worked for the team, team work again and we had something together and you bring in someone new and they gonna play like they play in the section, maybe he was playing a little stronger than Lucky in something and it wasn't thinking of blending, he's just reading his notes you see. So it's a lot you learn about that when got a team player, so there's something special working there.
Speaker 2: And it's very hard to play under animosity. Very hard to play.
Speaker 1: Right. You see plus the band was good and a lot of record people came down. It was so good. But, you know, that's where you began to see labels being put on everything. "Well, it's not bebop, it's not what we know as swing, but what can we call it?" They said, "We like it but we don't know what to call it."  Well, you don't have to call it anything, it's good music. You know, but they were trying to get a good (unclear), but we like it but we don't know what it is.
Speaker 2: So that was the emergence of what we'll call music marketing, when things started going into labels (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, you're right, just like, they always have music--well it's this, this is cool jazz and they had that for a while. They had this, and so--
Speaker 2: West Coast sound.
Speaker 1: --West Coast and East Coast and there was a period when they begin, the companies would come up with Contemporary Records, Pacific Jazz [Pacific Jazz Records], Liberty [Liberty Records], there a lot of new record owners. Marketing, and it was pretty good 'cause a lot of the West Coast songs were selling. In fact, Contemporary and Pacific Jazz, you know that's when the Lighthouse [Lighthouse Cafe, Hermosa Beach, California] was coming in too. It was still a different sound but they wanted to have--, "What can we call it?" We said, "Well, it's just swing music you know and that's that." "We need something to define what it is." (Laughter) We said, "Just take it for what it is, it's everything," you know.
Story_ID: 486983
Speaker 1: You know, there's quite a bit of myth about Charles Mingus--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And Charles Mingus was obviously a good friend of yours.
Speaker 2: Excellent friend, was closer than a brother to me, you know.
Speaker 1: Can you give us some background on his true personality and give us a little insight into the mindset of Charles Mingus, outside of the fact that you said he was a wonderful, studious and serious musician? Who was Charles Mingus the man (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Who was he as a man? Well he was a fighter as a man meaning that he was caught with the racial thing a lot. He was very light-skinned and I don't know--his family, father [Charles Mingus, Sr.], all of them, sisters were very light complected, but he was a fighter. So what started the amalgamation which was getting (unclear) together. He was hired at the Million Dollar Theatre [Los Angeles, California]. I'll just give you an example and maybe it will help clear it up. He was there with the light skin and everybody was light, it was Billy Eckstine who was very light too but he was the singer at that time. That had to be like '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: Around 1946, '47 [1947]?
Speaker 2: Yes, around in there before the amalgamation started. But anyway, he's working with an all-white band, Mingus is, and I don't whether they thought he was Latin--Mexican or something, or not. But, you know, he knew he was black, you know, but his skin was light. The main thing here was he was unhappy that he was the only black in there and they didn't probably know what he was, but we know. His thing was he was outspoken, he wanted the truth and it didn't hurt to hold his tongue. So, what he did when he was hired, he told the guys that, "You guys must be all prejudice," you know and a bunch of white guys didn't want to hear that, they said, "What do you mean we're prejudice?" He says, "Well, if you weren't, then you'd have a guy like Buddy Collette [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette] who can read all your music and you know, and then we'd really show," 'cause we were talking about integration in the music thing and in other words, this would be the beginning of the amalgamation where blacks and whites would work together. He said, "You guys, we got a black singer," he told these guys, now they don't know him, he doesn't know them, but not too many people would've that kind of courage to do that. He didn't care whether he had the job or not is what I'm saying at this point he's going to stand up for right and so when he did that and told them, "You got to meet this guy Buddy," me, you know, because we had been together all this time. So, I go down to the theatre on the day when they had two shows, Thursday and Thursdays and Sundays or something. So we'll go down and he tells the guy who's the flute player there, he says, "This guy can play flute probably even better than you and he didn't get hire on this why not?" They couldn't answer those questions. But I, so I go down, you know, just going to meet the people, I don't want to argue with them. But when I was around him, he was cool. In fact, a lot of people say, "You don't even know Mingus," they would say, "when you're not around, he could tear a building down." I don't know about that 'cause I never saw him do any destructive stuff but I heard a lot of stories. But I came down there and he was a perfect gentleman and when the guy said, "Here's the guy who wants the unions to be together. He wants love between people and everybody." So I come down and I bring my flute and the guy has the books, we all studying now cause flute is beginning to be very popular, like I said, an instrument where you'd hear a little bit with the symphony, but very few jazz guys were playing it now. So I bring my flute down so he says, Mingus says, "Bring your flute 'cause he may want to ask if you play." So I said, "I'll bring it," so the guy has the books so I'm studying with the teacher which is the same books now so I know the literature. I didn't say anything and when I told Mingus, asked how it was he said, "Man, you played as good as he did on that or a little better." I said, "Well, I got the books at home so I knew what I was doing." He said, "Oh man, you read it perfectly," and I said, "No, I couldn't read that fast," 'cause the guy challenged me and put me on his right side 'cause the flute goes this way so he could play louder or something. But I'm saying, the whole thing was like a showcase of what we were getting into and the band members looked to see if I could read and play with, this guy Julie Kinsler was an excellent flute player. In fact, we got along right away 'cause he said, "Man you sounded good, you sounded (unclear)." I said, "Well, I've only played for two years." See I had played saxophone and clarinet and I took up flute when I came home from the--I had the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944]. Well I said--the top flute player, he said, "Buddy you got a pretty good flute there," sound you see, I was already a musician you see so I didn't have to start with the bad notes, I knew. So that was part of that.
Story_ID: 486984
Speaker 1: So after that, then one of the guys named Milt Holland, was a percussionist from the Chicago Symphony [Chicago Symphony Orchestra], he said, "Well look you guys want to have one union right? Why don't you tell me how you want to do this? You want to have a big meeting or what?" 'Cause he said, "I got four or five guys and they want to do the same thing." That was the first guy that put out his hand and said, let's do it.
Speaker 2: His name is was what now?
Speaker 1: Milt Holland.
Speaker 2: Milt Holland?
Speaker 1: I think he's still around. He was losing sight the last time I heard. Excellent percussionist, nice human being so, he was the first guy that said, "Well, if you want to have a meeting to talk about it, I can get four or five, ten guys that will do the same thing," and said, "We can start this with a meeting." I said, "Let's don't have a meeting, let's form an interracial symphony orchestra," I said, "'cause our guys are beginning to learn the music and you be guys be learning the jazz," you know. It was like, you know, a trade off kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Now was this around the same time you were doing the jam sessions at the Crystal Tea Room [Los Angeles, California], was this around the same time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No. This was before the Crystal--I mean this was after the Crystal Tea Room. The Crystal Tea Room might have been around the start of, what you call it, Stars of Swing around '45 [1945], '46 [1946].
Speaker 2: Around '48 [1948], '48 [1948], around '48 [1948] maybe?
Speaker 1: Maybe '48 [1948]. But all this, you know, probably a lot of it was going on at the same time. That whole period, the Crystal Tea Room was for guys like Eric Dolphy, Walter Benton, Ernest Crawford, these were all young guys that came there, you know, 'cause we wanted to make sure that they could read and play and Bill Green and I started that 'cause we got this Crystal Tea Room thing. In fact, we got a picture on the wall, I'm just saying. Dave Brian [ph.] was there, Bobby McNeely, who's the brother of Big Jay [Cecil "Big Jay" McNeely] and we all like to make sure that most of them study with Lloyd Reese at the time too. And so, we used to like the way he would conduct. Have the young guys and make sure he try a section at a time. They had to play without the rhythm section sometime to see if they were keeping time. But it was all the same period, you know we'd go from place to place.
Speaker 2: So it was like a workshop, slash jam session?
Speaker 1: Yeah, because we got young players, Kenneth Matlock [ph.], Lloyd Reese a bunch of these guys, little--trombone player, they called him Hambone, James Robinson, excellent trombone player. These guys, we would meet and we didn't know where they were going and we had to make sure that they would have a future. And so the place was packed every Sunday and we couldn't serve any strong drinks and we didn't need to 'cause we had sodas and stuff for fifty cents, maybe twenty five cents, but the place would be packed and also Frank Morgan came when he was fourteen years old. His dad, Stanley [Stanley Morgan], brought him there, you know, because they knew what we were doing and said, take him to Crystal Tea Room. Frank played beautifully, he was so good for a fourteen year old, I think that caused him trouble. So later on he got with the guys like Dex [Dexter Gordon], and Teddy [Teddy Edwards] and those guys and they went to pretty wild parties, you know. And he could stand his own with them, you know, like fourteen, that's something. But his daddy was a guitar player. Stanley opened up a club on--I can't think of the name of it now, but that was what was going on. The city [Los Angeles, California] was marvelous, I mean the afterhour spots, you hearing Tatum [Art Tatum] like I say, Charlie Christian when he in town, the Basie [Count Basie] guys, Lester [Lester Young] and Hawkins [Coleman Hawkins] and those guys, Ben Webster, Bumps Myers was the guys here. You know, so young guys, Charlie [Charles Mingus] and I would be there. There's another place called, 54th Drug Street--Drugstore [54th Street Drugstore, Los Angeles, California] at 54th [Street], used to hangout, Big Jack Johnson, the fighter, you know, then Ellington [Duke Ellington] would be there. The place was the place to go after the clubs closed. That stayed open until four or five [o'clock] the morning. You get malts and hamburgers, you know. You'd hung out with all the movie stars, most of the black stars, you know.
Speaker 2: And black Hollywood was over there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was, yeah, not the white stars at this point.
Story_ID: 486985
Speaker 1: So, now was Central Avenue coming, starting to open and get itself, the Club Alabam [Los Angeles, California] and all those different places--
Speaker 2: Well, they were going yeah. There were shows there. That's the stars that would come in and then the Dunbar [Dunbar Hotel, Los Angeles, California] but, you know, naturally none of the blacks could stay anywhere else, so they'd stay there. So when Ellington [Duke Ellington] would be in town or Ella [Ella Fitzgerald] or whoever it would be, they would be staying at the Dunbar and across the street was the Last Word [Los Angeles, California]. The Downbeat [Los Angeles, California] was right across from the Last Word. So within the 42nd Street area, then there's, you know, a lot of activity going, everybody saying hello and the people with the brand new cars, Broomfield [Leroy Broomfield] and Greeley [Aurora Greeley], they got a, there used to be a car maker, (unclear) and the Cord. Now they had--the Cord was the most expensive, my dad [Willie Collette] had an (unclear), but it was flashy. The Cord, it had a nickel-plated hood, you know, and so when it'd come down the street, the sun would hit that it would be just like a big fire started, (laughter) (makes noise) and it would hit and it would just flash all along the walls. That was pretty wild, you know--
Speaker 1: What would you say a car cost back then? That particular vehicle. That's a luxury car at that point.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well let's see, it probably wouldn't be much by today's standard but I would say, about ten grand [ten thousand dollars], maybe.
Speaker 1: About ten grand back then was a lot of money.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a lot of money. Not too many people, my dad had the (unclear). I think it cost about five grand [five thousand dollars] 'cause he liked flashy cars but I don't think he could afford that ten grand, five grand that was kind of taking away from the family a little bit too, you see what I mean? But he liked that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was the Mercedes [Mercedes-Benz]--that was the top line for Mercedes back then huh? That was top of the line.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but they were, you know great dancers, you know Broomfield and Greeley, guy and his wife.
Story_ID: 486986
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let me ask you this question. So, while this is all going on--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --there's a lot going on on Central Avenue, people are hanging out and having a good time, things are going pretty good, then there's, there's the studio scene here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], but you still had this unction that you still wanted to segregate, I mean I'm sorry, to integrate things around here musically because I'm sure there were guys you wanted to play who were of other ethnicities and you wanted to make it one homogenous situation?
Speaker 2: Yeah and I had sort of a personal motive there too because I want to say that, you know, we could read the music, whether it's classical, I didn't choose to do that in the beginning, but that's why I formed the symphony orchestra [Community Symphony Orchestra], because that was my dream. I have to be playing it awhile and know the literature before I maybe can play it well, I didn't want to go in there and try to read it, you can't do that sometimes. You may read it but you don't sound like you in there and they would say, "Well, he still didn't belong here." I would have to start listening to the records and I would have to turn my radio in the car to KFAC [KFAC Radio, Los Angeles, California] or something or whatever the classical station was. So I begin to recognize Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven] and Mozart [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart] and all of that and some of those rehearsals, they would play some of these pieces, so I had a better idea of how they should be interpreted. The one thing about classical music you don't have as much freedom, opposed to, move around with jazz, you can change the note and do a little here and there. They wanted to hear, in fact, when I finally got the idea what to do, then the string players when I played one thing on the Bizet [Georges Bizet], 'Carmen.' When I played it properly and I learned that later on, the string players have a way of if they like you, they tap their bows (claps hands), oh that meant that was good 'cause I'm playing it like it's supposed to be played for the classical world. So we knew what to do, at least I knew that was the way to go. And we had people like Red Callender you know, guys, the black players that wanted to play, John Ewing [Streamline Ewing], which is a trombone player, Jimmy Cheatham, who just passed away a few months ago, Jimmy and Jeannie Cheatham, from the Sweet Baby Blues Band and Bill Green and Britt Woodman, all these players were excellent players. So, we brought a lot of good stuff there but the band, the classical orchestra was set in a way that if a player like myself who wasn't the experienced player in the band, they had some flute players that had been playing this all their life, you know, if they'd played some Ravel [Maurice Ravel] or something or who knows, Stravinsky [Igor Stravinsky] and I hadn't read it and I could play it if I thought I knew it because if not, you'd get embarrassed right then. The conductor said, "Well, you want to try that again?" It didn't mean you'd play it any better the first time, or the second time than you did the first 'cause this literature is hard some of it, Stravinsky was tough.
Speaker 1: Extremely tough literature?
Speaker 2: Yeah, tough. You got to be, some of the guys that had played there, they were playing it when they were ten years and they're fifty and sixty. So, they had mastered it. They'd heard all the records, you know. When you're living--it's like jazz, you know. If you knew Bird [Charlie Parker] and Dizzy [Dizzy Gillespie], you knew that either you could play it or you couldn't but you'd have to hear the records first, you know.
Speaker 1: You seem to be a great multi-tasker because I think during that time in '48 [1948] while you had that mission, you also did your first record date?
Speaker 2: I did the record date with Dolphy [Eric Dolphy] (unclear), yeah, probably '48 [1948], yeah.
Speaker 1: And there were two sides to that. 'It's April' and 'Collette,' right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And those are two of your own compositions?
Speaker 2: They're my compositions, yeah.
Speaker 1: You did those in '48 [1948]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, something else happened that we're going to get into in the next segment. We're going to change the tape in a minute but you met Jerry Fielding.
Speaker 2: I met Jerry Fielding around about the same time, '48 [1948]. But, you see, my life was very busy. In fact, I was doing so much, nobody could feel how much I had done.  But, I wasn't racing to make a lot of money. I was having a ball, and when I got on the Groucho ['You Bet Your Life'], that was paying about a hundred and thirty dollars a week.
Story_ID: 486987
Speaker 1: So, Mr. Collette [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette], around 1948 you've got several things going on, you're recording, you have this, we'll call it social mission and civic minded thing that you want to do as far as integration of the unions and musicians in the L.A. [Los Angeles, California] area, but something happens when you have your new symphony, your new interracial symphony [Community Symphony Orchestra]. You meet a guy named Jerry Fielder and he was the conductor of the Groucho Marx show ['You Bet Your Life'].
Speaker 2: Jerry Fielding.
Speaker 1: Fielding, correct, and he was the Groucho Marx conductor and 'The Life of Riley' show. What happened with that?
Speaker 2: Well, Jerry Fielding must have, you know, this one guy; I mentioned his name earlier, Milt Holland from the Million Dollar Theatre [Los Angeles, California]. He had told Jerry Roe [ph.], one of his good friends, so they were passing the word, "This guy Buddy," I wasn't there but he would say, "he and his friend, Mingus [Charles Mingus], want to have one union instead of two." So some of the guys that we had met, not all, one or two of 'em, have the one union, some wanted like it was. They said, "We don't go to the union that much and we don't care whether it's one or two." Some of the attitudes were like trying to discourage us a little bit. But Fielding apparently like Milt Holland, were the first two that understood what we were talking about. So Fielding was looking for me to hear me play to see if another guy can read and he plays the flute and everything. So Fielding had a change in the orchestra, the Groucho show, so he looked for me and he came to one place I was playing at church with the Woodman brothers playing some classical music and he walked in and when the concert was over, he walked up and said, "Hey, I came to see you and now you're not playing." I said, "We played earlier," so he was like disappointed and I said, "Well, I'll play again and you'll come around." So, the next time, like I said, the symphony orchestra played near USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California], so that was an area where I figure again, I was not the only one thinking like this but every now and then, I would just try to figure out how could we move it along. So I say, "Why don't we move the concert from 23rd [Street] and Union [Avenue]," which is near USC near Jefferson in L.A., "so, why don't we move it to Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] and rehearse there?" So somebody in the band, in the group said, "Yeah, we probably could rehearse at LeConte school [Joseph LeConte Junior High School; Joseph LeConte Middle School, Los Angeles, California] on Bronson [Avenue]," which is near Sunset Boulevard. So, hey it sounds good to me, let's move it to Hollywood then we'd get Jerry and a few other people who will come out. They don't like to go too far away especially at that time Watts [Los Angeles, California] had a bad name and Central Avenue people were kind of afraid, you know, not that it was that bad but like now, you know, a lot of places are bad, but at that time, "Oh Central, well I'd rather not go there." So, we went to LeConte Junior High on Bronson. So now this night, before we go, maybe the week before, we had a meeting and I said, "Hey, wouldn't it be nice to have a black conductor?" I mean, not just because we were going to Hollywood but just an idea again. You know, I'm constantly thinking how can we bring this thing about. As much work as we were doing, I didn't feel we were accomplishing that much. People liked the idea but--so, now where do we go? I didn't know how to do that. So they said, "It would be nice if you knew a black conductor." I knew a black conductor, his name was Percy McDavid. He studied in Paris [France] and everything. Could play the piano just like one of the best classical players you ever heard. He didn't know much about jazz and didn't care but he could really teach. He taught people like Arnett Cobb, Bill Green, Eleanor (unclear) and Russell Jacquet, you know, he told us he was from Texas but he lived in Kansas City [Missouri]. He taught a lot of musicians that I knew and I said, "The guy is marvelous." He got to be my friend. So I called him on the phone and said, "Hey, I'm gonna set you up to conduct this interracial symphony." And he said, "Okay, I've only been teaching at--," what's this school, out in the Watts area, one of the schools he taught math. He taught music for a while but he had to stop teaching music he said because each time he'd get the kids to play well, then the semester would be over and they'd graduate and he'll hear those sour tones again, you know, it kind of worked on his mind. So I said, "I got a chance for you to conduct with the symphony orchestra." He said, "Well, I'm rusty here." I said, "Well, that's okay. We are too, but, why don't you conduct because now we want to show you that we have a black conductor, that can do this." And he was excellent.
Story_ID: 486988
Speaker 1: So this is the night they played the, 'Carmen' by Bizet [Georges Bizet]. So he [Percy McDavid] was there and I said the premise of the orchestra [Community Symphony Orchestra] was, was if I wanted to play the first flute on one of the pieces while, you know, the conductor was there, I could do it. But sometimes if he hadn't been there, I wouldn't have gotten this opportunity; it could have been somebody else. They would have said, "Oh you play it," you know, I couldn't just take the part. So he's conducting and now he gets to the part that says first flute only and there's other three flutes players some have played with the symphony and they would love to play it too. Kind of show off, but they'd probably played it hundreds of times. I'd never played, but, you know, I probably knew it when I start playing it. So he said, "Mr. Collette [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette], would you like to play the flute solo?" The orchestra stopped here because now this next section is really just flute and harp but I didn't know that, I just figured well I'll play the solo because you got sixty people around you. So he starts conducting and I got three notes by myself (scats), you know I do the melody. But anyway I'm playing, the harpist about twenty feet across the room so lonely you know, I'm trying to, my heart is (gesture), and I say, "Where are the rest of the people?" I wanted more around me you know, I don't want to be exposed like that for the first time anyway especially playing a piece I didn't know. At this point, I'd only been playing for two years. But I hung in there and I was such a good musician on the other instruments that I could make it work so I played for about a minute all alone with the harp while everybody else listening, saying, "Not too bad, you know, it wasn't great but, you know, he didn't fall, he didn't stumble," and I didn't have to stop and give me another chance. So they tap their bows, like I said, that means you made it (claps hands). And I said, "Oh, thank you," a little, a little weird. The night it was over he was like, "Wow, that was a tough one." 'Cause everybody was listening to me and I didn't want an audition like that. But anyway after the concert is over, about 9:30 or 10:00, they got some big steps down there [Joseph LeConte Junior High School; Joseph LeConte Middle School, Los Angeles, California], 'cause went back there and taught the young after school class, help the youngsters come through the same place. When I walked down those stairs I could see myself talking to Fielding. I'm walking down and Fielding is already out. He said, "Hey, pretty nice flute playing." He said, "You remember me? I'm Jerry Fielding the guy that missed you at the church?" I said, "I know you." I said, "What's going on?" He said, "Well, I need a guy for the Groucho Marx's show ['You Bet Your Life']. You know Marshal Royal?" That's my friend that was in the Navy [U.S. Navy Reserve] with me, and also the eagle player. I said, "Yeah, I know Marshal, he just left town with Count Basie," and that was true 'cause and he said, "Well, you'd have to play flute, saxophone and clarinet." So he knew I play flute and I said, "I play saxophone and clarinet." He said, "Well, I didn't know you played that." I said, "But, yeah, I just played flute for two years." I said, "Marshal doesn't play flute," and he's gone so this was pointing toward me and he kind of wanted to see me anyway, that if I could play.  So, he heard a little flute that I guess he liked it okay. But anyway he said, "Well, I want you to work on the Groucho show. I'll have the contractor call you in about a week, his name is Ben Barrett," and I got the call and they said, "Well, bring your horns, alto, clarinet and the flute to Groucho Marx show," CBS on, at that time it was at Sunset [Boulevard] and, Sunset and, and Vine [Street].
Speaker 2: How big was that for you at that point getting that job? Did you feel like, what happen to you at that moment because now you're getting ready to be on a major national television show?
Speaker 1: Well, I'll tell you, well, I just felt good that I was accepted knowing that I would not let them down 'cause I had worked hard to be as good as the players I had heard out there. And, you know, most of them were pretty good, so, you know, all the training, all the studying for four years, you know. Clarinet teacher one day, flute the next day, next the writing class. I was in it, you know. I was like a guy in best shape for a heavy weight champion fight, you know. I said, "Well, I'll do all right guys I know" and the guy next to me, Hynie Gunkler, a German guy played very good and he hit me on the leg says, "Man, you're much better than the guy that was here." Well, I didn't expect that, I just knew I'd worked hard, you know.
Story_ID: 486989
Speaker 1: Now the first day, did--was there a lot of rehearsing or did you go in and just--
Speaker 2: There was no rehearsal for me. Jerry [Jerry Fielding] met me at a little coffee shop. It was interesting. He had the book. My book which was third alto, second part. The lead player was Hynie [Hynie Gunkler], played beautifully, and so like I said, but I was ready because sometimes the way they play, you have to follow them, you have to do the vibrato which--
Speaker 1: Stylistically?
Speaker 2: Yeah. 'Cause--or I could come in with my own sound or come in like Parker [ph.] and he might have said he doesn't blend with me. He would want Parker to change. The guy that's playing lead is saying, "He's not going with me the leader, he's not stepping with me, you know." So I'm saying Jerry met with me with my book, the third book. I hadn't seen the book. He said, "Let me explain what happens now. If you play this tune, the duck comes down and you have to play it, you just tick right off, there's a little (scats), you know, a lot of instructions, you read the notes but if the duck comes down, somebody got the secret word." They had a little skit there and when the duck would come down, I would have to jump away from what I'm playing and get that thing, the guys knew how to--they had been doing it for years, now I'm coming in so I got to remember this. And, so he explained it two times and said, "I can explain it one more time if you want?" I said, "Please do it," I had to get it into my mind, now if the duck comes down, you hit this part. You had two or three cues there and so, it all worked out and like I said, the band--some of the guys would say to me, "What have you been doing?" I said, "Well, I been doing other stuff. I hadn't been doing much studio work." They said, "Well, do you feel uncomfortable working with them? You're the only one that's not, you know, one of us more or less?" I said, "Well, I'm one of you, I just don't look like you." What I'm saying is they kind of felt that if they were in my place, they would be in this all-black band, you know, they would feel uncomfortable. I said I grew up with all kinds of people so it doesn't bother me. My main thing is to make music here whether it's jazz or classical. So, there were little things like that. And, the one guy too, Hynie saw the alto, most of the studio players played Selmer [Henri Selmer] saxes, because they're more in pitch and, you know, they blend. You come in with a, you know a Conn [C.G. Conn Ltd.] or a Bush [ph.] or something, sometimes the intonation is not as well. And, he said, "I'm surprise to see you playing the Selmer." I said, "Well, I've been around a little bit. I've studied with some good teachers." So it was good to know these kinds of things. The way I got to know, we'd go and have dinner together, you know, about six, nine in the band altogether. So I was the only African American there. So we'd go to Hatters [ph.] and all the best places and it was okay. It wasn't really okay 'cause later on I thought we would go with the young white players, friends at the show, not necessarily to see me, people would say, "Oh, you're Buddy [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette] the jazz player," and we'd go to the same restaurant and they wouldn't want to even serve you. We went one place where there was Mingus [Charles Mingus] and Red Norvo and Tal Farlow were playing on La Cienega [Boulevard] and we brought some of the friends from Red, Fielding and the band, a black woman who was, Thelma Walker she helped him in the symphony orchestra. She was a spokesperson at the time to see what the policy was. We all went to this club where Red Norvo had this excellent trio and Mingus was in it. He was staying at my house at the time and they wouldn't serve us and somebody said in the back of me to Fielding, and he said, "We can't serve this table." And they said, "What are you saying, what do you mean you can't?" And so I was hearing it and I said, "Here it is again," 'cause it was around at that time. So, they wouldn't serve us so they said, "Well, let's walk out." So we walked out and Jerry Fielding said, "We're going to sue you here." And, then, Red and them took the attitude, Norvo and said, "Well, man, why you gonna sue where we're working?" You know, they felt, which we understood that.  He said, "Why don't you sue a lot of other places, you know, where they don't hire the blacks, you know." 'Cause Red was doing the thing where if he had Mingus and we were all trying to show the integration and music would bring all kinds of people together. (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This was around 1949, going into '50 [1950] when, when this occurred?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so, at least around '50 [1950], now, I'm on the Groucho ['You Bet Your Life'] now.
Story_ID: 486990
Speaker 1: Now you're the first, at this point, you're the first non-white musician to perform on a national television broadcast?
Speaker 2: Well definitely in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] I was, yeah. Now 'cause in New York [New York] it was kind of hard, you know. I know Clark Terry and Snooky Young did 'The Tonight Show' ['The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'], you know it's hard to remember exactly those years.
Speaker 1: So, now is the union idea still in your mind now and bringing--television is becoming more and more popular now, too, right? So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, a little more, yeah. But--
Speaker 1: But African Americans and black people are still not on television. The musicians--
Speaker 2: Not really, except Kim Louie [ph.] with Willie Best, and Stepin Fetchit, maybe--I don't know what year but, you know, what's the thing--the 'Gone with the Wind,' what's her name, Butterfly McQueen [sic. Hattie McDaniel]. There was some point that somebody said that she won supporting actor [Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress], you know, but then she was kind of an interesting little woman so she might have, you know, they might have done that and also we're getting to a point where the unions [American Federation of Musicians Local 767; American Federation of Musicians Local 47 and American Federation of Musicians Local 47] finally got together in '53 [1953], we consummated that. We had help from Mr. Marl Young, for example and a few who did it legally. Now we got all kind of people waiting, a lot of people waiting to do it. Now we sort of, we kept going. We didn't care what year it was but I'm saying, we had to do this--this was before you know the Brown versus Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] and that period, might have been--that hadn't happen 'til '55 [1955] or '54 [1954]. But this came before anything had happened like this. But what we found out a little later, well around that time, that the Academy Awards [Oscars] in thirty-seven years had never had a black on stage other than Louis Armstrong with his band, you know, which we didn't count that being, you know, no black actor or anything had done anything.
Speaker 1: So was there like a quota system? Did the studios feel that if they had just one person or got one person or we have one, was that enough for them?
Speaker 2: Oh, there was a period yeah we did that. 20th Century Fox [Twentieth Century Fox Television] when we worked 'til later--kind of hard to keep up with the years. There was a period where we complained that 20th Century Fox had quite a few in the studios and their thing was that they did a survey to find out, you know, something about how many blacks were--and we felt, well, we were thinking about musicians cause that's what we were, and they figured out where they came up with about thirteen blacks for the whole studio and so that was in the mailroom and the kitchen and so we wound up with one in the orchestra, you see what I mean so we were hoping to get three or four in the orchestra 'cause you want to look over there--many times I was playing, I didn't know anybody and I'm playing a difficult thing and you feel kind of lonely out there. You do something and it might be pretty good and there's nobody you can even talk to about, what just say 'cause they're asking you, well, you know, who are you and why are you here and who's your friend and all that.
Story_ID: 486991
Speaker 1: So now--
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: --this is in the '50s [1950s] and you, pretty much you're good yourself as far as your career is concerned, television and things are happening for you pretty well now and you have access to some other entities in your life. Was there any pressure from other ones, other black musicians, African American musicians calling you Uncle Tom or you a sell out or any of those kinds of things because there has been those kinds--did you face any pressure from your own community as you went out and did these things?
Speaker 2: Not that I knew. I mean, I'm assuming that the guys might have, people do say things now. I'll say this about Mr. Leonard Feather who was a critic at the time, once I got the job on Groucho ['You Bet Your Life'], I wasn't, you know, trying to just make a--we did make good money, 'cause that was probably the most money I'll ever made--
Speaker 1: How much money was that, if you don't mind me asking (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Like I said a $130 a week and even when we were off for thirteen weeks they paid us. So we got thirteen weeks, in fact, we kind of even hated to go back to work 'cause that was the starting of the reuse thing period, you see. But we lucked out. We didn't know we were going to run into--the producer came and said, "What are you guys gonna do for summer?" You're off thirteen weeks, you know and we said, "We don't know." We didn't say, oh, we got a job, 'cause we didn't have a job, we don't know. He said, "We can pay you."  We say, "That would be beautiful, thank you." So, I'd go out of town maybe I could come back got thirteen checks of $130. So, I mean, it was good money but when the residuals did come in, you know how they do, they say, "Well, you guys have been paid already." You know, 'cause when they sold the show, so many people got money, you know, at that later time, but we got it when nobody was getting it. So, I'm saying that, the thing with Leonard--I skipped over it again, Leonard wrote in his article whether it was in the Down Beat or somewhere, he said, "Buddy Collette [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette] leaves jazz to go to studio work." I leave jazz, I didn't leave jazz, I could play jazz happy 'cause I had money in my pocket, and I would drive a new car, you know. I mean things worked out where I played more jazz (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Taking care of your family?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Taking care of your family.
Speaker 2: Yeah. A lot of times I could do the records like for Dolphy [Eric Dolphy] and people like that because Dolphy didn't pay me any money to do that.
Speaker 1: You did one for Contemporary [Contemporary Records] around 19--?
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956], yes.
Speaker 1: What was it called? Man--
Speaker 2: The 'Man of Many Parts.' That was my first real record where I'd done the music and called all the shots with the guys and wrote, you know, played four instruments and that's there where Les Koenig [Lester Koenig] who was going to call me man of many parts 'cause I had played a lot of roles and I had four bands within a band you know I had you know four different groups, I had a quartet, I had a quintet, I had a octet and they all were very musical, see.
Story_ID: 486992
Speaker 1: Now there's a sound that came about, you're--during the '50s [1950s] all this is going on. You're really being a catalyst for the integration. Not only are you doing the civic social thing, you're creating a new musical sound too. Tell us about the Swinging Shepherd [Buddy Collette and His Swinging Shepherds]. We all know about that particular piece. But, you give us your take on how that came about?
Speaker 2: Well, the record, the 'Swinging Shepherds' ['Buddy Collette's Swinging Shepherds']?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, we actually wanted to spotlight the flutes. A bunch of us like, the guys on that record was Bud Shank, was another good flute player, Harry Klee and let me think of the other guy, Paul Horn. We all knew each other and Pete Rugolo was working for the record company [EmArcy Records], I can't think of their name now, but anyway, it was a big record company and he wanted to do a record with flutes and most of the guys were under contract. Bud Shank was under contract and Harry had a couple and Paul Horn might have had a contract too. But I didn't have a contract because I worked with Contemporary [Contemporary Records] and freelance so I could do other things. Naturally they wanted to control you but I saw no need for him to tie me up and maybe only do one record every other year or so. But anyway, the idea came to Pete Rugolo from, I can't--the name on the tip of my tongue, I can't get but it's not important right now. He said, "We want an album with flutes. Buddy [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette], I want you to write something. Bud, I want you to write." And we suddenly realized that those guys could take the name as the leader, because they're under contract, so he said, "Can you take it as--?" I said, "Yeah, I can take it as a leader." So we did it and the idea was to use all the flutes. We had bass flute, we had alto flute, we had regular flute, we had piccolo, we had e-flat flute. So we figured out--for instances we had and we all wrote. Bud Shank wrote some, and Paul. And so, we created that and did it at Capitol Records. We did two of those, we did one with Swinging Shepherds 'At the Cinema!' ['Buddy Collette and His Swinging Shepherds at the Cinema!'] that was one at the movies and then we just did the 'Swinging Shepherds.'
Story_ID: 486993
Speaker 1: Now you're not only known for your, for your wonderful skills as a musician, but now your writing skills are coming into play, you're becoming a recording artist and you got a lot of things going on. We're going through the '60s [1960s]--I mean through the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: I'm sure now at this point that the contractors are starting to hire more people now. The union [American Federation of Musicians Local 47] has been put together. Is it one union at this point?
Speaker 2: Yes. It's one union since '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: Okay. So one union and we're going in and the Academy Awards [Oscars] are starting to hire people now and integrate--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know if I told you that but we should clear that up. Now we're at '64 [1964] am I getting ahead of you now?
Speaker 1: No, you're all right, you're okay. We're now in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: We're talking, we getting to meeting again.  Ernie Freeman, a bunch of the guys, Red Callender, all we get together, Bill Green, the ones that wanted to help out. And we have a meeting at somebody's house and we suddenly realized that, somebody said for example, "What about the Academy Awards, have they ever hired a black?" Everybody looked and say, "We don't think so, let's check it out." So there were a couple of groups now or helping to integrate, too. Like CORE--was it Congress for Racial Equality [sic. Congress of Racial Equality] or something of that nature and they wanted to more or less assist us once we brought our news to them what we needed. Hey we need some help 'cause we don't know the Academy Awards plus we didn't feel that musicians could fight it right, we didn't have--they didn't have any lawyers with us. Marl Young was the closest thing to a lawyer, he had gone to law school, and we didn't get him until later. But anyway what happens here, we had the guy, Don [ph.] somebody from the Congress on Racial Equality or CORE and he said, "What do you want to do?" We said, "Well, we don't think the academy [Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences] has ever had a black in the stage." We mentioned the Louis Armstrong deal but he said, "Well, I'll call Mr. Green," who was the conductor, Johnny Green, conductor, right. They had lunch but what happened on the luncheon thing, Mr., well Don is his first name, just spoke to Mr. Green and said, "Have you ever had a black in your orchestra on the Academy Awards here?" John Green was doing it all every year, he's the man and it was like his baby, meaning, nobody can mess with this, you know.
Speaker 1: He could decide?
Speaker 2: Yeah, plus the guy said--I can't think of his last name but anyway, Don, I'll say, from Congress, CORE and he said to--, "Have you ever had any?" Johnny Green thought and says, "No, we never had a black in the orchestra," he said, "Well, I would suggest you have one this year." There were about a couple of months before, you know, January whenever they had it, March at the time. He said, "Well, I suggest that you, you know, hire some because if not, it's going to be the most publicized Academy you've ever seen." He just kind of warned him, you know and the guy started to choke on his salad (laughter), I don't think he got his dinner 'cause he didn't feel like it. But the thing was he just told him. He said, "Do you know any blacks?" And he said, "I know some." He said, "I suggest you hire some 'cause we're going to publicize that you're not hiring," you know they just were straight talk. So I didn't know I'd get hired or not but see I was still one of the ones kind of popular 'cause I had played most of the shows now and most of the shows that wanted to try a black wanted to try me because he makes time, he can play, you know, he can get along with, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He's professional.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in other words, I wouldn't argue. One of my friends was very uncomfortable. See, there's so much of this stuff in my head. But, I'm saying, I'll finish this story. So I got a call, Bill Green, he's not around, dear friend, he could play too; really good. We both got a call, and a lady got a call, Toni Robinson-Bogart, she's a harpist. So two woodwinds and a harp player, she played very good. So we get the call, so we talked on--we said, "Well, we'll see you at the Academy rehearsal." And so we knew we were getting to them now, I mean. They were aware. They called us and they were kind of aware they had to do something.
Story_ID: 486994
Speaker 1: Well, there was a period where things were going kind of haywire. The way the black and white thing wasn't getting better in the world, I mean in the--especially in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], Watts riots hadn't come (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was going to bring you to that. After this Academy Awards [Oscars], the next year '65 [1965]--
Speaker 1: One year later. But that let you know what the temperature was of the cities, you know. Blacks and whites weren't getting along. We did this to kind of curb what the violence was going to be 'cause you could see what's happening, beatings up of the cops and everything. So we're in '64 [1964], and in '64 [1964], of course that we thought that cooled it down and they put me on the aisle, right next to the audience. Like, if I'm here, the audience is right there and they had the camera crew like you guys are there and they're shooting me and they'd go up on stage. There'd be a skit up there. So I got into the picture first, right. A little face view and up. And, so I knew what they were doing then 'cause one time they almost hit my head with the bottom of the camera where the guy puts his feet and the trombone player pushed me down like that, and I said, "Man, are you mad with me, what are you doing?" He said, "Man, that thing was gonna hit your head." So, I guess they'd been told to pan me and then go up on stage. So then I realized, yeah you see, I knew what they were doing but I almost got my head knocked off. They didn't touch me.
Speaker 2: Now, during the riots, Mr. Collette [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette], what was the tension, what was the music life, were you still working during that year?
Speaker 1: During the riots? I worked a little bit. I went to San Diego [California] because I had a job down there and to get out of town was hard because a lot of the roads were blocked off but, you know, let me finish this one thing on that night.
Speaker 2: The Academy, I'm sorry, go ahead.
Speaker 1: The Academy. That's when, you know, I don't know if we was tricked, but we were, we had a feeling that maybe we were pushing too hard to make sure it was okay. It was like Sidney Poitier won that night for 'Lilies of the Field.' So that threw us back, you see. We said, "Wow, a black man won, so I know he was good." But the idea that was the one, and so the final was almost like an explosion and people were sort of, you know, surprised that it could happen at that time, you know, and that was '64 [1964], I said?
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964], correct.
Speaker 1: Well, so anyway, so we kind of backed off with, you know, with our pressure. Well, it's better than we thought. It had to be 'cause if they do something like and they black, 'cause after that, a long time I guess, this year changed it a little bit. But at that time, you know, but another thing that happened musically, they hired three blacks that year, right? And then for the next three years, the same three blacks. Nothing has changed and we didn't work that much in anyplace else, even though now the unions [American Federation of Musicians Local 47] are together you see. I mean I had my own job. I always kept my jazz group going, so I kept, you know, in the eyes of the public. The others didn't work much more other than that show. They had had to wait for a whole year for another job of the same thing. So then the fourth year, it came up again and they called me and I said, "I'm not going to take it." See, I've always been that way, trying to go for the truth. That's just me. But, they said, "Why aren't you going to take it?" I said, "Well because you got a measuring stick now where you're always gonna have three there, you never gonna have four or anything." So then the contractor from Universal [Universal Pictures] said something. The papers would be interviewing us. I told them well I thought it was my quote would be in the paper and then the contractor was Bobby Helfer [Robert Helfer] so they said, "Well, Buddy says, it's always only three, that's why he didn't--." You know, there were exposing what we're saying in the paper. That was news right, but it didn't get anywhere for us. But, what happened is that he told them, "Well if Buddy had taken it, we'd have had four this time." They also hired Ray Brown, a great bass player at this time. So he said, "Well, it would have been four this year 'cause we got Ray Brown hired, but Buddy bowed out so now there's still only three." So, he trapped himself there. They had this three number, out of forty-five people, or whatever it was, three had to be black. For a long time, one had to be black and then they figured out and got complaints on that, I told them a lot of times, "You know, this is not the way to do it, you know." I went to Europe and things. I went to Japan with Percy Faith, sixty piece orchestra, I was the only, you know. So, it would happen this time. So we just kept talking and working on it. But then the Watts riots, they sure changed a lot of things because, you know, we figure well this is going to happen again because you guys are not being fair with the work, with the studio stuff. The ones that did commercial would get paid sometimes. A certain show would be used in, I mean a record--they would use you in a show, they'd give you residual checks, so we were not missing a little money; you're not missing the one job so much. Sometimes the show would pay you just like on the Groucho ['You Bet Your Life'] did. The thirteen weeks you got free money then the guy could be, a white guy could be working right next to you and it look like you're not working at all he'll said, "Well, it's a little slow," and he'll be getting another thousand dollars a month or week just because of something he did that's still running, you see.
Speaker 2: A residual?
Speaker 1: Yeah, a residual, there you go.
Story_ID: 486995
Speaker 1: Okay, so the riots have occurred and as in many areas and entities across black America, some of the pains obviously are because of the disparities in hiring, not just in music but across the board in just the differences that are going on, are causing this out lash in the communities not just in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] but across the country. Now tensions are--things are changing but people are starting to speak out now in different ways. Did that affect your career? You said you went to San Diego [California], was that out of necessity or was that a calculated move or what was that?
Speaker 2: Well, I wa- to answer that, I was going out of town every now and then. Sometimes I would go and hire a group in San Diego, you know. Somebody have a club that could bring my group, I would go down and play with their rhythm section or something. But, that was the job I had before the riots and all of a sudden the riots, they blocked off certain streets. It was hard for anybody to get out, you know.
Speaker 1: So, you were fortunate. You still had other outlets and venues to make money?
Speaker 2: Well, you know like I said, I would go to San Diego, San Francisco [California], places that I knew friends and if I had a job offer, I would go, this so happens this time that getting out of town wasn't easy because there were cops everywhere because of all the problems, they figured that you were either running away from something, you know, I just said it was kind of interesting to try to get out at a time when nobody was leaving there, were just trying to stay in the house and stay away from the problems and here I'm saying I gotta get out.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So they didn't quite understand it.
Speaker 1: You had a gig.
Story_ID: 486996
Speaker 1: Now '69 [1969] were moving in and you start your teaching career. You became, you were head of the music department at Cal State, L.A. [California State College at Los Angeles; California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]. In 1969, you got hired in that position as head of the music--
Speaker 2: Yeah, around '69 [1969] or '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: Around '69 [1969] you were still doing, it's amazing because you were doing that as well as playing on shows like 'The Danny Kaye Show' and you were moving into things like that. So you were doing dual things, you were doing television and teaching, and around '72 [1972], I guess Flip Wilson became very popular and did he demand some things for his show ['The Flip Wilson Show']? Was he instrumental in making sure some black musicians got on television?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he told the leader, the leader was George Wyle who was a pretty nice guy by the way, he had worked shows, but all of a sudden when he called a bunch of us and said, "Well, Flip Wilson said he wanted half and half," you know, blacks and whites in the band. So naturally George knew some of the black guys, Red Callender, Al Aarons, Grover Mitchell, Bill Green, bunch of us were on the show and the guys worked along a good band, a good swinging band, the guys could all read, so it was a good little job. Some of those shows were the best shows, they had top people. He had Jack Benny, he had Lena Horne, he had all the top people so those shows, they still play them now, we don't get any reuse from them, somehow they have a special contract with somebody where they can play those shows without paying reuse. But it was an excellent band, George was a good leader and we had a good thing from the '70s [1970s], I guess.
Speaker 1: Things were going good it seemed like in the '70s [1970s]. You were teaching at various places--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I always taught (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and you were playing at the same time and so the '70s [1970s] was a period, I guess music in general was going through a transition because not just jazz--discos is in, and the way music was marketed was obviously changing and you seem to be pretty adaptable towards that?
Speaker 2: Well, I got to the point where the word was that if you're a good musician; you should be able to play anything. That was the way it was put to me. So, there were times I would play some Jewish dances with more or less a Jewish band and they'd play the little Jewish tunes--
Speaker 1: "Hava Nagila" and those kinds of things?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and you know, if you on the horn then you had to play it. So you kind of got up, mainly during those periods I wanted to definitely work, so if I could get an extra job, it didn't make a difference. But this period, we're talking about I was so busy with shows and I usually made, if I made a show, I would try to keep the lessons going. It was very difficult at times 'cause you might have to do a lesson here and go to the show the next hour and then maybe go someplace after night if the show was an afternoon show rather than a night show and some of the guys did that every day and every week. I didn't try to do as much as I could. Some of it I didn't like as well as I would like my little jazz gigs so I kind of saved my energy for that sometime.
Speaker 1: So, the term that we use now so frequently, he's a multi-tasker. Buddy Collette [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette] was a multi-tasker a long time ago (laughter) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Early, yeah, they would see me in different kinds of groups. Sometimes would be, in fact, when I made my first album, the 'Man of Many Parts,' I was wrote with Nelson Riddle but I recorded with Nelson and did Sinatra [Frank Sinatra] records, and Nat Cole [Nat King Cole] records, I did all 'cause he wrote for those guys and a lot of times I would show Billy May, all those bands and they wanted to show a black player when they could and usually I got the call and later on, Bill Green, Plas Johnson and those guys got to be the good players too, so we all could send each other. Benny Carter, I sent him a few times and he didn't do the shows very much. He was a beautiful player and a great leader himself. So on Groucho ['You Bet Your Life'], every now and then, I'd have to get off to go to Monterey [California] or something, festival, I used to play there too a lot so I'd call Benny on the phone and I didn't know whether he'd do it. We got to be friends. "Benny I got to get out of town but if I send you, they'll probably let me go," and so I sent Benny in. They were so surprised. "Benny, what are you doing here?" He said, "I'm subbing for Buddy," you know and he wasn't that kind of player but they were in awe of his talent, you know, the gentleman you know.
Story_ID: 486997
Speaker 1: So we'll say between the, we'll say between the '50s [1950s] to the '70s [1970s] and maybe in the early '60s [1960s], your friend Mingus [Charles Mingus] now is becoming a bigger star, a bigger person (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the east.
Speaker 1: He's becoming a big name, now, right? Charles--
Speaker 2: Right, he moved to the East in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Um-hm. So now by 1972 when you're doing Flip Wilson ['The Flip Wilson Show'], Mingus is considered almost a cult hero at this point, right? Would you say so that his--?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah because in New York [New York], you see New York was different in that way. They used to come to hear Mingus. Mingus also would do any kind of thing and people would talk and some time they say he would go and pull the strings out of the piano or do something if you guys won't keep quiet (makes noise), "I'll do this." And we talked on the phone all the time and he wanted me to come back. He wanted to start this school with Max Roach and myself teaching, and I liked the idea but I didn't want to leave here 'cause I had work to do in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]. My kids for one thing, and also making sure that this town had some jazz roots that some of the young players could grow up and know that it's not only the studio work that I was working for, I was working, you know, people working together. Having a big bands with not just all-white or all-black, if they can play the parts, hire them, you know. That seemed a simple thing because I'd come through that myself. I went in Fielding's [Jerry Fielding] band, in fact, after a while, Groucho [Groucho Marx] would say, "Hey, we got Collette [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette] with us."  He used to call me Buddy Cole, there was a great pianist. First he got the Cole, the guy say, "Well, at least he gets half of the name." (Laughter) "Yeah, Buddy Cole is over on saxophone," and they told him, "Well, it's not Cole." But, I'm just saying, he recognized me. Plus we did a thing since I'm the only black, this is a funny thing for him and the audience. They had a thing with a screen like a big curtain or something and the band, wherever we were, backstage got it and he'd say, "We got a band here." So we walked around the screen, in front of the screen around where the audience could see us and so one guy said in the band said, "Let's fool him let's walk around twice," see we just living, so and I right away walk around twice. Well, that's not gonna trick him; he'll notice me, you know, because I'm the only black there. So somebody was like a little thing on the light meter, a black dot so you know how many times it's going around. So we went around twice and the audience broke up when they saw me twice (laughter). Now, it wasn't funny to me but they just ha-ha, they laughed because you can't fool us and Groucho said, "Wow," to the producer, Bob Dwan [Robert Dwan], he said, "Have them do it every night now, every week." So I said, we got ourselves into it 'cause he liked it. It was funny to Groucho. He needed every little joke he could to get him sometime. But just the idea that he wanted to see that little laugh and it made the show laugh. But it was just a little thing. So, we tried little things like that but he always knew when I wasn't there, too. He'd look at the band and say, "Where's that Cole guy, you know I mean, Buddy Cole?" They say, "He's gone to Monterey [California] for the jazz festival." So I would still take off, I wasn't afraid of losing my job 'cause I was doing my job, and I could play and I also had the jazz going. So that was why, I was a good one.

Speaker 1: So, as you move through the '70s [1970s], and we know there's some highlights where you played for Paul Robeson--
Speaker 2: Yes I did.
Speaker 1: --and he was there and you had your, you're doing all kinds of things and as we move into the '80s [1980s], something very fabulous happened for you. I want you to elaborate on it. About almost thirty years afterwards, after your initial striving to make this happen, you become elected to the board of directors of Local 47, the musicians' union [American Federation of Musicians Local 47]. Almost thirty years after you wanted to see the unions integrated. Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well at this time, my friend, Mr. Max Herman was president and through the years, he was always (unclear). He did something for Marl. Marl Young was actually secretary under him, you know, and was probably a board member too, but Max used to always say we need knew guys on the board, new ideas. And, he always would ask me and so I said, "I'll run for it," and also, Spud Murphy, he was a good arranger and these guys were friends of mine and so they kept saying, "Hey, we need new blood on the union," and I was always fighting for other things, so I took a chance on it. It was a tough job because most of the guys they were not doing what I thought was helping the musicians, making sure there was more work and more camaraderie and the black and white working together and helping each other, that wasn't happening as much, maybe just a little bit but not enough. So that was very difficult to do on the board because you got a voting bloc there. You may have a good idea but you have to get the votes, you know.
Speaker 1: Kind of like our government?
Speaker 2: Yeah, kind of the same way, it may be a good idea but you got people who don't want to do that. You had a lot of people that said, "No, we don't think that'll work, why don't we all--?" And even if a point where somebody gets a little more exposure than the other person, they didn't like it. For example, I would come in some days and I had a big article in the paper. I don't know why that happened. I got pretty good and not about the amalgamation, just like well, "Collette's [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette] doing jazz, he's got the new record out," or something like that. And one day, one person, I won't call their name said, "Hey guess what?" I said, "What?" You know, at the meeting. She said, "You weren't in the paper this week," and, I said, "Oh, that's good," because they got to the point where if I'm getting exposure, I must be paying for it. I didn't have to pay for anything, when you doing it, they want to write about you if you're doing something. But just the idea, you know, they were kind of feeling--a couple--another lady was head of the Jazz Society [Los Angeles Jazz Society] at one point and she got into a big argument in the hall with me because they were doing the jazz work, I was getting lot of credit, and they thought I was stealing their credit, because instead of writing about them, they would write about Buddy Collette. But I had been doing that years ago, still going out with Mayor Bradley [Tom Bradley] and playing for him and playing for a lot of people, playing for the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union]. I played some of the biggest parties and the biggest people would be there, and so all of a sudden they said, "Well they're hiring the Buddy Collette Quintet," you know, we had Al Viola and all the guys, Wilfred [Wilfred Middlebrooks], Earl Palmer, we had all the, you know, the people that people liked at that point.
Story_ID: 486999
Speaker 1: Not to gloss over a very high point of your ca- your career with Chico Hamilton and those guys (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What? Yeah.
Speaker 1: Could you elaborate a little bit, let's go back just a little bit and talk about the Chico Hamilton experience; how that group was for you?
Speaker 2: Well in the beginning it was like this, Chico and I had been friends for maybe--we'd known each other since, oh earlier; in fact, we even made little movies together with Fred Astaire, jailhouse scene [in 'You'll Never Get Rich'] with Joe Comfort. But we worked together a lot and then Chico went with Lena Horne the one period and then he came back in town and he wanted to start his group and since we knew each other, we thought well, let's get together and start rehearsing. But he wanted, the idea was a cello. Fred Katz was a cello player. Fred Katz played piano with Lena but he didn't play cello at the same time, he just practiced the cello in the room or something. So he said, "Buddy [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette], I got this cellist and I want to have a group with a flute, the cello and the guitar." He didn't have Jim [Jim Hall] yet, he found him in the bookstore. But anyway, he started a group, he wanted me in the group, I was with Scatman Crothers at the time in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], so he had a job in Long Beach [California]. He scouted down Harry Rubin, he called The Strollers; that had to be '54 [1954] or something like that, may be off a little bit, you know, it was earlier, though.
Speaker 1: During that time period?
Speaker 2: Yeah, during that period. So what happened, is that the door? Oh, but anyway, he wanted rehearsing open up before I could get away from Scatman. Scatman demanded two weeks, what you called it, notice 'cause he didn't want me to walk away at least he could find somebody. But Chico had another guy name Bob Hardaway to fill in that place. And so they wound up having a piano, sax, drum and then bass. So, they had Jim at the time but Fred was the kind of piano player that played everywhere, you know, one, two, three, four. So Jim was the kind of guy if you knew him, you sounded like you knew him; he has to wait for a place to come in and put something in. He can't do it if the guy is covering every, covering the bases. So the group was a different group. So when I came there, Strollers in Long Beach, I brought some music, some things that I had been playing for it and Jim wrote nice stuff. So we started right from there. We'd go down in the afternoon, John Stroger [sic. Robert Stroger] and I would go down there earlier; no freeways at that time so you take the service streets, take you a while to get there. So we'd stay all day, take your clothes. But in the rehearsals, things would happen like this, we'd say, "Okay guys, we'll play this tune." But on the night, we'd be playing the same tune but Fred with the cello, since he played cello, he's a kind of a guy who you almost have to pull him off; you say play a couple he may play four, you know, he's the kind of guy that stays on longer than he should, but he's playing good. Except he'll say, Chico get a little nervous and say, "Come on Fred, come off," and he wouldn't even hear him. His head be down sawing, you know (laughter). So in the meantime, they had a small stand, you know with railings around it and Chico's drums were kind of in the center and the piano is in the back, see, the way it was set up. So all of a sudden, Chico say, "Let's just get on the stand." So we'd all climb over the railing and get on the stand, or where we had to get, and then once we all on the stand the drums, he couldn't get to the piano. He would say, "Man, I can't get there." So it was okay with us so then that's the first time the sound came into the band 'cause the piano wasn't charging, playing heavy chord on every beat. So now Jim and I would play solo; it's much different then when Jim would play (makes noise), it just give me a little accompaniment, see.
Speaker 1: There was more space now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of space now I got to kind of improvise and we could try a lot of things. It wasn't so much what chord it was--we were playing more like linear and stuff, and it would work, see. So when we did that, then Fred couldn't get back and Chico's not going to move the drums so he could get back there. But, the sound began to come--when we rehearse and then all of a sudden, we heard the first the real sound and a lot of times, Fred knew some of the little riffs that I would play when he's on piano, now he played them on cello (scats), clarinet and cello was almost like, "Hey, somebody was really brave to bring the cello and clarinet, sounds good together," because now we knew the material that we're playing. He's playing on the piano and stuff. He's playing on the cello now. And, so we suddenly realized that that was what we did we played standards; 'Funny Valentine' ['My Funny Valentine'], things like that. And we all just played little sections, little counter lines and it just kind of came together.
Speaker 1: And, I've heard some of that stuff. And it was a very unique sound.
Speaker 2: It was scary because it's a way just enough but not too much, you see; and if you'd write it, most of the time you'd write too many things and every now and then, you'd hear the piece you knew the chords lines so well, you get like (makes noise). You'll just move through the line. And so that was an excellent group. The group went over very well and like I said, Hollywood was excited about that group and we did a couple of little movies and things like that.

Speaker 1: You were, you were hired at several schools, Loyola--
Speaker 2: Loyola Marymount [Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles, California], I worked there for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where else were you at? What other schools?
Speaker 2: I was at Cal State-Pomona [California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, Pomona, California]. I worked at Loyola Marymount.
Speaker 1: Several schools.
Speaker 2: Yeah, let's see, Long Beach University, Cal State Long Beach [California State University, Long Beach, Long Beach, California] and also a couple more. Dominguez Hills [California State University, Dominguez Hills, Carson, California], I taught at all the colleges.
Speaker 1: So, the whole California system?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: And you've also, you started some great, some JazzAmerica which we have heard about, we've heard about on the east coast. You helped co-found JazzAmerica--
Speaker 2: For the youngsters, about ten or eleven years ago, yeah.
Speaker 1: Is that still going now?
Speaker 2: It's going now and the players are getting scholarships and everything. They're playing very well. The kids start from twelve years old up to about eighteen, nineteen, and twenty years old. They're playing so well, they're playing good music; they're playing arrangements by Ellington [Duke Ellington]. They got a place somewhere in the East that Richard Simon, the bassist, you know, finding his music and they're playing the music the adults play like in years, the Basie [Count Basie] stuff in concert. Last year at the Four Points [Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles, California], and they played all of Basie's literature and they did a good job. They also did the Dixieland thing with seven of them and the guys, they played better than some of the older guys 'cause they have different enthusiasm about playing it. They're having fun playing it. Some of the older guys have been playing it so long, they wish they could change. But that's what they do, you know.
Story_ID: 487001
Speaker 1: Now you have a, just a bevy of awards that you've won, awards and accomplishments as far as you as a personal musician. You got all kind of things. You've won the musician of the year for Sweet and Hot [Sweet and Hot Jazz Festival], you've won all kinds of accolades from the city [Los Angeles, California], you've published several books, and you've published several things. Now that we've talked to you for a while, we can see fully what kind of musician you are, what kind of person you are not just as a musician. So as we are start to wrap up, I could ask you to give me some time on this. What is your last, what would you like to say to young musicians, people that are in jazz, jazz musicians, what is your secret to success, your formula for having this quality life? You're in your golden years and still doing well, doing it, and still teaching, and still writing, and still playing. What is the secret to this longevity in enjoying this music and making this happen?
Speaker 2: Well to tell you the truth, the studying and playing the music itself can give you some amazing energy, doesn't make you fall apart unless you're doing drugs or something, you know what I'm trying to say. The music will feed you with good thoughts, and good living, and everything; and it gives you a lot of hope because it builds itself a day at a time, or, you know, a little bit at a time. It's no instant success or anything like that and then all of a sudden, being challenged by all kinds of music, you begin to be a flexible person, you know. Somebody says, "No, we don't play it at that tempo, here's where we play at," and you have to fit in at that time rather than saying, "Well, I only play one way, I can't do that." Well, then you've lost a lot of work (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, it's a crosscurrent for life, life is the same way?
Speaker 2: Life is the same way. It goes on and if you treat it well, it will treat you well.
Story_ID: 487002
Speaker 1: Do you have any dreams or aspirations for African- for the African American community? What are your hopes for the future for the African American community (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For the community? Well for them all to strive to make a better world for, you know. We can do the best we can here not unless there's wars and things going on, but some of that could change one day and we'll all be able to face the peacefulness of life that it can be and you can bet if people can give up some of their anger, and the jealousy and all that stuff and just kind of be real human beings. 'Cause you can still rate and still be a human being. It shouldn't be about ego and I'm better than you and I'm mad because I'm not working and not making as much money. It's not about that at all, so I'm saying to you--have to do. One of the toughest questions since you said that to me was when I went to one school and they didn't, they weren't hiring. For a long time I'd go to schools just because I always felt this way about kids. You can help them if you take a little moment out of your time and do it. It doesn't have to be own kid, you might see a kid, you know, throwing rocks at a house or something and you might say, "Hey, you shouldn't do that." Take a moment to, you know, help and if we all help, it'll make it much easier. Well, this question I was going to say, where this young man was ten years old, I went to the school. It's easy to go to school and play for the kids and all the kids are asking me questions, and one kid said, I can't remember the answer that I gave him but I solved it, you know, once you, you can. He said, about ten years old, a bunch of teachers in the class and the kid said, "How do you get to be a man?  Can you answer that?" you know. And the teachers all were in shock. How can you answer that? I could see it on their faces. I said, "First you gotta start obeying your parents, and you gotta study, you know." I just improvised something and I got through it okay but it was scary, my hearts like (gesture), wow, how do you answer that? He looked and me. Whether he thought I was a man, I don't know but his question, how do you get to be a man? The kids would always say, "Why did you start playing saxophone," and all that. And he hit me with one, boy I never felt one coming like that 'cause this is a tough one to answer. I kind of knew what to do but to explain it that was very difficult, and while they're all waiting for an answer.
Story_ID: 487003
Speaker 1: So now, how do you feel about the way that you, over these last years, that, that you lived your life? How do you feel about your life over these past years? Do you feel that you have been successful in what you have accomplished and what you dreamed about doing?
Speaker 2: Well, I've been successful. It's been difficult since the stroke I've had because getting around, of course. I would hope to walk again, and if I can walk and use my left side, I could even play again, too. It would be nice to know that I could, sometime when the band is playing, you know, there a lot of things I may not be able to play fast and get enough speed, I could get my message out through the sound and what I would play, and it would also inspire some of the players who would play much faster and maybe better than I can play. So, it's not about even being better, it's the idea my story would come in and they would look up and say, "Wow, where are you coming from?" I'm coming from the experience of my life is what I'm saying. My message would be different, but see I don't have that in me right now. The option, doesn't mean it won't come back and maybe there's a reason for it not coming back. But my point would be, I would still have an expression, I can still play a little piano with my right hand, but of course you miss the, also a lot of notes that I want to hear and play. But the main thing is to keep going with what you have and use what you have and like I said, Ellington's [Duke Ellington] line on that is, "Do what you can," that's a powerful one right there, you know 'cause you don't want to do more than you can do 'cause then you're in trouble.
Speaker 1: The Duke said that huh? Do what you can?
Speaker 2: Max Roach in Duke's band, the great Max Roach years ago and he said, "Duke, there's no music here," and he said, "Max, just do what you can." You know, Max did all right but I'm just saying the idea that he was hoping to see a drum part to go, fit everything and he just played and he caught things as he was going (scats). He just answered them. You know, a lot of things you can do and they say, boy, what a drummer, well he was great, you see.
Speaker 1: You know we hear about values, we hear about family values, of that nature. What values do you think are important Mr. Collette [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette]?
Speaker 2: For families or what?
Speaker 1: Just in general, families as far as integrity in the workplace. What values do you cherish and think that are useful to the young people to succeed in life?
Speaker 2: Well I think the first comes the respect for the parents, mother and father and hoping they give you the right information, usually they would yeah but I'm just saying the respect and realizing that they're there for them and they brought them through a lot of strife and they will keep doing that if you honor them and there is a way to do that and learn these good habits early and I think that would help them be on the road, and also do work, school work, do good grades, listen to your teachers, these people are all trying to make you a better person, and just get some good habits there. Go to church, you learn, you know, good habits there about the Lord and all, life. So, there's a lot of things to tell them and if they've got a good family, maybe they can help direct them in that way and hope you mind them and don't cause problems.
Story_ID: 487004
Speaker 1: Now, my closing question to you is what would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well let's see. I think if I can explain it maybe in a little different way that--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --the one reason I stayed in, whether it's the legacy, and stayed in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], I did have my family there. I figured I had to kind of keep in touch because I traveled a lot when they were young and I think a lot of times you want them to know about you, not just your name being Buddy Collette [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette] or something, who are you as a father and knowing that some of these things that I wanted to tell them even when I wasn't around. I would even tell them now they're older. Sometimes it's harder to have them believe that because they get set in their ways so my thing would be, one of my reasons for staying in L.A. was my kids who are three of them, actually four, I got a stepdaughter there, too. But I'm saying, you know, still listen to some of the things you didn't hear from me early, but I was there for you all time, financially and as much as I could be and the thing now is to respect at least some of these things 'cause I had to hold some of the them back because I wasn't there. And when you're around your parent at a later time and you're set in your way, you can give the respect, just like I did with my father [Willie Collette], there was no point that I didn't go to visit him and he would say, "Buddy what you're doing or can you do this, or so on?" And, I'm listening, right on him so I don't want to miss anything because he's not going to be as long, you know, he left in '85 [1985], so I'm saying, those were valuable words and I appreciate it even though my head might have been someplace else. I respected the things that he felt even to the point, you know, even musically. He'd say, "Well, I haven't heard you play a lot but this thing you did the other night, you sounded like a bird with the flute," or something, and I appreciate that he was at least listening. He was the kind of guy that didn't tell me how much he cared about me but, you know quiet. But my friends would always say, "Your dad is just overjoyed with, you know, having you as a son, he appreciates everything you're doing." But he was not the kind that could say that so I appreciated him because he was quiet about it but I could see the relationship we had, out of the three kids, he loved to talk to me and find out what I'd been doing. So I'm saying the main thing now is just like I'm doing here in L.A., I stayed here for a reason, for the kids and to try to make L.A. a better town, not just musically, you know with the unions [American Federation of Musicians Local 47] and togetherness and everything. And a lot of times I got great offers to go, I went to Europe on a--people wanted me to move there, I got great offers to be in the studio. I said I got too much work to do in L.A. I was in the midst of one of the greatest jobs I'd ever had, is to kind of bring people together and get the best out of people, like people like Eric [Eric Dolphy] and Charles Lloyd and James Newton who's (unclear) through the ages.
Speaker 1: All great musicians.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all great. We had this in common. We talked and they said, well like James Newton, I went to Europe with him in '88 [1988] and '89 [1989]. I didn't have a band but he had his band there and James was a marvelous player and I didn't really teach him, he had the talent but he worked hard, he's a hard worker. He'd go on stage first, two of us flute players, and he'd go on the stage and he'd play and the crowd would be screaming. They knew him. They didn't know me; they knew my name they know what I looked like, some of them did, but. He'd play so well, there would be standing ovations and he'd go to the mic [microphone] and say, "Quiet down, you haven't heard nothing, wait until you hear my teacher." Then I would walk on and all I had to do was kind of show up, you know. I would play good but I'm just saying, he'd just set it up; his admiration or respect for his teacher, you know.
Speaker 1: So would it be safe to say that you want your legacy to be that of a teacher, a motivator and educator?
Speaker 2: Well, I never think about what I want it to be except I would want 'em to say that he helped changed the city or helped change the world in a way whether it's musically or just for there's more peace. You know it's kind of a combination of things, you know. In a way I'm an activist but at the same time I want to have peace in the mind and also if you're doing something; it doesn't have to be music, mine had to be music so I'm good at that. When I'm in front of an audience, I can ask for something and that was the thing that Charles [Charles Mingus] didn't read about my music. It's not just about playing the music, it's about me looking at you and saying, I'm shaping, you know, all the time. See, I'm constantly growing, whether I'm ninety or what if I'm still around. That's in me; I didn't put it there but it's there. Maybe all the people that I met and everything helped put it there, so it's making a better thing of whatever we got, you know; my family, you guys, you know if I can help there too, information, whatever and that's payback to me. It's not about the money, you can get ten million or hundred million [dollars] or whatever.  If it comes it's okay, but I'm not looking for that part, I'm looking for people to be the best they can be, you follow? So, that's my theme right there. If you're being the best you can be then. My grandson, the one that's twenty-seven, he ran a race and he was kind of winning, you know. He's, he didn't want to hear me tell him this, and he ran in and all of a sudden, the crowd caught him and they passed him, and I looked at him and I said, "Were you doing the best you could do," and he said, "Not really." I said, "I thought so because if you had had some zook there, you would've pulled that off," he was winning you know. So, it's just a matter if you can do better, do it, don't just do half of your stuff and I've always done that, you know. That's why I was a pretty good player, too. It wasn't that I had so much but I could go for it, you know. If you need it, if you're a champ you can go for it and then sometimes you can pull it off. You may need a little more of this and--
Story_ID: 487005
Speaker 1: Now, the guy that's on the left side, this side here, the left is Cliff Holland. He's kind of down, kneeling down a little bit. Then next to Cliff Holland is Buddy Collette [HistoryMaker William "Buddy" Collette]. That's me, right, and the guy on drums, is that next?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Eddie--
Speaker 1: Eddie Bufford right--or Eddie Beal, yes, they're in there, they're sitting next to me, Eddie Beal, piano player. He's gone, but I mean he was a good guy, Eddie Beal. And then Vernon Smith on drums, Josephine Baker, the woman there, and George Kast, violinist, the musician, yeah.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): That's (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, who is that?
Speaker 1: That's Buddy Collette, age ten years old.
Speaker 2: On the left side, Gianni Basso, B-A-S-S-O. That's in Milan, Italy at a recording session, 1961.
Speaker 1: That's Buddy Collette with the saxophone and Terry Lester, the club owner in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], 1958. It was called the Jazz Cellar.
Speaker 2: So when they were now--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, right.
Speaker 2: The lady on the left is, that's Sharon, but oh, boy. Let me take one more peek at that, one more peak at that. Linda Ortiz, yeah, sorry about that, yeah. I know these people, but I haven't seen 'em in years now. Linda Ortiz and then there's Sharon Stricker next, and it's Jackie Goldberg who was in the senate [California State Assembly] for a while in Sacramento [California], and she's also with the school board, and the tall guy in back is, is David Goldberg, her son. And then there's Buddy Collette with the, hands on, with the suit right next to Sharon, and then the lady next to her, I can't think of her name. But there's John Simmons, far right. He's a musician, dear friend. He helps me get around and he's an arranger. He got his own band. He's a good player and everything so there we go.
Speaker 1: My wife--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Hold on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Go ahead.
Speaker 1: There's my wife at the time, Louise, Louise Collette and that was done in 1957, the picture. Then right in front of Louise is Cheryl [Cheryl Collette White], my oldest daughter, and the other young lady there, that's Veda [Veda Collette Carrington], the younger daughter. Her name was Veda, and she's about maybe two and a half, three years old there. And there's my son, Zan [Zan Collette] with the clarinet I think on his lap. And he's gotta be about twelve. And there I am with a saxophone on my lap there. There's at home in Compton [California], 123rd Street, 1632, I think it was.
Speaker 2: Yeah, gonna give him his first clarinet lesson, you know. He played piano at the time, but I said, "Well, you'll get a chance to feel what blowing an instrument is about." So we had the extra clarinet, we hooked 'em up and played a few notes that day. So now, he's just checking me out, yeah. So you think you're twelve or older?
Speaker 1: (ZAN COLLETTE): About twelve years old, dad.
Speaker 2: Maybe twelve years old, okay, so that gives it, again, about 1957 or so. That was our same house out in the Watts area [Los Angeles, California], the Compton area, 123rd Street. And you can see, I got jazz album covers on the wall there. That was my little studio in there.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): All right.
Speaker 2: Now, this is two of the Woodman brothers I talked about so much, about his father [William Woodman, Sr.] teaching. The one on the left is Coney Woodman. He's the oldest brother. He's deceased now. He's not around. And the next gentleman is Theodore Collins. He's still around, one of my favorite buddies. We used to run together. He lives in the Pasadena [California] area now. And there I am, Buddy Collette, standing and talking to the other Woodman brother, which is William Woodman [William Woodman, Jr.]. William Woodman is still around. He's the only brother out of four that's still living. So William Woodman is eighty-seven now, and I'm eighty-five. But not at that time. That was the Buddy Collette Day down at the Biltmore Hotel [Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel; Millennium Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, California]. Tom Bradley more or less declared it Buddy Collette Day. So my friends came out, and we had my big band there, 1990 area, 1990, something like that, 1989 or '90 [1990].
Speaker 1: The Biltmore. I had my group playing. That's Jerry Williams on piano, Al Viola the guitar, Andy Simpkins on the bass, and I'm playing the saxophone, Buddy Collette on the sax. And the drummer is Harold Mason.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, next.
Speaker 1: An all-star group there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was probably 1961 in Milan, Italy, recording session. That's Buddy Collette on saxophone and Dusko Goykovich, an Italian trumpeter, a very good player, was into a little bebop playing, at least he was. He liked Dizzy [Dizzy Gillespie] and Miles [Miles Davis] and those guys. So, he was a good guy. I wish I could have played with him more. You know, we worked for a while in 1961.
Speaker 1: Now, the first gentleman, the young lady put it on, but I can't think of her name. It's John Ewing, Streamline Ewing, and then there's Horace Silver next to him, Gerry Wiggins [Gerald Wiggins], and it seems like, I think Joe Wilson is there. Let me think, I know James Newton is there, Red Callender is there, so many people, yeah, it's kind of hard to--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): What was the occasion again?
Speaker 1: That was the Buddy Collette Day, January--what'd I say, January 23, 1990, Mayor Bradley more or less proclaimed that day as Buddy Collette Day at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 2: That's just me. Some of the other people, I don't know too well.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Nineteen fifty-three [1953].
Speaker 2: USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California], yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): And what was the occasion?
Speaker 2: It was a meeting about me lecturing to a lot of students about music and jazz and everything, question and answer.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.
Speaker 2: That's just a band from Saint Mary's Pre-flight College [Saint Mary's College of California, Moraga, California], and we played in San Francisco [California] and places like that. So the band really got together so they could present a nice concert.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Are the guys who were not really full musicians, but the [U.S.] Navy band. We spent three years together in the service, World War II [WWII].
Speaker 1: Okay. Band. We did--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): I'm not ready--now, I'm ready now.
Speaker 1: Okay, you're ready? The Cee Pee Johnson band, like C-E-E, P-E-A [sic.], Johnson band. That's Cee Pee there, standing next to Paul Robeson, is the second from the left, big guy, big shoulders, real fighter, real activist and went through a lot of problems. You know, they wanted to say he was a Communist. But he just wanted to be treated well and treated right, and hoping the blacks were being treated right in those periods. And I worked with him quite a bit on a few concerts that he did, and he was a marvelous friend. I got to meet him and have dinner with him and things like that. So there I am standing between Cee Pee and Paul Robeson, and there's Alton Redd, the wonderful drummer who did a lot of movies. The little guys in front on the right there, one guy, Frank Bradford [ph.], who lived in Hawaii a long time and next to him is Buddy Banks, who is a piano player, played saxophone, and above him, Johnny Miller, who worked with Nat King Cole at one period. And the other guy is Loyal Walker and the other guy, Raymond Tate, the lighter-skinned guy there. So that was Cee Pee Johnson band in 19--say, '41 [1941], '42 [1942] at a club in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] called the Rhum Boogie [Rhum Boogie Club].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.
Speaker 1: The young lady in the corner, I don't know. But we got, the first gentleman on the left is Joe Williams, next to Joe is Ella Fitzgerald, the wonderful lady of song, and next to her in the middle there is Marshal Royal, a fine saxophone player. And we were at the Beverly Hilton [Beverly Hills, California]. They were honoring Ella Fitzgerald that night, and that was the first sign of her having problems. She had--that night, she sang and put on the show, but she had to have her toe amputated that night. And she was able to perform. So she might be in a little pain there, but she still put on the show. So I'm next to her, and the next gentleman in front of me is Mr. Benny Carter, great saxophone player, played trumpet, played clarinet, played everything and wrote a lot of music and had his own big band for years, did a lot of movies, wrote a lot of songs. So, a good group.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): (Unclear).
Speaker 1: That's one of the records ['Mood in Tenor Sax'] from Japan where we--somebody wanted me to play a lot of tunes from, you know, Japanese composers. And since the Japanese love pretty songs, they love low tenor and things like that melody. So that sold pretty well.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's in Mayor Tom Bradley's office downtown.  At least that was at that time. That was, I don't know if there was a date on the back of that, but that had to be probably eighty--'85 [1985] or something. But anyway, there's Sweets Edison [Harry Edison] at the top on the left side, then the great trumpeter and bandleader, Gerald Wilson, then the mayor, Tom Bradley, at the time, and next to Tom Bradley is Benny Carter on the right, and the two ladies in front, Ella Fitzgerald on the left and Dorothy Donegan in the middle there on the right side who was a fine pianist. Naturally Ella's lady of song, was one of the best who's ever done it. So that was a, honoring us in Bradley's chamber downtown. We all got a plaque and certificate or something of that nature, which he did all the time. He really loved jazz himself. So he'd always do that and make sure we felt--
Speaker 1: Is there one of you getting a plaque?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so. There's one.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): I'm ready.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's Tom Bradley on the left, the mayor of Los Angeles at the time. That might have been '85 [1985] or something. And there I am with Mayor Tom Bradley, which I got to be a good friend of his, and he would hire our band just about, oh, five out of the ten concerts they would do. We would do most of 'em. He liked our band. He liked the kind of jazz we played. He loved the saxophone, he loved his music--his favorite tune was "Impossible Dream" ["The Impossible Dream"], so we'd always have to play it for him which was great. And that was his life. He got to be mayor and almost made it to governor, but, you know, they didn't think, you know, that they wanted a black governor at that time, and even now they may not want it.
