Speaker 1: All right my name is Larry Crowe, I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers archive.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yeah my full name is Charles, C-H-A-R-L-E-S, Frederick, F-R-E-D-E-R-I-C-K, Lovell, L-O-V-E-L-L, Junior.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Date of birth is September 17, 1946, place of birth Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay and sir what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a practicing physician, internist, and I am Medical Director for Clinical Research at Sentara Medical Group.
Story_ID: 20647
Speaker 1: Okay and now we were discussing when I came in, just briefly give us a description of, of what I think is a great contribution to U.S. healthcare, just kind of mention that upfront here for us would you, about the Medicare.
Speaker 2: Yes.  In 1978 when I arrived, when I began my, my practice, I had just finished two years of active duty with the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] in Atlanta [Georgia] in the Epidemic Intelligence Service.  Fall was approaching and I sought to immunize my elderly patients against pneumonia and I became aware that the Pneumovax vaccine [against pneumococcal diseases in the elderly] was available.  So I contacted Medicare [national social insurance program in the United States] to see if this was a benefit covered by Medicare and I was told that they do not cover immunizations.  I then wrote a letter to the editor of Virginian-Pilot [newspaper] and in that letter I expressed the fact that it was really counterintuitive that Medicare would be willing to pay thousands of dollars for hospitalization and not tens of dollars for a vaccination.  That letter was read by then Republican Congressman G. William Whitehurst who then wrote me and told me that he was going to investigate this situation.  He then contacted Medicare.  He received a very clear, explicit letter from Medicare that they were not reimbursing any preventive health services.  Whitehurst then went further and commissioned a study by the Office of Technology Assessment, which demonstrated that pneumonia vaccines would create substantial savings in terms of dollars and also would result in many lives saved.  With this information he then went on, introduced a bill which after about two years, was enacted by the '96 [1996] [United States] Congress paying for vaccination against pneumonia.  And this bill represented the first ever reimbursement by Medicare for a preventive health service.  And of course since that time, Medicare has gone on to reimburse for, for influenza and many, many other services.  So it was a precedent-setting event, this bill because it literally changed the direction of Medicare from a pure treatment focus to a prevention focus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just wanted to make sure we got that up front.
Story_ID: 20648
Speaker 1: And now this is a more mundane question.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is February 5th, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: At the present time City-wise or building at 720 Riverview Avenue, I mean 301 Riverview Avenue, Suite 720 in Norfolk, Virginia.
Story_ID: 20649
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask that they just require a short answer.  They're like a warm up.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I do.  My favorite food would be turnip greens.
Speaker 1: Okay do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, my favorite color would be navy blue.
Speaker 1: Okay a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year would be spring.
Speaker 1: All right, a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Favorite vacation destination would be Jamaica, West Indies.
Speaker 1: Okay and the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes I do.  My favorite saying is from the Bible, the Mount of Olives, as they're about to stone the adulteress and Christ walks up and says, "Let he among you who is without sin, let him cast the first stone."
Story_ID: 20650
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right now I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  But we'll ask about them separately.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Rachel Mildred Arnold, and her married name is of course Lovell.  R-A-C-H-E-L, M-I-L-D-R-E-D, A-R-N-O-L-D, Lovell, L-O-V-E-L-L.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother's date of birth was in 19 -- I apologize.  I don't remember my mother's exact date of birth.
Speaker 1: That's all right.  All right if we could get as close--
Speaker 2: She was in--I would say 1928.
Speaker 1: Okay around 1928, okay and where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in, in Lawrenceville, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family, how far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Pretty far back.  My, my mother's father was a Baptist minister and a tobacco farmer.  He basically had two families.  My mother was a child of her, of his second family.  They were all basically working people.  All of them--some, I would say half of them moved to the North over the years.  Many of them worked in the automobile factories in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Others remained in the area and continued to farm.
Speaker 1: Okay, now are there any stories from--about the end of slavery or Reconstruction [the period after the American Civil War, 1865-1877] on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Well it turns out that, that my, my grandfather actually was fairly close to--his father actually was Caucasian and his mother was African American.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did that association give him any advantage at all?
Speaker 2: I--he--I'm not sure.  They had--he had a very--almost Native American features.  You could tell that he had--he was--his background was multi-racial.  My mother also had I would say multi-racial features.  At that time in North Carolina and Virginia, they really kind of--the family kind of spanned the border of Stokes County, North Carolina, Patrick County, Virginia.  I don't think it conferred that much of an advantage.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did this--did his white father raise him or, or was it--he's just the father of, I mean the biological father of him?
Speaker 2: For the most part, he was just the biological father.  For the most part he was raised by his mother.
Story_ID: 20651
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right so what did your mother [Rachel Arnold] say about growing up in--did she grow up in Lawrenceville [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yeah my mother grew up in, she grew up basically in the rural South.  After she married my father, she went actually to J.J. Jones High School, the same school that I started.  And after she graduated, she married my father and, and then basically began to, to raise a family.
Speaker 1: Okay now, now she finished high school, which is a, now that's a--people today, well I don't know if they take it for granted anymore.  We used to take, take it for granted that people would finish high school.  But nowadays with so many drop-outs we're not sure, but in those days that was a big deal.
Speaker 2: It was.  And, and I tell you J.J. Jones High School as I mentioned before with the limited resources the African American teachers there did a great job in stressing education.  So both of my parents were high school graduates.  My father entered the [U.S.] Navy and then my mother came to Detroit [Michigan] during the war [World War II] and she worked in the, in, in the automobile factories that were now making tanks and jeeps.  So she participated in the war effort on the production side while my father was on a mine sweeper keeping the shipping lanes open between New York and Nantucket [Massachusetts] light ship.
Story_ID: 20652
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now just before--is there a story behind who J.J. Jones is?
Speaker 2: Yeah J.J. Jones our principal, was a, an educated, primarily southern educated teacher.  His wife was a, was also a teacher.  And most of them came from teach--at that time teachers' colleges in the North Carolina area, Winston-Salem State Teachers College [Winston-Salem, North Carolina], [North Carolina] A&T [Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], Bennett College [Greensboro, North Carolina], which was an all women's college in, in Greensboro [North Carolina].  And a number of them were also graduates of, of the training school in Sedalia, North Carolina, which at that time was kind of an African American prep[aratory] school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A training school, okay.  You can't remember the name of the school?
Speaker 2: I can't remember right off the tip of my tongue, no.
Speaker 1: Okay in Sedalia, yeah.  So J.J. Jones--
Speaker 2: I do. It was Palmer Memorial [Institute].
Speaker 1: Palmer Memorial.
Speaker 2: Palmer Memorial, yes.  You've heard of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.  Okay so J.J. Jones was the name of, name of the--the school was actually named for the principal of the school.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Who was I guess exalted as an educator.
Speaker 2: Absolutely and you know with limited resources, was able to keep the school, to keep the school productive.  And even after I left North Carolina and went to New York to finish high school, I remained very close to my teachers at J.J. Jones.  Ms. Laura Johnson who was my seventh grade teacher, every time I went home I would contact her.  And so these teachers were great inspirations to me throughout my life.
Speaker 1: Okay now J.J. Jones is in Mount Airy?
Speaker 2: Mount Airy, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay Mount Airy, North Carolina.
Story_ID: 20653
Speaker 1: So let me go to your father's side of the family.  Let me ask another question about your mother [Rachel Arnold].  Now when she finished--I have a note here that she was a, she was a, a wedding consultant, a bridal consultant?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was this later on in life?
Speaker 2: It was later on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Basically my family was also very entrepreneurial.  So after the war my father and my mother worked in a dry cleaning establishment in my town.  And then my father and my uncle went on to form their own dry cleaning establishment, 'Lovell Town and Country Cleaners'.  So then my mother worked in the family business as a--in the dry cleaning business.  Then she became aware of the bridal and tux industry and began to work at 'Old Town Bridal and Tux' in Old Town, North Carolina, which is kind of a suburb of Winston-Salem [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  We'll get back to her and your father.
Story_ID: 20654
Speaker 1: Can, can, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Charles.
Speaker 1: [Unclear]
Speaker 2: Yes.  Frederick Lovell, Senior.
Speaker 1: You, you don't have to spell it 'cause we know it's the same as yours.  What is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My father's date of birth was September 15th, 1922.
Speaker 1: Okay and where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Pilot Mountain, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Pilot Mountain, North Carolina.  Now how far back can you trace his side of the family?
Speaker 2: I can trace his, his side back to slavery.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My great-great-grandfather named Jesse Lovell, was born a slave in Stokes County, North Carolina.  His father was James Lovell.  He was emancipated with the [American] Civil War and then continued his trade as an axe handle and wagon wheel manufacturer.  And he founded the church in my hometown called 'Lovell's Chapel Methodist Church'.  And this was my grandfather Jesse.  Now my grandfather Jesse married a Native American named Lightfoot Pace.  She was Cherokee.  And had a substantial family.  My great-grandfather James Floyd Lovell, was a descendant of, of that couple.  And then my grandfather Sylvester, then my father and me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's, that's interesting that you've got--you, you can trace it all the way back.  Are there any stories from the slave period or stories that are passed down about, about your great-great grandfather's experiences?
Speaker 2: Well he was, he was really quite a self-confident entrepreneur.  And again founded the church which existed over the years.  And I actually attended that church as a child.  I know that my family--he and his descendants were always very principled, always commanded respect and dignity and that passed down through the generations to the point where I had the occasion where I and my younger brother was in a local store in town and we walked in and we went to buy some Marie cookies and there were about six gentlemen sitting around and they called us nigger.  Called us--so we left the store and went out and my father was walking up the street and he saw us crying, so we saw him and started crying.  And he says, he says "What happened?"  So we told him that some people had called us out of our name and so he grabbed us by the hand and took us back into the store.  And he held one, my younger brother in one and he confronted these six gentlemen.  He says, he says "Don't ever call my sons out of their name again."  And he confronted them by himself.  And it was an in--it was an incident that of course I always remembered.  And it was--that was pretty much the, the attitude of my family.  I mean we--my family could demanded respect and tried to live with integrity.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now was, was it unusual for a, a black family to own its own land and in that area?
Speaker 2: It was very unusual, especially to have a business and to--, we actually had a pickup.  I would ride the, the trucks out to pick up dry cleaning out into the country and had a chance to meet a lot of people and to see a lot of, a lot of different lifestyles, a lot of poverty and so just going on those delivery trucks began to kind of expand my horizons.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now my father after the dry cleaning business, took a course at International Correspondence Schools to become a sign painter.  Became excellent and then founded 'Lovell Signs' in Winston-Salem [North Carolina] which operated profitably for thirty-five years.  He painted signs, he did gold-leaf lettering and actually was the best in the area.
Speaker 1: Now had he had, had he been known for any artistic, you know skills?
Speaker 2: Yeah he had.  You know he had the skill and he was always--he really was a, a very gifted craftsman.  So he had a, he had a knack and a, and an ability to, to create.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now it seems like now, correct me if I'm wrong.  I'm not, I'm not sure what part of North Carolina--but I know North Carolina is known for furniture making and, and you said your great-great-great grandfather was an axe handle maker and a--
Speaker 2: Axe handle and, and wagon wheels.
Speaker 1: Wagon wheels and that sort of thing.  Was it, was there a lot of woodworking activity around?
Speaker 2: We didn't have--most of the furniture making in Carolina was a little further to the east around Concord and Hickory [cities in North Carolina] and, and that area.  But my grandfather, I'll never forget, he had a special jig that he would use.  He would sit on this--it was like a large log that had a hole carved in the center of it.  And he had a, a pedal that would lock the hickory, the hickory limb in it.  And he had a double handed axe that he would use to shape it.  So he would actually use this device to make the axe handles and the, the wagon spokes.  And then he would assemble the wagon wheels.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now that, that's a--yeah there's a reputation of hand crafted stuff out of North Carolina that's really something, so--.
Story_ID: 20655
Speaker 1: Well okay, now is there--now your father [Charles Lovell, Sr.] went to J.J. Jones [High School, Mount Airy, North Carolina] too, right too?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And is there a story about how your parents met that they tell?
Speaker 2: Yeah it's a great story.  Apparently my father returned home and he went to my grandmother and he told my grandmother that he met the girl he was going to marry.  And he proceeded to execute his plan.
Speaker 1: Now this is while in high school?
Speaker 2: This was while in high school, absolutely.  He met my mother [Rachel Arnold] and, and, and decided that she was the one and she was.  And she was, it was a great story--a great romantic story to me, the way that played out.
Story_ID: 20656
Speaker 1: Okay so you say--was he [Dr. Charles Lovell, Jr.'s father, Charles Lovell, Sr.] then drafted out of high school for the war?
Speaker 2: Joined the [U.S.] Navy.
Speaker 1: He joined.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's interesting, all four--my father had three brothers.  His younger brother John and he joined the Navy.  They were stationed at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and they spent the war [World War II] on mine sweepers trying to keep the shipping lanes open between New York Harbor and where the convoys would form off of Massachusetts to try to make the run across to, to England.  His two oldest brothers, Floyd and Baxter, joined the [U.S.] Army.  They were in the Buffalo Battalion in Tuscany and Italy.  So they spent two years in the Army in Italy.  So all of them were, were in the military.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So he, sounds like he had a fairly large family.
Speaker 2: It was, it was the, the four brothers.
Speaker 1: Four brothers, okay, all right.  Now the one, the brother James, was it James?
Speaker 2: James, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah the one that you ended up living with in New York at some point.  Was he in the service too?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was, he and Baxter were the ones who went to Italy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So they spent time in the Buffalo Battalion in Italy.
Story_ID: 20657
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you think about your parents' personalities and their, and their looks, their habits, and their talents, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Probably my father [Charles Lovell, Sr.].  My father was a Virgo [zodiac sign] like me, he was very obsessive/compulsive.  He was a perfectionist.  And I must say that that's, that's my character.  My mother [Rachel Arnold] was a Libran [zodiac sign], she was more relaxed and she had more [unclear] poise.  My father you know and I told you this story about the store.  My father would pretty much, he would heat up pretty quickly and, and act.  My mother, she provided some balance to the family.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: I was just going to add that her father being a Baptist minister now, she was, she was quite strict.  I mean my mother had a tremendous amount of dignity and she ran a pretty straight household.  But she was a very warm person and a very humanitarian person.
Story_ID: 20658
Speaker 1: Okay now I think you got like a Baptist tradition out of your mother's [Rachel Arnold] side, but then there's a Methodist or AME [African Methodist Episcopal Church], is it--
Speaker 2: United Methodist.
Speaker 1: United Methodist out of the--on the other side.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Where did you all end up going to church, or did you--
Speaker 2: I grew up United Methodist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But I had my closest cousins were actually Baptist.  I have a first cousin who was--he was ten days older than me, the son of my mother's closest sister and we kind of almost grew up as brothers.  And he grew up in the--actually the primitive Baptist church.  Which is a, which is a, a sect of the Baptist church that doesn't have musical instruments.  They wash feet, they have a number of unique components to that order of worship that's different from the traditional southern Baptist.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah I've heard of that before.  I didn't know what quite what it meant, the, the primitive Baptist church.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All the songs are lined out by the minister.  The minister will line out the song and then the congregation would, would, would chime in.  If you remember hearing 'Jacob's Ladder' in the Ken Burn series on the [American] Civil War, you hear the minister saying (singing) "We are climbing Jacob's Ladder," and then the congregation comes in.  That would, that's the way they would conduct their, their, their hymns.
Speaker 1: Right hearing sort of a droning kind of--
Speaker 2: Yes.  All done with voice.  No piano or, or any musical accompaniment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is, is this an old form of--as far as you know, I mean you know.
Speaker 2: It's, it's believed to really have originated during slavery when there were no musical instruments.  There really was just the church itself and the congregation.  And, and the foot washing is believe to also date back to that time.  But the attributes of that service I find attractive, particularly the foot washing part because it has a leveling effect on the congregation.  No matter whether you're the doctor or the college professor, you know, you wash your neighbor's feet.  And I often, I've reflected on that, that custom on many occasions and I think that there are things about it that I think are very, are very attractive.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I have attended the primitive Baptist, some of the primitive Baptist meetings and quite different from United Methodist, but still had a lot of attractive characteristics.
Story_ID: 20659
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the town, Pilot Mountain [North Carolina, where Dr. Charles Lovell, Jr.'s father was born], is--, has a, a popular culture twin called Mount Pilot, correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Which is, which was popularized on the Andy Griffith Show, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And now tell us about that connection.
Speaker 2: All right well Andy Griffith was born in Mount Airy, North Carolina, which is about 12 miles north on Highway 52.  And it's interesting, Mount Airy is where J.J. Jones High School is located.  And I used to ride the school bus from Pilot Mountain to Mount Airy and back each day to attend elementary and junior high school.  Well Andy Griffith and his show had this neighboring town called Mount Pilot.  And of course Mount Pilot was my hometown, Pilot Mountain.  And the town takes its name from a unique geological structure which is this mountain that has a hump on it and a knob.  It has a--it's a very unique looking mountain that's called 'Pilot Mountain'.  So I literally grew up on the, at the base of that mountain.  Now I grew up in the western Piedmont of North Carolina, right--I was about thirty miles from the Blue Ridge Parkway.  So if you think of North Carolina, you go from the coastal plains which is of course the, the outer banks and that whole area, through the Piedmont area where you move to more red clay and more tobacco farming and that type of agriculture, to the mountain region and the mountain region of course includes the Blue Ridges, the Great Smokies [Smoky Mountains], Pisgah National Forest, the mountain area of North Carolina has a lot of very, very rugged, almost primal topography.
Story_ID: 20660
Speaker 1: All right now tell us something about the area you grew up in, because it you know I--in popular culture it seems, seems very homey and you can, you can almost, you can feel the affection that Andy Griffith has for the people and the place he grew up.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was it--did you find it like that?
Speaker 2: I did.  I was really raised by my entire neighborhood.  The black community of Pilot Mountain [North Carolina], even, even adults who were not part of my family knew who I was, knew where I was going, knew where I should be.  And all of them kind of raised me.  And of course I grew respecting all of them.  I was on a baseball team.  I was in the Boy Scouts.  The, the whole community as very warm, you know we wore paths, there were paths that crisscrossed the community that the children--that we would run down to get from one part of the, of the community to another.  Had a lot of relatives, a lot of cousins.  My aunts and uncles were there except for my Uncle Jim and my Aunt Martha were in New York.  All of my other uncles were right there in the Pilot Mountain community, so I had, I had a very close, extended family.  My grandmother was there, my great-grandmother was there, my great-grand-, you know, so it was a very large, extended family with a lot of love and, and a lot of, of very strong middle class orientation with an emphasis on education.  But I grew up delivering newspapers.  My older brother actually was never quite fair with me when it came to payment.  I would get up when he got up and we would go to the police station.  We had one police officer, Sid Patent [ph.], and we would get there early in the morning and roll the papers and then we would deliver newspapers and I think he paid me $3 a week and he took the rest.  But we delivered newspapers.  Now we did this and then came home and then had oatmeal and then stood to catch the bus to be bussed to Mount Airy [North Carolina].  So we had a very early morning to get all of this in.  When I was very young, when I was a little bit younger than my, my newspaper days, I used to run errands for an elderly Caucasian lady named Ms. Velda Footens [ph.].  She was a very nice lady.  I would come home, walk over to her house.  I would sweep the leaves off her porch.  I would take her postcard, walk downtown and I guess I was maybe, maybe six or seven then.  I would mail her postcard, go to Piggly-Wiggly [grocery store] and buy her some butter, pickup a half dozen eggs, and then bring it back to her.  My father [Charles Lovell, Sr.] used to drive her to visit her family in Kinston, North Carolina and he--it was kind of like you know, driving Ms. Daisy, my father would do that.  When she passed away she gave us a, a beautiful '39 [1939] Ford.  She left us the car that my father used to drive to take her around North Carolina to visit family members.  So I did that, then delivered newspapers.  And then began to work in tobacco, which was at that time the best pay.  I actually would pick tobacco, we call it priming tobacco.  We would actually harvest tobacco in the, the August and September sun in North Carolina.  I think we--I think the most I made was about a dollar and a half an hour.
Speaker 1: Tell us about--I know my father said he hated the big tobacco worms.  He had a job of stomping the worms when he was a little kid, but did--I mean what, what was it like?
Speaker 2: We weren't around those.  We didn't like to--I mean they were--they didn't bite, but they were not appealing to look at.  So we would pull them off and, and, and just keep going.  But what I remember is that it was so hot you could see wavelets of heat coming off, off of the tobacco.  And it looked like those, those rows went over hills.  We couldn't even see the end of the rows.  So we would get out there early morning, long sleeves, it would be very cold in the morning for the dew.  And we would--each of us would pick two rows and we'd go down the rows, back and forth and at lunch we had a mid-morning break where we had a king size Coke [Coca Cola] and some nabs [ph.].  Then at lunch Jerry Lynch who was a farmer we worked for, his wife opened up her kitchen and we all piled right into the house around the kitchen table and had this huge country lunch.  So large that it was difficult getting back in the field because you wanted to just lay up against a tree and, and sleep for the afternoon.
Speaker 1: Now, now is this the kind of lunch they call dinner down South?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes sir.  Several meats, many vegetables, cornbread, hot biscuits, you know several breads, that type of thing.  And then we would work the afternoon and he would bring us home and as I recall I bought my first record album with my tobacco money, 'Where Did Our Love Go' by the Supremes. I actually purchased that after washing the tobacco gum off my hands and, and headed to the record store.  So did that actually during the summer when I was in high school in New York I would come home and work in tobacco to make some, some spending change.  And Mr. Lynch was very proud when he learned that I was going to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Mr. Lynch was a, he was a, a very interesting gentleman.  Always treated us with respect.  Never had a moment of disrespect from him.  His wife was the same.  So we really you know, it--we really had no misgivings about working for him and helping him with his, with his harvest.
Speaker 1: Okay so some of the sweetness portrayed on TV around that part of North Carolina is true.
Speaker 2: It is.  Yeah it was interesting that you knew you had this duality.  You had a tremendous amount of--with certain individuals you would experience a lot of dignity, a lot of caring and what-not.  It's just that when you got to groups, the problems arose with groups you know black and white, you know, rich and poor.  But on the one-to-one level you had these very genuine relationships as I recall.  That was, that was really not atypical at all.
Story_ID: 20661
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell us about school.  Now where did you start school?
Speaker 2: Started school at J.J. Jones High School.  Actually the high school is--you went actually to one building, grade one through twelve, different classrooms.  So Ms. Johnson was my first grade teacher.  And I mentioned before my seventh grade teacher Ms. Laura Johnson.  Ms. Laura Johnson was a large lady, so we called our first grade teacher Little Miss Johnson, and we called the seventh grade teacher Big Miss Johnson, and that's how we distinguished them.  But I started there in the first grade.  And basically stayed there through the ninth grade, just moving up the classes.
Speaker 1: Now did you, did you have an interest in, in science when you were growing up?  I mean was it pronounced?
Speaker 2: You know I was always very curious.  My Uncle Jim always brought me something scientific for Christmas.  He brought me a Gilbert Chemistry Set and he bought me a Gilbert microscope, and that's how I got started.  I took that microscope and then I would buy 'Popular Mechanics' [magazine] and I would order different types of things to look at under the microscope and they'd come in the mail.  And then I got my Gilbert Chemistry Set and I began to do chemistry experiments.  My Uncle Jim even before I moved to New York, he really kind of sparked that interest in, in the natural sciences when I was in junior high school.  So that's how I began.  And so then you know we would catch animals and we would catch crayfish.  And I just had a natural curiosity about living things and how things worked.  And you know the principles that underlie different things.  So he, he was a, a critical role in I think giving me kind of some of the tools to move forward with.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so you said like Mount Airy is about fifteen miles away from--
Speaker 2: About twelve miles.
Speaker 1: Twelve miles.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right now, now so did you--did they have separate classes in, in--at J.J. Jones for each grade?
Speaker 2: Yes we did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We did have separate classes.  It wasn't like the old schools where you had four or five grades.  We had separate classes and, and separate teachers.  But you knew who your next teacher was going to be and you basically had one teacher per grade until you got to the--I remember the eighth grade we had, we began to have two teachers.  But you, you kind of knew the gauntlet you had to run to graduate.  But I would like to underscore really I think the attention that my teachers paid to us, trying to educate us and, and they really taught us--they really underscored behavior, you know.  We respected them.  We learned how to dress, you know they, they taught us life skills as well as you know, reading and writing.  And I think they imbued a certain dignity in us.  So it was almost like the teachers were extended family.  If anything went wrong I knew my father [Charles Lovell, Sr.] would know by the time I got home.  And that was the case.  I mean it--we, we would never disrespect our teachers at that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah you seem like a--the kind of person that would always do the right thing, but did you ever get in trouble in school?
Speaker 2: Well yes I did.  I, I made the mistake of calling one of my first cousins out of her name, called her a name.  It was a very cool thing and I paid for it.  By the time I got back home my father had already gotten the message and when I ran down one of those paths that we had worn, he was standing in the back yard with his belt buckle.  And so he would hit me a couple of turns with his belt, and of course after that he always put me on his knee and told me how much he loved me and that I had done--he said you know what you did wrong.  You know you should not call your cousin out of her name.  And so I did get--not common, but from time to time I would step out of line, I'd get a little corporal punishment.  Never abused, always appropriate, always followed by an expression of love and in my opinion the right thing.  Yeah it worked for me.
Speaker 1: Now what--I didn't have you name your siblings and stuff in the order.  But can you do that for me?
Speaker 2: Yeah my oldest brother is Clayton, okay.  Then my--then comes me, then comes my younger brother Reginald, and then I have three sisters, Precious, April and Renee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That, that's the group.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Story_ID: 20662
Speaker 1: So, so when you were in--did you ever have--did you have an inkling at some point that you wanted to be involved in science or medicine--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when you were growing up.
Speaker 2: I've always loved science.  I think that when I arrived in New York--you know I, I did well in all of my classes, but I loved my biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics.  I even went to Stuyvesant High School [New York] in the summer to take advanced algebra and trig so that I could take calculus my senior year in, in high school.
Speaker 1: I don't want to get you that far yet.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But I, I'm--
Speaker 2: But I've always liked--
Speaker 1: In grade school, in grade school.
Speaker 2: Yeah in grade school I've always liked science, always liked science, you know.
Speaker 1: Did they have equipment in the--in your school?
Speaker 2: Very little.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mr. Setzer [ph.] who was our science teacher, had one small cabinet.  We rarely had, we rarely did good experiments.  We just didn't have the material there.  This was at J.J. Jones High [Mount Airy, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were all of your teachers black?
Speaker 2: They were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah they were--all of them were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Setzer wanted to, Earl Setzer was his name, he really wanted to--he tried to teach, he taught us science with, within the, the restrictions that he had to operate.  But he always encouraged me and when I got to New York, I always stayed in touch with my teachers and let them know what I was doing and you know, in, in my science subjects.
Story_ID: 20663
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how was--let me ask you this before I get you out of, out of North Carolina.  Did, did the family like keep up with the, the current events?  Did you have like newspapers coming to the house and--sounds like you might be that kind of--
Speaker 2: We did. Yeah we had the 'Winston-Salem Journal Centennial' that came in.  I think for a time we used to take, take--I'm trying to think, was it the 'Amsterdam News'?  We took a, a black newspaper.  I think it was the 'Amsterdam News' that we had delivered that we paid for.  So we also got a little bit of, you know we got some, some kind of dedicated news in the, in the larger black community.  And we had of course an 'Encyclopedia Britannica', which is where I did most of my learning in North Carolina.  I just devoured the 'Encyclopedia Britannica'.
Speaker 1: Okay now that was special.  I mean having a, a set of encyclopedias there at home.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well actually my, my grandmother had them, but that was in walking distance.  So when I visited my grandmother first thing I did was pull off, pull a volume of the 'Encyclopedia Britannica' and read that.  Remember when--back at that time my grandmother had just gotten a first telephone in Pilot Mountain [North Carolina], which was a party line.  We had just gotten a--we got a television when I was in the fourth grade.  So we didn't have television.  We listened to radio.  So a lot of time was spent you know with cousins, talking, playing, you know, exploring in the woods and you know catching snakes and all those types of activities.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What did your family make of the [American] Civil Rights Movement via the television?  I guess you, you all got a television in '56 [1956] thereabouts?
Speaker 2: That's right, that would have been, yeah that would have been about '56 [1956], yes.
Speaker 1: That's about the time of the Montgomery Bus Boycott.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Making the news.
Speaker 2: My family was always very activist, but very measured.  My Uncle Jim and his older brother Baxter went to Pilot Mountain and told them--Uncle Jim was at [North Carolina] A&T [Agricultural and technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] at the time and he told them they came to register to vote.  Had a very good friend of the family, Owen Swanson who was the voting registrar, said, says Jim, he says you know I like--I would like to register you but you really can't--I can't register you.  So they were returned and said we, we're here to register, we want to vote.  And actually they were registered.  They were registered.  It, you know, didn't have to go much beyond that.  But my family was very much tuned into the Civil Rights Movement, very much so.  And actually some of these activities were occurring really before the, the Civil Rights Movement really got the momentum that we, that we you know, that we know it, it developed over time.
Speaker 1: You said your Uncle Jim was at AT&T?
Speaker 2: A&T, A&T, A&T.
Speaker 1: A&T, North Carolina A&T.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: He went to North Carolina A&T.
Speaker 1: I'm trying to make it AT&T.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So he was there, yeah before he went to New York.  They registered to vote in Pilot Mountain.
Speaker 1: So was he there when they, they--the sit-ins were going on?
Speaker 2: No he was in New York by then.
Speaker 1: By then, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  He was already teaching in New York.
Speaker 1: So they were--the students were agitating then for the right to vote before even the sit-in movement.
Speaker 2: Well yeah now in, in Pilot Mountain it was more just a family thing, you know it wasn't an organized event with larger numbers of people.  It's just that he and my Uncle Baxter decided they wanted to vote.  So they went over to register and they were registered.  It--but it was just the family you know A&T was really when it became an organized, you know the sit-ins at Woolworth's became an organized you know student event.
Speaker 1: Okay what you're describing basically is a community where the relation-, the hard line segregationists, I mean the rules were in place but the people were kind of you know, they weren't as hard lined as the rules.
Speaker 2: Exactly, you didn't have you know organized, you know groups that exerted pressure on certain key individuals.  Owen Swanson was kind of leader of the community.  So if he wanted to register my uncle to vote, that was fine because he was really part of the establishment in Pilot Mountain.  And--
Speaker 1: Well it sounds like that he didn't really want to be blamed for letting you all vote, but he, he didn't have a problem with it himself.
Speaker 2: Right, there wasn't a lot of news--it really wasn't a newsworthy event, so it didn't get a lot of attention.  They just kind of registered, voted and, and kind of went their way.  So it was kind of before you know, there was a lot of media attention developed in the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Kind of before that, that period of, of history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20664
Speaker 1: All right so now what--there had to be a--was there a series of events or, or I guess a point of recognition in your family that you were a special student and should actually, you know, have this opportunity to go somewhere else to school.
Speaker 2: My Uncle Jim you know I, I always got As at J.J. Jones High School [Mount Airy, North Carolina] and my Uncle Jim as I was going into the tenth grade, this was just before the schools were integrated.  My younger brother two years behind me, finished high school in Pilot Mountain [North Carolina], he went to Pilot Mountain High School.  But my Uncle Jim met with my father and suggested I come to live with him and my Aunt Martha in New York City.  And I did, and I was so close to my father [Charles Lovell, Sr.] and my brothers that I almost died of homesickness when I first got to New York.  I--
Speaker 1: Now, now did your [older] brother Clayton go to college?
Speaker 2: He did.  My brother Clayton graduated from J.J. Jones High School, got to New York and had to take some remedial courses, okay.  He went to CCNY [City College of New York] and, but he, but he was a little bit behind.  And, and so he had to kind of catch up and then go forward.  And so I think that you know, recognizing a little bit of his difficulty kind of, kind of caused the plan to come together for me to, to leave North Carolina and finish high school in, in New York City.
Speaker 1: Okay make sure that you were already in stride with--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So, so this happened just before your sophomore year starts.
Speaker 2: Just before.  So I finished my--I entered the tenth grade in--at Seward Park High School and stayed there tenth, eleventh and twelfth.
Speaker 1: You had visited New York before, right?
Speaker 2: I had, I had visited my uncle and aunt.  I went, I was there when they had the World's Fair, when Shea Stadium was built.  I was there for that and so I had been there a couple of times before.  Before I actually moved there.
Speaker 1: Okay so, so you had mixed feelings about it I guess?
Speaker 2: I did, I mean I loved my Uncle Jim, but I was so close to my father [Charles Lovell, Sr.] and my mother [Rachel Arnold] and my brothers.  I mean, I mean it's--we were very close you know.  When my father came home from work, he'd pull the seat of the car out and my brothers and I would jump in the back of the car with baseball bats and gloves and we'd go to the stadium and hit balls with my father until the sun went down.  I mean that's the kind of boyhood I had.  We--my father was a, a, a prize winning model airplane builder.  He was a modeler.  Won the blue ribbons--he would have to, he would build the planes and give them to his white friends.  He couldn't enter them in the contest and they would enter them and he, he always got blue ribbons.  So he was that type of modeler.  Throughout my childhood I wanted to be able to model like my father and I was never as good.  Came close, but I was never as good as he was.  So I grew up building model planes, playing baseball, you know with my father and it was--I missed that.  But after a few months I kind of made friends in New York in my class and you know, things settled in.  And my Uncle Jim was always very supportive so things worked out.
Story_ID: 20665
Speaker 1: Okay now Seward High School was on the, on the lower East Side [New York]?
Speaker 2: It was, 350 Grant Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Lower East Side.  Even below the area that is traditionally thought of being the, the immigrant area, below Delancy Street and Orchard Street and all that area.  And I entered a, an honors class when I arrived.  And most of my classmates were Jewish kids from Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, who were incredibly competitive.  I tell people that when I got to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I had already felt competition.  I experienced no competition at Harvard as, as sharp as the competition I had at Seward Park High School in the honors class.  So I was well prepared.  I remember my first semester of chemistry I got a ninety-nine with Mr. Mitchell Shulack [ph.].  So my classmates says well you know you have Mr. Litman [ph.] next semester, let's see you get a ninety-nine with Litman.  Well I got a ninety-nine with Litman.  And then at that point I was established.  I mean I had gained my respect within the class.  But that was the way, I mean we talked about high grade point averages, man we talked about 96s and 97s and 98s, that's the kind of competition that existed there.
Speaker 1: Now did you hit the ground running when you--I mean at first, or did you have--was there any moment of shock of "Oh, wait, wait a minute, I'm not ready."
Speaker 2: You know there was some insecurity at first you know because most of these kids had a lot of confidence.  You know they came from middle class families, Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village you may know they were, they were very middle and upper middle class communities, primarily Jewish communities on the Lower East Side.  You know from maybe 14th Street up to 23rd Street, right on the East River.  So they came from professional families but I got in there and did well in, in, in math and science and eventually did well in all of my subjects.  And became--they elected me President of Arista, which was the honor society and so I graduated actually third in my class.  We were separated by a tenth of a point.  The first in the class was Carmine Insolaka [ph.], and Carmine was my classmate at my freshman year at Harvard, we were roommates.  And Marilyn Shlamowitz [ph.] was second.  But I mean we were all, I mean you know .02 apart from each other.  So that's how we--that was out of a class of about 700 graduating seniors.
Speaker 1: Okay I was looking at the famous graduates of Seward and a lot of them were entertainers you know, Tony Curtis and Jerry Stiller.
Speaker 2: Interesting.
Speaker 1: Yeah a lot of them--I think the only black one was Satch Sanders, the basketball player that played with the Boston Celtics.
Speaker 2: But we had--my class was totally multi-racial, multi-ethnic.  You know I was right down near Chinatown, Little Italy.  I had quite a few Russian kids in my class and of course I, I studied Russian and French in high school.  And African American and a pretty large Jewish population.  And so we were all in there--it was a really true melting pot of a high school.
Story_ID: 20666
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now still there's a story about that--now how did you, how did you choose Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?  I know it may sound like a silly question, but if they chose, I don't know if they chose you or you chose Harvard.
Speaker 2: You know what?  My Uncle Jim suggested I apply.  Again it's, it's having that mentorship, you know.  He said you have great grades.  I had already been accepted to CCNY [City College of New York], Rensselaer Polytech [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York], I had a number of--he says look, he says, "Why don't you apply to Harvard?"  So I told him I didn't have the money for the application.  He says, "I'll pay for the application."  That's how it happened.  Just having a family member, a teacher nearby who suggested I apply.  And I got an acceptance notice.  You know it's interesting I, when I went for my interview at the Harvard Club in New York City, I walked in this place and I'm a member, I've been a member there now for about thirty years.  I walked in and I thought I had entered another country.  I had on my one pair of dress slacks that my uncle bought for me at Barney's.  And I walked in and I was greeted at this door, huge walk-in fireplaces burning.  I had never seen anything like this in my life.  But I was greeted and taken into a, a room where, where I was interviewed and there were a lot of questions about [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], a lot of questions about leadership.  You know they were really interested in leadership you know and what did I want to do.  How did I view myself, you know, in the greater society.  These were the questions the Harvard Club interviewers were asking me.  But I'd never in my life seen anything like the physical appearance of the Harvard Club in New York City when I walked through those doors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I was accepted and, and packed up and headed to Cambridge.
Speaker 1: Okay this is like 1964.
Speaker 2: '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  [President] John [F.] Kennedy had been assassinated.  I'll never forget that day.  I remember it as if it was, you know, today.  I was in, in my English, in my music appreciation class when Mr. Nanas [ph.] came on and said he had been shot.  When I got to my Russian class the word came that he had been killed, he had died.  And that weekend I was going with a good friend of mine who was a Russian ancestry, going to Connecticut to spend the weekend.  It was the longest drive I think I've ever taken.  Everyone in the car was so profoundly depressed as we were making our way up to Connecticut.
Speaker 1: Yeah that drive, remember that time, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 20667
Speaker 1: Yeah tell us now you, you took a journalism school at Seward [High School, New York City].  So--
Speaker 2: I did.  We had--in the honors class we had some electives.  We could take a course in creative writing, which I did take.  We could take one in journalism.  And so my journalism teacher was Mr. Colin Twano [ph.].  I took this and I had to write a feature story. So I called up 'Chock Full of Nuts Coffee' and I got a, an appointment to interview Jackie Robinson [American baseball player; first African American in modern-day Major League Baseball].  Now I got to give you a little backdrop to this.  When I was growing up, every time I took the bat, I was Jackie Robinson.  Every time I had--always had to slide and I was Jackie Robinson, okay.  So I had--I, I got this appointment to go into town and meet Jackie Robinson, so I, I go in and have my little, my little pad with me and they--his receptionist greets me and leads me into--so I walk into this room, kind of dimly lit room.  And this giant stands up who is Jackie Robinson.  And of course there are trophies everywhere and plaques and things on the wall.  And I walked in and shook his hand and to me, you know having grown up playing baseball, baseball was my childhood sport.  It was a, just a special occasion.  And so I talked to him and, and you know took some notes and wrote my feature article on Jackie Robinson.  That was an incredible experience for me.
Speaker 1: Did he say anything that surprised you or anything that--
Speaker 2: No, he was very warm, I remember he had a great, deep voice.  He had a, a--he filled the room.  His presence was enormous, you know of course that was I'm sure a lot of my, of what I brought to the, to the encounter, but I just remember he being very large, very, very powerful voice, but he, he really made me feel very much at home.  I sat down and we talked a little bit about baseball and he asked me if I played baseball and, and you know I shared some of my childhood experiences with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know when I grew up you know my dad [Charles Lovell, Sr.]--, when I grew up each town had a baseball team.  And so my father played with the Pilot Mountain [North Carolina] Black Socks.  So the way--see the way you met people in these small towns is on the weekends you would play neighboring towns.  And that's how you met girls and and made new friends.  So my father played for the Pilot Mountain Black Socks and, and then of course I grew up playing baseball and, and that's kind of how--baseball was the sport you know when I was growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so Jackie Robinson--now this was--how old were you at this time do you think?
Speaker 2: This would have been 1960--this would have been about 1963.
Speaker 1: '63 [1963], okay.
Speaker 2: It'd be junior year in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20668
Speaker 1: Now the year before [in 1962] you had an encounter with Malcolm X [African American human rights activist].
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: I did, I, I would always march with the United Federation of Teachers.  I remember then Al Shanker was the president of the union at that time.
Speaker 1: Albert Shanker.
Speaker 2: Albert Shanker and so we were very supportive of our teachers and, and I remember we, we marked--I think it was one of the teacher demonstrations, but I'm not 100 percent--we marched across the Brooklyn Bridge [New York] and we marched to City Hall.  And among the speakers was Malcolm X.  And I--so I'm standing in the crowd and I had this little piece of paper and so I just approached the podium after his speech.  And I raised my paper up and I--he was a giant, he was so tall, and I said, I asked him for an interview.  And he gave me the X and I stuck it deep in my pocket and then left.  And of course I was a little concerned that the FOI [Freedom of Information] might have, you know intercepted me, but I looked, I guess I looked pretty harmless to them.  They just let me approach him and I got my autograph.
Speaker 1: Now had you known any members of the Nation of Islam up to this point?
Speaker 2: I had some because my uncle [Jim]--I would spend Sunday mornings watching the news shows with my uncle.  And of course he was a history teacher and I'd like to just to compliment my uncle, my uncle was a true intellectual.  And I might just interject that recently my aunt [Martha] gave me all of his papers.  So they're in my possession now.  All of his term papers and writings, I own.  Which to me was a great honor of my aunt to give those to me.  But we would watch David Susskind on Sunday morning.  And I would watch Malcolm X and the thing about him that impressed me the most was his confidence.  And everything he said seemed to be the truth.  You know he seemed to be speaking this, this truth.  And so I really, I used to just love the way that he would respond to Susskind's questions.  But you know I was very much involved in, in you know all of the lead--with all of the leaders of the [American] Civil Rights Movement at that time.  And my uncle and of course would follow with a lot of discussion with my uncle, so it was--I had a very rich, intellectual life you know with my, with my uncle.
Story_ID: 20669
Speaker 1: It just occurred to me, did you--members of your family have, have any theory about the assassination of [President] John [F.] Kennedy?
Speaker 2: No.  Our family pretty much accepted the prevailing explanation.  But I will just introduce a little piece of humor from high school.  I even survived the 'Untouchables' which was the Puerto Rican gang on my block, on 13th Street.  When I first arrived, one of them asked me to make him a sandwich.  So I went upstairs, I said, I asked my aunt [Martha] and uncle [Jim] where, where the bread--I made a sandwich and I brought it down to him.  From that time on even though I looked like a nerd with my briefcase and you know, catching the Second Avenue bus to go to high school, I never had one moment of trouble with those guys.  They would harmonize on the corner every night.  I mean it was just like out of 'West Side Story' [American musical], but, but I did you know I had a, a very--pretty smooth high school existence in New York in the midst of many cultures.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In the midst of many cultures.
Speaker 1: Now did you, did, did you date in high school?  Did you have a, did you go to the prom or any of that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: I didn't go to the prom. I did, I did have a high school girlfriend and, and so we--dating was pretty much you know, plays.  I didn't date heavily but I did do some dating.  And living where I lived on the Lower East Side on 13th Street, I was able to walk four blocks and be at the 'Five Spot', and listen to 'Ross on Roland Kirk' in high school.  And I could listen to the Beatles, and I could go up to the Apollo [Theatre, Harlem, New York] and listen to James Brown.  So in high school I became a very avid jazz lover.  But I had a very eclectic you know, musical taste.
Speaker 1: Now Roland Kirk, I just thought we'd dwell on this for a second but you know tell us why Roland Kirk was unique.
Speaker 2: Well I was impressed by the fact that he played multiple instruments.  He came out playing three saxophones.  When we got to the 'Five Spot' that day--
Speaker 1: This was that one time, right?
Speaker 2: This is that one time, at one time.  We hear this sound from you know from kind of behind the curtain and out comes Roland Kirk playing as he, as he breaks the curtain.  Three saxophones you know and he moves up to the bandstand and continues his performance.  But, but that was life on the Lower East Side.  Kirk, I remember someone told me that [John] Coltrane [jazz music composer] was playing at 'Slug's'.  I got home, I got my uncle to give me a little money, I ran to the club.  Came in the club and there was--and literally stood by the--it was standing room only.  And I'm standing there with like sawdust on the floor listening to John Coltrane.  My wife and I caught Monk in Winston-Salem [North Carolina] but you know I grew up you know with giants.  You know with all of the hard boppers and Beboppers, even some big band.
Speaker 1: Yeah that really sounds exciting, you know.
Speaker 2: It was very exciting, you know and to go through high school, still have that type of culture in New York City.
Story_ID: 20670
Speaker 1: Now did you know your wife back in high school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Met her my last year of college [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay, well we're going, we're going to put this off.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we'll just go on to college, but all right now Harvard, we've already talked about your interview at the Harvard Club and what you thought of that and so shortly after you were accepted to Harvard [1964]--
Speaker 2: Shortly after I was accepted, Harvard sent me a reading list of the books I was supposed to complete over the summer before entering the freshman year.  About twelve books.  And so I, I began to pour through these books.  I remember some of them, Harrison Brown, 'The Challenge of Man's Future', [George] Schaller was 'The Mountain Gorilla', 'The Herring Gulls World' by [Niko] Tinbergen I believe was about behavior of herring gulls.  It was a very wide range of readings.
Speaker 1: These were the biology, a focus on biology?
Speaker 2: No, social services, 'The Population Bomb' was about you know the challenge, you know was about population growth and food supply.  So a lot of it was like world, you know, public health issues.  So I spent the summer priming tobacco [in North Carolina] and reading them.  Then I make my way up to Cambridge, Massachusetts
Speaker 1: Now was this your first time you know on campus at Harvard?
Speaker 2: It was, it was.  Got there and kind of found my dorm, Thayer, Thayer Hall and moved in.  Probably one of the most striking experiences socially was going to the Freshman Union because at that time, Harvard was still about 50 percent prep[aratory] school.  And so I kind of walked in there, Carmine and I were from Seward [High School].  At least I knew one person from high school.  I walked in and these groups of guys were rolling in from Andover [Phillips Academy Andover, Massachusetts] and from [Phillip] Exeter [Academy, Exeter, New Hampshire] and from Choate [Rosemary Hall, Walligford, Connecticut] and they had their own table in the Freshman Union you know and they'd be joking and laughing.  And so a lot of the prep guys you know they had seven or eight or ten people that they'd gone to prep school with and so you saw that camaraderie and then the public school guys like myself would kind of sit over to the side and, and you know we got to know each other.  But there were really a couple of cultures there.  I mean there were multiple cultures, but the prep school culture was really quite, quite strong at that time.  Now I made a lot of friends.  I mean you know that cultural divide was crossed in class and we really became--all of us became friends.  But most of the final clubs were still preppy, you know the Spee club, the Porcellian club, these were these very, very exclusive clubs, campus clubs that they called "final clubs" that some of the most prestigious of America's families supported and had their descendants pass through.  Those--while I was a student, we had the first African American, Frank Snowden, became the first African American member of a, of a, of a final club.
Speaker 1: Now Frank Snowden, is he the, is he the son of the Frank Snowden of Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia], the classicist?
Speaker 2: I think so, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah Frank Snowden was his son.  And I think my classmate Frank Snowden also is an expert in classics.  I think he published the book 'Blacks in Antiquity'.
Story_ID: 20671
Speaker 1: But my class [matriculating in 1964 at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] had thirty, fifteen African Americans, fifteen Africans out of a class of about 1,200.  And the next year the classes increased I think to about fifty.  And then Harvard really began to kind of move forward with increasing African American enrollment.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And when I was there I edited a--our journal called the 'Harvard Journal of Negro Affairs'.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was the editor for two years and I was a member of what we call AFRO, the Association of African and African American students at Harvard and Radcliffe [College, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Now was Archie Epps there?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, and Martin Kilson. To be honest with you, they were the only two that were there.  And so we met them and Martin Kilson really supported our journal out of his pocket.  He helped us to publish it.  I wish I'd brought one, it's a beautiful journal.  We had articles by Conor Cruise O'Brien [Irish politician and writer], we had some good writers.
Speaker 2: I know there, there's a famous story of Archie Epps sponsoring a debate with Malcolm X [African American human rights activist] on campus.  Were, were you there when--
Speaker 1: I wasn't, no I wasn't there.  Archie Epps was a very interesting persona, you know.  Kilson was the first tenured, black tenured professor at Harvard, in history, he was the first.  And over the years they have now finally put a portrait of him in the Faculty Club.  I think this is the first portrait of an African American in the Harvard Faculty Club.  Of course a lot of these have changed since the African American studies department, you know Skip Gates [Henry Louis Gates, Jr.] came and Cornel West and Appiah [Kwame Anthony Appiah]. Those guys, you know rolled in and really fleshed out the department.
Speaker 2: Do you remember Ewart Guinier?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Guinier kind of was--, he bridged, he was kind of the first and his, his daughter was in my class, Lani Guinier.  Have you met her?
Speaker 2: I have not, but I know, yeah I know--
Speaker 1: She's a professor at Harvard Law School now and you know she wrote the--she was up for the head of the Civil Rights Division and then they--her book, she had published a book called 'The Tyrrany of the Majority'.  And never got the confirmation.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So, so what was she like as a student?
Speaker 1: She was a very good student, activist, most of us were activists.  You know we--now I kind of preceded you know the takeovers.  We didn't take over any buildings or anything, but we were pretty active otherwise, short of that.
Speaker 2: I think the takeovers took place in the '60s [1960s], '67 [1967], '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Exactly, right after we left.  Lani was in that group that, that took over the dean's office and really--they really kind of forced the issue of African American studies at Harvard.  Got the department started and, and now it has you know one of the stronger departments in the country.
Story_ID: 20672
Speaker 1: Okay.  What--who were some of the other personalities there when you were, you were at Harvard?  Who did you--were you surprised who run into some certain people or--
Speaker 2: Well you know actually I--it's interesting.  When I was there, Robinson from Richmond, Virginia, Randall Robinson was in the law school.  He was--and I recall kind of you know meeting him crossing the campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He's, he's someone you didn't come into contact that much, right?
Speaker 2: Not that much and only later did I realize you know his accomplishments, you know.  I've now acquired all of his, all of his writings and you know and of course the history of TransAfrica and all the things that he accomplished, pretty impressive.  He, as you know Randall was very--had very strong positions, very, very strong positions.  And--but my, I had one other African American in my dorm named Elvin Montgomery, and he's a gentleman I've mentioned who is the appraiser.  He and his mother were--his family were--his mother was an educator in New Orleans [Louisiana] and he and I were in Fair South and so I eventually got to know all the fifteen.  One year behind me was Bobby Scott who is the congressman from Virginia, he was one year behind me.  And in his class was Tommy Lee Jones and Al Gore.  So I was crossing campus with all these, all these guys you know they were--at least three years we were there together.
Speaker 1: That's right I forgot about them.  Tommy Lee Jones--
Speaker 2: They were class of '69 [1969], we were class of '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so--
Speaker 2: But I, you know I was a fencer, I was on the fencing team and pretty much had a, a good college life.
Story_ID: 20673
Speaker 1: I, I would say that I spent a lot of time [while at Harvard University from 1964-1968] with the [American] Civil Rights Movement and focusing on you know the issues that--
Speaker 2: Now were these issues in the Boston [Massachusetts] area, or, or issues that, that would take you down south?
Speaker 1: Well some in the Boston area.  You may remember the mayor, Louise Day Hicks, he was the mayor of Boston at that time.  And there was a lot of polarization in Boston proper.  At that time I was tutoring at the Boy's, Boy's Club of Boston in, in Roxbury.  I was tutoring there which you know Roxbury's the African American community.  So I was working there and, and while I was pursuing my studies.
Speaker 2: Okay so, so were there organized efforts on the part of the students to you know, impact what was going on in Roxbury?
Speaker 1: Yeah there was some.  Yeah the students were pretty active.  You know we also SNCC [Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee; African American civil rights organization] on campus.  So in addition AFRO [Association of African and African American students], we had a number of other groups, student groups that were very much involved in the Civil Rights Movement, in South Africa, trying to--placing pressure on the university to divest of its holdings in South Africa.  So there was a lot going on with groups other than just AFRO at that time.
Speaker 2: Now was the President [unclear]?
Speaker 1: No, my President, my--I had Nathan Pusey, P-U-S-E-Y, Nathan Pusey.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Then he was succeeded by, by Bach and then of course Neil Rubenstein came, and Neil really increased African American enrollment.  He, he got Dean David Evans, and David was very instrumental in expanding black studies and increasing African American enrollment at the university.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So this was under Rubenstein's presidency.  [Ewart] Guinier came in under Bach.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then of course you know we got Skip Gates [Henry Louis Gates, Jr.] and Cornell West and we got a really stellar faculty [in the Department of African American Studies].
Story_ID: 20674
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now you were majoring in biology [at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: I was.
Speaker 1: As a pre-med student or had you--
Speaker 2: Not pre-med initially.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I became pre-, became pre-med the end of my sophomore year.  And part of it was influenced by the Vietnam War.  Staying in graduate school in just pure science, it was difficult to--whether one could get a student deferment was questionable.  So the way I handled Vietnam when the war--when a troop call-up occurred, I volunteered for Air Force ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] on campus.  I planned to go jet--to be a jet fighter.
Speaker 1: Okay now what, okay, go on.
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right tell us about the Air Force ROTC.
Speaker 2: When [President Lyndon] Johnson called up the troops I remember picking up the Harvard Crimson [Harvard University's daily newspaper], said President Johnson calls up 50,000 troops.  So I went to the Air Force and I joined ROTC and I called my father, of course remember I grew up building model planes.  So I called my dad and I told him I joined the Air Force.  I said, "Dad, it looks like I'm going to have to go to war, but I've decided that if I have to go to war, I want to fight from the sky, because if I get back I'll have a dry bed and hot food."  So I was all set to head off to Pensacola [Florida] to, to flight school and somehow they learned that I'd had a duodenal ulcer in high school, and that canned me from the flight program.  Okay so then I, I did not want to, to go into the infantry, so I began to look at career options.  And I said well you know I'm a pretty social guy.  I mean I, you know I, I, I'm involved in the [American] Civil Rights Movement, I said you know I might--I should get a good blend of science and people by looking at medicine.  So I thought it through and I said you know this may be a, a good career choice for me, and so I did.  So I chose medicine and ended up going--I was early accepted to UNC [University of North Carolina], Chapel Hill and went to Columbia [University] in New York, went to med [medical] school there.
Speaker 1: Now did you apply to Harvard Medical School?
Speaker 2: I did, I did and I was waiting listed at Harvard.  And the Columbia acceptance, it was the most incredible thing.  Dean George Pereira was kind of like the monarch of Columbia Medical School.  So one weekend I was in New York visiting my uncle and I, I went up to 168th Street, I had no appointment, and I called Columbia and I, I got the dean's office.  And so I--they put Pereira on the line.  He said, "well can you, can you come up for an interview?"  I went in for the interview on Friday and on Tuesday Pereira sent me an acceptance letter.  Just like that.  But I, I learned that Pereira was pretty much kind of--he was, he liked you know students who were Ivy League [universities] grads you know, and I'm sure that there were a lot of things that went into his assessment, but I was accepted and I had--there were three other African Americans in my class out of about 120.
Speaker 1: Well think about it, in those days there was a lot of pressure to you know, bring more minorities into schools.
Speaker 2: Some diversity, yes.
Speaker 1: Here's somebody, an Ivy League grad, you know, you don't have to really worry about his academics.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right and, and I think that was part of my early acceptance at UNC [University of North Carolina], my state school.  So I was--I had already planned to go to the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill for med school and of course when I got into Columbia, I loved New York so much.  You know I, I just became excited about getting back to New York City.  So to me that was--Columbia was a great fit, getting back to Manhattan, going to med school there.
Speaker 1: Columbia's right there near Harlem?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, and that's how I ended up doing my training at Harlem and doing a year of chief residency at Harlem.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20675
Speaker 1: How was medical school?  Was medical school what you expected it to be, or what were your expectations of it?
Speaker 2: Different culture.  Very formal, very regimented.  Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], you know Harvard was a pretty laid back campus you know I mean you had to study and you had to, you know, you had to take your examinations.  But college life is very different.  You know professional schools are very, very conservative and structured.  So that was, that was a bit of culture shock going from the undergraduate experience to the professional school experience.
Speaker 1: Let me go back.  Now you maybe thinking I'm going back too far but I did not ask you about who your mentors were at--you mentioned some of them at--back at J.J. Jones [High School] and then on through Seward Park [High School]. You know who were some of your mentors along the way?
Speaker 2: Okay at J.J. Jones I would say Earl Setzer because he was a science teacher.  Mr. Hargraves, my band leader was also my eighth grade teacher, was also a, a mentor.
Speaker 1: What did you play?
Speaker 2: I played trumpet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  But I've lost my embouchure over the years.  When I got to New York, Mr. Kessler who was my math teacher.  He taught--, all the math subjects I took with Kessler.  My chemistry, Shulack [ph.] and, and Mr. Shulack and Mr. Litwood [ph.].  And then I would probably say my Russian teacher, Esther Astrov [ph.].  They were kind of very close to my educational experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And at, at Harvard?
Speaker 2: At Harvard, Martin Kilson.  I mean Martin Kilson was kind of our refuge.  Any time we had a problem or a question, Kilson or Archie Epps were the people we would go to and I tell you I had an interesting freshman advisor.  His name was Chuma Azikiwe.  He was the son of the President of Nigeria.
Speaker 1: Nnamdi Azikiwe [President of Nigeria from October 1963 to January 1966; first president of independent Nigeria; Nigeria gained independence from the British in 1960].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  When I met Chuma I remember he had such a deep voice, full beard, very confident, C-H-U-M-A.  Very confident.  Chuma was at the [Harvard] Business School at the time.  Later on I met his brother Abbe [ph.] who trained with me at Harlem Hospital [New York] so it's interesting that I was with the Azikiwes pretty much through college and, and med [medical] school.  But I had Chuma Azikiwe as my advisor, and his younger brother Abbe Azikiwe and I were, were of the, in the same year during our internship and residency at Harlem Hospital.
Speaker 1: Okay, I didn't realize that Nnamdi Azikiwe's sons actually studied in the United States.  I mean, I'n not--, he did himself, you know so I guess it's not that surprising.  But I, I, I've never heard anyone mention his sons before.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's something, so Chuma Azikiwe.
Speaker 2: Yeah they were, they were important contacts of mine during, during college and medical training.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20676
Speaker 1: All right, okay so, so we were talking about your mentors at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and, and so did you have, well did Dr. [Martin] Kilson or Dr. Abslaka [ph.] [Dr. Chuma Azikiwe?] advise you to go to medical school at all, did they ever?
Speaker 2: They weren't involved in that part because you know they were really more in history, political science.  I--David Ragizon [ph.] who was a, he was a graduate student at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] was one of my section leaders in calculus.  I had some discussions with him in terms of career choices.  But they, I guess because it really wasn't in their fields, they didn't participate much in my career choice.  More, more classmates and students and some of my tutors at my--in Quincy House which was my upper-class house.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so you're going--was it a rigorous, professional, formal kind of a program at Columbia [University's Medical School, New York]--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in medical school.  And we know you did well, so I don't know if that's a good question or not, how did you do, but--
Speaker 2: It was interesting.  My first day of class I go into this dark amphitheater and this lady goes up to the podium, this professor.  Her name was Dr. Luce [ph.].  So she flashes a slide, she says, "Okay Lovell, you take this one."  She had memorized the names of all the class.  This was the first day in med [medical] school.  And so I, I took, I, I said, "Dr. Luce I think that is a (unclear)."  I had taken some ultra-structure at Harvard and I was right.  And of course the class goes "oooooh" because I'd gotten this correct.  But that was the way med school was.  I mean the--they knew you by name.  And if they saw you walking out of a lecture early, they would say--I remember I left--I thought I could do better studying biochem [biochemistry] on my own and my biochem professor says, "Doctor, are you sure you want to leave the review session?"  He caught me walking down the aisle, so I of course I stopped and sheepishly stayed in the review session.  But medical school, you know the classes are very small, very intimate, very rigorous and they're at that time it was the old medical hierarchy.  I mean attendings were gods.  I mean you literally--medical school and medicine was a rite of passage.  It was meant to be rigorous, it was meant to be almost unattainable.  The interaction with the professors was very formal, very different from college.
Speaker 1: Yeah the reverence for a doctor in New York City, I mean you, you know I don't know if--you know I see the stories of the woman that's scrubbing the steps and you know to send her son to medical school and he becomes a doctor.  He's sort of like a god, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes.  It really--I mean and you know the, the, the difficult call schedule we had back then.  They were meant to break you.  I mean if you made it through, I mean you; you earned the right to be called doctor then.
Speaker 1: What you're saying is--I've thought about this from time to time, that, that it's a, it's a certain amount of a hazing in that the way a doctor is scheduled to, you know the--I was wondering why would you--they have to work twenty-four hours a day without sleep and what is that about, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think there's an element of that that's in the process, yes.  Of course you often hear that it was cost, you know, expense.  But there was a, there was a--literally it was part of a ritual.
Story_ID: 20677
Speaker 1: Did you ever think that maybe it was, it's a misguided, you know when you consider the--that lives are at stake and you're--
Speaker 2: We've learned subsequently that it was misguided.  Studies have been done looking at EKG [electrocardiogram] interpretation and responses to emergency rooms that involved doctors who were tired and doctors who were not.  I mean there were more mistakes.  If you're exhausted, you made more mistakes.  So it was a, a, a--there was some decline in proficiency with those extreme levels of fatigue.  I never forget when I--after my first night on call I had had four or five admissions.  And I walked to the southwestern corner of Harlem Hospital [New York], into the staircase and I looked down Lenox Avenue and I said I'll never make it.  This was my first night; I said I don't think I can make it.  Well it turns out I saw the snow come.  Every morning I would go to that same staircase and look down the avenue.  Every time I was on call.  And then the snow passed and the spring came and before I knew it, I'd made it through internship and I was a first year resident.  But it was very rigorous.  It was, it was--as you know it's very different now.  There are rules, there are laws that control the amount of hours that doctors can work, in that, that residents and interns can work.
Speaker 1: Now you were at Harlem Hospital [New York].
Speaker 2: Harlem Hospital.
Speaker 1: And what is the, well it serves the black community of Harlem, but what was the, I guess the reputation of Harlem Hospital in those days?
Speaker 2: Harlem Hospital was a hospital that had extremely advanced disease states.  Most of the patients came in with diseases in very advanced states, unlike Columbia Presbyterian.  You know my clerkship was at Columbia Presbyterian.  At Harlem we saw everything.  You know we saw the complications of drug use.  We saw the complications of chronic alcoholism, you know we saw the chronic, the complications of, of, of poverty and hunger and malnutrition you know.  And so that was a--I went through under a Columbia affiliation, so my residency certificates have Columbia University on them.  So our training program was actually a part of Columbia's training program.  It had that academic nexus, so it was--so there was you know the academic rigor was really under the aegis of Columbia Medical School.  Columbia had at that time in the city Harlem Hospital, St. Luke's Hospital and Roosevelt that were part of the, the teaching hospitals.  And Francis Delafield which was a small cancer hospital just down Fort Washington Avenue from, from Columbia Presbyterian.  But I had my Department Chief was Jerry Thompson who was involved in developing hemodialysis with Eli Freeman at downstate, a real medical academician.  African American, a real--so he, he--Jerry Thompson set the set the standard for the Department of Medicine.  So we were, we were very proud to have him as our Department Chief and had a good experience there, it was hard work but I saw everything.  I saw disease states I've never seen in private practice.
Speaker 1: Okay so Harlem Hospital is right in the heart of Harlem, right across from the Schaumburg Library.
Speaker 2: It is now.  Back in that day it was across the street from three local bars, one of which was Maxus Angel [ph.].  That made the best contaminated fried chicken in the world.  But now Harlem is on the corner, as you know, of 135th and Lenox Avenue.  We have the famous Schaumburg Collection across the street.  That whole, that whole side of the street has really changed.  Well the whole face of Harlem has changed.
Speaker 1: Okay so on that side of the street where Schaumburg is now was a--you said there was a chicken place and bar.
Speaker 2: There was a series of bars and the residents, we would go there and they would take whole chickens and drop them in this grease which we thought was never changed.  And they would bring them out and take a meat cleaver and cleave that chicken and cover it with pepper and salt and give us a grape soda, and we would go back to the resident's lounge and have a party.  It was so good, so unhealthy, but so good.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so did, did you ever attend any, any notable people?  You know I don't know that's--so many notable residents of Harlem, but you have any stories?
Speaker 2: Yeah you know I don't--I'm trying to recall.  I don't' recall any individual you know, like Adam Clayton Powell or any of the notables of that stature from that time, but I'm sure they came through, I'm sure they came through.  But I do remember when we got our first dialysis machine.  Before we got that machine, kidney failure was a fatal condition.  But just before the patient died, they lived on a diet of butterballs and sugar.  Literally they would be served a plate with ice cream scoops of butter; butterballs covered with sugar because remember the kidneys cannot excrete protein.  And protein was felt to cause the uremic poisoning.  And so the patients literally lived on that, for a short period of time.  And then we had this--
Speaker 1: Well they didn't live long.
Speaker 2: Didn't live long.  So we got a dialysis machine and then we had to deal with the ethical challenge of how do we use such a limited resource in a community the size of Harlem?
Speaker 1: You had one machine?
Speaker 2: We started with one machine.  Looked like an old Maytag washing machine where the nurses would dump fluid into it.  So that's how I do remember the arrival of dialysis at Harlem Hospital which changed the face of treating kidney failure as you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So at some point you become chief resident, right, at Harlem Hospital?
Speaker 2: I did.  After I finished my, my second year residency I was offered the chief residency, and did a year of chief residency.  I'd already been accepted to CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia] at that time.  And so I did one extra year of chief residency and then headed down to CDC.  Now the chief position really we run the medical department as you know, we schedule--we make the schedule, we cover the wards, we cover the clinics, we cover the--we make all the schedules and, and basically keep the service running.  We set up the educational conferences, the--and so on.
Story_ID: 20678
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when, when you were at Columbia [University, New York], I know you were in the medical school, but that was when, when--'68 [1968] is when the students took over the campus, you know, the anti-war [Vietnam War] movement was at, at the, at its height.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of that?
Speaker 2: I remember it but when I say medical school is rigid, we didn't really think of getting involved in it.  Dean Periera was so conservative that he would remind students that they should not get involved.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So we, you know we, we remained very much aware of, of the social issues but we did not get involved in demonstrations or any activist activities at that time.
Story_ID: 20679
Speaker 1: Okay so in '75 [1975] you're the chief resident at Harlem Hospital [New York].  In '76 [1976] you moved to Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Moved to Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Now how did that come about?  I mean by, by this time you're considered a, an epidemiologist, right?
Speaker 2: Well I, I became a--I got my epidemiology training at CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Dr. Brockman [ph.] who was--I remember one day the announcement was made that Dr. Brockman from CDC was visiting Harlem Hospital and that he would like to interview any residents who might be interested in doing a tour of duty at the CDC.  And so I made an appointment, went down and met Dr. Brockman and shortly thereafter was offered a, a position in the Epidemic Intelligence Service.  So I signed on to join the EIS [Epidemic Intelligence Service] after my chief residency, which is an--which is what I did.  So I moved down for my training in Atlanta in 1976.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  This is Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta.  So well tell us about, you know--
Speaker 2: About CDC?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: CDC--the Epidemic Intelligence Service of CDC was a very prestigious appointment.  You know it had been developed out of the perception of a need to have highly trained individuals who could do surveillance for not only disease within the population, but biological warfare activities as well.  So we received excellent training in epidemiology in the Epidemic Intelligence Service.  I chose to--we had a choice of either staying in Atlanta or going into the field and I chose to move to the State Health Department in Richmond, Virginia and be in the field services.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So now was there a, a--what were some of the concerns I guess of the, of the government in terms of epidemic, you know, clandestine you know or, or warfare using germs and --
Speaker 2: When I was there, I'll be honest, that never really entered my professional life.  I mean I knew that I was trained; we were trained to do surveillance.  So when I was in Richmond, I got all of the state, all of the reports came in from the health departments and from the state lab.  And so I looked at the types of bacteria and fungi that were being cultured and I knew how to identify an aberration or a, a--the appearance of a, of a, of an infectious agent that does not normally occur in Virginia; so we were trained to do that, but it wasn't really a, an emphasis in the EIS.  Most of our attention was on surveillance within the population for diseases that occurred not at the hands of, of a foreign, of a foreign agent.  But the training--my time at CDC really helped to solidify my, my public health perspective.  It gave me that nice blend of medicine and population medicine and disease prevention.  And remember it was only a few months after I left active duty that I wrote the letter to the editor of Virginian-Pilot [newspaper] that resulted in, in the legislation paying for, for pneumonia vaccine.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now just to--would I be correct in saying that preventive medicine was something that wasn't really discussed much in those days.
Speaker 2: Not very much in medical training at all.  Your public health rotation was really, it was almost known to be not important, that you didn't have to worry about your grade, you made a few field trips and you passed public health.  I mean that was--it was kind of viewed to be kind of a gut course, an easy course in medical school.  CDC and my tour duty in the United States Public Health Service really changed that perspective totally and gave me the ability to view the behavior of diseases in populations and to look at strategies for impacting populations.  And that's why it made no sense to me that, that Medicare would not pay for a vaccination.
Story_ID: 20680
Speaker 1: It says here in '78 [1978] you launched a private practice called York Clinical Research in Norfolk [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: No, in '78 [1978] I, in '78 [1978] I launched my, my medical practice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'd only been doing research for about ten years, so I was, I joined a three man group initially, and then I practiced solo as, as a, an internist for a number of years.  Then about ten years ago I began to do clinical research as well as private practice.  But there were a couple of professional experiences that kind of shaped my perspective on medicine.  I joined a group called the 'Vascular Biology Working Group', which was a, kind of a, an academic national working group.  Actually there were probably some international members.  And we focused on things that made arteries become diseased, things that caused hardening of the arteries and arthrosclerosis.  So we began to look at the, the, the micro-, the molecular biological underpinnings of vascular disease.  So the Vascular--VBWG, Vascular Biology Working Group.  Then I joined an organization called COSEHC, the Consortium for Southeastern Hypertension Control.  This was formed by a former Argentinean called Carlos Ferrario [ph.] who is a, a, who is a researcher of international stature, who arrived in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and noticed the prevalence of stroke, predominantly among African Americans, but among Caucasian Americans as well.  And then of course the southeastern U.S. at that time was known as the 'Stroke Belt'.  So Carlos says, "We should form an organization to get rid of the Stroke Belt."  So the consortium is a, is a consortium of doctors in the southeastern U.S. from Maryland around to Texas and then some of the border states.  And our--and what we did was we focused on the cultural attributes, the culture of the South.  The types of foods southerners ate, the salt content, the prevalence of obesity.  So we, we would meet every year and we talked about the epidemiology of vascular disease in the southeast.  And we developed strategies to impact that.
Speaker 1: Now, now did you--now was this done prior to '78 [1978]?  These, these organizations.
Speaker 2: No, these were after I finished the CDC [Centers of Disease Control and Prevention], so all of this occurred after 1981.  So all--this occurred over the years in private practice.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 20681
Speaker 1: I didn't want to skip over those--the letter [to the editor of the Virginian-Pilot].  You know we, we need to--
Speaker 2: Yeah so when I made the transition--you kind of want to go back to when I left CDC and then entered private practice, that period, or-
Speaker 1: Well they had it on the outline here like preceding the letter that you had formed it, so--the private, your private practice before you wrote the letter.
Speaker 2: Yeah now I had just entered private practice when I wrote the letter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Remember the letter was written in 1978, in the fall of '78 [1978].  I left the CDC and I left Richmond in July of '78 [1978].  I'd just started practice and I was excited about this vaccine and I wanted to immunize my elderly patients.
Speaker 1: Okay you're a young doctor, thirty-one years old.
Speaker 2: Just leaving the public health service, wanted to use the skills and the knowledge I had obtained in public health service to start treating my patients.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I was told by Medicare [national social insurance program in the United States] you can't do that, we won't pay for that.  And so then came the letter.
Speaker 1: Okay so why did you decide to write a letter to the Virginia Pilot, with the hopes that someone would see it that, that--
Speaker 2: I didn't think anyone would see it.  I just wanted to voice my opinion and I continue to write newspapers today.  I mean I, I write letters to the editor just to voice my opinion.  I never really expect anything to come of it and quite frankly, I was shocked when I got a call from the office of Congressman Whitehurst asking if they can meet with me.  It was totally unexpected; but that, that whole experience kind of regenerated my, my--some confidence in the system.  That there are people out there you know that the system can work because you know I was very cynical at that point.  You know coming out of the [American] Civil Rights Movement.  I mean there was, there was a lot of cynicism and I, I really didn't expect anything to come out of it except to vent, my personal venting.
Speaker 1: Okay so this is--Congressman Whitehurst and so William, G. William Whitehurst.
Speaker 2: G. William Whitehurst.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was his reputation then?
Speaker 2: He had a very strong reputation.  He was, as you know he was a Republican.  He was a professor of history at Old Dominion University [Norfolk, Virginia].  He--Congressman Whitehurst was kind of a boots on the ground type congressman.  If he saw a problem, he would try to address the problem.  And, and you know it's interesting, he took it--I don't know what discussions took place behind the scenes, but to me I always felt that he was genuine, he, he saw, he saw this as a problem that needed correcting.  And he engaged it and stuck with it for the, for the duration.  And you saw the letter.  And it was just--to me it was a remarkable period of my history.  Working, having this Congressman hear the voice of a citizen and take it through the legislative process, get the studies to support it and then to take it through the legislative process.  And then --
Speaker 1: Interesting the letter indicated basically that it was sort, sort of apology.  We're sorry, but we don't do this kind of thing.  In, in--
Speaker 2: From Medicare.
Speaker 1: Medicare doesn't cover--
Speaker 2: Yes, preventive services.
Speaker 1: Preventive services at all, so--
Speaker 2: We don't cover preventive services.  And to me you know trying to live my life as a logical person, it, it was--it made no sense.
Speaker 1: So, so did Congressman White, well Whitehurst call you over to his office?
Speaker 2: He and his wife actually came by my office one afternoon.  And I met both of them and he talk--he asked me to, to kind of tell him more about the problem and I explained it.  And I didn't know that he was going to go forward with it and that I'd get that next letter where he tells me that he has written Medicare.  And then I get the letter where he sends me a copy of the letter.  He enclosed that copy from this [unclear], which stated Medicare's position.  And then he continued and, and then we changed the entire focus of Medicare.
Speaker 1: I think it's interesting to point out--
Speaker 2: The entire focus of Medicare.
Speaker 1: Okay I think it's interesting to point out that he comes to visit a young doctor who's got a big afro, giant afro, a big, full beard, I saw your picture.  I mean you don't look the way you look today.  You look more conservative today than you did then.
Speaker 2: I tried to find a picture of, of our handshake with my big afro and my full beard and I haven't been able to locate that.  But that's right, he came right into--right onto Church Street and came up to my office.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So other than the fact that you were a doctor, you looked like any number of young, young black men in those days, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah I, I certainly didn't have the clean cut look, you've seen that.
Speaker 1: Yeah was he surprised to see that you were, you were a black doctor and that you were, you know?
Speaker 2: No he wasn't surprised and I--he probably, you know where I, where my office was located, he probably knew that that was primarily you know, a, a black community.  So I, I'm sure that he suspected I was African American.  But he came up, he came right back to my office and we talked about vaccination and, and the fact that over, over, over decades you know, actually centuries, vaccination has been proven to be life-saving.  Back to the days of [Edward] Jenner and small pox; back to the days of [President] John Adams, you know and so you know and he's a logical man and he, I think he just looked at the facts and moved on them.  And my impression is that when the savings became apparent in addition to the, the life savings and the, the monetary savings, and the life savings, it was kind of win/win.  I mean it would be kind of hard to, to take a position against that.
Speaker 1: Okay now did you have to--where you called upon to testify before a Congressional Committee or anything?
Speaker 2: No I was not, I was not.  I think the, the Office of Technology Assessment pretty much armed him with the, with the key data that he needed.  You know it would save lives and, and save money to, to take the preventive approach.  And it's gratifying to see that now Medicare emphasizes prevention.  Even now pays for preventive physical examination.  So over the years following 1980, additional preventive health services have been rolled out.
Speaker 1: Okay so this, this is actually the first--like you said the first time Medicare--
Speaker 2: Has paid for preventive health services.
Speaker 1: --preventive health services.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  That, that is a milestone so--and today I think we were discussing earlier that today a, a much larger portion of Medicare spending is spent for pre-, prevention than for--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --anything else.
Speaker 2: Yeah and those--all of those services are available on the Internet.  Congressman Whitehurst and I in 1981 shared the annual award of the Virginia Lung Association for our, for the, the passage of the Pneumovax reimbursement legislation.
Story_ID: 20682
Speaker 1: Okay so this is 1981 when you and Congressman [G. William] Whitehurst share the American Lung Association's annual award [for the passage of the Pneumovax reimbursement legislation].  So now where do things go from there?  Now did you become a--
Speaker 2: Well it's interesting.  I continued to practice and then I was contacted by a city councilwoman in Chesapeake named Willa Basemoore [ph.] and she asked me if I would serve on the Board of Medicine.  And I told her I would if I were appointed.  And so I--while I was practicing, I spent nine years, two terms on the Board of Medicine.
Speaker 1: This is from 1993?
Speaker 2: I was president in '93 [1993].
Speaker 1: Okay so you started serving earlier.
Speaker 2: I think it was eighty, I think it was '86 [1986] to '95 [1995].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Were the, were the nine years.  And then I was first, I was elected the first African American president of the Virginia Board of Medicine in 19-, 1993.  It was really that that got me the Leadership Award with Dominion was the president, the first African American presidency.
Speaker 1: Now was that--so was Virginia ready for that when you became the--
Speaker 2: I think it was.  You're actually elected by the rest of the board members, and so I had served on the board a term and they had seen my approach to analyzing issues.  And, and voting on issues.  And so they, they decided to elect me president.  I was honored to spend a year doing that.  It's usually just one year, it, it rotates year after year and so it was a, another great, gratifying experience because you know you--this, this gives you a, a view of, of health regulation.  At CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], I got the view of public health and population medicine.  Then of course at Columbia [University Medical School, New York] I already been steeped in individual medical practice.  So I was getting a very, a much more sophisticated and comprehensive view of, of all of the, all of the elements of modern medicine.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now you were nominated by Tommy Thompson to serve as Secretary for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services--no, no, no, no, no, I'm sorry, to become a member of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee by Tommy Thompson.
Speaker 2: That's correct, yes.  Now this is interesting.  When I was nominated, I thought that they invited me because they knew of the role I had played in getting vaccination reimbursed.  None of them knew that.  And this is why I was, you know this is why when you, when we were talking about HistoryMakers before, this was jut a piece of history that had just kind of dropped out.
Speaker 1: They did not know about your involvement in that.
Speaker 2: At all.
Speaker 1: So did they tell you what criteria they were using?
Speaker 2: One of them told me that someone else had claimed it, someone else that he knew had claimed it.  Had claimed the role of, of getting vaccines paid for.  So none of that was--I thought that was the most interesting but not totally surprising, phenomenon.  And then when I got the invite from HistoryMakers I said you this is, this is really an opportunity to set the record straight.  And then--and to provide HistoryMakers with the letters and documentation from Whitehurst and Medicare.  It literally walks you through the process.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In an unmistakable way.
Speaker 1: Now in 2006 your internal medicine practice was designated a Cardiovascular Center of Excellence by the Consortium for Southeastern Hypertension Control.
Speaker 2: That's correct.  The same organization that I mentioned that's devoted to breaking up the 'Stroke Belt' and to controlling those risk factors for stroke, formed a Centers of Excellence Program.  And to get that, you, you have to have some academic connections, you have to demonstrate community service, you have to demonstrate community outreach, you need some research experience.  So they, they basically enumerated the requirements for that designation.  Now initially they would not designate any practices smaller than four doctor practices.  Then they evolved to say well, we should develop what's called Cardiovascular Practices of Excellence.  They started off as Centers of Excellence.  So once they agreed to take groups of four and smaller in, then I became eligible.  And I was one of the first Cardiovascular Practices of Excellence designated by COSEHC [Consortium for Southeastern Hypertension Control].
Story_ID: 20683
Speaker 1: Okay let's just kind of talk about here most of your career has been centered around three diseases that, that are--three diseases, they're non-communicable diseases that African Americans have and Africans share.
Speaker 2: Yes sir.  It--you know I--over the years I've always had a report card for myself and I graded myself an F for any stroke that my patients sustained, any heart attack, and if a kidney failure, okay because I knew that these clinical end points that conferred pain and suffering and shortened life expectancy were largely driven by three diseases; hypertension, type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.  And so I've always--in, in my private practice when my patients came in the exam room we always talked about salt restriction, exercise, compliance with medication and all of our goals were driven by guidelines.  We practiced evidence-based medicine.  So I wanted all of my patients to, to age without major disability of paralytic stroke or congestive heart failure.  So--and COSEHC [Consortium for Southeastern Hypertension Control] of course emphasized the, the importance of treating these three disease states.  Now over the years I've been to Africa four times and over the years I have, I've had a chance to round at hospitals in Uganda, I rounded in the two largest hospitals in Ghana, Komfo Anokye in Kumasi and Karle bu in Accra.  I met a lot of the physicians in Ghana.  And I said you know there's a brain drain that's taking place in Africa.  A lot of African physicians are educated and then are recruited to the West.  There is limited manpower.  There's limited healthcare funding.  So is there an opportunity to address some of these unmet needs?  And so I founded the 'Three Diseases Project' with the purpose of, of treating three diseases; hypertension, diabetes and cholesterol.  We already had resources of the [Bill and Melinda] Gates Foundation going out to a lot of the infectious diseases in Africa but I wanted to focus on non-communicable diseases that drive expensive cardiovascular end points.  And the additional impetus was that a lot of the treatments that we have here, we have bypass surgery, we have stints.  In many African countries there are no stints.  In Ghana there is no interventional cardiology, there are no stints.  Bypass is essentially unavailable when you look at the numbers.  There's no dialysis to speak of, (unclear) kidney disease is the kiss of death.  Stroke rehab[ilitation], minimal.  No heart transplants for heart failure.  No resynchronization therapy for heart failure.  So what can you do?  Okay if you don't have the resources to treat those end points, focus on prevention.  If you can bring down blood pressure, bring down blood sugar, bring down cholesterol, then you could prevent all those expensive end points that there are no resources to handle.  So the Three Diseases Project, the mission is to lower blood pressure, lower blood sugar, lower cholesterol to prevent heart attack, heart failure, stroke and kidney failure.  What's different is we're going to leverage the project with information technology.  With the internet, with cell phones, with telemedicine and introduce an electronic medical record, a rudimentary electronic medical record to track individuals.  So what we want to do is to--the project will seek the support of the medical community in the countries that we want to operate in.  Insert our product in the medical community to supplement and complement what the overstrained doctors are trying to do.  They're still primarily doing one-on-one like I'm trying to do.  The Three Diseases Project is totally a population-based strategy.  Different from the individual strategy, but population-based and evidence-based.  And so that is in addition to doing my research now, my part-time practice, I'm spending a lot of time developing the Three Diseases Project.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which we hope to launch in Ghana, maybe Nigeria and then there are many African countries that have even greater needs.  But the concept of the project can be used in Central America, South America.  The same diseases drive the same end points.  And where you see westernization and the gradual overtaking of infectious disease by non-communicable diseases, you're going to see this, this need.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So those--that's kind of the, the--my population view on cardio-metabolic disease.  You know population views have been primarily used with infections diseases.  This is to my mind's eye, this is a somewhat unique approach to cardio-metabolic disease and non-communicable disease, this population strategy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you mentioned the southeast United States as being the 'Stroke Belt'.  What contributes to it being the Stroke Belt?
Speaker 2: High fat diet, you know we love pork, ham and all the pork products, I grew up on that.  High sodium diet and the prevalence of obesity.  And you know obesity contributes to insulin resistance and insulin resistance contributes to the development of Type 2 diabetes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course sedentary lifestyle, lack of exercise is a major contributor as well.
Speaker 1: Okay now are these conditions duplicated in West Africa too, in the cities of West Africa?
Speaker 2: They are.  And matter of fact, with movement you know to the, to the cities, you see, you're starting to see the emergence of calorie dense foods in Africa, fast foods.  You see people taking the more sedentary jobs.  So a lot of the same trends we're seeing evolve in West Africa that evolved in the United States decades ago.  And so looking at the unmet needs there in terms of manpower and advanced technological medicine, we have to do this.  I mean otherwise dialysis patients, a kidney failure patient dies.  But if we use the population approach and keep from getting kidney failure, we can keep them alive.  If we can lower blood pressure and prevent stroke and heart failure even though we don't have transplants, artificial hearts like we have here, we can keep a greater portion of the population alive, allow them to build a country, to become employed and to contribute to development.
Speaker 1: Okay this--it sounds to me just from the outside this is an educational challenge to educate the people to actually change cultural practices that--when you're trying to change cultural practices amongst people that don't have that much access to education, necessarily--
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is where the telemedicine and tele-education comes in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We'll be developing culture sensitive education modules and if necessary, to specific languages where we will be able to play videos to talk about local diet and exercise.  And the importance of taking medicine.  So we--the Three Diseases Project will be treating the disease with medicine, but a major part will be the educational part that focuses on lifestyle, diet and so on.  Now not to be naive, the dietary choices are not the same as we have here.  A lot of individuals are locked into high carbohydrate diets because of money, poverty.  So we'll have to work within some restraints that are conferred by poverty and, and unavailability of desired foods and desired food categories.  It will be a, you know it will be a challenge but if you know the elements you can develop a strategy that should be effective.
Story_ID: 20684
Speaker 1: Okay I mean today as we sit here the First Lady Michelle Obama has launched a--spearheaded a program to improve fresh food content in school, public school diets, right.
Speaker 2: It's way overdue.  We've known, we've known for a couple of decades that calorie dense foods were being introduced into the public schools.  And I'm not going to mention any names, but we know what calorie dense foods are, so the pop, pizza, you know high carb, high fat food choices.  And but you know there have been economic incentives in terms of money that came along with the arrival of those foods.  Well to me there's always been a bioethical issue here that has remained unaddressed, but not to go there.  We've know that these foods were there, we know that childhood obesity is epidemic.  We know that 35 percent of children now have Type 2 diabetes when it used to be all Type 1.  So we've watched our children become obese, we've watched them become diabetic and we've turned our backs on the school diets, on the lack of exercise, on the removal of physical education from the public schools.  I mean we--it's almost like we have just turned our backs on a vast evidence base that tells us we're doing the wrong thing.  So to have the First Lady [of the United States, Michelle Obama] take this on to me is great.  You know a lot of countries are judged by the health of the children of those countries, you know.  Childhood mortality, infant mortality all have been metrics for years of, of the status of the healthcare of a country.  And to me--, and you may tell from my voice I've taken this personally.  For the public health authorities to, to watch what we have observed in the United States with our state of knowledge to me is inexcusable.
Speaker 1: Give me an example, a sense of--I know we talked earlier about how busy you were as a youth, you know getting up before day in the morning and delivering papers and doing all that before you went to school and what's an example--what's a typical week for you, or now, like--
Speaker 2: What I do now is I, I do private practice Monday, Wednesday, Friday morning, Tuesday, Thursday afternoon, four hours.  Then I get in my car and I come here and I do clinical research for twenty hours a week.  Now I do research that ranges from health effectiveness studies, you know which is kind of the trend nationally.  Is this treatment effective?  To drug development, you know we also develop new diabetes treatments and new insulins.  So I do that twenty hours a week.  I still am on the faculty of the Eastern Virginia Medical School [Norfolk, Virginia], so I, I have students come by the office and, and, and introduce them to ambulatory care.  And I serve on a number of boards, the Sentara Healthcare Board being one which is the board that runs our integrated health, healthcare system.  I get up at 4:30 to 5:00 [O'clock], I stream a little jazz in the morning and grind my coffee beans and make my coffee.  I go to the gym every morning.  My first stop every morning is the gym.  So I work out Monday through Saturday.  One exception is Sunday morning.  I work out Monday through Saturday, on Saturday I go to the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  And then from there either to my practice or to research depending on the day of the week.  It's a full schedule and then of course I get home at night, I work on the Three Diseases Project [Lovell's health initiative to combat hypertension, diabetes and cholesterol in Africa].  So I'm also reviewing the literature, you know posting the evidence base on the internet to, to argue for my project and I feel very strongly about having a very strong academic and research argument on the site to show why the project is necessary, it should be effective.  And so--and I end the night streaming a little bit more jazz and that's pretty much an average workweek.
Story_ID: 20685
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, now you had started to tell us a little bit of--earlier in the interview, how you and your wife met.  Now how did you all meet?
Speaker 2: Okay I, I had gone home for the Christmas holiday and my girlfriend at that time, I think she was angry with me.  So my first cousin Debbie and I, decided to go to a disco-tech in Winston-Salem [North Carolina] called the 'Dungeon Club'.  So I'm in the Dungeon Club dancing with my first cousin and I see these, these four students come, these four ladies come in.  And so I told my cousin I was going to go and ask one of them to dance.  So I go over and I meet my wife Barbara and I say let's dance.  And so it was Gladys Knight 'I Heard it Through the Grapevine'.  So she gets on the dance floor with me and we dance.  And so then I, I joined her at the table and we talked.  And that Christmas I told my mother that I had met this young lady.  She was still at Winston-Salem State [University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] at that time, they hadn't let out for the Christmas holidays.  So I asked my mother if, if I could invite her up over the holidays to, to spend some time with us.  So my mother called her mother and they had this conversation.  My mother said well if she can come up, she's my daughter.  So the two mothers arranged for Barbara to come up and spend part of the Christmas holidays with me.  So then, so that's how we met.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's how we met.  And she finished college, taught in Wilson, North Carolina.  Then she got her law degree at Rutgers [University, New Brunswick, New Jersey] and then she moved to New York and we--and we've been together.  That's how it was played out, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now do you have children?
Speaker 2: I do, I have a daughter.  And she is with Bank of America, yeah and she is in marketing there.  And I have a little granddaughter who is going on three.  And she's spoiled by her father's family, my family, by everyone.  And I'm in the process now of making her, making science fun for her, for my granddaughter.
Story_ID: 20686
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: One of my greatest hopes is that we will reconnect to our culture that has allowed us to survive untold hardships for centuries.  And our culture is a culture of dignity, respect for parents and grandparents, respect for teachers, respect for each other.  So my concern is that we've lost a lot of that and my hope is that we can regain it because the value, the survival value of those attributes have been unmistakably demonstrated by the fact that we're still here.  On a lesser note but important, I want us to--I would like for young African American to know who Thelonious Monk is or John Coltrane or Cannonball Adderly or Duke Ellington.  It disturbs me that a form of music that was born in the United States to a large extent developed by African Americans, is being lost.  It's being consumed by another culture.  And now I mean we've always had many different forms of music evolve and that's--and you know and gosh, we have an incredible history of creating musical forms.  But, but some of our--jazz in particular comes to mind because sometimes I'll ask a young person you know, do you know who Monk is or do you know who, you know do you know who Oscar Peterson is and most of them don't know.  What I would hope is every Saturday morning I have a reading club at my church.  I bring the neighborhood kids in, I go to the gym from eight to nine, eight to eight-thirty, I show up at my church at nine [O'clock] with another lady and we read literature.  We are starting--we just finished 'Of Mice and Men' and we're starting 'Animal Farm'.  And I bring the kids in, some of whom who are having a lot of trouble reading that have, have been designated special ed[ucation] and they come in and say--their friends will say well he can't read and I always say she can read.  So we bring them up--we read with them word-by-word-by-word-by-word.  And after a while they begin to read.  And their grades go up in school.  So probably the most organized institution in the African American community today is the church.  And I think that we are not leveraging the organization that the churches confer to teach African American history, to step in where the public school systems leave off on reading and, and mathematics and other forms of education.  I would like to see all the [unclear] interdenominational organization devoted to educating black children.  Not just black children, but any children.  But I'm speaking of black children now because your question was regarding the African American community.  Like the, like Hebrew school.  Teach them about Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane.  Don't say well criticize the schools because they don't do it.  Well you can criticize them, but at the same time we have a structure in place that could make a major contribution in these areas.  And that's the churches, and we need interdenominational organization and a commitment and a will to rediscover the values of the traditional African American community, respect, integrity, dignity, and to educate to pick in where the school--pick up where the schools drop off.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm just doing a little piece of it.
Story_ID: 20687
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently now if you could?
Speaker 2: You know it's--I don't think so.  I thought about staying in public health service, and I could have stayed at CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention].  But I kind of like the fact that I, I think I've done a lot of good in practice.  The strokes that occur in my practice you can count on one hand over my entire career.  I don't have strokes.  My diabetics don't have amputations.  And I would like to believe that that's because I am treating them to goals and guidelines and I'm making a difference.  The--I have been, I have enjoyed a lot of privilege in my life.  I mean I've worked hard and I come from pretty humble beginnings, but I, I've had the privilege of having family members there to advise me and to stand by me at critical decision making points in my life.  I've had the privilege to go into some of the best educational institutions in the country, in the world.  I've had the privilege of going to serve in the Epidemic Intelligence Service [at the CDC] and acquiring a public health perspective.  So quite frankly I can't think of things I would have differently.  They have kind of rolled out in a certain sequence and I'm not sure what would have happened if I had changed that sequence.  So I'm still you know, in the struggle, I still want to impact cardio-metabolic disease in West Africa.  I think I have the--I have the educational and experience infrastructure to take it on.
Story_ID: 20688
Speaker 1: I'll just form it as I ask the question.  I wanted to ask you this question.  How, how do you convince your patients to change their lifestyles I guess to, to a more healthy lifestyle.  I know a lot of us have tried, it's not--it doesn't seem to be that easy.
Speaker 2: I do it by example.  I go into them and I tell my patients I don't ask you to do anything that I don't value enough to do myself.  Now patients know I exercise six days a week.  They know that I have a spiritual dimension.  I tell them they have to have some spirituality, their choice.  But for me I go to church on Sunday morning, it's a great experience for me.  And I don't smoke cigarettes, they never smell tobacco on me or smoke.  And we discuss diet.  So I think that when I stand in front of them and they know what I'm doing, that they respect it.  So I, I always have literature in the office for them.  When they leave I tell them anything on that counter or on that bookcase that you want, take it home.  Dietary material, exercise material.  I get every DVD and CD that the representatives provide.  So I always have resources that they can take, but I think the strongest resource is the fact that I do what I ask them to do.
Speaker 1: What's the toughest to change, diet or exercise regimen, or attitude?
Speaker 2: You know what?  I'll tell you they're both tough, they're both tough and--but I do know that to be successful with exercise you have to find a time of day that doesn't compete with other activities.  So I, I, I share my solution with my patients.  I'm in the gym at six and out by seven.  So go early in the morning because by the time you finish, the world hasn't awakened until you've finished your workout.  I tell them that at the end of the day you're either tired or you're burned out, or there's one more thing to do that always seems to encroach on your exercise time.  So I give them tips, early morning exercise.  And I leave very simple messages, no seconds, stay away from things which are white, you know, go for the complex carb rather than the simple carbs and no more than two fried meals per week.  Look at your food content, calculate your calories per day, calculate your sodium intake per day.  Be very much aware--and I encourage home blood pressure monitoring.  So most of my patients have their own blood pressure cuffs at home.  I developed a sheet that they bring to me when they come for their visits that has a list of their blood pressures and if they're diabetic, their blood sugars.  And I'm trying to push the country, the companies to make more of this downloadable.  I'm very much attuned to leverage technology, developing apps [applications] that patients can use for their exercise reminders, apps for dietary reminders.  You know let's, let's embrace what we know the trends are.  Everyone has a smart phone.  How can we use that to encourage taking meds, to encourage exercise, to encourage diet?  So I want to you know really use modern IT [information technology] to supplement the traditional doctor-patient interaction, and to use the public health authorities to, to provide additional educational input.

Speaker 1: Okay.  We always ask this question too.  When you look back on everything you've done to this point and you've received numerous awards where you can look at the record, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy is transforming Medicare.  The office that is responsible for healthcare of the elderly and the disabled.  From a philosophy of treatment to a philosophy of prevention.  And according to the numbers over the time since the law was enacted, depending upon the estimates that OTA [Office of Technology Assessment]--if we look at the upper range of the estimates, the introduction of Pneumovax [vaccine against pneumococcal agents] has saved almost two million lives, 1.722 million lives.  I think that's a legacy.
Story_ID: 20690
Speaker 1: Okay and the last question we ask, now is there anything we haven't asked you that I need to ask before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: You know I think that we've pretty much covered the main issues, I think we have.  I would like to as far as my, my kind of my personal avocation, I would just like to say that my personal interest now and I have a couple of friends that I enjoy this with, is understanding the relationship between the evolution of science and the evolution of mathematics.  I, I'm fundamentally a scientist, but when we look back, we know that the calculus was developed by [Isaac] Newton because of the need to, to model planetary motion.  So we've had math pushing science and we've had science dragging math.  And so I would like to gain reasonable mastery over those disciplines of mathematics that have been proven to be necessary for modern reality.  I'm trying to model reality.  Now that's kind of what I do for fun and besides streaming jazz.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you were also, and I thought I'd raise this too because you were discussing this that you have quite a library of black history and that you, you actually can--in fact I was asked to ask you about this and I, I guess it's a good time as other to try to give us a capsule history of blacks at Harvard Medical School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Well at Harvard Medical School as you know, the first black was Harold Delaney, was--
Speaker 1: Martin
Speaker 2: Martin Delaney.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I have a cousin named Harold Delaney.  Please excuse the slip there.  As you know the, the enrollment has increased over the years.  Delaney was initially expelled because of the opposition of the southern members of the class, along with the first female who had been admitted.  And this was under the, the deanship of Oliver Wendell Holmes, the senior, the father of the famous Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.
Speaker 1: Yeah I believe it's 1850.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But I do have the book 'Blacks at Harvard'.  Have you seen that?  There's actually a book, there's actually a publication called 'Blacks at Harvard' that kind of chronicles the history.  Now I'll tell you an interesting comparison.  When I graduated I think Harvard had just graduated about 300 undergraduates.  Since I graduated and since the arrival of David Evans, that number has, has increased tenfold.
Speaker 1: You're saying the number of African American graduates.
Speaker 2: Yes has increased tenfold.  But Richard Greener was the first member of the class of Harvard College, he was also a diplomat, I mean he served in the [United States] Foreign Service, Richard Greener.  D.W. DuBois was in the same class as Monroe Trotter.  And they actually were finalists for the Boylston Oratory Award.  So the finalists were two African Americans and they, they competed in oratory because the boys needed the money to stay in school.  So there's some interesting historical tidbits about, about that time.  And of course DuBois got the first Ph.D. in history.  His thesis, 'The Suppression of the African slave trade', and then there were the--that was followed by, by the secession of West Virginia from Virginia, and that was right before Wesley.
Speaker 1: Carter G. Woodson.
Speaker 2: Carter G. Woodson [unclear] and then Charles Wesley.  So it was DuBois, Woodson and Wesley.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So in terms of the, the medical school when you got there I mean has the presence of black folks increased?
Speaker 2: It's increased dramatically.  Now remember my medical education was all at Columbia [Medical School, New York].
Speaker 1: Right, right, that's true.
Speaker 2: So I can tell you a little bit more about the history of blacks at Columbia Medical School.  Prior to my class which had four, the largest class had contained two.  So my class was the largest class in history which had four medical school, members.  Harvard Medical School, I don't know the, the details of, of that as much as I do Columbia where I, you know where I matriculated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 20692
Speaker 1: Well our last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Sir how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a, as a physician who was dedicated to both the public health and to individual health.  That had a philosophy of both, but primarily prevention and secondarily treatment.  And as, as an individual who fortuitously wrote a letter to an editor that resulted in legislation that transformed the focus of Medicare from treatment to prevention.  And every time I see a new CPT [Current Procedural Terminology] code come out for a new preventive service, I think back to the fact that there had to be that first one.  And that first one was Pneumovax, was payment for pneumococcal vaccine immunization.  I think that is--I would like to be remembered for that.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well thank you very much for sharing with us.
Speaker 2: Thank you, thanks for having me.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Alright.
