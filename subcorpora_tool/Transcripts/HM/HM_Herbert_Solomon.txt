Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we ask as sort of a warm up, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?

Speaker 2: The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, that's good.
Story_ID: 651939
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [William Herbert, Sr.] side, but separately; and then we'll put them together.  So can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Margaret Herbert [Margaret Johnson Herbert], middle name was Louise.  It's M-A-R-G-A-R-E-T, L-O-U-I-S-E, H-E-R-B-E-R-T.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: You know, the exact date is on the questionnaire.  I don't have it in my memory.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were telling me earlier she was born around nine- 1905.
Speaker 2: Ni- around 19- around 1910.
Speaker 1: Nineteen ten [1910], okay.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them, and what occupations or activities were they engaged in?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother's, my mother was a housewife.  She wasn't--you know, when I--during my lifetime, I never knew her to do anything outside the house.  She just took care of the family.  But she was from New York.  Her father, my grandfather, Solomon Johnson [Solomon Johnson], was a, worked at Ellis Island [New York, New York].  He was from the D.C. area [Washington, D.C.], and he worked at Ellis Island and was involved in their, managing their immigration department.  Now I had heard a story, and I don't really have a lot of particulars.  But he told me, when I was a little one, that he traveled from, on a stagecoach, from the West to the East, from out in the West.  From what part of the West, I don't know, to the East with his mother, who was a Native American.  And, so that's, you know, kind of family lore that I've been told about but never given any great details about that.  But--
Speaker 1: Now that's quite a story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, but, you know, so he was born somewhere, raised somewhere out west or, and as a child he came across--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --all the way to the East on a stagecoach.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that would have been in, I guess in, what, 1880s or '90s [1890s] I guess?
Speaker 2: It would have had to been.  I know that I knew him--he was alive when I, when I was around--and he passed in the '50s [1950s], I don't remember--in the early '50s [1950s].  I don't remember the exact year or month, but he was in his eighties at the time that he passed.  So he would have had to been--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --made that trek somewhere in the 1880s, I would guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did he ever mention what group of Indians his mother was a part of?
Speaker 2: Well, I, again, this is all kind of lore, so you just don't know how much, how accurate it is.  But I was told it was Apache.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that would put him out in the Southwest, you know, in Texas or Arizona, you know.  Okay, if my (laughter) TV history is correct about the Apaches.  But yeah, I think like Texas and sort of in the Arizona area.  So that's what I'm thinking.  Okay, any- anything else?  Well, what else did he say?  Because it's--whether, whether we can verify it or not right now, it's good to have a clue.
Speaker 2: Well, that's probably the only bit of history that he sh- you know, that I can remember him sharing with us.  I mean there's other little pieces that we've come across.  Like, we have a family member from my grandfather's side of the family who was Lincoln, President Lincoln's [President Abraham Lincoln] barber.  And it's actually detailed in a book called 'They Knew Lincoln' [John E. Washington].  And he apparently was involved, fought in the Civil War with the Union Army.  And because of his bravery or because of his loyalty or whatever, he was gifted with this opportunity to be Lincoln's barber.  So we kind of read about that, but it's not, we don't have a lot of information about it, just what was in the book that was shared with us.
Speaker 1: Did they give his name [Solomon Johnson]?
Speaker 2: You know, I could get it.  I don't remember it off the top of my head.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Well, that's, that's the kind of story that a lot of families wish they had (laughter), I guess.
Story_ID: 651940
Speaker 1: Her father comes from out west.  And well, what about her mother [Herbert's maternal grandmother, Emma Boyce Johnson]?
Speaker 2: Her mother was from the New York area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So are there any stories from that branch?
Speaker 2: Not really.  We didn't know a lot about her.  She--I didn't know her.  You know, she either passed before I was born or when I was so young that I don't have any memory of her.
Speaker 1: Did she have relatives down south, or were they all in New York?
Speaker 2: I think the family line came out of Kentucky, is what I've--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was told.
Speaker 1: All right.  So did your grandfather, Solomon Johnson [Solomon Johnson], manage the immigration office [at Ellis Island, New York, New York] for a long time?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure how many years it was, but it was, it was, it wasn't just for a couple of months or a couple of years.  He was there for a while.
Speaker 1: That's significant.  I guess that would be a federal appoint- appointment, no doubt.
Speaker 2: I would think so, yes.
Speaker 1: So, okay.  That's interesting.  Did he have any stories to share about what happened in that office or any stories about (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, he never talked about it much.
Speaker 1: There have to be a lot of stories on all the people coming through there.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Story_ID: 651941
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Margaret Johnson Herbert]--now what part of New York City [New York, New York] did she grow up in?
Speaker 2: Well (clears throat), they lived in (clears throat), excuse me (cough), they lived in the Harlem [New York, New York] area.  And my father [William Herbert, Sr.] was a dentist.  He had practiced in that area for a while.  So the family--my uncle, her brother, Solomon [Solomon B. Johnson] was a--at one point became a commissioner in, a liquor commissioner, in New York City.  But it's an interesting story.  One day he took his mother, my grandmother [Emma Boyce Johnson], to the movies.  And when they were sitting in the theater, unbeknownst to her, the movie starts.  It was a film called, I think the name of it was called 'Notorious' ['The Notorious Elinor Lee'], and it was an Oscar Micheaux film.  And her son, Solomon, was the star of the film.  She knew nothing about it, had no idea that he was involved in that.  So that's something, one of the stories that was passed down.  And we actually have a copy of the film someplace.
Speaker 1: So Oscar Micheaux's No- 'Notorious,' huh?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Oscar Micheaux was a pioneer black filmmaker who worked out of Chicago [Illinois] and New York.  Okay, so that's something.  So did he, did he appear in any other films?
Speaker 2: I think that's the only film he was in.  He was a, you know, dashing young man, and he was--the old ladies loved him.  So he just, he was a natural for that.  But I think that was his only foray into the film industry.
Story_ID: 651942
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Margaret Johnson Herbert] have any stories about growing up that she shared with you?
Speaker 2: No, you know, not really.  Her--she was more--a ve- very devoted mother.  And she--her--whatever time she had with us.  And unfortunately it wasn't very long, because she passed when she was rather young.  I think she was (clears throat) maybe forty-three or forty-four.  And probably the last five years of her life she was in and out of the hospital.  But one of the things that I learned from her--I didn't know it was going to be hard to talk about this.  But anyway, when she--he had cancer, and she was--I remember when we went to--my dad [William Herbert, Sr.] and I went to see her every day.  The last time she was in the hospital for--I don't remember how long it was--but it was months, months and months.  And I went to see her every day with my dad after school and on weekends.  And she was, it was at some point she was just losing so much weight.  She was all skin and bones and just barely, barely alive.  But the last time I saw her, when I got, we got to the hospital, the nurse said, "Oh, we have a big surprise for you."  So, you know, we couldn't figure out what that was all about.  Because every time we had gone, she'd always been just lying in the bed, you know, with all the tubes and all the things connected to her body and just barely, barely conscious.  And, so they sat us, sat us down in the waiting room or lounge.  And a few minutes later, they brought my mother out in a wheelchair.  And she had this beautiful pink gown on and had makeup on.  I hadn't seen makeup on her--I don't, I can't remember the last time.  And she had her hair combed.  And she taught, a lesson she taught me that in all the pain that she was in and the suffering she was in, she was more concerned about us and trying to brighten our day up rather than worrying about her inevitable death.  And, so it was, it was, you know, a very sad time in my life.  But also it taught me--and I think it probably had an impact on me--why I chose a life of, you know, to some degree of service, and was involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  And even in the work that I do now, there's really, there's a mission other than just being in business and making money.  I'm really trying to help people and help our community.  And I think that that spark was lit in me by my mother, by that kind of very courageous act on her part, to show that she could put her feelings aside and her needs aside and really think about her family and how she could do something to ease our--whatever anxiety we were having about her condition.
Story_ID: 651943
Speaker 1: How far did she [Herbert's mother, Margaret Johnson Herbert] go in school?  Did she go to college, or?
Speaker 2: You know, I, that I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'd just be guessing, whatever I told you.  But she was very, I don't know how in terms of degrees, but she was very learned and very intelligent and knowledgeable.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she ever talk about any of her aspirations growing up, what she wanted to do or--
Speaker 2: No, I think her conversation with us was always about us and about what we needed as--you know, as her responsibility, what she, what she could do for us.  And that was--I just don't remember her being ever focused on what her needs were.  And I'm not saying that that's necessarily a good thing.  Perhaps if she had--I don't know--if she abused--I don't think, I don't mean to insinuate that at all.  And we don't know what we knew--know now about cancer and the things that cause it.  But maybe had she been more in tune with her needs and not so devoted to her family, who knows if she might have lived a longer life.  But she never really talked about any aspirations outside of just being a mother and a wife.
Story_ID: 651944
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father's side, and then we'll deal with them together.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name is William Gordon Herbert [William Herbert, Sr.].  That's W-I-L-L-I-A-M, G-O-R-D-O-N, H-E-R-B-E-R-T.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in 1897, December [sic. January]--and again I don't, I should know it, but I don't.  But it's all on that form that I gave you.
Speaker 1: That's fine (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what can you tell us about his side of the family?  How--now he was born in Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago], right?
Speaker 2: He was born in Trinidad.  No--don't know a whole lot about his family.  Interestingly enough, we just, I just reconnected with some of my relatives in Trinidad in the last couple of years.  I mean I went, you know, (laughter) for seventy some odd years without really knowing anybody.  And my brother [William Herbert, Jr.] went over to carnival one year and connected with some of our cousins over there.  So I know that he had a brother Frank [ph.], and I believe three sisters.  And his mother's name was Cecelia [Cecelia Herbert].  I don't know anything about his father, and we don't know why that is.  He never talked about him.  So it may be, you know, again, that would just be speculation on my part why that is.  Maybe they, maybe they just weren't close, maybe--who knows?  But he was very, extremely close to his mother and to his siblings.  And I can remember growing up, when I was perhaps ten or eleven, one of his nieces, Jean Farrell [ph.], used to come when we lived in Jamaica, Queens [New York].  And she used to come and spend summers with us because she was having some medical work done on her ear.  And, so that was one of only two of his family members that I knew.  The other one was Uncle Fred.  He was Wilfred Huggins, and he was my father's senior.  I mean at the time my pa- my father dea- passed, Uncle Fred was, I guess in his late seventies or early eighties.  And those were the only two members of his family that I knew anything of.  And of course I lost contact with both of them shortly after my father passed.  But, you know, I don't, I don't know a lot about--now since--like I say in the last couple of years, I've connected with some of his nieces.  And, so we stay in touch.  And when I was over in Trinidad--a couple times recently I went and had, you know, time to spend with the family and actually was there for the birth of the newest family member.  One of my cousins had a little girl.  So we're trying to keep the connection alive, and we're learning--we've agreed that we'd work together and try and establish a family tree for the Trinidad side of the family, and we're working on that now.
Speaker 1: So there's no discussion about his father, or what his father did for a living or anything?
Speaker 2: Absolutely none, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what did his mother do for a living?
Speaker 2: You know, I think she was an educator.
Story_ID: 651945
Speaker 1: Is there a story that your father [William Herbert, Sr.] told or anybody else told about why he came to the United States?
Speaker 2: Well, not why we came but I think, you know, I can surmise that he came, you know, to--for the opportunities that presented themselves.  He came I guess around 1911, 1912.  He was a very young, you know, in his teens.  And his only contact here was his cousin, Uncle Fred [Wilfred Huggins], who was, you know, perhaps fifteen, twenty years his senior.  And, but it was a, he had a, quite a fascinating story after he came because he was another one of my great heroes and inspiration.  He went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  He, you know, worked on the railroad, as many people during that era did and got into Howard University, and he was studying engineering.  And he, I guess around 1917 or so, decided--you know, there was a call for volunteers for the First World War [World War I, WWI].  So he went and signed up for the [U.S.] Army--I think it was the 92nd Division [sic. 15th New York National Guard Regiment], if I'm not mistaken, which later became the 369th [369th Infantry Regiment]--and went to officers training school [Officer Candidate School] and got his bars.  He was a second lieutenant and in 1980--1918, shipped out to go to France and fight.  And, you know, this--I actually did a presentation about my father once because it's so fascinating.  And the more I studied it, the more I learned about our history and about the motivations and tried to get myself inside of his head and other black folks of that era.  And the truth of the matter is, of course, you know, the history that of the segregation and the laws that existed.  And a lot of black young men felt a desire and a, and a need to show their loyalty and to prove themselves as worthwhile loyal citizens of the U.S.  So despite all the terrible things that were happening to people of color, he went and joined and went and fought.  And he couldn't even fight under an American flag, the Army wouldn't allow it.  So all the black troops had to fight under French command.  So they went--in 1918 shipped out, fought in France, Argonne Forest and other, other major battles there.  And I think he was on--in the battle zone for about eighteen months.  Got out and got a--promoted to captain before he came back home.  And of course, you know, even despite that came back to all the same racism and all the same Jim Crow laws that were there before he left.  But anyway, that was what he was driven to do.  And they went through many hardships, even in the training.  They wouldn't give them guns when they were here.  And they had to, you know, march with wooden guns and broomsticks and whatever, just to--but they would not give them weapons.  Because they, I guess they didn't trust black people--if you put weapons in their hands they were going to, you know, try and take over the country or take over Harlem [New York, New York] or whatever.  But anyway, he--the thing about--that I learned from him--A, was that he never gave up.  And he never was bitter despite--and I know that he, I said that he went back to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] to finish, got his degree in engineering and could not find a job, could not get a job as an engineer.  So he went back to Howard and got a degree as a, as a dentist.  And that's when he had his practice in Harlem before we moved out to Queens [New York] when I was maybe about four years old, five years old.  And through all of this, he was always positive.  His only interest was providing for his family.  I can never remember him uttering a single negative word about white folks, about racism, about any of that.  He just had his responsibilities to take care of his family and to try and provide us with a good life and the best life he could.  And that's what he focused on.  And even when he passed, he was literally weeks away from getting a degree in law.  He was only fifty-nine when he passed.  He was studying to be--get a law degree.
Story_ID: 651946
Speaker 1: One other little interesting thing about my dad [William Herbert, Sr.], he worked at the Brooklyn Navy Yard [New York, New York].  He finally, after many years, he was able to put some of that--he was, he had trained and gotten a degree as an electrical engineer.  He was able to put some of that to work as a shop steward in the electrical department at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.  So while he wasn't a full fledged--you know, he didn't have a position as an engineer--he--that training didn't go to waste.  And one of the things I remember as a young person growing up (clears throat), he used to sit around the kitchen table with all sorts of tools and testers and tubes and things.  And he was trying to build a television.  This was before television had been perfected.  And there were a couple of--I think there was a company in Europe, maybe in France that was working on it.  And then there was one of the major--and I don't know which one it was--but one of the major com- companies in the U.S.--General Electric [Boston, Massachusetts], or one of these--
Speaker 2: RCA [RCA Corporation, New York, New York] was a--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  And they were trying to iron out all the bugs to develop television.  And he was doing the same thing in our kitchen on the table.  Now he didn't have any resources to do this.  And, so he didn't really have the funds to find out what it, you know, whatever that missing link was.  But I do remember when as soon as--whichever company it was that found out what it was, and he discovered it, he made our--us a TV before it was even anything to watch on TV.  He went and, he went--there was a, I remember there was a used furniture store not too far from where we lived on--in Jamaica [Queens, New York].  He went and got one of these old wind up Victrolas and he gutted it.  He took out where the little like, the little (unclear) in the front where the sound came out.  And he put a little tiny TV screen in there and he built a little--whatever the guts of that--I think he put in there.  And we had a TV.  And there was nothing to watch except, you know, the patterns that they put on to, you know, the test patterns.  And then I think a couple of shows came on like, I think Milton Berle and a few others.  There weren't many shows.  But he was brilliant.
Speaker 2: Well, this TV actually worked.  It was a homemade TV--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that worked.
Speaker 1: Once he found out what that was--that these, you know, major companies--put that missing ingredient in and he found out what it was, he just went and got the part and put it together and made this little TV.  And he--I was just, I was amazed at him.
Story_ID: 651947
Speaker 1: So he [Herbert's father, William Herbert, Sr.], he had a major influence on me wanting to--and one kind of a thing that incensed me is when he passed.  And he passed, like I say, very young.  He was only fifty-nine, and I was perhaps fifteen, and we were extremely close.  And it kind of fell on me to go through his personal papers and, you know, try and put things in order and send out, you know, notices about his death and the funeral and all that.  And I came across his income tax forms.  And when I saw what this guy with two degrees and one, a third one almost--there, and all of the things that he had done, you know.  He was also, which I didn't mention before, he stayed with the [U.S.] military even though after the First World War [World War I, WWI] he was one of the mainstays at the, at the 369th Regiment [369th Infantry Regiment].  And when he finally retired in around '52 [1952] or so, he was a lieutenant colonel.  And all these things he had accomplished, and his last, the last year of his life, he earned something like seven thousand dollars.  And when I saw that, I just, it just blew me away.  I mean, I made that much on my first job.  And I just--it incensed me that he could be treated so--I mean he didn't look at it that way.  He was just happy that he was able to provide for his family and had a nice place for us to live and all that.  But it just incensed me.  So that along with what I had told you earlier about my mother [Margaret Johnson Herbert], has kind of really fueled my participation in a lot of community service kind of activities.
Speaker 2: So he seems like he was really busy and really a talented person.  Did his dentist practice just not really take off?  Did he--
Speaker 1: Well, he did okay.  But he just wanted something a little more for his family.  So, and he felt that, you know, it was kind of sporadic.  We were in a, in a black community.  It was not a very affluent community.  So he wanted to I guess, I mean we never discussed this, but I'm sure he wanted a stable income.  And he kept the practice going, even on a part time basis for a long time.  But he eventually stopped the, the practice.
Story_ID: 651948
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were just talking about how inspirational your father [William Herbert, Sr.] was.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was saying that he's, he was not a very large--in terms of, physically.  He was about 5'7", and towards, towards the end there he had developed a little bit of a beer belly, I guess you might call it.  That was his one vice in life, he used to enjoy having a glass of beer every now and then.  But he was just, he inspired us by his own actions and by his--him being so devoted to his family, to his children and to his wife [Margaret Johnson Herbert] and to--just don't remember anything--him ever having any kind of negative thoughts, don't remember him ever having any kind of bad behavior or negative behavior or, you know, he was just there, he was a solid guy.  He went to work, he came home from work, and he came straight home.  He wasn't hanging out.  He wasn't doing anything except doing what he was supposed to do, which was to be a good father and a, and a good husband.  And, so we just loved him a lot, and he inspired us to do whatever few things we've been able to accomplish in life.
Story_ID: 651949
Speaker 1: He must have finished high school in Jamaica [sic.].  Did he talk about going to school in Jamaica or growing up in Ja- in--I'm sorry--
Speaker 2: Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago].
Speaker 1: --in Trinidad--
Speaker 2: He didn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) which is much different from Jamaica.
Speaker 2: He didn't talk about it a whole lot.  He talked about his family and one of his sisters who was a great swimmer, who unfortunately died in a drowning incident and, but he just didn't talk a lot about, about what happened in Trinidad or why he left or--and as I said, noth- nothing at all about his father.  And I have to also say, since he passed, and I was so young, you know, had he lived a little longer, until I was a little older, I would have certainly drilled him and asked him all kind of questions.  But when you're fourteen, fifteen years old, A, you're not thinking about those kinds of things and, plus, we had no idea he was going to pass.  I mean, even though we knew he had some health issues, it wasn't like he was an invalid or didn't really--we used to have--well, during the Second World War [World War II, WWII], he was wounded and gassed in France.  And, so he was a, considered a disabled vet, and he was on a pension.  But he was active and he, you know, he wasn't a frail person at all.  So we were really surprised when he passed and, you know, hadn't planned on it--weren't prepared for it.  And the thing, in retrospect, I know there are some things that he did.  And again, sometimes you can be too devoted to your family that you don't take care of yourself.  I can remember on numerous occasions when he would have to stop what he was doing.  It usually happened when he was driving.  And he would have to--we had a rather awkward driveway going into our garage.  And he had to really work hard to get out of there and back out of there without running into something.  And I can remember many times when he would have to just stop and put the, put the car in neutral or turn the motor off and sit there for five or ten minutes because he was having chest pains.  Now, you know, perhaps we didn't have the health coverage maybe, whatever.  He was a medical person, so he knew better.  But I guess his feeling was he could deal with it, his family was more important.  And that can be--that's a blessing on one hand.  But in the, in the case of my dad, he probably would have had another ten or fifteen, twenty years in him had he addressed that and been able--or even had the finances or made a way to get the healthcare that he needed, but he didn't.  And he paid the price, and we all paid the price for that.  But it was an act of selflessness, it wasn't because he didn't care.  He--I'm sure that if he had thought that it would end the way it ended, he would have done something about it.

Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your parents met?  Did they tell a story about how they met and fell in love?
Speaker 2: Well, my father [William Herbert, Sr.] was about thirteen, fourteen years older than my mother [Margaret Johnson Herbert].  And, so when my father was a dentist in New York [New York], they used to tell the story about how he'd see this cute young lady walking down the street.  And, you know, they would joke about it and make--I don't how much of it was, you know, I'm sure there was a kernel of truth there, but it was probably embellished over the years, as we all do with stories like that.  And, so he said that he just thought she was so cute.  And he just--but then at some point he took another look at her, and she was, you know, really gorgeous.  And, but they eventually got together.  So he didn't go into great detail about it, but I can remember that sticking out as, you know, this beautiful young lady kind of blossomed before him; and then once he kind of took note, he was smitten with her, and--
Story_ID: 651951
Speaker 1: Now when you consider your parents' sense of humor, their personalities, their dispositions, their likes and dislikes, their talents, their looks--who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, in terms of looks, I know that I don't actually look like either one of them.  I look probably more like my father [William Herbert, Sr.] than my mother [Margaret Johnson Herbert].  Personality wise, my father--and for that matter my mother too--but much of my remembrance of my mother was when she was ill.  So she, you know, it was kind of hard for her to be too upbeat.  But she always tried to, as much as she could, to be positive, and she had a sense of humor.  But my dad was really a character.  And I can remember him--and his standard uniform around the house was boxer shorts in the summer or undershirt, you know, with no sleeves.  And he would, he loved to watch wrestling.  And we all knew it was not real but he just, he liked it.  And he, and he used to even go through some of the same moves as some of the fa- the famous wrestlers of the time with us, play with us like that.  So he was, he was just a good dad.  He just, he just really related to us and spent time with us, especially since my mother was away so much in the hospital.  He just really--we were his top priority.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now are you, are you scientifically inclined like your father?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, when I was in school my strong suits were math and science.  And when I, when I went to CCNY [City College of New York, New York, New York], I was actually studying to be an electrical engineer.  I mean this was, I was kind of trying to follow in my father's footsteps.  But I got off on a different track and the arts and writing and stuff really--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --bug bit me and, so that's where I ended up.
Story_ID: 651952
Speaker 1: Were your parents involved in organizations, civil rights organizations or any of that when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or clubs or--
Speaker 2: Not really, not that I'm aware of.  But, you know, as far as organ- organized activities, definitely not my mother [Margaret Johnson Herbert].  And I--my father [William Herbert, Sr.] was very active with the 369th Regiment [369th Infantry Regiment].  So in that sense he was.  But in civil rights organizations, he may have been involved with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], but I really couldn't say for certain on that.  But I know that he was a real strong supporter of reform and change, as it relates to the way African Americans are treated.  I know he was, it was never, he was not one of these Negroes who were just happy to, you know, not make waves and look out for themselves.  He was really community oriented, and he really was always about what was going to be best for the largest, you know, part of our community and not just himself or his family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the 369th--now these are the Harlem Hellfighters, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now this is a group that's celebrated, you know, in Harlem [New York, New York] and has the highest stature in New York City [New York, New York] and in the country.  Were there annual activities, I mean, that, you know, where they would recount their services during the war [World War I, WWI]?
Speaker 2: Well, we used to go there on a regular basis with my dad when he was active.  And they would have, I guess they would call reviews where they would, there would be public events where people would come in.  And we would go there other times with him when he just had work to do or paperwork to do, and hang out with him there.  So since he passed, actually, we had our first family reunion in 19--I mean 2010, first and only one that we've had so far.  And we--I took family members to the 369th Regiment Armory [New York, New York], and we donated--I have some very rare photos of the 369th and the group that he went to France with in 1918.  And I don- donated those, and we took them through, our family members, through the museum that they have there.  And actually, my father's picture was in the museum, and actually there's a plaque on the wall with his name at the, at the 369th.  So we spent a lot of time there.  And then my brother [William Herbert, Jr.] and I both joined, and we, I spent six years as a member of the 3- 369th.  So we have fond memories of our time spent there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we interviewed one of the officers [HistoryMaker Major General Nathaniel James] over there last year who talked about the process of trying to erect a statue in France.  And he's the one that shepherded the statue to France of the 369th and how high it was, who sculpted it.  And he went through the whole--
Speaker 2: Was it--now he was active--is he active now or was he active years--
Speaker 1: He's active now, but he's not from that era, of course.  He's--he would have been maybe Vietnam [Vietnam War] era himself.  But he, you know, was there in the armory, you know, in charge of the museum [369th Historical Society, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: What is his name?
Speaker 1: I can't remember right now.  It's been so, it's been a thousand people I've interviewed and I--it'll come to me if I keep thinking about it.
Speaker 2: Was it Sergeant--oh, I forget his name now--who we used to contact.  This is going back when we were setting up the--our visit for the family reunion, and I can't--
Speaker 1: He's actually a brigadier general [sic. major general] in the reserve [U.S. Army Reserve] now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, when I was there, actually I served with some people who served with my father.  And our commanding officer was a Colonel John Brown [ph.] who was--served with my dad.  And, so, you know, we were--you know, I certainly paid him all the respect of--that you'd pay an officer, especially--he's a full, a bird colonel.  But we were also friends, and we would--you know, when we were out of uniform and stuff, we would, we didn't hang out together--but you know, we--he, because he was such a close friend of my father, he always looked out for me, and we just had a nice really cordial relationship.
Story_ID: 651953
Speaker 1: World War I [WWI], I think a lot of historians would agree is sort of a forgotten war now and, but one of the most horrendous war experiences.  I mean war is bad, always bad, but the trench warfare--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --gas--they tried everything, I think, in World War I.
Speaker 2: My father [William Herbert, Sr.] told me when he first went off--now he went in 1918.  He was at that point twenty-one.  He had just gotten his lieutenant's bars.  And he said that the guys were on the ship and all of them talked about, oh, they just want to get over there and kill some Germans.  They just want to get over there and show their mettle.  And they wanted to be on the first wave and all this (mumbles).  So when he went over there, and he got there and they started having these staff meetings of the officers.  And the way that they talked about the enlisted men was, you know, just like statistics.  They said, "Well, okay, we've got to send out however many.  You know, we're going to have to send out a thousand an hour over the top in order to gain so many yards and so many, you know, meters."  And they would--I mean not that they were expendable, it was just the way the war was being fought.  It wasn't--it's not like they could sit back and, you know, send a drone over there.  It had to be done with human bodies going out of the trench and going into the no man's land.  And he said so of course they started to lose their enthusiasm for being the first ones out of the trench.  They said, "Well, why don't I wait until the second, second wave or the third wave?"  But when he told me about that, it was kind of frightening.  And, but he did what he had to do.  And I remember, as I said, he was not a big guy.  But he did tell me the story about this huge brother who was in the outfit with him and was kind of, had his back for him.  He just became his companion, and whenever he went anyplace, this guy was with him and just, you know, kind of protected him because--and he told me one story, once he was in some situation where there was a combat, combat situation.  And he said that there was a German machine gun that had a beat on him and the gun jammed.  And it wasn't, I don't know how far away, but it couldn't have been that far away because he saw the guy.  And this guy that was with him was, he just, he said he went over, he just ran over to this guy, but the guy was trying to unjam the gun and get it to work.  And I don't know whether he killed him or disabled him or whatever he did.  But he said this guy saved his life more than once.  But this particular time, this guy just showed no fear at all.  He just ran right up into the barrel of this gun and took the guy out.  That gun could have been unjammed at any point, and he would have been killed and, so would have my father.  So he had some harrowing experiences, but he survived, and he came back and lived a rather full life after that.
Speaker 1: Did he re- ever name the person who--
Speaker 2: No, he didn't.
Speaker 1: --saved his, saved him?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Story_ID: 651954
Speaker 1: Now you have a brother and a sister, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, well--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I had a sister, my sister is passed, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.  Well, can you name your siblings in the order that they're born, including yourself?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My brother is the oldest, he was born in May 30, 1937.  His Wi- name is William Gordon Herbert, Jr. [William Herbert, Jr.].  Then my--I'm the second.  And then my sister is Margaret Cecelia Herbert [Margaret Herbert], and she was born March 19, 1945.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do they do for a living?
Speaker 2: My brother's an engineer.  He works mainly in the automotive industry.  And my sister (clears throat), she actually was--did a lot of administrative work.  She used to work at Black Enterprise magazine for a while.  And she was also a professional dancer, a ballet dancer, but she couldn't get any work during--as a ballet dancer.  And, so during her lifetime, rather than put all of this great skill and talent to waste, she ended up getting a--doing some work as a go-go dancer.  And they used to have these clubs where they'd have these cages, and people would get up there.  And, so that was not, believe me, not her thing at all, but she needed to make a living so that's what she did.  But she was a wonderful--very athletic.  And, you know, to be a ballet--you have to be very, very fit and a great dancer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And she worked for Black Enterprise?
Speaker 2: She worked for Black En- we--actually, we kind of got separated for a while.  I got separated from all the family, actually.  I went there--during the tail end of my work with the Civil Rights Movement, I really went underground. And then I, then I got involved in writing, and I was writing for Black Enterprise and that's how we got reconnected.  She wrote me--well, she actually, she wrote my brother and said, "Hey, there's this guy named [HistoryMaker] Solomon Herbert that's been working with Earl Graves [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.], and you think he might be our brother?"  And, so my brother wrote me, and that's how we reconnected.
Speaker 1: Now this is--I'm intrigued by this, and I guess we'll get to how this happens as we tell the story.  But that's really something because--but next que- well, we have to talk about growing up first, and we'll get--that's something, though.
Story_ID: 651955
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I would say I remember when I was perhaps four or five.  I think the things that, for me anyway, that stick out in my mind are things that either are very happy or very sad.  A lot of the other stuff is just a blur and, but I can remember when I was four, and I was in a place in New York [New York] called the Little Brown Schoolhouse [Bronx, New York].  I used to go there, it was a little private school. And it was before we started going to public school.  And my dad [William Herbert, Sr.] and mom [Margaret Johnson Herbert] had a guy that used to babysit for us, and his name was Roscoe Wilkes [ph.].  I believe that was who it was.  And one day I can remember--this sticks out in my mind, and it was no big thing.  But to a little kid, it was a big thing that he told me, "Oh, I was going--." We were staying home and we were going to do something.  I wasn't going to school that day.  We were going to go to--I don't remember what he told me he was going to do.  But we--it wasn't--we weren't going to go to school, he was going to do something fun with me.  And, so he took me to this school and sat me down on a bench in the entranceway.  And he went upstairs, he said, "Just wait here for a minute, I'll be back."  And he went up to, into the school, up to the second level.  And then I'm sitting down on this little cold, wooden bench waiting for him to come back and take me to this great fun day we were going to have.  And about five or ten minutes passed by, and somebody from the school comes and gets me.  And he just didn't have the heart to tell me that, whatever it was, that he, but he wasn't taking me.  He just told me this lie, just so I would be calm and not give him a hard time, so he could make his getaway.  And that's a thing that just stuck in my mind.  And, you know, I just, I kind of--you know, like I said, it was a little thing, but I just felt so betrayed.  And, so it's stuck with me all these years.  And, so I try not to do that to other people, not that I haven't in my life. But I certainly try to remember that--what it feels like to have that experience, and it stuck with me.  But on the other side of that, I can remember some wonderful experiences of my dad.  I remember he used to--I remember one thing that really--I went when I was maybe perhaps twelve, eleven or twelve, he took me to see a movie called 'Battleground' and, with Van Johnson and Ricardo Montalban.  I remember that was one of my favorite films.  And every once in a while, it comes on TV and I watch it.  And that was just one of the best days of my life, I just spent it with my dad in the theater.  And being, being that he was, you know, a colonel in the [U.S.] Army, he just, he would tell me what, you know, what was realistic and what was supposed to be happening or things that weren't, that was not a good idea.  And it was just, I remember that and a couple of other instances like that.  One time he said, more than once, but one time it sticks out where we sat down--and he used to love to make model airplanes.  I don't know that kids make them anymore.  But we used to get things that you--out of balsa wood.  You'd make it, make them, little tiny pieces of wood.  Not, you know, not something you'd just put together in five minutes.  It would take a, it might take a week or a month to do it, if you do it right.  And he sat down with me and helped do that, in his boxer shorts (laughter) and his undershirt.  And I just remember that always as another really positive and wonderful experience with my dad.
Story_ID: 651956
Speaker 1: Little Brown Schoolhouse [Bronx, New York], now that's--is that, is that in the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York] or is that?
Speaker 2: No, that was in Harlem [sic.].
Speaker 1: In Harlem, okay.
Speaker 2: It was, you know, her name was Helen Meade.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, what it was?
Speaker 2: Helen Meade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Hel- Helen Meade?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that was her school.  She had that, and she also had a summer camp that we went to, Camp Craigmeade.  And I have a lot of interesting remembrances of that camp.
Speaker 1: So did you go every year to summer camp?
Speaker 2: We didn't go every year, but we went several years.  And I went when I was, you know, quite young, maybe in--nine or ten, you know, for about two or three years.  And then when I got a little older, I went as a, as a junior counselor a couple of times.  The last time I went, I think my mother [Margaret Johnson Herbert] had already passed, and my father [William Herbert, Sr.] was still alive.  And Helen, bless her heart, she was so- somewhat of a character.  She--I mean, we all came out of there healthy.  It wasn't like she starved us, but it wasn't--you know, once your parents were gone (laughter) and you were there under her care, it changed, things changed and they--the food--I remember we used to have cornmeal mush.  That was our breakfast with molasses.  Every, every morning, the same thing, nothing, nothing fancy and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Cornmeal mush, huh?
Speaker 2: Cornmeal mush, yeah.  And then a lot of times--I think there was, I remember this place.  We were up in Peekskill, New York, is where the camp was.  And they had a lot of apple trees around.  So she used to get these little wild green apples and bake them and put them in a big pot.  And literally, I mean this sounds bizarre, but it's true.  We would go on line, we'd have to go on line like, almost like in the military, in this long line.  And she would have this pot of baked apples that was just all mushy.  And she would just literally reach in with her hand and take it and squeeze it, and it would come out between her fingers into your plate.  And that was, you know, I mean that's not all we ate, but that was some, very often that was our lunch.  And we had fun, you know.  Kids find a way, you know, being out in the nature and being with a bunch of other kids and all that--you still find a way to have fun.  But I can remember we'd get these packages from home, these care packages.  And my mother and my father would send us cookies and whatnot and potato chips, whatever.  And of course, the counselors would get the packages and open them with us.  And then they say, "Okay, one for you and one for me," and, you know, this kind of a thing.  So they would, they would share and end up getting more of the food than we did, the goodies.  And I remember there was a stream going through there.  And we were always writing our parents to send us a fishing pole so we could go fishing and catch a fish (laughter) because we weren't satisfied with the food that they were giving us.  And the thing is, though, with kids, they have short attention spans.  Because they would have a visiting day during the middle of the, of the summer.  And for about a week before visiting day they'd start giving you fried chicken every day and all--every--all the food that you love--cake and ice cream and stuff.  And by the time your parents came, you had, you were fat and happy and forgot about all those other things that happened.  And of course, after visiting day, back to the cornmeal mush and all the other stuff.  And then at the end of the summer, for about a week or so, they'd feed you real good so you would leave there with good memories and want to come back.  And (laughter) it was, we looked back on it and laughed.  I remember my brother [William Herbert, Jr.], we talked about this.  And he said he remembers there was a dog.  And he remembers that once he--and I mean the kids who didn't eat--I ate a lot.  Kids who didn't eat a lot, you know, they would sometimes leave food in their plates or something.  And my brother and I, we would go around and be eating leftover food.  I mean it sounds terrible now, and it was terrible, but, you know, we can laugh at it now because we survived.  And anyway, it was quite an experience.  I'm sure that Helen's not around anymore, so she's not going to be pissed at me for saying these things (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I've heard of this school before.  And I don't know why I got it, got it--but this is, this school is a pretty well known school.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --at the time it was.  I don't know that it's still around, but I know that we went there and some of our friends went there, and--
Speaker 1: So this is where you went to preschool, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: But it wasn't like full time school or anything?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It was--okay, all right.
Story_ID: 651957
Speaker 1: The natural question is in--so you--you're born in thir- '39 [1939].  So, I guess you start school, what, in 1944?  I mean, kindergarten or--
Speaker 2: I think--
Speaker 1: --or preschool?
Speaker 2: Forty- '44 [1944] or '45 [1945], yeah.
Speaker 1: You said you started preschool, right, first--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) at the Little Brown Schoolhouse [Bronx, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: That was the Little Brown Schoolhouse, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then she--the direc- director there, Helen Meade, pops up again as the camp, lead- leader of the summer camp [Camp Craigmeade].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, well, where did you start formal public school?
Speaker 2: In--when I moved to Queens [New York], I moved there when I was about four or five.  And the first school I went to was Public School 40 [P.S. 40, Samuel Huntington School, Queens, New York].  I don't know if they still number all the schools, but that's the way they were identified then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Pub- Public School 40 in Queens.  This is in Jamaica, Queens, right?
Speaker 2: Jamaica, Queens, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And, okay.  What was Ja- your neighborhood like in Jamaica, Queens?
Speaker 2: It was, it was not what you would call an affluent--I mean it wasn't the bottom of the economic ladder, but it wasn't high end, either.  It was kind of, there were some nice well kept homes in the area.  Small, nothing elaborate but, you know, people had pride of ownership.  And then there were some places within the area, like right across the street from my house, there was a junkyard.  And, so, you know, that certainly doesn't add to the value of your property or, and then down the street, there was a--not too far away there was a, I think it was called the Club Ruby [Queens, New York].  Every neighborhood has one, and it was kind of the hangout for, you know, people who were looking for a place to hang out and drink.  And I remember they had, we had our--right outside the Club Ruby down, you know, within a block or so there was a little park.  And a lot of, you know, what they called the winos at that time would kind of hang out in the park and, but, you know, it was a, so it was a mixture of people in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Now Queens is characterized--the borough of Queens has, you know, you know, single family homes with grass and front yard, backyard, you know, which is different from the rest of New York, New York's other bor- boroughs, right?
Speaker 2: Well, we were on a street called Merrick Road [sic. Merrick Boulevard] and Hendrickson Place, right on the corner there.  And Merrick Road, most of those--what houses that were there, didn't have front lawns.  They were just like concrete and then your property.  And Hendrickson Place along the side is where people had some grass and some front lawns.  And on Merrick Road there were a lot of commercial establishments mixed in.  I mean that's where my father [William Herbert, Sr.], he had his dentist office there.  And next to us there was a family of, about two houses down, there were the Codringtons [ph.].  And they had a floor cleaning business, so they had little signs in the window.  And, but it was--so like I say, it was a mixture.  And then if you, if you went down the block, the end of Hendrickson Place, then there was kind of almost--I won't say rural, but it was not quite the same with the manicured lawns and everything.
Speaker 1: So you were on a commercial street, basically with--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --his office on the first floor?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then the living quarters on top?
Speaker 2: Well, the living--it was, he just had one little area in the front for his, for his office.  And then for a while, he had an X-ray machine in the family room or the living room.  And he would, but then he eventually moved that out and just had stuff in that front part of the house, which in many of the houses it would be considered like a, not a porch but, you know, some houses you would go in and there would be a screen in there and you could sit--it would be inside but you--
Speaker 1: Like a sun porch?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But this was enclosed, and he used that for his office.  And then the rest of the down- downstairs was a kitchen and a bathroom and a storage room and then a living room and a dining room.  And then upstairs were the bedrooms.
Story_ID: 651958
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, again, some of the, some of the negative things as well as some of the positive things stick out in my mind.  And I can remember seeing some or hearing about some terrible violence in our community--black on black, whatever, you know.  Some--I remember once, I didn't see this.  My brother [William Herbert, Jr.] told me about somebody who, a black man, who hit a black woman with a brick in her face and tore her jaw off, practically off of her face.  And things like that happened.  I won't say it happened on a regular basis, but they happened.  And, but then there were some--such nice people.  I remember down the street from us right around the corner, there was a young man and his brother, Paul [Paul Nurse (ph.)] and Eddie Nurse [ph.].  I don't, I don't know if they're still with us anymore, but they were just young guys maybe in their early twenties.  And they just were--whenever they could, they would do things with us.  They would take us to go fishing or things like that.  And there was another guy, Vic [ph.], I can't think of his last name, who took me under his wing and taught me how to box.  And he was actually a shoemaker, that's what he did for a living.  But he worked with young kids.  And, so there was, you know, all kind of people.  And, but I--probably one of the things that sticks with me most to this day about that, was the music.  I thought the music of the '50s [1950s]--it's still my favorite music.  I have--every time I can get my hand on some of that music I--nowadays they call it doo wop, but then it was just R and B.  And some of the groups--I think the music was really beautiful, like The Orioles or The Platters or The Five Keys or some of these groups that I just think, I enjoyed that music so much.  And while I'm not--again, I understand there's a gender, not a gender--age gap or generation gap--and I'm bothered by some of the music I hear today.  Some of it I like.  I mean there's some rap music and some rap artists that I enjoy.  I don't like it as much as the music from my--but I understand it, I like it.  I think some of them have some real positive, powerful messages.  But some of it is just so, I think, I don't know any other word but just that it's terrible.  I know that you're not supposed to be judging art, but I don't know, I guess it's art if they want to call it art.  And, but some of it is just so degrading, and especially the way they talk about our women and kind of glorify violence.  And I just, I don't understand.  It's maybe it's just I'm too old to understand it, I don't know.  But anyway, maybe I'm getting off the topic here.  But the music, the music of that era was just wonderful.  And some of the people, a few of the people, not many of them, are still around.  I know that this young man that did these shows on public television.  I think his name was Lubinsky, TJ Lubinsky, I think.  About, maybe twelve or thirteen years ago, he started bringing some of the groups around when they were still alive.  And, so we have a lot of those tapes, and we have all the records that we can get our hands on.  And I--my wife [Herbert's third wife, Gloria Herbert] will tell you I listen to it all the time when I'm able to.  And I find it very--I just--enjoyable and relaxing; whereas some of the music today it's, you know, I can't listen to too much of it.
Story_ID: 651959
Speaker 1: Did you get your music from the radio, basically, in those days (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite station?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the two stations I listened to were WLIB [WLIB Radio, New York, New York] and WWRL [WWRL Radio, New York, New York].  I don't know if you heard about WWRL has just been, starting January 1st, they're going to be all Spanish language, even though it's still going to be owned by black folks.  But in--when I was coming up, there was a guy on WLIB called Tommy Smalls.  Tommy "Dr. Jive" Smalls was his name.  He was probably the top deejay of the era in New York [New York], and he played all the great music.  And, you know, you'd call in and make your requests.  They didn't call them shout outs then, but now they call them shout outs to people.  And I had a very interesting--when I was working with CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], I started doing a series of fundraisers at a place in the Bronx [New York] called the Blue Morocco [Sylvia's Blue Morocco].  Blue Morocco was owned by Joe [Joe Robinson, Sr.] and Sylvia Robinson, both of them--actually Sylvia just, I think passed last year, the year before last.  She was from the singing group, Mickey and Sylvia.  And Joe Robinson was just a record industry executive.  And, so they invited us into their club to have fundraisers that we could charge at the door.  And, so we go to, mainly me, but a couple of other people, we'd go to the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York].  And we knew Honi Coles [Charles Coles] who was the--worked there.  He (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The tap dancer.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And he was the, I guess the manager.  And, so he--we had an agreement with him that on Thursday, after the groups that were appearing there were finished, he would allow them to go and perform at the Blue Morocco if they wanted to.  They couldn't perform any, any other time during their runs at the Apollo.  Once they were done with their last show at the Apollo, they could go perform at the Blue Morocco.  So we went there and would, you know, have Ben E. King and a, and a bunch of other people to come over to perform for us.  And the deejay we got was Tommy Smalls.  He worked with us for, well, maybe about a year or so.  (Unclear) every Thursday night he'd come over and host it for us.  So that was kind of coming full circle for me because like I say, he was, he was my man when I was coming up as a teenager listening to him.  So that was fun to work with him, and I got to raise some money for the organization and meet a lot of these entertainers who I enjoyed and followed over the years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's WLI, is it V or?
Speaker 2: WLIB.
Speaker 1: B.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: WLIB, okay.  Okay, okay.  I've been to their website.
Story_ID: 651960
Speaker 1: So let's go back to--now in grade school, did you have any special relationships with any teachers?   Were there any mentors or role models in grade school?
Speaker 2: Well, probably the one person that stands out--and I got to tell you, when I went over that questionnaire and started trying to remember all that stuff--it's been a long time, and a lot of that stuff is just--you know, if there wasn't something important, it just--I just lost it, you know.  That's just the way my mind works so, but I can remember one particular teacher in, not in P.S. 40 [P.S. 40, Samuel Huntington School, Queens, New York], but the next school I went to.  I was only in P.S. 40 for maybe one year, and then I went to Public School six- 116 [P.S. 116, William C. Hughley School, Queens, New York], I believe it was, which was a little closer to my home.
Speaker 1: 116?
Speaker 2: 116.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the teacher there, her name was Mrs. Hedges [ph.].  I don't know what her first name was, but I don't remember her first name.  But I re- just remember her kind of taking me under her wing and encouraging me.  I was a little bit of a, of a--I got, I got into a little trouble, nothing serious.  I mean I was just, I mean not a thug or anything like that, but I just was playful and prankster and that kind of stuff.  So I was constantly in some kind of a little problem at school.  And, so she kind of took me under her wing and looked out for me, and whenever she could, involved me in activities, and got to know my mom [Margaret Johnson Herbert] and my dad [William Herbert, Sr.].  And, so I'd sometimes stay at the school with her and work with her because I had some kind of art- artistic abilities at that point.  And, so she would help me, you know.  And at Christmastime or Thanksgiving, I would help decorate the classroom and draw pictures or make posters or whatever.  So she's the person that sticks out in my mind.  She was an Afri- African American lady, and she used to come by the house.  Remember we had a huge rose garden, and we used to give her bunches and bunches of roses whenever she came by.  And just, I just have fond memories of her.  Truth of the matter is I can barely remember any of the other teachers.  And not to say that they were--there was anything wrong or they didn't treat me--or weren't good teachers.  It's just there was something special about her.  She took a special interest in me, and that's why I believe I remember her.  I can remember one other teacher, Mrs. Deeks [ph.], and she was the music teacher.  And that's--but other than that, I don't, I can't remember much about her; we didn't have any kind of a special relationship.
Story_ID: 651961
Speaker 1: Now was church a big factor in growing up?
Speaker 2: It was a big factor in my--and my parents [Margaret Johnson Herbert and William Herbert, Sr.] almost never went to church with us.  But we went to a church just about two blocks from my house.  So my brother [William Herbert, Jr.] and I went, and later on my sister [Margaret Herbert] went a little, a little bit.  It was an Episcopalian church.  And, so--
Speaker 1: Do you know the name of it?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember, don't remember.  But it was, you know, we were told we had to go church, and we went to church, you know.  But I can't say that we were greatly involved in church.  We just, we went and learned what we could and participated and came home.  But we didn't--other than Sunday, we never went to church.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, but your parents never went, you say?
Speaker 2: They went a few times but, you know, on a regular basis, we went every Sunday.  They went very rarely.
Story_ID: 651962
Speaker 1: Did you have a, like a middle school or junior high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, from 116 [P.S. 116, William C. Hughley School, Queens, New York].  I went to, I think it was Public School 36, if I'm not mistaken, in St. Albans [P.S. 36, St. Albans School, Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now by middle school, had you like, had you come to a decision about what you were going to do?  I mean, had--I mean, had you chosen like a targeted profession or something?
Speaker 2: Not really.  But that's when I was, you know, as I said, math was my, one of my strong suits.  And I didn't have really a lot of science classes, but I tended to be more into technical things.  And also, even out- outside of school I liked to build things and do things with my hands and work with tools and woodworking and stuff like that.  So that's where I was leaning.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So when you were--let's see.  So you would have been in middle school around in, around 1952 or '53 [1953]?
Speaker 2: I went to high school [Brooklyn Technical High School, Brooklyn, New York] in '52 [1952].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you would have been in middle school, what by 1948, '49 [1949]?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, they called them different things.  Like, I went to elementary school, then I went to, I just went to the, to the eighth grade in Public School 36.  And then from there, I didn't go to a junior high school.  I mean, they did have junior high schools, but I went from there directly to high school.  So it just depends on the, on the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Terminology so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So at age thirteen, you would have been--what you would call high school, but it would have been eighth grade, though?
Speaker 2: Well, eighth grade was the end of elementary school and--
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: --ninth was the high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had an interesting experience.  Now I went to this Public School 116.  It was outside of my district.  So what I--we did one of these things where I used my Aunt Ruby [ph.], whose picture I show, I think I showed you earlier, and we used her address so I could qualify for that school.  Because the feeling was it was a little better school than some of the other schools that were available.  And it was a fairly decent school, but we had our, had my experiences over there with some of the teachers.  They weren't very supportive of a, of a black, of me as a black child.
Speaker 1: Well, let me kind of re- recoup this on some level.  Now P- P.S. 40 [P.S. 40, Samuel Huntington School, Queens, New York], was that mostly a black school?
Speaker 2: 40 was definitely all black, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what about 116?
Speaker 2: 116 was mostly black, I think (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Perhaps a hundred percent.  There might have been a few kids in there, but mostly black.
Speaker 1: So P.S. 36 was integrated?
Speaker 2: It was mostly white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there were some black students there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is this--now, okay.  So you, so you came out of high school in '57 [1957], right?  Is that about right?
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 1: Fifty-six [1956], okay, '56 [1956], all right.  And, so during the period of time that you were in, you know, the junior high school years and high school, your mother [Margaret Johnson Herbert] passed away, right?  Back in--around--were you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was in high school when she passed.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you were fif- fifteen, did you say?
Speaker 2: I was about fifteen, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  So you were going to St. Albans--I mean P- P.S. 36, 36 in St. Albans [Queens, New York], okay.
Story_ID: 651963
Speaker 1: In the mostly white school [P.S. 36, St. Albans School, Queens, New York], and you say that the teachers were not necessarily very supportive?
Speaker 2: Well, I can remember a couple of instances that stick out in my head.  Now I have more recollections to this school because I was a little older.  But I remember one time there was a male teacher, actually, who was a substitute teacher.  And I, as I said, I was a little bit mischievous.  So we were in class, and it was maybe two or three other black kids in the class and we were kind of sitting close together, and we were talking a little bit.  I mean, not doing anything outrageous, but nevertheless, you're supposed to be sitting there quietly listening to the teacher.  And, so he came over to us.  And while we certainly deserved--I know I certainly, I was talking, and I'm talking loud.  I mean I wasn't screaming, but I was talking, period.  So I know I was wrong.  And we needed--he was right to say something.  But what he, what he did was far--he came over and said, "You colored boys over here, you need to be quiet."  And he took a piece of chalk and wrote on my head.  You know, just kind of like, you know, just--and I, you know, I was--couldn't believe that he did this.  And I didn't know what to do.  I'm just like a, you know, whatever.  I was thirteen years at the time, thirteen years old.  And I was of course embarrassed and humiliated.  But at the end of the class he came over and apologized, not in front of the class but, you know, privately.  So I mean even he knew it was wrong.  But, and I don't know what possessed him to do something like that.  But anyway, it's just something that sticks--stuck out in my mind.  And the other thing, which was even worse--because this guy was just a substitute teacher, so I only had to deal with him that one time, I never saw him again.
Story_ID: 651964
Speaker 1: My math teacher, and I don't remember her name.  I can remember her face, but I can't remember her name.  When I was, when we were getting ready to graduate, and I said I wanted to go to Brooklyn Tech [Brooklyn Technical High School, Brooklyn, New York], and Brooklyn Tech is one of the better schools, if not the best high school in New York [New York], technical school.  And she tried to talk me out of it.  She said, "Oh, you don't want to do that.  That's--you're not going to be able to get in there, and you're much better off getting, finding a nice vocational school and maybe getting a, getting some training as a mechanic or as a--."  And, you know, she probably thought she was giving me some good advice.  I don't think she was--you know, you can't be inside of people's heads, but I don't think she was trying to be malicious.  I just think that's where her belief system was.  And, so I mean, I told that to my dad [William Herbert, Sr.].  And my dad made it--he probably would have done it anyway.  But he made it his mission to get me into Brooklyn Tech.  So I can remember spending every night for months--he got, he got a, you know, workbook and stuff.  And we just went over it and did--studied the vocabulary and spelling, and whatever things that would be on that test.  We just drilled and drilled that stuff night in and night out, for months.  And I went of course and aced the test, and went to the school.  And my brother [William Herbert, Jr.] was already in there, so he went there two years ahead of me.  And I graduated, although it wasn't my favorite experience.  The training was good, the education was good, but I've always kind of been sensitive to, you know, being in a, in a city where, you know, people don't relate to me and I don't necessarily relate to, I try to relate to other people but, you know, being a black kid, the only black kid in your class or any black kid in, you know, in--it just, it was something that bothered me.  And it wa- and it wasn't just because of what was in- what was inside of me, but it was definitely the way I was treated.  You know, and not, and again I always try and give people the benefit of the doubt.  I'm sure that folks didn't do things out of maliciousness at all.  But it was just a kind of a sense.
Story_ID: 651965
Speaker 1: I'll tell you an interesting story, and not that this had necessarily a bearing on much of anything except what the attitudes were at the time.  When Dick Clark had his--teen bandstand ['American Bandstand'] I think it was called.  And I can remember one day--and I would watch it every now and then.  It wasn't, I wasn't a big fan of it, but I would watch it because it was just, you know, something that related to young people.  And I remember turning it on one day and seeing a bunch of people from my school on the show and some of my friends and peo- at least people that I knew and I recognized.  And I'm saying, "Well, now these folks recruited them somehow, but they didn't let me know, and they didn't let any other black people know about it.  They just kind of did this behind the scenes and got them in there."  And I, not that I even wanted to be there, or if they had asked, would have asked me probably not participated.  But it was just the idea that that's kind of how they treated black people.  And I remember one time--you know, I mean a lot of times--Now there was a school closer to us, but it just didn't have--it was an okay school, but it didn't have the reputation of Brooklyn Tech [Brooklyn Technical High School, Brooklyn, New York].  I think it was Jackson, Jackson High School [Andrew Jackson High School, Queens, New York], and it was mostly black.  And all of my friends, most of my friends went there.  And they would talk about all the fun times they had in school and the things that they did and social activities and being on teams and whatnot.  And didn't have that kind of experience at the high school.  And one time, my brother [William Herbert, Jr.] and I decided we were going to go to a dance.  We'd always hear about these dances, school dances.  So we went to a dance.  And literally, we walked in the door and we were there about two minutes and turned around and walked out because we didn't see another person of color in there.  And there were some people in school, not a lot, but there were some.  And there was nobody there.  Not that we, I certainly don't have any (laughter) animosity towards white folks.  But at that time I needed, to some degree still do, want to be around people who I relate to and people who I have some cultural affinity for.  So anyway, we walked in, and we were there for two minutes and turned around and walked out.  And even in the lunchroom--I think Brooklyn Tech at the time had about six thousand students at any given time.  And maybe there was a hundred black students, maybe, I don't know or somewhere around in there.  And when, and they would have either two or maybe even three lunch periods.  And all, just about all the black students would be at one table.  And there was just, you know, it wasn't like necessarily we were trying to separate ourselves from--but we could sit there and talk and we wouldn't--we'd feel comfortable.  And I know that--I heard and read all kind of things about that, you know, self-segregating kind of stuff.  And I don't know.  All I know is that we could sit down and have a conversation and talk about things that we understood and knew about and felt about.  And when we went and sat at other tables occasionally, which we did, the conversation didn't exist.  The fellowship just wasn't there.  So we end up gravitating back to the table where the black folks were, we could talk about, about things that we had in common.
Story_ID: 651966
Speaker 1: Once again, you're in high school [Brooklyn Technical High School, Brooklyn, New York] from '53 [1953] to fifty--I mean, '52 [1952] to '56 [1956]?  Is that it?
Speaker 2: Four years, so (mumbles).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I graduated in '56 [1956].
Speaker 1: Yeah, '52 [1952] to '56 [1956].  This is--now were you paying attention to the Civil Rights Movement when you were in school?
Speaker 2: I was, I was watching it, yes.  I was, I was kind of interested in it, but I really didn't get involved until I was really confronted with a demonstration in the Bronx [New York].  That's when I kind of just couldn't pass by without seeing what it was about and because everything that I had seen had always been in the South.  It had always been someplace else.  Now I know that, you know, historically it had happened earlier in, I mean in Harlem [New York, New York].  Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] used to--had demonstrations against some of the merchants on 25th Street because they weren't hiring black folks.  But in terms of the modern civil rights era, it had all been in the South until it happened in the Bronx.  That was the first time outside of the South that it happened.  And I just happened to be driving by one day and saw all of these people in front of White Castle.  And I just pulled over and got out and got on the line and starting talking to them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're going to get to that.  But right now in high school, the atmosphere is--I mean in Queens [New York]--well, in New York [New York] when you were growing up you said there was kind of like a--I mean you feel the tension, but you're not, you know--I mean there's things going on that you can't say are overt segregation or overt ra- racism, but it's there though, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: As you describe it, yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean I sensed it, but I wasn't, I can't say I was in great, in tune with that.  You know, it wasn't something that captured my interest.  I was still young and, you know, interested in the things that most teens are interested in--girls, especially.  But li- little by little I was beginning to understand it.  And when my dad [William Herbert, Sr.] passed--I told you about when I found out--and I just was so angry that--and I, and I knew that that was all about race.  It wasn't because of--I knew how brilliant he was, and I knew how much he had done for so many people.  And for him to be marginalized that way just really incensed me.  So I think that's when it really started--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --you know, want to do something.
Story_ID: 651967
Speaker 1: You were in high school [Brooklyn Technical High School, Brooklyn, New York] when your father [William Herbert, Sr.] passed, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how old were you?
Speaker 2: Well, he died in '55 [1955].  And, so I was like either just fifteen or I had just turned sixteen.
Speaker 1: Right.  So your mother [Margaret Johnson Herbert] had just died like--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) a couple of years before, right?
Speaker 2: She died about maybe a year and a half before he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so I mean, so these are two, you know, really big blows--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --while you're in school.  So I mean how did--who took care, who took care of you after your father passed?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean who did you live with?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  For a while we just lived in--my brother [William Herbert, Jr.] and I lived in the house.  And, but, you know, that obviously couldn't last very long.  So we maybe did that for a month, a month and a half.  And then I moved in with my aunt, and my brother joined the [U.S.] military.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this was a surprise, too, your father passing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Because your mother had been sick a long time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So it was a--we--total shock when my dad passed, so I went to live with my mother's sister, and I stayed there for a short time, not too long.  But I ended up when I was seventeen, getting married and--
Speaker 1: You were still in high school?
Speaker 2: I had just graduated from high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, so I went off and got married.  And I'm sure that I did it partially because of my circumstances, not the best reason.  But, you know, I just was looking for some kind of stability, you know.  And I appreciated what my aunt was doing for us but, you know, just wasn't, wasn't what I needed.  It wasn't, wasn't what I wanted at the time.
Speaker 1: Now, so many questions here.  How were your grades during this period of time?  Did all of this tragedy like affect your grades?
Speaker 2: A little bit, but I pulled through.  I graduated.  I didn't, I passed.  Only, only one time did I ever fail anything in high school, and I think it might have been right around the time my mother died.  And I went to summer school, one summer school.  Other than that, I passed everything.  And I wasn't necessarily an A student, but I did okay.
Story_ID: 651968
Speaker 1: Brooklyn Tech [Brooklyn Technical High School, Brooklyn, New York] is sort of, this is like an advanced placement school--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --basically.  So it's tougher than other schools?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And, so, and you were taking like a science kind of based curriculum?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So what kind of official counseling did you get in school?
Speaker 2: Well, I really didn't get any.  I mean I can't, I didn't have a relationship with a guidance counselor there that worked with me.  It just didn't happen.  And I didn't, I certainly didn't take the initiative to do it.  But I mean there were just, there were, there were no services that I was aware of that reached out to me, or that I could take advantage of.  And they probably were there, but I was not aware of them and just didn't have anybody at home telling me, "Well, you know, you need to be doing this."  But had my dad [William Herbert, Sr.] been around, I'm sure he would have been either directing me to the counselor or counseling me himself and doing some of the work that the counselor would do.  But it was never offered to me, and I didn't know enough to look into that.  And then plus, going to college was not something that, it's something I wanted to do, but it just wasn't something that I could see myself doing.  I needed to get to work and support myself.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you met your wife--did you meet her in high school?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I met her at my--I guess this was my second job.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was, I was working in a textile firm.  And, so I met a young lady there, not the lady I'm married to now [Herbert's third wife, Gloria Herbert].  And that's where we met.  And we got married I guess about a year later.
Speaker 1: So is this--like, did you start working while your father was still alive?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you got your first real job after your father passed?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, I had some other jobs, some little things.  I worked at a vegetable market when I was like, you know, eleven or twelve and, you know, a little part time job on the weekends and things like that but not a regular job.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you had a regular job when you met your wife at work?
Speaker 2: Well, the second job.  The first job I got, I worked as an air conditioner insta- installation man with a family friend.  I was his assistant, so we went around to different locations and installed, I think it was a Fedders air conditioner.  That's what we did.  And I did that for maybe six months.  And then from there--actually, it was my third job that I met her.  And from there, I went out to Roosevelt Field, Long Island [New York], and got a job working at Macy's [R.H. Macy and Co.; Macy's, Inc.] as a salesperson in their menswear department.  And I did that for a short period of time before I got the job at the textile manufacturer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's where, that's where I met my wife.
Speaker 1: What did you do at the textile manufacturer?
Speaker 2: I started off kind of doing a lot of different things, working in the stockroom and delivering and stuff.  But I had graphic, artistic skills, so I told the owner that I wanted to work in their art department.  So he gave me some assignments to do and I did them, and he liked my work.  So he brought me in there and, so I did--became part of the art department and also did printing for them.  We brought in--had an offset press, and I used to print their samples of the fabrics that we would design.
Speaker 1: So you had printing in high school or did you, or did you--
Speaker 2: It was just something I learned, you know.  I was just always, always--just do a lot of reading--self-taught a lot of things.  I mean even writing--I didn't, didn't really ever have any writing classes other than what, you know, English classes I had in school.  I just would read and do it and practice and just--until I got--you know, learned well enough to be able to sell my work, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just thinking, like, as you described your father.  He probably had a big influence on your ability to learn and try new things.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  He was just--he--to this day he's still, you know, is a major part of what motivates me.
Story_ID: 651969
Speaker 1: Were there a lot of magazines coming into the home when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, not a lot.  I mean, I know that we saw--got the Ebonys and the Jets.  And those are the two that stick out in my mind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what kind of work were you reading in those days?  Were you rea- reading like--not--well, of course you probably read Ebony and Jet (mumbles).  What else did you read?
Speaker 2: Not a whole lot.  Maybe, you know, read the newspaper.  I mean we--I tried to keep abreast of things with the newspaper.  And I can't really say that I was a big reader as--in my teens.
Speaker 1: I just wondered, wondered if you read two things--pub- publications that I was considering--I thought about.  One is Popular Mechanics because of all of the tinkering your father [William Herbert, Sr.] was doing.
Speaker 2: Well, now that you mentioned that (laughter), you know, I just kind of--it completely slipped my mind.  I used to read all of those magazines--Popular Mechanics, Mechanix Illustrated.  There was like three or four of them.  And I would--those, yeah, those were some of my favorites.  I'm glad you brought that up.  And I would go through and find these plans and make stuff and tinker with stuff that was in there.  Yeah, I did read those.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the other thing is National Geographic because of your subsequent interest in travel and photography.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I just wonder if you were reading those.
Speaker 2: You know, I can't say that I read it a lot, although when I would go to the library or go to either the school library or a regular library, sometimes I would look.  But sometimes my reasoning was not because of the, of the travel aspect of it.  It was because of the young ladies that would sometimes be (laughter)--I'm being honest with you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, for some reason black women were allowed to be naked--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in these magazines, right, yeah.  So, interesting, yeah.  That's--I think you're not the only one.
Story_ID: 651970
Speaker 1: So did you graduate from high school on time?  (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I graduated from high school.  But I'll tell you, I never went to graduation.  I just got my diploma and I was out of there, and I was happy to be out of there.  I just didn't want to go sit through that, and be in that kind of uncomfortable (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, socially, you never worked in high school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, I might have tried harder.  And maybe if I had tried harder--but it was just, I was just becoming more conscious of social climate and the way black people were being treated.  And I guess maybe that was, you know, coloring the way that I felt about that school [Brooklyn Technical High School, Brooklyn, New York].  And, you know, maybe in retrospect, it was not the best--maybe I could have tried harder and made more of an effort to relate.  And maybe I could have done some good, changed some minds, I don't know.  But it just wasn't, that wasn't in me at that point, and it wasn't--
Speaker 1: It would have taken (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) something that I was interested in doing.
Speaker 1: It would have taken an exceptional effort--most teenagers are not prone to make exce- exceptional social efforts, you know, in high school.  But you know, nobody else had to do that, so I mean, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so I don't know if you're being too hard on yourself, you know.
Speaker 2: Of course, now my brother [William Herbert, Jr.] was just the opposite.  He loved it, he did all the, all this stuff.  In fact, he goes to the reunions.  I mean he's always trying to get me to come.  He's a bigwig when he goes because he's, you know, from so long ago.  He graduated in '54 [1954], I guess.  And, so when he goes to these reunions--now, of course it's integrated, and it's, and it's also coeducational.  So when he shows up, you know, it's like a big deal.  But I've never gone.  They keep on inviting me, and I--maybe one of these days I'll go.  But I don't have any burning desire to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So was, so were there any clubs or anything you were involved in in high school that--
Speaker 2: No, nothing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A couple of times I went out and practiced with the track team.  Because obviously the two places where you'd see the black athletes were the track team and the basketball.  So that's the one thing we did.  We had a friend, his name was Teddy Harven [ph.].  And we used to go to as many basketball games as we could, my brother and I, to see him play.  He was a black guy.  But, and we'd go to, occasionally we'd go to a track meet because Boys High [Boys High School; Boys and Girls High School, Brooklyn, New York] had a spectacular track team, and we had a couple of guys on our team that were good, too.  So we'd try and go to those, but that's probably it.  I didn't involve myself in much of anything else at school.
Story_ID: 651971
Speaker 1: Nineteen fif- '56 [1956] when you graduate [from Brooklyn Technical High School, Brooklyn, New York], was--Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] was the president, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I believe so.
Speaker 1: There's a big emphasis on--well, it's just starting--this growing sense that we needed to amp up the technical activities here in the United States and science activities, to--you know, in a race with the Russians, you know, to get--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --an object in space, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So that was, that was going on, some of these things about the atmosphere.  Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is the spokesperson for the Montgomery Bus Boycott.  And that's in the news for, you know, during the per- period of 1956, on national news.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, so these are some of the things that are going on.  What else do you remember from '56 [1956], from graduation?
Speaker 2: Well, when I got out, and after I went to these first couple of jobs, I decided to go to night school at CCNY [City College of New York, New York, New York].  And I did that for a couple of years, but it just, it was too hard to try to do that and to, and then I had gotten married early.  And to try to, you know, support my wife and myself and work full time.  So I--
Speaker 1: Did you have any children at this stage?
Speaker 2: Well, we--not immediately.  But we had--by 1958, we did.  So it, so I--and the work was really hard.  I had started taking some of those calculus classes.  I could see that this was not something that I could, I mean was able, just because of whatever little, little brain that I had that I could grasp a lot of these things without--I mean I worked at it, but some of it was easier for me to grasp than for some other people.  But this--some of the calculus and some of this stuff, the new stuff that I was getting in college, really was going to require a lot of work and a lot of time.  And I'd known some people--like I knew a guy who was a lieutenant in the 369th [369th Infantry Regiment] with me.  And he was telling me how he had gone to night school for, you know, twelve years in order to get his, finally get his degree.  And I just wasn't--that's not, was not in my DNA.  I wasn't (laughter) going to be--go through that grueling, you know, I just figured there were other ways that I could make a living and didn't have to have--not that I didn't val- I do value education, believe me, I do.  And I, if I had had the chance, I would have loved to have had that college experience and not night school.  But I mean since I've become an adult, and I've had--worked with college students and gone and spoken with colleges.  And I think that that is--what a wonderful experience and opportunity that is for a young person to go and, you know, even if they're going to a local college--or to go someplace and live on campus and that whole thing--that's got to be an important part of their development and growth in life.  And I would have loved to have done that, but it just wasn't in the cards for me.  I just--reality was I had to get out there and put some food on the table and support myself.  So I don't--you know, I wish I had done it, but it's not something I dwell on or regret.  It just was not something that happened in my life.
Story_ID: 651972
Speaker 1: So what did you end up, what did you grav- di- now you learned how to shoot photos at a certain point, too?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You learned photography and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --so you're doing graphics and photography and--
Speaker 2: Well, when I, when I got the position at the textile firm--and then I, then I worked there for several years, and then I decided to leave that company.  And I, because I found out about, heard about an opening at another company.  And I went to work for that company, a large company called Cohn Hall and Marx [Cohn-Hall-Marx Company, New York, New York], and I worked there for a couple of years.  And I developed a freelance business, so I was doing a lot of freelance work for other, other companies in the, in the downtown Garment District [New York, New York].  And, so after a couple of years at this job, they were downsizing that department.  And one of the few other black people that I was, that I knew in the industry was also working there.  And her name was Jackie, Jackie Peters [ph.].  And she asked me, well, did I want to come work in her department rather than leave the company?  And by that time, I had a fairly active business going, a freelance business.  So I said, "No, I appreciate the offer, but I think I'm just going to go and give this as my full time effort and see what comes of it."  So--
Speaker 1: So about, about what year is this, and how old are you at this point?
Speaker 2: Oh, this is maybe, maybe 1963, something like that, something like that.
Speaker 1: Sixty-three [1963], now this is really a big year in U.S. history with so many things going on, especially for African Americans.  Because we interviewed a fellow in Oakland [California], just wrote a book about 1963 who talked about, you know, this, he's got the thing--George Wallace in the door of the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama], the assassination of Medgar Evers, the March on Washington, you know, a whole summer of civil rights activities.  A lot of activity by CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], in the North--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --starts up in those days, in '63 [1963].  You know, the Birmingham bombing [at 16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama], the assassination of John Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] at the close of the year.  Those were the big things that were going on in that year.  So this is the year that you leave a job and, you know, go freelance.  You know, I mean you start your own business, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what's the name of your business?
Speaker 2: It was called, originally it was called Leemar, L-E-M-A-R--L- L-E-E-M-A-R Designs [sic. Anmar Designs (ph.)].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Leemar Designs, okay.
Story_ID: 651973
Speaker 1: Now at this juncture, ha- were you involved with CORE?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'd already become involved with CORE, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, now is it time to tell the story about the, how you got involved in the Civil Rights Movement (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess it was maybe 1960--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when I got involved.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And I was just literally driving someplace.  It was on a Saturday, I think.  And, or it may--might have been a Sunday.  And I passed this White Castle restaurant in the Bronx [New York].  And I--there was tons of people outside with picket signs and news media and all that kind of stuff.  So I pulled over down the block and parked and got back out the car and just walked over there to find out what was going on.  And I was kind of hooked from that point forward, just wanted to be a part of it.  I just, you know, I'd been--up to that point, I'd always been kind of frustrated.  You know, you keep reading about these things happening, and you want to know what you can do.  And it would have been a big leap for me, at least at that point to go into Birmingham [Alabama] or, you know, put myself in the lion's den.  And because, you know, it takes, took some acclimation to dealing with that--you know, confronting racism and dea- dealing with the danger involved--to--where you reach a point where then you're able to do that.  But just going cold, it wouldn't have made any--I mean, I wasn't--that's not something I thought about, oh, I'm going to hop on a plane and go to Birmingham and get even for--or become involved.  So this was my entry.
Speaker 1: So what was the issue at the White Ca- Castle in 1960?
Speaker 2: Well, White Castle, they wouldn't--it was in a, you know, a very heavily--populated by black folks and Puerto Ricans.  But there was ne- never any people of color working at the restaurant or any of the White Castles.  But this was the one that was, I guess the biggest one in the black community.
Speaker 1: So was this a CORE demonstration?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was the Congress of Racial Equality, the branch in Bronx.
Speaker 1: Who was leading CORE at that demonstration?
Speaker 2: His name was Herb Callender [Herbert Callender].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was the president at that point.  And he actually changed his name later in life, he adopted an African name.  But anyway, I knew him as Herb Callendar.
Speaker 1: What was his African name that he adopted later on?
Speaker 2: I can get it for you.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I have it.  And, so he, so I had a talk with him while we were on the line and some of the other people who were there.  And from that point forward I was active and went to the meetings and participated in that.  And, you know, it's very eye opening.  Because we had always been taught--when I say we, I mean, just society had been taught that all of this racism was in the South, in the Deep South, and it didn't exist really in the North.  And it wasn't until you saw how some of the people in the North reacted when you were challenging some of their institutions, it was no different.  It was really the same.  I mean, they may not walk around in hoods and, you know, hanging people the way that they did in the South, but believe me, it was a lot of hate and a lot of fear amongst the larger community of black people and where, where they were going to take this Civil Rights Movement.
Story_ID: 651974
Speaker 1: I know some of the issues in those days were state, state municipal jobs, yeah, where a lot of black folks were working--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for state and local government.
Speaker 2: Yes.  One of the big issues in New York [New York] was the, working with the unions.  The unions were just so racist and segregated, and they just, and the worst of all was the teachers unions.  The--there were, in the early '60s [1960s] there were no black principals, not a single black principal in all of New York, not a single ass- assistant principal that was black.  And almost nobody on--up above, in administration was black.  I remember there was a young lady, her name was Edythe Gaines, who worked for the school board [New York City Board of Education; New York City Department of Education].  And her--you know, again, I can't know why people do what they do.  I'm--she was put there as a buffer to--and I'm sure that--
Speaker 1: She is a black woman?
Speaker 2: Black woman.  I'm sure that her intentions were to do the best she could, given what she was, the cards she was dealt.  But she was definitely there to try and to be a buffer and ease tensions and be a face that black people could--and Puerto Rican people could relate to and try and put out fires and that kind of thing.  But we formed a real strong alliance with a guy named Milton Galamison [Milton A. Galamison].  I don't know if that name is familiar.  He was from Brooklyn [New York] and he was, that was his, almost obsession, with improving the schools and changing the way the schools--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) this is the person that Malcolm X was introducing, you know, I think when he was assassinated.
Speaker 2: So Milton, we worked with him.  And he was real supportive of us, and he always, you know, acknowledged what we were doing in the Bronx [New York] and the things we were trying to accomplish.  And we had school sit-ins and we--it was one of the things that--we had a challenge in our community and perhaps to this day still the same challenge because we don't always see the larger picture.  We get sometimes drawn into small issues, and we make that the focus of our attention and we lose the big picture.  Now, and, but the school issue, there was a big issue, big push to get these, I forget what they call them.  But they would be folks from the community who'd be working in the schoolroom, kind of monitoring the teacher and watching the teacher.  I forget what they--it was a name that they called them, and it escapes me right now.  And, so of course all of these parent groups and different civil rights organizations were pushing hard to get these people on board.  And what happened was that as soon as they got on that school payroll their allegiance changed because they were, now they were going to protect their job, protect their--they weren't going to report the teacher if the teacher--they weren't going to put pressure on the administration to do things differently.  They became part of that structure and part of that team, and they were not, they didn't serve the purpose that a lot of people thought they were going to serve.  And we used to go to the meetings down at city hall where they would talk about the budgets and how many, and, so, what they'd bring--all the community activists would come in and have their little two minute speech about they want to have these school aides in the classroom and they want all, you know, and they want to have black history and, you know, not that these things weren't important.  But then when they would finish venting, they would leave and then the school board and the people there would talk about how many millions of dollars would be spent on yellow pads and, you know, number two pencils and all that stuff.  But where the money is--which way I think--I always believed we should be putting our attention--we want a part of this economic development.  And when you get the economic clout, a lot of other things follow.  But we didn't do that.  We would, you know, got--and I, and I think it was by design.
Story_ID: 651975
Speaker 1: I think we were not dealing with--you know, one com- community person dealing with somebody else in the community.  These were sophisticated, politi- political operatives who knew what they were doing, and would manipulate public opinion and manipulate--I remember once going into an office with a guy who worked for the city [of New York, New York].  And he swore me to secrecy so, but this is so many years ago, it's like fifty years ago, so I think I can, I won't mention his name.  But he went into this room, like a little war room.  And it had maps on the wall, and it had these little push pins all over it.  And he told me, he says, "You know, all this stuff here you're debating and fighting about," he said, "there's a big plan they don't--you're not even supposed to know about."  He said, "All these buildings, like they have these buildings slated for demolition.  They--what happens is that they have--as soon as the black folks organize themselves politically in any one area, then there's always a plan to change that and to move them around and displace them so that they lose their political clout, and they have to start that process all over again someplace else.  And then number two is that they want to tear these buildings down, and they create opportunities for the construction industry to demolish them and build new buildings."
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah, that's true (laughter), that's so true.
Story_ID: 651976
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there was a big--I believe--now I don't where this fits in the time--this has to be the late '60s [1960s].  Well I don't want to go too far into it, but I know the big Ocean Hill-Brownsville crisis [Ocean Hill-Brownsville Experimental School District] in Brooklyn [New York] was in the late--latter part of the '60s [1960s].  It was a big dramatization of what you just described--of a lot of community organizing effort for a change--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the classroom and--
Speaker 2: It was just a lot of, a lot of turmoil and a lot of manipulation.  There were people in the various organizations that were provocateurs, really.  I mean, and when you hear about that kind of stuff, you think oh, that's just, that's stuff from movie scripts.  There was a guy, and again, I don't--I'm not going to mention his name because I don't want to be sued or anything like that.  But there was a guy who was involved in CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] at one of the chapters.  He was the president of the chapter.  And he sat up in a meeting--and granted, it was in the heat of debate and there was a lot of name calling and screaming and hollering.  And he said something to the effect that, "Hit- Hitler [Adolf Hitler] didn't kill enough of you Jews."  And of course, that was a terrible thing to say, a terrible thing to think.  And it had all kinds of repercussions, and they were talking about kicking him out of the organization and we were getting calls from the leadership at the national office, and how are we going to deal with this?  And just, and there were calls in the newspaper to ban him from the organization and denounce it.  And anyway, the organization survived that.  And years go by, and I made my way out to Los Angeles [California].  Come to find out this guy--my wife knew him--he was an FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] informant, and he was planted there and he did that.  And he used to brag about, you know, stuff that he would do.  And I actually bumped into him here maybe about ten years ago at the airport.  And he came, and I saw him in the parking lot and he came over to my car and we spoke.  And I didn't say anything, I just said, you know, "It's water under the bridge, there's no point in opening up that old wound."  But there was a lot of that, a lot of that kind of stuff happened.  There was a guy who belonged to our organization, the Bronx [New York] chapter, his name was Ray Woodall.  And his real name was Ray Wood, but he used the name Ray Woodall, and he was there as--just to monitor our activities.  And there was some talk about them going to try and blow up the Statue of Liberty [New York, New York], and he was, that was his job.  And, so he, eventually he was very involved in the leadership of the organization and everything.  And then at some point, we were reading in the Daily News [New York Daily News] that they had busted all these people who were, you know, plotting to blow up the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that was the RAM, Revolutionary Action Movement [sic. Black Liberation Front] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --former SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] members who got busted in that plot.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: So there was a lot of that going on, and a lot of it today, you know.  I mean there's a, there's a young man whose father was involved in CORE, and he's doing--I mean I think he's finished with it now--did a--his dissertation on CORE.  And he really went into a lot of research and sent me some stuff that he had gotten from, I guess the Freedom of Information Act [Freedom of Information Act of 1967] from the FBI (unclear).  And of course, every--half of this stuff was blacked out.  But they were really monitoring him, watching very closely and infiltrating all of these other organizations.  And the interesting thing is, and there were some exceptions, that we weren't about doing any, any harm to anybody and we weren't about, you know, blowing up anything.  I mean there were some people like the, what was that called, the, what was the name of that organization that was actually planting explosives around--the Weathermen [Weather Underground Organization], I think they were called.  You know, that was a splinter group.  Most of us were just, you know, incensed at what was happening to black people and were trying to do something positive.  And, but they had--every, every other person (laughter) you talked to, you just didn't know who--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --who was legit.
Speaker 1: And it's interesting that, yeah, a lot of people say that folks in the organizations that suggested, like, the most violent acts were usually people that they suspected were planted.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would not be surprised.
Story_ID: 651977
Speaker 1: CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] had an aggressive stance, though, in terms of integration of public life in the United States in terms of actually going out and doing something, having a demonstration or a boycott (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --and that sort of thing.  That was the position that CORE took that was different from some of the other major civil rights groups in the North.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I know that the Urban League [National Urban League] and the Urban League in particular, theirs was economic development, and that's what their focus was.  NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] did some demonstrations and some direct action, but they were, they were considered more conservative--a little.
Speaker 1: I think, correct me if I'm wrong.  I think the leadership of the NAACP fought about, you know, what the direction of the NAACP was going to be in that regard, that NAACP Youth [NAACP Youth Council] being the more radical--I mean in terms of demonstrations, the sit-ins and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Well, I think Roy Wilkins--I mean I have nothing but admiration for him and what he did, and what the organization has done, and what they continue to do.  And, you know, there was--and again, I think this attempt to manipulate by the powers that be to pit one organization against the other.  And our--my feeling was always that they complemented one another--that if you don't want to deal with me then go on to the NAACP.  Because that--you--if I wasn't here, you probably wouldn't want to deal with the NAACP.  But since we're maybe a little bit to the left of them and doing some stuff that make you uncomfortable, you know, pushing a little harder than you'd like to see us push--you're going to run to the NAACP and deal with them. And that's fine because they're--all the organizations were doing something worthwhile.  It wasn't like we were going to badmouth the NAACP and say, you know, "They're not legit. We're the legit ones."   They were--had a marvelous role that they played.  And for the people who thought they were too much, there was the Urban League, they were doing great things.  So every, every one of the organizations had a role to play and--including SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].  SNCC was--if--even a little bit to the left of us.  And Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture], he whipped up the fire, you know, I mean he really stirred the pot.  And he encouraged, by his actions, he encouraged CORE to be a little bit more aggressive.  And we in CORE encouraged the NAACP to be more aggressive.  So I think it was all working and good for the same cause.  And I never felt any sense of competition between the different groups.
Story_ID: 651978
Speaker 1: So what were the, some issues of--that CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] dealt with where you were in New York [New York] were education, you said, and--?
Speaker 2: In the school--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and the unions and then, and the, and the original one, which was the employment.  I mean, I think those were the three big areas that we were involved in.  Of course, we were involved in police brutality and other things.  But police brutality has al- has always been a difficult--especially back then.  It's a little bit more--today with everybody walking around with a cellphone, they can take videos and everything.  There's more proof of it.  If it hadn't been somebody there with a camera to tape Rodney King, people probably wouldn't have believed that.  And a lot of the stuff that was happening back then, it was never documented.  It was just, you know, this person told me this is what happened to him.  But there was no way to prove it.  So that was always kind of a fringe--it was an important issue, but it was an issue that you could get little traction on sometimes because it was difficult to prove.  And, you know, the police are not--and I'm certainly not anti-police.  I mean my daughter is a retired police officer in New York.  And her husband, my son-in-law, is a re- retired police officer.  So I don't really have a problem with police when they're doing their job.  But a lot of them don't do their job.  And my daughter used to tell me sometimes how she had to have to either speak up or bite her tongue in a situation where she saw some of her fellow officers were acting in an inappropriate fashion.  But back then there was almost no way to prove some of the allegations.  So while it was--you know, we addressed those issues, very little ever came of it.  But with housing or with schools, I mean you could--the numbers speak for themselves.  When there's no black principals in a ci- city the size of New York for those black people, you know, how do you deny that?  How do you cover that up?  You can't.
Speaker 1: This used to be said by the powers that be that they could qua- not find qualified Negroes--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to fill these spots.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, that's an argument that's still being used today.  And in fact, maybe later on we'll get into that.  In the industry I'm in, it's unbelievable.  I mean the thing is, there aren't much better than--I mean, there are some, but there are not nearly as many as there ought to be.
Story_ID: 651979
Speaker 1: Now did you go to the March on Washington in '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] sponsor buses?
Speaker 2: Yes, our chapter had (background noise)--I think we had one bus from our chapter.  But, you know, it was a citywide effort.  So there were, all the chapters had busses that went.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was your, I guess position, I guess by that point in CORE?  What was your--
Speaker 2: Well, I was one of the organizers of the, of the March on Washington.  So I was, you know, helping coordinate that and going to meetings with other people like Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] and folks like that who were involved.  We would go to meetings where they would be there and A. Philip Randolph and some of these (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you rose pre- pretty quickly in the ranks.  (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean at that point I was not an offi- I was not an officer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we would just go to meetings, and these people would participate--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) in the meetings.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I became a vice, second vice president of CORE after about two years with the organization.
Story_ID: 651980
Speaker 1: The national pre- president of CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] then was James--
Speaker 2: Jim Farmer.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Farmer, right, yeah.  He was the founder of CORE.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The founder of CORE.  And I think they had something called FOR [Fellowship of Reconciliation] before they had CORE that did the freedom rides [Journey of Reconciliation] back in the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But it didn't get as much publicity, and it didn't, it didn't, you know, reach the same kind of end.  But so Farmer, James Farmer, whose father [James L. Farmer, Sr.] was the professor in the movie, the--was it 'The Great Debaters,' (laughter) right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, from Texas (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) From Texas, yeah.  He was portrayed as the kid in 'The Great Debaters' as--I mean, one of the brilliant speakers of the black community--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --organizers.  What was he like?  Did you get a chance to know James Farmer very well?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was a very genuine soft spoken, very soft spoken person and very--but brilliant, brilliant.  I mean, he was such an orator and, so committed.  And he put his, himself and his life on the line many times.  He just had, he just had, no--I won't say he didn't have fears.  But he just would--his mission and his goal was more important than whatever fears he had personally.  So he put himself out there, and was a good, I think an excellent leader and excellent motivator for the rest of the organization.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now and he spoke at the March, right, on Washington?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 651981
Speaker 1: What was that experience like?  I mean organizing it, did you realize it was going to be what it turned out to be?  I mean, this is, what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, you hear so much about, oh, you get that many black folks in one place there's going to be violence and stuff.  So you, you know, you don't want to believe that.  And I can't say that I believed it but, you know, certainly it's in the back of your mind that it could happen.  And, but it didn't.  Everybody was really, it was a very emotional experience, and everybody was really pumped up by it.  And I can remember just on the way there in the bus, people were cheer- you know, we were going along the highway and the streets, and whenever we'd pass and there would be some black people out there, they'd be waving to us.  So it was, you know, we were just--it was very touching that--we felt we were doing something good and worthwhile and that we were being acknowledged for that.  And the experience in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] itself was, it was so many people.  It was kind of hard to--but we--the King speech [I Have a Dream] was certainly very breathtaking and just very amazing.  And the one thing that I heard afterwards from a, from a few people that I, that I know who are in the entertainment industry, is that they--some of them resented--now I think overall it was a marvelous--the whole experience was great, and I think it served the purpose that it was planned for.  But there were--everybody who participates in these kind of things have their own agenda.  Mine was just that--be part of making history and trying to move our country forward.  But some of the people in the entertainment industry thought--not that they didn't have those objectives as well--but they thought this was a wonderful opportunity to have an international audience.  And, so they were rather disturbed that Peter, Paul and Mary were the ones that got that opportunity and that some of the people of color weren't put out there as the, as the symbol, you know, for the, for the gathering.  So--
Speaker 1: I believe, like, Joan Baez performed, too, right, didn't she--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at the march?  But there were no black performers at the--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, there were, there were--they didn't have the spotlight.  I mean there might have been some, and I missed--it's been, all I can say, it's been (laughter) fifty years.  So, but Peter, Paul and Mary and Joan Baez, they were the ones that had the major attention there.  And there was--I mean a person like--one of the people that mentioned this to me was a guy named Olatunji.  I don't know if you know who that is, he's a drummer (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, yes, Olatunji.
Speaker 2: He was very--
Speaker 1: Babatunde Olatunji.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was very involved in the, in the movement, very supportive.  And he thought this would have been a great opportunity him for get out there and get some money.  And it wasn't for that, I think.  But anyway, you know, you can't--you're not going to please everybody.  I mean, I agree, not that I dislike Peter, Paul and Mary--I think that they did a good job, what they did--it was great for their career and all of that.  But there's some people that I would have liked to see been a part of that that just weren't given that opportunity.  But, you know, that's--you get, you win some, you lose some.  So I didn't--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) I didn't lose a lot of sleep over it.
Speaker 1: Now that's so- that's something I never thought about.  I never heard anybody mention this before.  But Olatunji--I'm just trying to imagine the power of having Olatunji--his drums and pa- passion--at the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --march.  That would have been--and then you had like people like Max Roach and Abbey Lincoln--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --'Freedom Now Suite' ['We Insist! Max Roach's Freedom Now Suite'], and all--you know, they were thinking along those lines.  So (laughter) I've never thought about that--the black artists, the lack of black artists at the March on Washington.
Story_ID: 651982
Speaker 1: So you helped plan the event, right?
Speaker 2: I helped plan, I mean I sat in on the meetings.  The larger group that planned the activities.  So I was aware of what was going on there, but my actual planning was more for the chapter [of the Congress of Racial Equality], what we did to bring (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --our--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --our members there.
Speaker 1: But you were privy to these discussions and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --after discussions, too, about what happened and, yeah, I can--now the major planner, we've always been told was Bayard Rustin, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And I was told by, I was told by James Bevel [HistoryMaker Reverend James Bevel] that it was his idea but, you know, initially--but I don't, you know, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He always, he said that when we interviewed him.  But he didn't--you know, so he participated, but he wasn't like the, but the major planner was Bayard Rustin.  Is that, is that pre- pretty much correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And, so the decisions about who was going to, you know, speak and who was going to perform, and I guess the logistics of the day, were pretty much handled by--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Bayard Rustin at the head of a committee that included who else?
Speaker 2: Well, I think pro- probably A. Philip Randolph was involved in that, and I'm sure Jim Farmer [James Farmer] was.  And, but those three for sure, I'm not sure about other people, because I didn't sit in on those meetings.
Story_ID: 651983
Speaker 1: I know one thing I'm thinking about was the aftermath of the march [March on Washington], was the next summer, '64 [1964], there was a concerted effort to recruit white college students to Freedom Summer in Mississippi, and which was successful.  A lot of college students went south, and a lot of media attention was focused on black vo- voter registration in the South as conducted by SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] during that summer.  And I just wondered how that--you know, the showcase of Peter, Paul and Mary and Joan Baez, you know, at the march along with, you know, the other, the white movie stars that showed up--
Speaker 2: Well, I think that part of the reason the march and part of the reason that the movement was successful was that there was broad participation in coming.  I mean, if it had just been black people, I mean I would have, I would have loved that--if we would--had the unity and the strength and the clout to do it, pull it off by ourselves.  But, you know, realistically, we needed everybody's participation.  We needed those people who would bring that audience and bring that part of the population, who would, you know, listen to what they had to say and respect them for doing it.  If it was just black folks out there, a lot of people who supported the movement, probably wouldn't support it or would not support it to the level that they did.  So I think it was an important strategic move to have as broad an appeal as possible.  It didn't negate the necessity for black folks to have a leadership role and to play more, you know, more of an important role and not just be following the lead of other people.  But I think that their participation of multiethnic groups was very important, and it certainly--I don't think it would have been successful or as successful without them.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  Yeah, because we--on the entertainment end of it--Charlton Heston was there, you know, a lot of the mo- movie stars, white movie stars, as well as the black ones, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: People like Sidney Poitier and [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte, of course, were there.  But you had like, you know, people who had national recognition there that I guess that people would trust on some level.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Definitely and if you look at an example where white people were not part of it--and that is SNCC.  At one point when Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture] was talking about black power and he was--even though there were white people that belonged to the organization that was, you saw that there was a negative reaction to that amongst the general population, this whole idea of black power.  It just--it's frightening to some people, and they think the worst of (laughter) what we're going to do when we get power and we get control.  It's like in South Africa, they were just so afraid that Nelson Mandela was going to have a bloodbath, you know.  It's--so I think like--not to repeat myself, but I thought it was important to have this because that allays the fears of a lot of people who are sitting on the fence.
Story_ID: 651984
Speaker 1: Thinking about what you're doing now--when you look back at 1963, were you concerned about the logistics and the travel?  You bring thousands of peo- of people coming to the March on Washington.  You know, where did they stay, and how were they taken care of?  Did--I mean, some people came and just went right back, I know that's true.  But did you think about those kind of things, you know, when you looked at the march?
Speaker 2: Well, to be honest with you, no.  I mean, because we just took our butts there and stayed for the march and turned around and came right back.  And I think most of the people did that.
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now there were probably some that did have to stay, but we didn't get involved in that.  So I'm not sure how they dealt with that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  Yeah, much the same thing happened with the Million Man March.  People came down and they marched, and they got back on the bus.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And interesting about the Million Man March.  Of course, you know, Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] has been raked over the coals by a lot of the media, and a lot of white folks who are scared to death of him.  We used to work with him in the Bronx [New York].  He was--his mosque [Mosque No. 7, New York, New York] was right--not too far from our office, so we had a nice relationship with him.  But when he did the Million Man March, the then president of the convention and visitors bureau [Washington, D.C. Convention and Visitors Association; Destination D.C.] told me, oh, they had a nice meeting with Minister Farrakhan and they planned all this stuff.  So, you know, when, money talks when you're talking about millions of dollars of revenue coming into your city, your area.  Because of, some of that stuff goes out the window about, you know, race and being afraid of this group or that group.  He was not, he was not a pariah when he was bringing in a million people or however many people he brought, and they were going to be spending money and buying lunches and staying in hotels.  So he was, he was a popular man with the, with the convention and tourism people in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] when he did that.
Story_ID: 651985
Speaker 1: Now you become the president of Bronx CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] in what year?
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess it was maybe about '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what--was there a residual effect of the march [March on Washington] on CORE in the Bronx [New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it helped.  You know, membership spiked, you know, because of that, and also because of the White Castle.  But it kind of tailed off, you know, as the, after the bombings and all that stuff.  You know, it was out of the headlines and it wa- it wasn't a lot of that being reported on.  People's interest waned and, so membership, you know, kind of started to dwindle.  And then of course, at some point the direction took, the organization took a direction that was not very popular with some people, myself included.  So--
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a--James Farmer leaves CORE at a cer- at a certain point.  I guess there's a, there's a--was CORE basically split nationally between what Floyd McKissick wanted to do and what James Far- Farmer wanted to do (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I think, you know, James was the ideal, he was the ideal leader.  Floyd, you know, he was a good leader.  I mean, he did what he could do and he--but it wasn't him.  I think it was some people low- lower down the totem pole that just started, they just had some odd objecti- objectives.  And--
Speaker 1: For instance?
Speaker 2: Well (laughter), I hate to get into--
Speaker 1: Well, you don't have to name them.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But what were they talking about doing?
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is a person who is--was the head of New York CORE.  And he just became so conservative in his views and started espousing right wing kinds of ideology.  And he became the darling of the little conservative talk show folks whenever they wanted to find a black person (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Well, that's interesting.  You know, who is this?  This is a well known, he's a well known figure, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you may as well--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, we're talking about Roy Innis.
Speaker 1: Roy Innis, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Because he was, I remember seeing those shows.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, so he, and he became a major influence.  And then when Floyd left the organization, I think Roy took over then.  And it just went, you know, from my perspective--I--by that time I wasn't involved anymore.  But, you know, I don't want to speak negatively of the brother.  He did what he, I guess he did what he felt was the right thing to do.  It just wasn't right for me so I--
Speaker 1: But you are correct that he--it turned off a lot of people--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --his position as an ultraconservative, you know.  So at any rate--so you, but you were, you served as second national vice president of CORE under Floyd McKissick from '66 [1966] to '68 [1968], right?  Is that true?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think I was there that long.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think I, I think I left around '66 [1966], maybe '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know something happened in my hometown in Dayton [Ohio].  We had a very strong CORE chapter under W.S. McIntosh that seemed to have a similar--you know, that's when they stopped, basically about the same time.  And it was probably stopped for the same reason.
Story_ID: 651986
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other leaders in CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] that--you were mentioning some off camera (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, in the Bronx [New York], Herb Callender [Herbert Callender] was the president.  His, I guess, second in command was How- Howard Quander.  And my understanding is Howard's still with us in New Jersey, but I have not been able to make contact with him.  And a lot of the other people are--Sonny Carson [Robert "Sonny" Carson], he was actually the chapter president in Brooklyn [New York].  But we did a lot of things together.  He has since passed.  And then some of the local people in Brooklyn, the Bronx like Mable Hurst [ph.] and Dorothy Lowery [ph.] and Nat- Nathaniel [ph.], what was his last name?  Oh, I can't think of his last name right now.  But these people, I don't know, I just haven't been able to stay in touch with them.  Some of the people from other chapters, I've occasionally have been in touch.  In fact, one person--since I've been living in Los Angeles [California], I went to a, we used to have a youth program.  Actually, it happened right after CORE.  We had a youth program in the Bronx.  And one of our instructors who was a martial arts instructor, his name was Bradford Gonzalez.  We always called him Brad.  And I was at a residence in--maybe about twenty years ago--in Los Angeles going to a kind of a social event at somebody's house.  And this guy knocked on the door, and this guy comes up next to me and he's waiting to get in, too.  And he looked kind of vaguely familiar, but I couldn't really put, you know, put it together.  And he introduced himself as Bradford.  And we always called him Brad, so I didn't, it didn't register on me.  I mean, but anyway, the long and short of it was after we got inside and got to talking, he was this young teenager who was one of our martial arts instructors in the Bronx and had since moved to Miami [Florida] and had his own martial arts school there and was doing very well.  So we--I--every once and awhile I bump into people who were involved with us in some way, either in the movement or in the youth program, and he was one of them.  And I was at another, actually at a party here around that same time.  And this guy in the, in the crowd who was dancing or something--and we made eye contact.  And he--after the music was over, he came over and asked me what my name was, and I told him.  He was like a little, he was like a twelve or thirteen year old kid who had worked in the--who was part of our youth program and came to me.  And he was, out here he was an entertainment lawyer and was doing very well.  So those kind of things, you know, are encouraging.  They make you feel like well, you weren't just spinning your wheels for nothing.  Because believe me, a lot of times you felt that way.  As much as you were committed to what you were doing, sometimes you just felt like what is this is all--what are you accomplishing and is the sacrifice worth it?  You know, because you give up your own life sometimes or a lot of your own relationships that you should be giving more attention to.  But you--as I said, it becomes all engrossing and you spend all of your time thinking about that and working with those issues and--
Speaker 1: So during the time that you were really active in CORE, you had your own business [Anmar Designs (ph.)], right?  And then you went--but, so you'd have to actually take time from your own business to--
Speaker 2: I did.  Actually, and actually I left--eventually closed down the business, even though it was successful, in order to devote my time to CORE and the youth program.
Speaker 1: So CORE had a youth program itself?
Speaker 2: Well, we had a program called the Bronx Community Self Improvement Association [Bronx, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was kind of a--follow- followed up on CORE's--as CORE kind of waned.  We started a youth program.  So there was a little brief overlap there but--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you--were you working with the Bronx--I mean youth program--throughout the, I guess the '70s [1970s] or (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I worked with them until I, until I left Los Angeles--I mean until I left New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: So I guess until maybe about 1969, 1970.
Story_ID: 651987
Speaker 1: Now what made you leave New York [New York] to come to Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, I just really went underground for a while.  I was, it was a district attorney in the Bronx [New York] who just was out to get me.  And he just, he was really, if he could put me under the jail, he would have done it.  And he--
Speaker 1: Now this was who, now?
Speaker 2: A district attorney in the Bronx.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And, so it just--at the time, I had, I think I had kind of done what I could do.  I had outlived my usefulness, you know, where the movement was, where I was able to contribute to it.  And I just thought it was time for me to get away before I got hurt.  I remem- a friend of mine, this guy I was telling you about, Nat [ph.], we used to go fishing all the time at a, at a place in the Bronx, where we could just sit on the rocks and fish out.  And we had a program where we were encouraging, you know, working against the drug traffic in the pr- these projects where he lived--the apartments where he lived, this big apartment complex.  And, so this one day that I was supposed to go meet him, like on a Friday or something and go fishing with him, I didn't go.  And some of these guys who were selling drugs came and found him and beat him, almost killed him.  And he ended up with a metal plate in his head, and I guess I can say it now.  But I started, I had to start carrying a gun.  You know, in New York, you get caught with a gun, and it's--you're done.  You know, they'll put you away for a while.  And I said, "Well, what is, what am I coming to, where I'm--have to walk around carrying a gun?  Because--."  And I said, "It just wasn't--," you know, at that point it was time for me to get away and have a chance to regroup and think about what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now this is the age of--since then have you, have you read about the COINTELPRO [Counterintelligence Program] pro- program out of the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], you know.  It was active in the destruction of the Black Panther Party--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and (unclear) organization and other organizations around the country.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So this is something that, you know--yeah, so this is, this is a real--I mean there're real government forces trying to destroy black activism.  You know, and not for criminal activity, either.  Just for--because they're activists, and they were considered a, you know, were considered a threat by J. Edgar Hoover in those days.  So this is well documented now.  Anybody can read about it, and read the FBI files about it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  As I said, I have that report at home that this young man sent to me, and it just documents a lot of that stuff.  And I mean I haven't read it cover to cover yet, but a lot of the stuff I was reading about where people were just doing all sorts of bizarre things that would be detrimental to the organization they were belonging to.  But then they would blot out stuff, so you couldn't really, couldn't be sure.  But you could assume that they were working on somebody that we have to do these things.  It wasn't just somebody making some bad, bad choices on their own.
Story_ID: 651988
Speaker 1: Did you have contacts out here in Los Angeles [California] when you came out here?
Speaker 2: Not really (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you know anybody?
Speaker 2: Not really.  At the time I came out here I was, really came out here because I was working in the television industry, and I wanted to get some more work opportunities because I actually lived in New Mexico. That's when I left New York [New York], and I went to New Mexico.  And I was there for about five or six years, and I started a catering business [Santa Fe Movie Caterers (ph.)] where I catered for the movie and television industry.
Speaker 1: Really?  A catering business?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So I worked with the, most of the black films that came in.  All of the--they had these Nigger Charley films, I don't know if you remember, all of the Fred Williamson--I worked on all those and worked with Richard Pryor when he came out that way and worked with David Bowie on a film out there.  And, so I stayed fairly busy when I was out there.  But I wanted to, I also wanted to write for film.  So I came, that's why I came to L.A., so I could maybe have closer proximity to the producers and do--continue with the catering and also maybe get some writing opportunities.
Speaker 1: Now that sounds like a great niche to be in.  I mean, how did you, how did you manage that?  Now I've been an extra on movies, and I know how they--caterer is a big part of the set up, you know, feeding the actors (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the reason that I got the opportunity--because I wasn't, I mean I've always been able to cook.  But I wasn't, I didn't have a catering business.  But some of these black folks that came out there just were committed to working with other black people where they could.  And I literally came to Fred when he showed up.  And he was getting--setting up to have a picture, and I came to him with notes scribbled on a yellow legal pad and talked to, talked to him about doing this.  And he said, "Oh, sure."  And I literally went from never doing it to being his caterer for that and I guess we did about three films with him after that.  And then I actually built--you know, these skills I developed while working with, you know, carpentry and stuff like that, worked to my advantage.  Because I had an opportunity to work with British Lion Films [British Lion Films Ltd.; British Lion Films], which is a big company out of the UK [United Kingdom] with David Bowie.  So, but they were going, they were going to want more than what I was able to deliver to--
Speaker 1: To Fred (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Fred.  I mean, we gave him good service and everything, but these folks from the UK, they wanted to see something more substantial.  They weren't--it wasn't just the cigarettes.  They were going to be impressed by what equipment you had.  So I went and found myself a used trailer, and I refitted it into a kitchen.  And I literally, and I, you know, of course, I bent the truth a little bit.  You know, and they called me and asked me what I--I said, "Oh, yeah, I have this wonderful kitchen that I could--," so they wanted me to bring it there.  And I was just rushing to try and get it finished, so I could go and show it to them while they had their people in town.  And I wasn't quite finished with it yet.  I had the outside done, I had most of the inside done.  But I still needed to put some finishing touches on it.  And the lights weren't in and stuff like that.  So I--but they said, "Well, we have to see what you have before we can sign you on."  So I drove it there one--I just waited, and I told them I couldn't come until it was dark (laughter).  So I went there after dark, and I parked in the parking lot of this big Hilton, whatever it was.  And they were really impressed.  I mean, it looked real nice.  It's just if you, if it had been light, they could have seen where there were some things that weren't quite finished.  But I had done a really decent job.  I went and had a big--you know, commercial stove and oven and a grill, griddle and, you know, plenty of cabinet space and a big refrigerator, freezer.  So it was a nice job, when it was finished.  I needed about another half a day or a day to really put the finishing touches on it.
Speaker 1: Is this like a tractor trailer?  I mean a trailer that--
Speaker 2: It's a trailer.  It was like a twenty, maybe a twenty-five foot trailer that you hook up to the back of a, of a truck.
Speaker 1: Those are--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, so anyway, that's how I got that first big job working with them.  And then we worked with a number of others.  And then I brought it here, and I, when I moved to L.A. and I worked, I was the caterer for 'The Jeffersons' for several seasons and worked on, with Redd Foxx on--not the original show ['Sanford and Son'], but his follow up show ['Sanford'].  I forget the name of it right now.  So we did okay out here, but it's like everything else; it's, you know, depends on who you know.
Story_ID: 651989
Speaker 1: And I really wanted to write, that was, that was my main interest.  I wanted to write screen plays, and I had written one.  But it just--I came at the wrong, it was the wrong timing.  You know, it was at the end of the, what they call the blaxploitation films.  And, so they were just not looking for what I had.  But I actually ended up--did selling a piece to Topper Carew.  A friend of mine, he brought me on and I did a lot of work with him.  So he bought one of my scripts and--
Speaker 2: Which one was it?
Speaker 1: Actually, it was a script for his television show that he had called 'Bustin' Loose.'  It was not one of the movie scripts, but he hired me to do a script for him, so I did it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, this is really remarkable (unclear) (laughter).  Well, I laugh listening to this.  This is, this is really, really showing a lot of ingenuity, and--
Story_ID: 651990
Speaker 1: I mean, did you know Fred Williamson at all?  Or did you--?
Speaker 2: No, I just met him when he came in, because I was living in New Mexico.  When he came in there--I just heard he was in town and I went over, went and spoke to him.  And he was, you know, he was--and one of his right hand people, his name was--oh, it'll come to me.  He--oh, what was his name?  I can't think of it right now.  But anyway, I actually bumped into this guy about a year or two ago at a meeting I was at.  And he was one of Fred's right hand people.  And he, I'm sure he had something to do with the decision that was made.  And he told me his story, how he got started in Hollywood as a costume designer.  I think it was with his company, you know.  He said he went and rented a Rolls Royce.  And he said he didn't have any money then, but he just had enough and rented his Rolls Royce and showed up with this Rolls Royce.  Met some film producer and went in and made a, he just made a big--he was just--he's a kind of very theatrical kind of person, kind of flamboyant.  He went in there and just impressed the people so much.  They just thought he was big money, and he's, and he got the job and got lots of work and then did all of Fred's work with him.  So I'm sure that he probably recognized a little bit of me, a little bit, little bit of himself in me.  And if he had any input, he probably said, "Oh, give him a chance, give him a chance, he could probably do it."  And it worked out.  We did good work for him, and he was pleased with everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's a tough industry.  Believe me, it's a--not only is it a tough industry--it was then, and I don't know that it's changed much.  But it was extremely racist, very--the interesting thing is when I worked with the British group [British Lion Films Ltd.; British Lion Films], they loved me, and they were just very, so friendly.  Because I was, you know--and I don't say this disparagingly, but they just, they have a class system in the UK [United Kingdom] that's very--everybody knows about it.  And, you know, they have titles and you have all this kind of stuff.  And I was doing what I was supposed to be doing, which was serving food to them.  So they were happy to have me there, and they loved the food, they loved the service, they loved my attitude.  So I never got any grief out of them at all.  Working with, even with Fred, even though he was the producer and he was the star, 95 percent of their crew was not black.  And they just griped and complained and bitched every, every moment of the day that they could.  And Fred, on a number of occasions, just came to my defense and told them to, you know, shut it down, he didn't want to hear it anymore.  Because, you know, I was doing something, I was taking money, from their perspective, I was taking a job that they could--their people, one of their family members or one of their friends or one of their colleagues could be doing.  So it's--now I'm hoping that's changed a little bit in the years since, but I don't know that it has.
Speaker 1: I wouldn't guess it has changed, has changed a whole lot.  But you know, maybe it has changed some.
Story_ID: 651991
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I remember once I was working on a film.  I'm trying to remember who the lady's name.  What's that actress, well known actress here?  Her name escapes me.  And they were just giving me such a hard time.  I mean, really giving me a hard time.  And she came over to me when I was, and I did everything, I mean I just bent over backwards to try and be accommodating to everybody.  And she came over to me and said, "Tell me how--," and this is a white actress now, and she could have just gone on about her business. And she came over to me and whispered in my ear, and she said she admired me for being so strong.  And she said that they were just doing everything that they could to make me miserable and hoped that I would quit and leave, but just hang in there and, you know, and don't let it get to me.  And, so she was aware of it.  It wasn't like I was imagining all of this.  And I had a number of experiences like that, where I had a, it was a guy, it was a white guy, who lived in New Mexico, and we were friends.  I mean we weren't great buddies and hanging out all the time, but we knew each other.  We'd see each other around town, and we were--always had something to say.  And once he got on this film--he was hired on this film that I was working on.  He wouldn't talk to me, he wouldn't, he didn't want to have anything to do with me.  He just, he was going to--you know, he was going to--whatever the, whatever the larger group was going to do, he was going to be part of that, and not, you know, acknowledge our relationship, our friendship, which is, you know, fine.  I have tough skin, so I did what I had to do and got my paycheck and went about my business.  But it's--it takes a certain kind of--you got to, got to be thick skinned to--not only in that industry, but just in general--to be an African American, especially in my--now maybe it's a little different these days, I don't know.  I'm not young, so I don't know what the young people are going through.  I know they have their own challenges, they have their own--my grandson who works with me, he's back over there now.  But they have their own, you know, crosses to bear.  So I don't know what it's like.  But I know back then if you didn't have a thick skin, you weren't, you couldn't deal with some of this stuff. You would be lost.
Story_ID: 651992
Speaker 1: Now were you still doing any, any pho- photography, or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did photography all along when I was involved in CORE [Congress of Racial Equality].  I used to document a lot of our activities.  And then when I was in the youth program [Bronx Community Self Improvement Association, Bronx, New York], I did that.  And then I continued to do it as I was a freelance writer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so you wrote, you were writing during the '80s [1980s], I guess for--it says here you wrote for Black Enterprise, Ebony, Essence, Black Collegian [The Black Collegian]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Black Elegance, Crisis [The Crisis], Travel and Leisure, the Brides, Circle [Family Circle] and, you know, and a number of other publications.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you were really busy.
Speaker 2: I was very busy.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I used to speak at some of these writers clubs.  And one of the things about many of the writers clubs and writers is that they kind of like to get together and tell their war stories and their horror stories.  And there's this myth that writers love solitude and that they are just destined to have a life of rejection and disappointment and that the triumphs will be few and far between.  And I eventually got, you know, tired of being around that kind of negative attitude, and I stopped, I stopped doing it.  Because I, literally now, I'm not saying I made a lot of money.  I could have certainly, would have liked to have made more money.  But I was working, you know, as much as I wanted.  I was working twenty-four hours a day if I wanted to.  I would be fi- you know, people would be talking about their writer's block, and they need to go sit at the beach and deal with their muse and all this kind of stuff.  And I would be printing one story--we used to use these old dot matrix printers.  And I would be printing one story.  And while that's printing, I'm already started on my next--I mean, that's how busy I was.  I didn't have any time to be contemplating anything.  I just--and needed to make deadlines.  And, so I kind of eventually stopped with the--going to these writers clubs, because I just felt it wasn't benefitting me.  I don't, I don't know that I was necessarily benefitting them because I had such a different perspective than they did.
Story_ID: 651993
Speaker 1: Now in '81 [1981], the National Coalition of Black Meeting Planners was formed.  Were you a part of that at all?  Were you (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually it was '83 [1983]--
Speaker 1: Eighty-three [1983]?
Speaker 2: --when they started, yeah.
Speaker 1: Eighty-three [1983], right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And I wasn't there for the first one.  But Black Enterprise called me and asked me would I do--cover their conference, I think the next one, '84 [1984].  It was either '84 [1984] or '85 [1985] was going to be Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And since I was here, would I cover that?  So I did go to cover that and participated.  And they had--it was not a large group.  It was maybe--well, let's put it this way.  When it was all over, we all sat around in a circle of chairs and kind of had a wrap-up session.  So there might have been twenty, twenty-five people altogether.  And the person who was in charge of that was Howard Mills [Howard F. Mills, Sr.].  Howard Mills was the founder, one of the founders, and also he was the meeting planner for the Urban League [National Urban League].  And, so it was very enlightening.  And as I remember, I think [HistoryMaker] Randall Robinson was there.  It was--
Speaker 1: Randall Robinson of TransAfrica [TransAfrica Forum; TransAfrica]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I believe he was there for that one.  And it was, and it was good.  It gave me--kind of introduced me to the industry, which I was not that much aware about.  It's funny how things go full circle.  Part of the whole media industry is going to trade shows and conventions, trade shows and setting up a booth.  When I was working at this textile firm, they--for whatever reason, I'm not sure why they picked me.  Maybe I was the only one available.  They always asked me to go set up their trade show booth.  And I had no training, but I, you know, they knew I had some kind of artistic ability.  So I used to go set up these trade shows, never ever realizing that some- someday I'd be in that industry and working, working with it all the time.  But it's just interesting how these things come around and fall, you know, fall in your lap when you least expect them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So at a certain point, Mr. Mills made you the off- unofficial publicist and photographer for the group, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He asked me to help him get--you know, put out press releases and take pictures of their activities and do whatever I could to spread the word about what he was doing.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you were at the rest, the rest of those meetings for how long?
Speaker 2: I meant--to almost all of them.  I haven't missed--I'd say in all the years, I've probably maybe missed, maybe missed--and if I could, I just missed one here they just had in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] a couple weeks ago, I couldn't get there.  But I probably missed maybe eight or ten of the ones since then.  And they, they had them twice a year up until last year, and last year was the first time they only had one a year.
Story_ID: 651994
Speaker 1: In the meantime, you were like, you're basically making your living as a freelance writer (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what kind of articles are you writing?  Are they, are they business oriented, or are they--
Speaker 2: Well, I ran the gamut.  I've always been taught or, you know, as I say, I'm self-taught.  So when I read about articles and books--what it said, you start with something you know about.  So the very first article I ever wrote was for a magazine called Cat Fancy [Catster].  And I wrote an article about building cat trees.  I knew how to do it, I had made some.  Because at one point, which I didn't go into it--but I used to have also, for a short time I had a pet store.  And, so I used to make our own pet, you know, pet products--some of our own pet products.  And, so I knew how to do that.  I wrote them, and they were interested and--
Speaker 1: Now was the pet store in New Mexico.  I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: In New Mexico, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's what I did.  I did a story, I took my own pictures--step by step how to build it.  How, you know, I gave them templates for--and that was my first piece I did.  So I did things from that.  But I would say most of the stuff I did tended to be business oriented.  And a lot of stuff I did for like the Black Legion was--had to do with education and career opportunities.  And Black Enterprise was almost always business.  I did some pieces on the automotive industry for them.  And then I also did a lot of work for the Hollywood Reporter.  I did--it was entertainment industry pieces.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What organizations did you like to write about, write for the most?  I mean what were your favorite ones?
Speaker 2: What--
Speaker 1: Publications and magazines, which ones did you--
Speaker 2: I always preferred writing for some of the black publications, just because they would--I mean I thought it would do some good, and it was not just a paycheck.  I thought it would--I felt like I was accomplishing something and that I was having an impact on our community.  And, so Black Enterprise--I did a little bit for Ebony, not a whole lot for Ebony, but mainly I did a lot for Black Enterprise.  I did some--wrote for Essence and--
Speaker 1: Do you remember who your contact was at Black Enterprise?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I had several.  Kenneth Smikle [HistoryMaker Ken Smikle], Alfred Edmond [HistoryMaker Alfred Edmond, Jr.]--I think Alfred's now--he's the head man there.  And Ken has his own publication called Target Market News.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And one other guy, Matt, Matthew [ph.]--what's his name?  Maybe it'll come back to me.
Story_ID: 651995
Speaker 1: So we were just talking about some of the people that you came in contact with at Black Enterprise, Black Collegian [The Black Collegian].  I guess you knew [HistoryMaker] Kala- Kalamu ya Salaam and some of the other (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, and also a young lady, Sonya Stinson, I used to work with her there.  In fact, she wrote for me up until about a year ago.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is--now that sounds like a pretty good life, you know.  You make--you're able to write and without any blocks or anything (laughter).  So let's see.  Now in 1990, now tell me if I'm going to fast, jumping ahead too much.  But in 1990, you and a business partner launched The Black Con- Convention [The Black Convention], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is a monthly magazine.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, so tell us why, and what was the focus of it?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, Howard had been for--Howard Mills [Howard F. Mills, Sr.] from the coalition [National Coalition of Black Meeting Planners]--had been urging me for the longest time to try and put together a magazine to address the needs of the African American meeting planner and hospitality professional.  And of course it was--I had never published before, even though I had done a lot of writing.  So that was a whole new industry for me.  And also, it was during a recession, a very bad recession during that period of time.  So, but in any event, I was doing a story for one of the general market publications.  And that was around 1989 or thereabouts, '88 [1988], '89 [1989].  And there was a boycott of Arizona going on at the time because they had refused to acknowledge the Martin Luther King birthday [Martin Luther King Jr. Day].  So I'm doing a telephone interview with the president of the bureau, convention and visitors bureau.  And of course, when I'm doing a telephone interview, unless the people know me, they don't know who I am.  They don't know if I'm black or what I am.  And I, and I also, when I'm rea- if I'm writing for Black Enterprise, I know who my audience is.  And, so I'm going to write, you know, with one focus.  If I'm writing for a general market, well, I'm writing for a different audience.  So anyway he didn't know I was black, and I wasn't trying to write a black story.  I was just writing a story that I was given, an assignment I was given about Arizona.  And, so I was not going to make the whole boycott thing a major part of my article, although I was trying to figure out how to get it in there without, you know, because, you know, a lot of times people don't--in a destination--don't want to talk about if they're being boycotted.  They don't want to draw attention to it.  So about halfway through the interview, he volunteers.  He said, well, one of the things he's hoping is the boycott ends soon, because they've lost, whatever, $25 million and groups pulling out.  So I said, "Fine."  So I put in his little comment, a sentence or two, and went on with the rest of the story.  When I sent it to the editor, submitted it, the editor said, "Oh, nobody's interested in that.  That's old news."  And he just took it out.  And that was kind of the story that broke the camel's back.  I figured well, now, first of all, the president is the one that raised the question.  I didn't ask the question, and he felt it was important enough to include it in his comments.  And it was relevant, even to a general market audience, I think--audience, it was relevant.  But anyway, that was the kind of thing that said, "Well, maybe I need to sit down and talk with Howard about this.  Because this may be the time--if we can't tell our stories, we can't rely on other people to tell them for us."  So that was kind of the thing that pushed me to do it at that particular point and time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, how did this, how did the magazine do?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, it was difficult, it was challenging.  For that matter, it's still challenging.  But we had some folks that belonged to the coalition that I--by this time I had gotten to know, who wanted to see it happen.  And, so they did something that people very seldom do in this industry and almost never do.  And that is that they made some commitments before anything was done and some of them even paid in front.  Now you don't--in the, in the magazine industry, the drill is you send somebody their tear sheets and an invoice and then they pay you.  Tear sheets are the things that come out of the magazine that show that their ad is run.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They don't pay you before that's done, because you could take the money and run.  And believe me, people have done it.  But we had some people who were just committed to seeing this magazine come to life.  And, so we had a few of them that were, made that commitment and just--we didn't have a lot of funds, but we had enough to do what we had to do and get that first issue out there.  And we started out, I think we did, we did one issue in I think November, and then we did--the next one was in January.  Something like that because we were, we didn't try and do it, start out as a monthly.  And then at some point after the first couple of issues were out then we went to a monthly.  And we did that for a while until advertising revenue really kind of died after 9/11 [September 11, 2001].  And that's when we, somewhere around that time, we went to a bimonthly.
Speaker 1: So 2001, that's when it went bimonthly?
Speaker 2: Some- somewhere around there, may have been a little before that.
Story_ID: 651996
Speaker 1: Now you were involved in a Bill Cosby book project, too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wrote a biography of Bill Cosby.  I had a cowriter, but I actually did the writing.  George Hill, Dr. George Hill, he's kind of compiled a lot of the information, did a lot of the research.  And I did some as well, but he did the majority of the research.  And then I took it on, put it together into a book.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was the title of the biography?
Speaker 2: It was--I think it just said 'Bill Cosby.'  In fact, I may have a copy in there.  I'll see if I--
Speaker 1: Just 'Bill Cosby'?
Speaker 2: I think it just said, 'Bill Cosby.'
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.  And was it, how was the book received?  And--
Speaker 2: It was received--I mean it's--it was not your standard kind of a book deal where you--I mean I was paid, but I wasn't paid a huge amount.  And then once, once the--you get your money, you're done with it.  So they, whatever they market, you know, you don't get any royalties or anything in addition.  So I was paid a flat, a flat fee for it.  And people that I talked to that saw the book said they enjoyed it, and they thought it was good.  But I really have no idea how many copies they eventually sold, or how it did in terms of--profit wise.
Speaker 1: Now this is an unofficial biography of Bill Cosby, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't do it with his--he didn't, I mean he, I don't know if he was necessarily against it, but he didn't, he didn't participate.
Speaker 1: Did you get any feedback from Bill Cosby at all when you wrote it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nothing.
Story_ID: 651997
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-four [1994], you launched Black Meetings and Tourism magazine.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now this is, this is different from Black Convention magazine [The Black Convention] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And what's--explain the difference, and what you were trying to do with Black Meetings and Tourism?
Speaker 2: Well, the difference--there's not so much a difference in the magazine as there is difference in the ownership.  We just had to go our separate ways, my partner.  And we just had different interests and different ethical, (laughter) ethics that--by which we operated.  So that's why we started the new magazine.  And my wife--actually, I got started by myself.  But then my wife came in later on and left her job as a, as a teacher and worked with us and still works with us, although she's in the process of retiring now.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now where did you meet your wife?  This is just, this would be your second wife, right, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, actually, this is my third wife.  My second passed.  I was divorced from my first wife, and my second wife passed.  She was in an automobile accident and was killed.  So, but we've been married--Gloria [Gloria Herbert] and I have been married now for thirty-one, almost thirty-two years.  And I met her in church, at a church here in Los Angeles [California], called Guidance Church [Guidance Church of Religious Science].  And we have a little (laughter), a little amusing thing that we do about that.  When we went to church there was one seat, literally one seat or one of very few seats available, and it was next to me.  And, so she had been waiting outside for a friend of hers to come, a young lady, and she didn't show.  So she came in, and they directed her to sit next to me.  And of course when I tell the story, I always say the church was empty, and she just came over and sat next to me.  So she gets a kick out of that. But I'm admitting here and now that her version of the story is true.  But anyway, that's where we met and--best thing that ever happened to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she's a, she was a teacher at the time and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --then she became an integral part of the magazine.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: She was a--taught special ed [special education].
Story_ID: 651998
Speaker 1: Black Meetings and Tourism magazine.  Now is this magazine competing with Black Convention [The Black Convention]?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, it--that went out of business.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And, well, tell us about your distribution and who you're trying to target with the magazine and--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and content.
Speaker 2: Well, our distribution is mainly to (cough) meeting planners and association executives--folks who plan meetings, conferences, trade shows--and also to travel agents and tour operators and group travel leaders who plan different kind of travel activities.  And then maybe 5 percent or so of it goes to just people who are in the industry, in the hospitality industry, who just want to stay abreast of what's happening in the industry, but they don't necessarily plan travel.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what kind of information would be in a typical issue?
Speaker 2: Well, we have everything.  We have what we call destination pieces, which are--we'll profile Birmingham, Alabama or maybe a whole state, State of Ohio or Northern California.  And we talk about, we pr- try and provide information that any meeting planner or incentive planner or somebody, travel agent, would need to know if they wanted to book some business there or to plan a meeting there.  So just general information and contact information.  So if they want to go further and delve further, they could do that and call or go on the web.  And we als- what makes our different, our magazine different than general market magazines, is we do everything from a black perspective.  Now granted, black folks are looking for some of the same things that anybody else is looking for.  They want good service.  They want, you know, good hotel rooms.  They want ample meeting space.  They want access, you know, transportation, all those kind of things.  But they also tend to want to look at the culture and heritage and historic points of interest that relate to their culture and their history and their existence.  So that's what we, that's the ingredient in our magazine that's different than what you find in general market magazines.  We always have that when we talk about attractions and places of interest.  We always make sure to include things that they would need to know or that they would want to know about, about African American history and culture and about places to get--eat a good meal or that kind of thing.  That's, that's one aspect of what we do.  Then we do, we normally have some piece, or more than one piece, about venues--something about hotels, something about meeting space.  So we might do a piece about, entitled 'Meeting at the Beach' where we're talking about if you want to take your conference and be on a beachfront location, here's some great places to go and, you know, what they offer in terms of meeting space and what amenities they have, and what attractions are nearby.  Or we might do, and then we also try and to some sort of, something that's going to be provocative, to deal with diversity or to deal with opportunities--or lack of opportunities--for people of color.  But one of the things we've decided to do is not to use--and there's plenty of room for criticism out there.  But rather than to be critical of those people who aren't doing the right thing, and there's a lot of them, unfortunately too many of them, we try to focus and highlight on those people that are doing well and encourage our readers to support them with business.  And hopefully, and it has had that effect on some--that those who are, that are not doing what they ought to doing--or not doing as much as they should be doing--want to get that kind of acknowledgement and that business and that recognition.  So it has encouraged some people to do more.  But it's still a long way to go in this industry.  It's really, I mean I don't know if this is the right time to go into that, but we have--there are close to five hundred convention and visitors bureaus across the nation.  I don't know, how many you think are run by people of color or African Americans?  Eight of them out of five hundred.  And one of them here fortunately is in New York--I mean is in Los Angeles [California].  But that means that there are 492 or thereabouts that aren't run by--now I'm not saying that the people that are running the other ones are not competent and shouldn't have those positions.  But certainly I would like to think that, you know, our representation in the leadership positions would be, you know, in line with our instance in the population.  And we're certainly more than 8 percent or not even 8 percent.  That's like whatever--2 percent or something like that--of the--who's out there.  So I would, I would like to think that that's going to improve with time.  And I haven't seen a lot of, haven't seen a great deal of improvement.  It's actually gone down in recent years.  It used to be as many as maybe eleven, at one time.  So it's gone down.  And the, in the hotel sector, it isn't much better.  It's like fifty-five thousand hotels, and there's less than a hundred black general managers.  So there's a lot of, a lot of room for improvement.  And that's one of our primary missions, is to try and encourage that and be a catalyst for that, for that--those improvements and that kind of movement in our industry.

Speaker 1: So your ad revenue comes from your, it's streamed from--your ads come from pri- primarily--?
Speaker 2: Primarily from destinations and primarily from the Southeast.  Most of the, most of the destination, many of the destinations in the South have some sort of historical significance in the black community.  So places like Birmingham [Alabama] that used to be where you wouldn't, wouldn't want to, wouldn't want to go, unless you just absolutely had to now they are one of the most aggressive in reaching out to the African American community and promoting their, you know, the place where the church, where the four little children passed--were bombed or--
Speaker 1: 16th Street [16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And Kelly Ingram Park [Birmingham, Alabama], where they used to have the--a lot of the Civil Rights Movement's--and they were attacked by the police dogs.  So they've turned this sad history into an attraction and have used it to promote to African Americans.  So most of our advertising that we, that we get comes from that region of the country.  I mean we do get some from other parts, but that's--the majority of it comes from there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the South, Atlanta [Georgia], Birmingham, I guess--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Florida (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sav- Savannah [Georgia], Florida.
Story_ID: 652000
Speaker 1: What's the most pop- popular destination in the U.S. for African American travelers?  Do you have a sense of it?
Speaker 2: Well, Atlanta [Georgia] is certainly one.  And I think they deserve it.  I think, because of the--what they have, what they offer there.  And Atlanta is one of the destinations--although it doesn't have a black president at the bureau there--has been one of the--the convention and visitors bureau [Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau] has done, probably has the most diverse staff.  In fact, it really started with [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young, when he was the mayor there.  And he challenged the convention and visitors bureau and told them that if they didn't start sharing the wealth with African Americans and other people of color--in other words, directing some of their marketing dollars and hiring people of color--that he was going to cut off their bed tax.  Because that's where most of these bureaus get their financing or a major part of their financing from.  And when he did that, he just changed the face.  And, now they have one of the more diverse staffs, number of vice presidents and directors and have a great, great product.  And they're really engaged in the African American community, and reach out for them and want--welcome them and invite them to come.  So I think that they--another one, which is kind of at the other end of the spectrum, is Las Vegas [Nevada].  Las Vegas is very popular amongst African Americans because of the attractions that it has and the over the top, you know, resorts and--great place to visit and everything.  But they do almost nothing to reach out to the African American community.  And, so, you know, I have mixed emotions.  I know that on the one hand, you want to go there and have a great time and have a good conference.  Whenever they have conferences there, the attendance is much better than in many other places and, so many things to do and see, and you're going to have fun.  But it kind of--they're getting a lot of this business by default because African Americans aren't as discerning as they need to be.  I mean, I believe that we need to support people who support us.  And if--you can go into those places around there, you don't find a whole lot of black people working in the hotels, in most of the hotels.  There are a few exceptions, but most of them are not--the hotel brands don't have black presidents or don't have high ranking officials.  And yet, we flock there to take advantage of all those other things that it does offer.  So that's something that needs to change.  I'm not sure if I know what the answer is to that because that money is--you know, they're interested in making money and they, and I don't fault them for that.  I don't, I don't--that's what the business is about.  But I do think that along with that comes a responsibility.  And I don't feel that folks in Las Vegas have lived up to their responsibility to, to work with the communities of color.
Story_ID: 652001
Speaker 1: What about overseas destinations?  Which ones are the most pop- popular for African Americans (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I would say probably in Africa--Senegal and South Africa and Ghana.  Those are probably the three top destinations there, although there are many places that are really wonderful to visit.  In South America, I would say Brazil might be the most popular.  And maybe in Central America, maybe Guyana is real popular.  And then in--and Ja- and Jamaica and the Caribbean and the Bahamas, the U.S. Virgin Islands are probably the three top Caribbean destinations.  And Europe, I guess it's probably Paris [France] because they're, they are, I mean--you know, most of Europe has some very fascinating and beautiful architecture and stuff, but I think Paris has developed--in fact we have some friends over there who have tour companies that take visitors around to black Paris.  So I think that's--a lot of, a lot of people go there--African Americans go there.  They try and partake in some of those tours and find out what, you know, Paul Robeson and some of these people have done, what lured them to Paris--and Josephine Baker and people like that. So--
Speaker 1: Now do you get a chance to take junkets to check out--
Speaker 2: I used to travel a lot more than I do now.  I go to--but more often than not, I go to the, to the Caribbean.  I used to go to Africa a lot.  I haven't been in a couple of years.  It's just kind of difficult to get away and, so we usually send writers and--to represent the magazine [Black Meetings and Tourism].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean, I used to travel like six months out of the year.  And it just--now maybe all told, a month.

Speaker 1: I know the National Baptist Convention [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.] is the largest black organization in the country, and it has been for years, if not the world.  What are the some of the--do they, you know, when they come to a city, do they really spend a lot of money or--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I mean, anytime you have that many people anyplace, they're going to spend a lot of money.  It's--I mean their spending patterns may be a little different than say, the Essence Music Festival.  Because people come there prepared with--you know, they save up and they have their fat wallets, and they come there and they're ready to really party and spend a lot of dollars.  A lot of times people going to the religious conferences--while they have to spend because they need accommodations, they need to eat, they need--but they're not necessarily as free spenders as, you know, the Essence Music Festival or some other festivals.  But nevertheless when you have that number of people anyplace, they spend a lot of money.  And there are a number of them, it's not just that.  We--in fact, we do a piece--and I can give it to you when we have another break--the twenty-five largest conventions.  And it's probably the top eight or ten of them are all religious conventions.
Speaker 1: I wou- I wouldn't have guessed that.  I would have thought the National Baptist Convention would be big, but would I never have guessed that.  I would have thought that maybe the sor- sororities--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --or the fraternities.
Speaker 2: One of the biggest is the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority].  Deltas, they had one of the biggest--I think it was in Las Vegas [Nevada], too.  They had like a luncheon for twenty-five thousand in one place at one time, and that's huge.  And they went into, I think it was Macy's, but I may be wrong on that.  They had set up a shopping excursion to go to Macy's.  And they cleaned, actually cleaned the shelves.  There was nothing left (laughter), practically when they finished with that. So they, yeah--those ladies, they like to shop anyway.  But when the Deltas take over a town, they take it over.
Story_ID: 652003
Speaker 1: Now you were saying when we first came in and started talking, before we started the interview, that black people travel more so now than probably other people.
Speaker 2: Yes.  When we, when we went to, we used to do a big pavilion at the Congressional Black Caucus every, every September.  And the year that--9/11, 2001 [September 11, 2001], it happened just before the Black Caucus.  And, so we went there, not knowing what to expect.  And almost every, you know--all of the traffic was the same.  And we talked to people and they said, oh, they had been planning that all along, and they weren't going to stop because of this thing with the World Trade Centers [sic. World Trade Center, New York, New York].  And a lot of them felt--you know, and this is not to in any way downplay what happened on 9/11 because believe me, that was very tragic and a lot of people lost their lives, and I feel very bad about that and, you know.  But a lot of people in our community feel well, you know, this stuff we've been dealing with for a long time.  It's--the larger community has never really been threatened about their, you know, their lives or physical--you know, threats.  Black folk, black folks have been dealing with that, and certainly in the South, for many years.  And places like New York [New York] and Chicago [Illinois] and other places--dealing with that just from each other, unfortunately, and from the police.  So that--what happened on 9/11 wasn't, didn't have a major impact on us, in terms of stopping us from traveling because we're kind of used to that.  Maybe not that particular event but used to dealing with, you know, security stuff--and just kept on traveling.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean I guess one of the aspects of that that's sort of a surprise to me is the disposable income that blacks have that you would not imagine, because of the economic conditions of the black community, with all the joblessness and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I'm not sure if there's a clear answer to that.  I think a lot of the people who are, who were traveling before are still traveling because they have the funds.  And a lot of the people who couldn't afford to travel before are traveling now.  But what happens with black folks, especially when it's a major trip, like to Africa or, and for some folks, even going to the Caribbean is a major getaway.  They'll save for a long time for that.  It becomes an important part of, you know, their budgeting.  And they may save for two or three or four or five years to have this vacation of a lifetime.  And it may be, you know, for some people, maybe the only kind of vacation like that they'll ever have.  So that's in the plans.  Unless they just absolutely need the money for something else, they're going to continue flowing with that plan and go, follow through with that vacation.
Story_ID: 652004
Speaker 1: Now in '98 [1998], the National Association of Black Hotel Owners, Operators and Developers, NA- NAB- NABHOOD [National Association of Black Hotel Owners, Operators and Developers, Inc.]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --is deve- is formed.  And what is their relationship to what you do?
Speaker 2: Well, I was part of that organization and the founding.  We used to have a multicultural tourism conference, and that's how it started out.  And it was always in Fort Lauderdale [Florida].  And the challenge in our segment of the community is that many of the organizations that have tried to have conferences and conventions have just not gotten the support from the larger community.  I think I might have mentioned earlier about the ITAS, organization of travel agents [InterAmerican Travel Agents Society].  They were the, I mean, the oldest.  They were formed about sixty years ago in Henderson [Henderson Travel Service].  And they could never get the level of support--granted, they weren't as big as ASTA [American Society of Travel Agents], but nevertheless they could not get the support.  And they eventually had to go under.  I sat on the welcoming committee here for ASTA one year.  And one company, Universal Studios [Universal Studios Inc.], put up nine hundred thousand dollars in cash and in kind support, to support this conference coming in.  Now of course, they bring in four or five thousand people.  Well, only ITAS maybe brought in three or four hundred people, but they were getting maybe ninety thousand dollars, which is maybe 10 percent of what ASTA was getting.  They might, they were lucky if they could get ten thousand dollars from somebody, or they couldn't even get enough--they had to have meals that went unsponsored.  So for whatever reason, these organizations don't get the kind of support--so I'm getting off track a little bit.  But in Fort Lauderdale--so we were having this meeting because there were no other meetings who were really addressing this.  There was one actually in New Orleans [Louisiana] for a number of years, and I actually sat on that planning committee and that board.  And they eventually had to give it up because they weren't getting any support for that.  So Fort Lauderdale, we tried it there and for about two or three years we did it.  But just--we didn't have the hook that was bringing in the dollars and the, and the support that we needed.  But what we did do was start involving and having a segment that dealt with ho- dealt with, dealt with, rather, hotel development.  And that's kind of how we got started.  And we were just sitting around at one of the conferences and there were some people in the room, and we just started brainstorming.  And they decided, "Well, let's try this."  And the next year, we actually had a formal--we formed an organization, formed a board and actually had it devoted to hotel development.  And then we had a segment just for multicultural tourism.  So that's how it got started.  And I'm still on the board and still active with them.
Story_ID: 652005
Speaker 1: Now 2- 2002, you were hired as executive producer of 'Globetrotting' for BET Jazz [BET on Jazz; BET J]?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, that was our show, we created that show.  So I was the executive producer, and my wife [Herbert's third wife, Gloria Herbert] was a producer as well.  And, so we did--what happened was we had actually had on--in the works in 2000.  And we had, oh, maybe about a dozen locations lined up who wanted to, us to come and shoot the show in their destinations.  And then 2001 happened, and everybody backed out except U.S. Virgin Islands and Balti- not Baltimore--Maryland, rather.  So we went forward with it, two shows.  We did the U.S. Virgin Islands first and then we did the Baltimore, Mar- Maryland show.  And we did two hour long shows that appeared on BET Jazz.
Story_ID: 652006
Speaker 1: So the travel show for BET ['Globetrotting'] only--it just ran a short period of time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was just a short period of time.  And we've kind of had it on the back burner ever since, though.  But there's some new--renewed interest in now.  So we're tuning up, and we may be doing a couple of new shows in the next, in 2014.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now in 2004, you published an, you wrote an article that appeared in the L.A. Sentinel [Los Angeles Sentinel] entitled, 'African American Travelers Taken for Granted.'  And I think you kind of addressed some of it, but what were you, what were you saying?
Speaker 2: Well, I was talking about Las Vegas [Nevada] earlier.  There are some destinations that just feel that we're going to come, and they don't have to address this market.  We're going to be there anyway, and the truth of the matter is, we do.  We do go places, and it seems like the higher the occupancy hotel rate they have, the less they're inclined to reach out to African Americans or people of color.  And New York [New York], you know, is the perfect example of one that enjoys a lot of visitation from African Americans, but there's just no effort made to reach out to the market because they don't feel there's a need.  And, so that's what that was all about.  And, you know, as more--that's why we feel it's so important to have people of color in leadership positions.  They don't have to be in charge of everything, but certainly they need to have diversity of views in the boardroom and in these executive committees.  Because if we're not there to tell a different, provide a different perspective on life and on business, it's not going to be there, and it's just going to be business as usual.
Story_ID: 652007
Speaker 1: So I take it you think that the, that the future of black travel is bright in terms of black folks, you know, getting out of this country or traveling around the country?
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely, sure, yes.  And we're--I mean travel is such an enlightening and educational thing.  And the more you travel, the more you realize how much you have in common with people.  And one of the real eye opening experiences for me--when I first went to South Africa, it was right after apartheid ended, shortly after apartheid ended.  And, you know, in this country, African Americans are told a certain thing about Africans, how they view us and how they think of us.  And Afri- Africans are told that we think of them a certain way.  And, so there's this suspicion and this aloofness that we have and we, and it shouldn't be.  I mean, we're from, all of us can trace our roots back to Africa.  And we--there should be a connection there.  But there isn't as much of a connection as there ought to be.  So, anyway, the first time I went to South Africa, I went and I was one of only a handful of black folks who went to this particular conference.  It's a big conference called Indaba [Africa's Travel Indaba].  And it's always in, what is the name of this destination?  Oh, I can't think of the city, the city's name right now.  But when I went to the, into the convention center--and I maybe saw--and there's thousands of people there maybe.  And I could count on two hands the black travel agents that I saw that had come from the states or other places around the world.  Most of the vendors were not black, even though this is Africa.  Although there were some, but I would say probably 95 percent of the vendors were not black.  But we did see a lot of blacks who were the maintenance people.  All around the convention center there were black, mainly women but some men, too who were, you know, sweeping the floors and emptying the trash and that kind of stuff.  And when I walked in and they saw me, they just kind of, you know, and you could see that they were looking at you and they didn't know what to think, and they were whispering back and forth.  And, so I just started speaking to all of them.  And by the time this thing was over, three or four days--I mean we--I wouldn't say we were all fast friends and knew everybody's, you know, last name--but we were just speaking and smiling and talking and having conversations.  It's just a matter of educating and learning that a lot of that stuff that's been put out there--some of it intentionally to keep us separated and some just out of ignorance and not knowing any better--needs to be, we need to cut past all that and, so that's what travel does for me and does for a lot of people.  And I think that the con- conversation I've had with people who had a chance to go to Africa or to South America or to Central America or to the Caribbean--particularly where you can see large numbers of black folks--has always been very positive.  And very seldom have I heard anybody say anything negative.  And if it is negative, it's usually because they didn't make the effort--or people at the destination--to cut past all of those pre- you know, stereotypical views that they have.  They never cut past that, and when they don't, you don't get past that and, you know, you have to deal with that separation and that curtain's between us.
Story_ID: 652008
Speaker 1: How large a staff do you have [for Black Meetings and Tourism]?
Speaker 2: We have about six people here in house, and then we have some people on the outside.  We have--one of our sales- salespeople lives in Louisiana, and then we have our graphics person who lives in Los Angeles [California], but he doesn't work in the office here.  And then we have a couple of other outside salespeople as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what are you, what are your plans for future growth, and where do you see yourself like ten years from now?
Speaker 2: Well, we're doing--well, you know, because the print industry has kind of been under some fire--and that has kind of changed the way we do business.  We're doing a lot more stuff online these days and focusing a lot more on social media.  So that's where our real growth area is right now; we're working on that.  We're just wrapping up on a big program we did with Virginia Beach [Virginia], where we ran some editorial online and had a contest.  And we just awarded a weekend getaway for a meeting planner and his guest in Virginia Beach, which he's going to be going in March.  So that's the kind of stuff we're working on.  And we're getting a lot of interest, more interest from our clients and potential clients.  And also we're doing more event activities.  A couple of years ago, we actually did--a host- a hosted buyer program for the Caribbean Tourism Organization in New York [New York] where we qualified and screened meeting planners and travel agents and meeting planners from around the country.  And we brought them into New York, had them, had one to one meetings with suppliers who supported the program.  So we're doing more of that.  We have negotiating right now with a couple of places to do some more things for them this year--this coming year, I should say.
Story_ID: 652009
Speaker 1: I was asking you when I came in, too, about the--your board position on NABHOOD [National Association of Black Hotel Owners, Operators and Developers, Inc.], which we just talked about the founding of.  As we sit here today, how many black owned facilities are there that can, you know, deal with a major convention?
Speaker 2: There's about five hundred now.  When we started NABHOOD--and we kind of had this conversation before. I know there were a lot of different, little small properties here and there.  But there was one major property that was considered a black owned convention hotel--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --owned by a guy down in New Orleans [Louisiana].  And then there was the Howard Inn in--at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and that's where we started from, seventeen, eighteen years ago.  And, now there's five hundred now.  Granted, about 125 or 30 [130] of them are owned by Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson].  But even still, it's come a long way in a short time, relatively short time.  Of course, there's a lot, a lot of room for growth there.  Because as I said, there's fifty, fifty-five thousand hotels.  And int- interestingly enough, I don't know if you know, but Asian--there's an organization called AAHOA, Asian American Hotel Owners Association [Asian American Hotel Owners Association, Inc.].  They started a few years before NABHOOD and, now they own like 40 or 50 percent of all the hotels in the U.S.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yes, and they're mainly East Indians, and they just came over.  It's like one group, one family, bought a hotel.  And they lived there and they worked and then they invested their money and kept on.  Now they own about 40 to 50 percent of all hotels.
Speaker 1: It is even kind of a little joke or rhyme down south about a Patel hotel, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: A Patel motel, you know, the--
Speaker 2: So one of the, one of the AAHOA board members is also--sits on our board.  And we work with them as closely as we can, and we're trying to learn from their experience.  And some of that has helped us in our progress.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a movie with Denzel Washington ['Mississippi Masala'] where he's--he meets an Indian woman down south and they start dating.  That's (laughter) the family operates a motel, you know, motel down south, yeah.
Story_ID: 652010
Speaker 1: Your family's involved in the organization right, working--your wife [Herbert's third wife, Gloria Herbert] and your son [Solomon Herbert II], right?
Speaker 2: My wife, my son, he's--does a lot of our graphics, he does the cover.  We have somebody who actually lays out the magazine [Black Meetings and Tourism], but he does the covers.  He does the--whenever we have to create ads or we have to create graphics for documents or marketing tools, he does all that.  And then my grandson, he works here.  And then my--I have a couple of--my brother [William Herbert, Jr.] writes for us from time to time.  And I have some nieces that write for us from time to time, and a cousin that writes for us from time to time.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, all right.  Now, there's a, I notice you all have an affinity for birds here, (laughter) right?
Speaker 2: Well, we like birds.
Speaker 1: Who's the bird aficionado?
Speaker 2: I'm the one, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: We actually have them at home and then we take care of Gloria's mother.  And Gloria's mother, we're preparing to move her into our house.  And she's not a bird person, she's not a pet person.  So we just figured at her age, we don't want to try and have any--the shock of moving into a house with birds squawking.  So we moved them here.
Story_ID: 652011
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: In terms of business?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, may- maybe prepared a little better for this, for this change.  We were not ahead of the curve.  We should have been ahead of the curve.  We didn't really see the, or acknowledge the change, the digital change taking place in front of us.  And I think we, if we had thought about it--we have a guy that works with us, a brilliant marketing person.  And he says you should always be thinking about three or four or five years ahead.  What are things going to look like in three years?  What are they going to look like in five years?  And that's what you should be planning for--not how are you going to deal with next week, or how are you going to deal with next month?  And had we had him with us then or been--you know, had that frame of mind--we probably would have been a little better prepared to make the transition to more digital and not relied so much on print [of Black Meetings and Tourism].  I mean print is still viable, and it's still going to be around.  But we--there's some missed opportunities we probably had.  And also I'm just learning--I mean, you know, these young people walk around here, like my grandson who just left here a minute ago.  You ask him anything about smart phones or something, I mean I'm still walking around with a dumb phone, you know, it just, all it does is takes phone calls.  It doesn't take pictures, it doesn't have any apps or any of that stuff.  And I'm going to eventually have to, you know, plunge in and do that because I understand there's a lot of stuff that I should be doing.  But I remember when I first started freelancing, I had an electric typewriter.  And even before that, I had a, just a little manual typewriter.  And then computers came out, and it took me a couple of years before I finally broke down and got a computer.  And it wasn't the money--it just was, I just didn't want to take the time to learn.  It just seemed like it was so complicated.  And after I finally got the first computer, which I might--we still have it around here.  We don't use it anymore.  I mean, like by today's standards, flash drives have more--ten times as much memory as that little thing.  It had like sixty megabytes, and you couldn't even put the programs in.  You had to put the disk in and turn it on, and then take them out and, you know, you--but anyway, but after I--even with the limitations it had--when I found out what I could do, and how instead of how when you make a mistake you had to type over the whole page or the whole section and everything, I could just make these changes.  I kick myself for not making that transition sooner.  And I, and that's the way I feel about this whole digital thing--this stuff we're just learning now about apps and about mobile devices, and we keep on hearing it, you know, if we want to be successful in the future, we're going to have stuff online that is friendly to mobile devices.  And what we have now isn't necessarily--I mean it'll work with a laptop but, or some of the larger devices.  But some of the smaller devices, we need to reconfigure it to make it more friendly and usable.  So these are things that we're learning at our advanced age and trying to figure out how to get in tune with the younger generation.
Story_ID: 652012
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, going just beyond, you know, our business, I would like to see us a little bit more unified and a little bit more concerned about each other.  One of the things that happened when I was coming up--and a lot of that had to do with the fact that we weren't welcome places.  We couldn't go, there was so much discrimination.  We just couldn't stay in certain places.  We couldn't eat in certain restaurants, we couldn't live in certain neighborhoods.  And we looked out for each other, we had each other's back.  And we were really happy when somebody was successful, and we recognized that.  And we gave them their props when that happened.  It doesn't happen too much today.  And, you know, that old crab in the barrel syndrome--I see more of that than I'd like to see, where people--as soon as somebody has any kind of success, instead of encouraging them and trying to emulate them, you try and knock them down, you try and criticize them, you try and knock them down a peg or two.  I just, I would like to see us be more supportive of one another.  And the other thing, and I don't know what the answer to this is.  But all this black on black crime and violence, I just don't, I don't, I don't even know how to respond to that.  I don't know what the answer is, but I know it troubles me to no end.  And when I listen to some of the music, I'm not surprised.  And I see what some of the popular culture--I'm not surprised that some of that stuff happens.  Because instead of recognizing people for their accomplishments and recognizing a Ralph Bunche--or you name it--who are doing something very worthwhile and doing something to help society, we are popularizing and--'The Housewives of Atlanta' ['The Real Housewives of Atlanta'], 'Bad Girls'--and what we're doing is rewarding bad behavior and rewarding people being rude and fighting and insulting one another and doing that thing with their head, you know, and the hand on the hip--and all that kind of foolishness, which I don't think has any place in our community.  And, so that's something that's missing.  I don't know what the answer to that is.  Because as long as people are still watching those shows, as long as people think that's entertaining, and they want to--then they're going to stay on, they're not going to take these shows off unless they're making money.  And as long as we want to watch them, then we're, I think we're doing ourselves a disservice.  I don't watch any of them and, but a lot of people do.

Speaker 1: Now when you look back again at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be, I mean at this moment, to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Well, I like to think that I had an impact in this industry, in terms of business--that we've helped change some minds, we've helped open some minds.  Things aren't nearly what they need to be, but certainly it wasn't until we started publishing the first magazine [The Black Convention] that we got our first black convention and visitors bureau president, Melvin Tennant, who was in, that was in Oakland [California].  And, now he's in Minneapolis [Minnesota].  And he and I remain good friends to this day.  And, but like I say, not a lot of people followed in his footsteps.  So, but we at least opened--helped open the door.  I mean I'm not saying we were the ones that made it happen, but certainly we contributed to creating an atmosphere where that was possible.  And, so I would like to see more of that happen, more people in the pipeline.  I mean when we, we recently were selected as the magazine for the National Policy Alliance, their official magazine.  These are all the different groups like Blacks in Government and black mayors [African American Mayors Association] and all the different elected officials from the schools.  And when they found out that there was only eight black presidencies, they said well, they want to know where they are, so they can take their business there.  And also, since they're elected officials, what can they do to start pressuring some of these people who are using tax money to run these bureaus to--so we just, just started working with them and hopefully that will have some impact.  But we need to be creative--when I say we, I mean in the black community, but ourselves included, in ways to make, to bring about some change.  Because it ain't going to happen because it's the right thing to do or it's morally or ethically right.  It's got to happen because dollars make it happen.  We've got to be economic pressure, and the only way that's going to happen is if people are more selective in how they spend their money.  Believe me, if Las Vegas started losing money and started having, instead of having 95 percent hotel occupancy and only had 60 or 50 percent--they would be scrambling for a solution to that problem.  But they're not facing that, so they don't have to deal with this.  And we, you know, we can look up and get somebody on the board there or the chairman that has a, feels a moral obligation to do something--and would try and make something happen from the top down.  But, you know, that's not likely to happen, and that's not a plan.  I mean, because if that happened, that would just be luck.  We need to have a plan in our community for pooling our resources and pooling our economic leverage, to make things better for all of us.

Speaker 1: Now is there anything we haven't addressed, before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I think you've been pretty thorough.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There's probably something but, well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I would like to be remembered as a person that made a difference and that was willing to stand up and fight for what he felt was right.

Speaker 1: That's family and friends.  We, my brother and I, gave a birthday party for my father.  Turned out to be his last birthday, and that was 1955.  And that's me on the far left in the back, and my brother, yeah, my brother is there.  And that young lady in between is my aunt Ruby [ph.], right here.  She's the one that just passed.  And that's my father there.  Yes.
