Speaker 1: Turk Burton:  Can you talk about your childhood a little bit?

See, because when my mother [Ruth Burton] passed, I was with my father [Frank Burton], brought me up, you know what I mean.  So ain't too much about my childhood.  One thing (chuckle) I learnt, don't follow a bad bunch, trying to keep up with 'em, do what they doing simply because, you know what I mean, you're a youngster with this bunch, see.  Now, the thing of it is that, little town that we were in, see, those boys could flip a train, get on and off, and that's what they were doing, see.  Naturally, I'm with the gang, gonna follow 'em.  I get on the train, and naturally, it started getting out of town, see.  And I don't know nothing about gitting off of no train.  And in fact, I didn't know nothing about gitting on no train, you know, like that.  (Unclear) So, naturally, I'm getting out of town, and I'm getting too far out of town for me.  So I just turn a loose from the train.  And the train threw me down the hill, embankment, and ah, your--ah, and it wasn't but as far as your car out there, down this embankment, see.  So naturally, I'm knocked out, dead as coat doornail.  So when I came back to my senses enough to have life in me, I crawled back to the railroad track that the train was on, you know, where embankment, up.  And I got a red crepe shirt.  It was popular then.  You know I laid my head on that rail that the train had went by, like this, to keep this blood--I had the scar up there in my head, keep that blood from getting on a crepe shirt I had.  You wouldn't believe it.  It just go to show you that if I had enough energy of mine, I could have stuck my head on that rail and got chopped off.  But I was too dizzy, you know, to do it.

Speaker 2: Turk Burton: Was that your first encounter with trains?
Speaker 1: Oh, well--.
Speaker 2: That was a bad encounter with a train, isn't it?
Speaker 1: Well, see, in other words, I'm following the bigger boys, you know, just like (unclear) anybody, you gonna keep up with the bigger boys, that's right.  So that's, the, you know, keeping up with them, you wouldn't believe that I could have lost my life out there getting on a train.  Then turned around, get to the Pullman and makes my life riding the train the rest of my days.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  That's the pay off.

And [when] it started to getting too far out, I just jumped off.  (tumbling down sound) (Chuckle)  So the train's gone and the other youngsters [who] was older than what I was, they gone cause they got off and went on about their business, (unclear) (I guess?).  So when I came to I crawled back to the embankment, put my head on the rail that the train was gone, just like that, cause that place--there the place right there now, you can see it.
Story_ID: 53639
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a pretty big scar, right.
Speaker 2: And let that blood drip away from me and this crepe shirt, see, cause I didn't want no blood to get on this crepe shirt.  That crepe shirt was it, you know, (chuckle) at that time.  Well, it was it.  Boy, oh, boy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's a--.
Speaker 1: Did somebody help you?  Did anybody come and help you?
Speaker 2: (Chuckle)  That, that's a, that's a joke.  That's a joke.  Just think of it.  When the train is gone, the older boys come back, and, you know, see me, you know, there, my head on the rail--track, the blood dripping down there cause I didn't want it to get on this crepe shirt, see.  And they were surprised that I done got hurt, you know, there.  We went around town, you know, (unclear) the train done got out, we were around town because we knew good and well, we couldn't go back to the station through there because then we'd get arrested.  So we went around town for a while.  So, now, now, I got to tell my daddy [Frank Burton] something see, because I'm there with him, just me and my daddy, you know, living there together.  I got to tell my daddy what happened.  Now, I can't tell him that I was flipping the train and got hurt or something cause he'd probably tell the police, see, and the police arrest [would] all of us, you know, what I mean, if I was to tell him.  So now, I got to think of a--something to tell that father of mine.  So, when I come back in the town like that, went over to the doctor, one rock--one doc--colored doctor was there in that town.  I told the doctor and him the same thing, see, fell off a lumber stack (chuckle), head hit the corner of lumber and knocked a hole in.  But there that scar right there, (unclear) tell a tale.  Now, that didn't bother me till he raised the skin up on my scalp and say look like your skull is cracked.
Story_ID: 53640
Speaker 1: Okay, so we were talking about you, you went to the doctor, and you were telling the doctor what happened to you, and you had to tell your dad the same story because you were afraid of what your dad [Frank Burton] might think, you know, if you told him the truth, right?
Speaker 2: See, in other words, see, I couldn't tell the doctor that I was flipping trains down there with, with the boys.  And, of course, as I said, that he had a chance of telling my father, see what I mean.  Naturally, I'd got a beating, I guess, you know, a lot daddies beat on you when you do something wrong.  So that's why I couldn't tell him.  So I told him I fell off a lumber stack, head hit the corner of the lumber.  And then I, like I said, it, it didn't bother me not until he picked that skin up on that skull, that skin is just [as] thick as your finger on your skull.  It don't look like it, but it's just that thick, see, and raised it up.  And then he say, look like your skull is cracked, then I started crying, you know, boy (unclear).  Yeah, that scar is right up there now, wherever it is.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's right there.  Yeah, and it's pretty deep, a deep scar.

(Chuckle) I was dipping the water out of the boat that had seeped in there, and I was--I don't know what it was, you know, alligator (unclear), and alligators look near the same in water, you know what I mean?  Just about long as this walking stick, come up to the top of the water, and I'm there at the back of the boat dipping it out, and just eased on by like that.  I looked at (him?)--that's the wrong thing.  Ain't no way in the world, I got any business going over there on that side of that lake to shoot no ducks with something like that done up and you could see him move and all like that.  I took that shot gun and went on back to the house and forgot the duck cause I wasn't afix'n to get, you know, knocked over out there in a boat by myself, you know, like that, whew, it's a lot of crap.  I didn't, didn't go either, went on back to the house.

See, my daddy [Frank Burton] by being a carpenter, he'd cut logs out of the trees, see, and tow them to the house, to the back of the house, tied 'em together, made a flat farm.  So naturally, I was thinking that rotten logs was still at the flat farm, but the wind had moved them.  I, gonna throw my brother [Leroy Burton] in this water.  We both were in.  Well, now, by me being larger than he was, you know, I [was] holding him up, didn't want him to go under, see.  Boy, oh boy.  My mother [Ruth Burton], boy, oh, boy, that's the worse beating I ever got.  She took a strap or something, (unclear) I know and wore me out for throwing him off in this water, see, cause she knew we had a chance of getting drowned, you know, what I mean.  Boy, I sho got a beating, oh, got a beating.

Speaker 1: Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.  That's a, that's a--something that you wouldn't believe that a animal like this bull calf I had there--his name was Logan.  That calf almost, you know, looked like, wait for me to talk to him.  I want him to go this way, I'd pat for him to go that way; want to go that way, pat him to go that way.  And we would go from the house where my daddy [Frank Burton] had this log platform, that calf had sense enough to go on to this barn, yard barn, you know, and that was at least as far as from here across the street to that other house over there.  He would go and turn up against that fence for me to unchain it, open it, go in.  He'd wait for me to close it behind me there, go on to this barn, get a block of hay, get on it, come back out.  He'd go to this gate, he'd wait till I chain it, and bring me on back to the house where that--cause he knew that's where I was gonna give it to him.
Story_ID: 53644
Speaker 1: So did you--?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did you leave [Earl] Arkansas or did you stay--I mean when did you leave Arkansas?
Speaker 2: My father [Frank Burton], when my father left, you know, you know, cause, cause my mother [Ruth Burton] had passed, you know, see.  And it wasn't nobody there then but me and him.  He brought me on to--he, he--by him being a carpenter, naturally, the white fellow's farm down there or something, you know, knew good and well that he had this brother in Arkansas, see.  So he contact him, so we came on (unclear) in Arkansas.  Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy; yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: --I'm asking like when did you leave Arkansas?  When did you leave Arkansas?
Speaker 2: When did I leave Arkansas?  I left Arkansas, oh, boy, after a year or two I was there in Earl, see.  The people that I was acquainted with in Arkansas moved to Little Rock [Arkansas].  They moved, see.  By them moving, going to Little Rock, naturally, I went to Little Rock and lived with them.
Speaker 1: Turk Burton: Is this a white family?

Speaker 1: Turk Burton: Was it a white family?  Black family?
Speaker 2: (No audible response).  (Nodding, yes)
Speaker 1: Turk Burton: Okay.

So naturally, I'd get up there and shovel it off (unclear).  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Turk Burton: And you got paid for that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 53645
Speaker 1: So you lived in Little Rock [Arkansas], then how long did you live in Little Rock?
Speaker 2: How long did I live there?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Oh, how long did I live there?  In other words, I lived there, went back to Earl, Arkansas and my daddy [Frank Burton] wanted to build him a house.  Well, he ain't got anything to build no house with, see, as far as that's concerned cause he was working, just carpenter's jobs as a carpenter, you know.  So I told my daddy I'll go back and get my money down on a lot I was buying out there, you know, because the streetcar was coming from Ninth Street in, over to Sixth Street on out down in that neighborhood, see.  So, naturally, I don't know anything about development and what it meant to put that transportation down in that neighborhood, see.  But the real estate guy knew good and well what it did, see, it boosted the building and the homes and price, you know, cause that streetcar was going down in there then.  So (chuckle), so I told my daddy, went there, I would go back, which I did, I was intended to go back and sell the lots if I could or what not, see.  But I went back and told the real estate guy I wanted my money down off the block cause I was going home to live with my daddy, and I wouldn't be there to build no home for myself, see.  So, naturally, he's glad to give it to me cause the price done jumped up, you know, what it was, so it was a hundred or two [hundred] dollars I got back.  Went on back, helped my daddy build the house, you know, (unclear).

Story_ID: 53647
Speaker 1: That--the boy [that] flipped this freight train, train coming through that yard.  He flipped that freight train.  And naturally, it's a funny thing.  I can carry that memory with me all the time for the rest of my life because, naturally, this boy flipped that train, see, and should have got the car behind the coupler, see.  And when he didn't do that, that whipped him right around in between that (unclear), coupler, you know, just whipped him right around in between.  Naturally, when he turn a loose, like that, he was knocked out dead, down the embankment.  And when you think about it, now, me being a youngster, you know, and see this happen, it should never happen if he had knew not to catch that car where the, that train whipped him around into that coupler, you know, see, like that.  It often dawned on me, what he did wrong.  And when it did that, throwed him down the embankment, and it was going over a trestle, naturally, that trestle down--.
Speaker 2: A bridge, huh?
Speaker 1: --he was dead.  The section gang there just took a bulldozer, dug a grave, put him in it, covered him up, and he was buried right there on that railroad ground, which his people never know what happened to him.  All they knew, he left home.

Speaker 1: They didn't know where he was from, lest known his family.  You know, couldn't let nobody know cause, you know, nobody know where he [was] from.
Speaker 2: Turk Burton: Oh.
Speaker 1: Boy, oh boy.
Speaker 2: Probably didn't think it was important (unclear).
Speaker 1: Boy, oh, boy, that's--go to show you.  Yes, go to show you 'cause those guys took that bulldozer, digger, dug the grave and buried him right there.  And the only thing, his people ever know, he left home.  That's all.

Speaker 2: Okay, now, how did you--?
Speaker 1: You take, you take a incident now that arose in my mind and where something happened, I don't--you know, you can't figure it out.  The people that I lived with there, they had two boys and a girl.  The girl was the young-youngest.  And the boy, young--the young boy, the family had moved from Arkansas, went to Cleveland [Ohio], and I had left them, and I was still in Little Rock [Arkansas].  That youngest boy never figured it out, got a shot gun and killed his brother.  That's just like a youngster, if I get hot, you know, what I mean (unclear), by him being the younger and everything, killed that boy.  You take--that was a terrible thing that happened, by me living with them and that family, and this young boy do that, see.  And naturally, I (unclear) whether it was one to seven or one to fourteen years for this murder.  That's what he got.  And in the pen [penitentiary], he made shoes, you know, shoe, shoe (unclear), made shoes.  And I often thought about him making shoes in the pen.

And he lived back behind us, facing that street, my housing [was] facing this street, you know what I mean, just like that.  So naturally, I went over there visiting him, and visiting him, he had this little automatic pistol, see.  And I'll never--in his room, and not knowing the bullet was still in that chamber.  I pulled the trigger, right down through the bed, see, I'm at the foot of the bed, right down through the foot of that.  Man, I was, I was just scared, just to think if I had pulled that trigger at him, pointing, I might have killed him, see.  And naturally, they would have had to take my word, what I (unclear) managed to be over there, kill this boy.  And they wouldn't know whether we were fighting or arguing or what not, you know, see, or whether I did it intentionally.  But I, boy, I sho was glad I [was] pointing down to the foot of the bed, I'm at the foot of the bed, bang.  Oh, boy.  And I, I was just really glad, really glad.  And, of course, even if I had a shot him like that, he would a explained it was an accident.  I would [have] have explained it [was] accident, the man that I'm living there with, the white fellow, his son was a lawyer, had finished law.

Speaker 1: Mr. Burton, how did you become a Pullman Porter or when did you become a Pullman Porter?
Speaker 2: Now, that's--how did I become a Pullman Porter?  I always, coming up a youngster, wanted two jobs.  I'd be a city fireman or work on the train, see.  I always wanted to get a job for a living that didn't play out.  You take a lot--so many jobs you get like that play out, you know.  You got to go look for something else, go look for something else, see.  And the thing of it is, show you how close it come for me to get on the railroad with the Pullman, I taken the examination to drive mail truck.  I figured that would be the next steady job you can get that's year in and year out, don't play out.  I went and taken the examination to drive a mail truck.  I went and bought a coat sweater, you know, to wear on account it was chilly, picking up mail around at the mail box and things, a coat sweater to wear.  I had orders to be on relief wait, you know, to get called to the post office, see.  The Pullman Company called me to come work for them day before the post office called for me to come back and work for them.  If the post office had a called me to come work for them, I'd never been on no road [as] no Pullman porter, just never would cause it was a steady job, I knew that, and that's what I was looking for, a steady job in life, you know, that you go year around, year around, year around.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, where did you live when you--?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Were you still living in Arkansas when you became a Pullman porter?  Were you still living there in Little Rock [Arkansas]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 70984
Speaker 1: When you started out, Mr. Burton--?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Sir, when you started out, I mean what route did you travel on--as a [Pullman] Porter?  What train route did you go?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, just then (unclear) now.  On the Santa Fe, you know, with the chief, Super Chief, California Limited, Scout, all them trains are still running.  And you thing of it, the thing of it is that the Pullman Company put you on local trains,  figure you didn't have the experience to start to riding (phone ringing) the first-class trains, you know, see.  (phone ringing) Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.  Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.  You take, see, the fast train, the unlimited run, you know, in other words, they didn't fool with no little stops, they run 'em, the big stops, run the big stops (unclear) big stops.  And the guy one of the, one of them Pullmans in Los Angeles [California], he deadheaded on that train next to the engine in the mail car, put it up there, put you on it, to deadhead that car out there cause they needed to load up to come back.
Story_ID: 70985
Speaker 1: They--.
Speaker 2: What does--?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Excuse me, sir, what does deadhead mean?  What does that mean?
Speaker 1: Oh, that means I want this empty car in California and ain't but one way to get it out there, put it on the head end of this train and send it out there because a certain day, it'll be loaded up out there to come back this way.  That (unclear).  The conductor on there, when you deadhead like that, you tell him to order you a box lunch at a town, you know, that Fred Harvey was fixing those lunch--he'd (unclear) in, they'd fix that lunch and have whoever it is to bring it out to the train when it come in there.  And when the train come in, you had a box lunch.  That's the way you got something to eat on (unclear), otherwise, you didn't nothing to eat.  And then that's, that train making its schedule, and it hit, hit a curve, pin you to the side of that car, would pin you in there, and you can't get up till it straighten up and start walking again.  It's running just that fast.  Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  I'm sorry I'm worrying you with my life.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's a, that's a--one thing that I never did figure I'd live to see a colored woman being a engineer on the train.  Now, she worked the switchyard, yard switching quite a while, see.  And, of course, when they needed her, they would send her out on, on a train like that, you know, see, as fireman side, see.  And he didn't jump up and put her right over in the engineer side.  They let her work the fireman's side.
Story_ID: 70987
Speaker 1: Now, being a porter [Pullman Porter], was it hard work?
Speaker 2: Hard work?
Speaker 1: Yeah, was it hard work being a porter?
Speaker 2: (Chuckle) I wave my hand at you, talking about hard work.  That's about the hardest job you could ever get on, was on those cars.  You take--you got--you're supposed to get four hours sleep a night, between the two cars, that are traveling like that.  One will go down, 10:00 o'clock, I think till 2:00 and the other 2:00 to 6:00 to get that sleep, see.  And nine times out of ten, you supposed to be in the bed at 10:00, you making beds because a lot of people that had rooms, see, call you at different times for you to come make their rooms for them to go to bed.  Your time for you to go to bed is there when they calling you to make their beds.
Speaker 1: Okay, I get it, I get it.
Speaker 2: Boy, oh, boy.  Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh. Boy.
Speaker 1: So you only were allowed four hours of sleep a night?
Speaker 2: Four hours, yeah, four hours, but you didn't get that.  A lot of the time, you didn't get that because the thing of it is, you may lose two of them hours before, you know, you get a chance to get through with your work to go to bed.  So like you say, supposed to be four hours sleep you get, but you didn't get that far as that concerned.  That's a, that's a--that, that was, look like one of the most killing jobs there ever was, was porter, on a Pullman car, one of the most killing jobs that you could ever want to, ever want to be on.

Speaker 2: It took two nights from here to California, two nights.  Two nights.  That's, that's on your fast train, two nights; slow train, three, three and more, but it took two nights to go out there.  Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.  Two nights.
Speaker 1: So how long were you, were you away from home?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: How long were you away from home at a stretch?  I think you were saying earlier that--?
Speaker 2: How long you away from home?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Well, the thing of it is, it depends on what train you was working on, see.  Now, the California Limited, Scout, naturally, you know, you was away from home longer because it was taking 'em longer to make the trip, maybe two nights or three nights or what not, you know, see.  So it took you longer, took you longer.  Oh, boy.  Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
Speaker 1: Uh--.
Speaker 2: Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
Speaker 1: I guess what I'm asking is, you said before--.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: --when we talked earlier, you said that you would be away from home as many of twenty days out of a month, right?  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Away from home about ten days?
Speaker 1: No, about twenty days, you said, about twenty days in a month, you'd be away from home?

And they tell you, car Little Rock, you know, such and such a place.  Then they say, you take it out, and that's all is in there is beds.  The, the cars had different names, different names.  So it depends on what name it, that car had.
Story_ID: 70990
Speaker 1: Boy, oh boy, oh boy.
Speaker 2: Was the pay--well go ahead, go ahead.
Speaker 1: That's a job that you think about, it was a dangerous job that you ever performed because the guys find out, send you into these yards, all these towns, all of 'em--don't make no difference where it was, send you in these yards.  You got to go there, go in that yard, find out what track that train is on to get your car.  And naturally, you could get killed, held up, anything, you're going to your car, you see, cause in these towns, you don't know who's out looking for somebody to hold up to get the money off of 'em, see, cause you're going out between these tracks, line of cars over there, a line of cars over here, see.  Now, you going down between them.  And a guy could walk out there and stick a gun on you and rob you going or coming.
Speaker 2: Do you have any stories of--?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Do you have some stories that you can tell about your days as a Pullman Porter?  I mean things that happened when you going to another--from town to town or did any of your friends get in trouble or did you have any, any problems yourself?
Speaker 1: The time something happened?  What you mean?  What you mean, times--?
Speaker 2: Did you ever get held up?
Speaker 1: No, no.  That's, that's what I'm telling you, it's just a good place to get held up, you know what I mean because you going down between two cars, tracks (unclear) you know, and you're going to go down in between them, see, till you find your car where it's (unclear), naturally, but you just, just fortunate you--the time that you probably going to get in the car, nobody out there looking for somebody to stick up.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but did you know anybody that got stuck up?
Speaker 1: No, no, I don't, don't remember it.
Story_ID: 70991

Speaker 2: Well, that--the flood, you know, like that was we had to run through the water, half up on them wheels, you know, see, that's that, going up there, but you was in the one going through Kansas City [Kansas], wasn't you?
Speaker 1: Turk Burton: Yeah, yeah, but I, I didn't, yeah.  But tell him, they--when you got out there, that was going to Washington, D.C.  And they had the flood and they had to get the Army guys to come out there to get yawl off the train.
Speaker 2: Got off?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they got to putting those Army ducks out there and you had to get on them ducks.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That, that was, that was out East here, out East here.
Speaker 1: (Unclear), right.
Speaker 2: That was out East here, and naturally, the high water come up and, naturally, I think the car jumped the track or something, you know, (unclear) it out.  And that's when they got to come out there with the ducks and get luggage and the people off.  (Chuckle)  The way, the way we had to get out (laughter) is to go through the baggage car, crawl through the door that they put that luggage and stuff, that's the only way you could get out of there 'cause the water done got this car.
Story_ID: 70992
Speaker 1: Could you tell me about the union?  I know that--were you involved in the union, in the Pullman Porters' union?
Speaker 2: Turk Burton: The Brotherhood [The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters].
Speaker 1: The Brotherhood, right.
Speaker 2: The, the Pullman Company said that you're eligible to be drafted in the Army.  See, but by you, by you being a Pullman Porter, we need experienced trained men to operate these cars to haul the soldiers and sailors and things, see.  In other words, he couldn't just pick a guy up and put him on there and he don't know what to do, you understand.  So the Pullman Company said that we need you to still operate the (unclear) cars, see.  That's the way I missed going in, by being on the Pullman car.
Speaker 1: So it kept you out of the war [World War II], then?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: It kept you out of Army?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure, sure, they told--he said that that's why he didn't send me because they needed me on them cars to haul 'em.
