Story_ID: 569071
Speaker 1: First of all, let's start about talking about your family background.  Tell us a little bit about your mother.  What was her name and where was she born?
Speaker 2: My mother is Lenora Thomas [Lenora Thomas Battle], and Battle by marriage.  She was born in Nash County, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: And she was--that's where she grew up?
Speaker 2: She grew up there and moved to the Washington, D.C. area after graduating, or directed to Washington, D.C. after graduating from high school within the 1940s.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know much about her background and her growing up?
Speaker 2: I do know a bit.  I--my--unfortunately, virtually all of my grandparents were deceased prior to my birth.  My mother was the youngest of a family, initially of thirteen.  And I think her mother died very young, when she was a very young child, and she was raised primarily by one of her older sisters, who in so many ways was much more a grandparent than an aunt.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: My mother is patient, and, and giving.  She's like everybody's mother.
Speaker 1: Did she share any stories with you of her growing up?
Speaker 2: She talked about it to some extent in terms of the kind of farm life that she lived for the first few years of my life before actually starting school.  I spent much of the time in North Carolina on a farm, so I did have some experience in the sort of circumstances that she grew up in.  But her recollections were pretty much of the kind of farm life a young person would have experienced growing up in the--that early part of the 20th century.
Story_ID: 569072
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your father.  What was his name and where was he born?
Speaker 2: My father was Thomas Oscar Battle [Thomas O. Battle].  He was also born in the same Nash County area of North Carolina, completed the high school there.  I think one of interesting things about both of them is they both completed high school in that late '30s [1930s], early 1940s era, when many of our people who lived in rural areas did not either have the advantage of such schooling, were taken out of it because of their farm life, or otherwise weren't able to complete the studies, and it's one of the things that I think has inspired me and others in my family in terms of the value of education is that both of my parents actually had completed high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: My father was, I think, when I think back about it, he was a very, very funny person.  He's very engaging, he was someone who, for whom education was a very important ingredient.  If I think back about education, I realize that it was always my father.  Not that--my mother [Lenora Thomas Battle] was certainly encouraging as well.  But always my father, who was very much about the importance of education and especially, as it would relate to the, the kinds of achievements that we could have as black people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he share any stories with you about growing up?
Speaker 2: I--not, not so much.  My father did not talk very much about his background once he had moved here to the Washington [D.C.] area.  It appeared that he went back home fairly infrequently.  His life tended to be around here.  Not so sure how much, but he really didn't talk very much about his past.
Story_ID: 569073
Speaker 1: About how far back can you trace your ancestors?
Speaker 2: I have members of my family who have--who are very much interested in genealogy.  And they have done, on both my mother's [Lenora Thomas Battle] side of the family as well as my father's [Thomas O. Battle] side of the family, some genealogical research, that at least takes our families back to the Civil War and probably the--some parts of the antebellum period.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And most of them were out of the North Carolina area?
Speaker 2: As we see it, we fairly much come out of that general North Carolina area.  There may have been, at some much earlier periods some migration, perhaps out of Virginia.  Whether that relates specifically to our side of the family, meaning the black parts of our family, or whether that more reflects the Battles generally, from whom my name was probably taken.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories, or legends, or songs that they might have passed down that you can remember?
Speaker 2: Not really.  It's just sort of the kinds of things that you hear growing up, you know, sort of on the side, hearing adults talk about things.  But, I don't recall there was a whole lot of discussion about the kind of experiences they'd had in the past other than just the kinds of home life activities that they would have talked about just as they sat with their friends and relatives and reflected back upon things.  It was anecdotes, but not specifically anecdotes that children, or young people like myself were involved in the conversation.
Speaker 1: Your grandparents.  You say you don't remember?
Speaker 2: My grandfather on my father's side--if he was born, if he were still alive when I was born, I have no recollection.  Both of my mother's parents were deceased, but my grandmother, my father's mother, lived until 1986 at which time she died at 101.  So she is the one grandparent who had a, an influence in my life.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's great.
Story_ID: 569074
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: I have some vague, early memories of life on the farm [in North Carolina].  That in the past, when I happened to mention something that I remembered, my relatives were usually surprised because they realized that I had some recollections going back, probably to the time when I was about three or four years old.  They are not connected in any kind of way.  But I do have some vague recollection of some family events, or experiences that go back to, probably, when I was about four or five years old.
Speaker 1: Can you describe what your family life was like, some of the holidays, special events, daily life?
Speaker 2: Growing up in Washington [D.C.], a federal city, we certainly enjoyed all of the, the various kinds of federal holidays.  They were probably not anything unusual, except that my father [Thomas O. Battle] worked for the federal government, the D.C. government, rather, so that was certainly the opportunity that he had to, to interact with family.  But it was probably the normal kind of celebrations whether it was Christmas, Thanksgiving, 4th of July.  I think we were fairly traditional in, in celebrating those kinds of activities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What street did you live on?  Can you--and describe your block?
Speaker 2: In Washington, D.C., I've lived numerous places depending upon whichever time of my life.  At the very early period, I think my family lived somewhere around the Northwest L Street area when I was born.  I know we lived in the Northeast Maryland Avenue area, when I initially started going to school.  I initially went to Charles Young [Charles Young Elementary School, Washington, D.C.].  I know that we moved into Southeast Washington on Stanton Road, I believe, about the time during my early years in elementary school.  My junior high school [Carter G. Woodson Junior High School, Washington, D.C.] years were spent in the River Terrace community in Washington, D.C.  And my high school years, I lived on Monroe Street in Northeast Washington, which is where my mother [Lenora Thomas Battle] still resides.  So for the last forty-five odd years, my family roots have been in that part of Washington.
Story_ID: 569075
Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds or smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: I guess some of those that might, might come would be here in the city.  Would certainly probably be the--some of the open air markets that were quite common around Washington [D.C.], whether the Eastern Market [Washington, D.C.], the old Eastern market, the Florida Avenue Market [Washington, D.C.], the seafood fish vendors down on the waterfront.  When I think about the North Carolina aspects of that, then it's much more of the kinds of summer smells that you would find on a farm, the fresh fruits and vegetables, tobacco, because my family was involved in tobacco farming.  And, and just the sorts of sights and sounds and smells that you would expect and associate with nice, warm southern summer days and nights.
Story_ID: 569076
Speaker 1: And what elementary school did you attend?
Speaker 2: I attended, actually three.  First grade, I attended the Charles Young School [Charles Young Elementary School] in Northeast Washington [D.C.].  From the second through most of the fifth grade, I attended Turner Elementary School in Southeast Washington.  I completed elementary school at River Terrace Elementary [River Terrace Elementary School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have any teachers that influenced you?  If so, can you name them?
Speaker 2: Certainly one teacher that I recall, would have been a teacher in junior high school.  I don't recall her name quite at the moment.  But I remember, it was probably the first instance of which I can recall, that someone really pointed out the stark reality of being a black person in a white world.  And I sort of remember the comment was that there are only two things in this life that you must do.  One of them is to die, and then the other was to stay black.  I do remember that.  There were other teachers, probably in high school.  My journalism teacher certainly would have been influential in some of the writing and other things that I would have had interest in.  But it's probably just a conglomerate of individuals. There are not many single individuals that stand out, so much as the group, we were sort of educated by groups of people.
Speaker 1: And what junior high and high schools did you attend?
Speaker 2: I attended Woodson Junior High School [Carter G. Woodson Junior High School, Washington, D.C.], which is named after Carter G. Woodson.  I've often remarked that I don't recall that I had any strong feeling and understanding of who Carter G. Woodson was during that time, as the father of black history.  And I find it such an irony here later in life, that that is the field in which I, you know, do my professional work.  And while, at the same time, it was also the period in which I was probably coming to some awakening about black history and culture, and I wonder what kind of influence would it have been if I'd really had an understanding of who Carter G. Woodson really was.  I later attended the McKinley High School [McKinley Technical High School; McKinley Technology High School] in Washington, D.C. from which I graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What year was that?
Speaker 2: I graduated from high school in 1964.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was a good student.  I was always known for being studious.  I--if I could probably, I may have been able to be a better student if sometimes I had been as interested in studying the lessons as I was in the sort of extracurricular materials.  There were many things that I was reading on the outside that had nothing to do with the classroom work.  But, overall, I was a good student.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What type of child were you?  Were you well mannered, mischievous (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think I was--I think there is always some mischievousness in young people and young children.  Having said that, I was--sometimes say I was a model child.  Depends on what kind of model you think that may be, but I, I think generally speaking, I was pretty well mannered, and respectful of my elders and other people, and I think I was a pretty good kid.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: Dreams and aspirations, one of the--I guess the easiest thing is to say, is yes.  I did not grow up in any environment in which I was ever told that I would not be able to achieve whatever it was.  No matter how unrealistic some of these things may have been, and, and much better understood by my elders, I don't recall any point at which I was, or anyone else that I knew in my family, was ever discouraged in, in terms of the dream seeking that that may have had.  It may have been to inform them that there's some preparation that you need, but in terms of not having the support to move forward, I can say that I was never discouraged in anything, so it was a quite positive kind of an environment.
Story_ID: 569077
Speaker 1: Did you and your family attend church?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My family has to one extent or the other, been involved in the church, probably for quite a long time.  We were never involved, in the sense of necessarily being required to do things.  I think we were given the latitude to be able to come to our own understanding and our own beliefs.  That is one of the reasons why my [paternal] grandmother was an important factor in my life.  She was very religious, and she certainly is one responsible for my initial entry into an involvement with the church, and I've sometimes told people that when you say, talk about wading in the water, it's a, it's a real concept to me because I was literally baptized in a snake infested river.  I sometimes say, I wonder what kind of potential child abuse that may have been, you know, as I reflect back, but it's the sort of experience that one would find quite common in rural North Carolina.
Story_ID: 569078
Speaker 1: What influenced you as a young person, and tell me some of those books that you might have read as a young person?
Speaker 2: I think one of the things that influenced me was books and reading.  I've often said that I cannot remember a time when I could not read.  I know much of that is a result of the encouragement of my family.  I know that I had older cousins who sort of took me under their wing and, and encouraged me to do things, and expose me to things.  And as I read--and my, and my interests were about virtually anything.  But as I read, one of the things that I discovered, was I was not reading about black people.  And there was something very strange about that because I saw them everyday in virtually every walk of life.  So I wasn't encouraged in reading any particular type of book, literature or anything else, I was a consumer of whatever the library had to offer.  But in that consuming effort of learning, I was always trying to seek out the African, if you will, where are the black people?  So whatever I could find, regardless of what it may have been that may have reflected the status of black people, it was something of interest to me.  And if I think back about, among the earliest things that would have done that, it would probably have been among the works of Carter G. Woodson or perhaps some 'Mis-Education Of the Negro' ['The Mis-Education Of the Negro,' Carter G. Woodson], but I think probably, the other works that he had done that today we would look upon as black history.  And then probably another book, as I became aware of it would have been [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin's, 'From Slavery to Freedom' ['From Slavery to Freedom: A History of African Americans'].
Speaker 1: How did the schools celebrate black history here in the District [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: I really don't have any strong recollection of the celebration of black history in the school system.  Maybe it's just a matter that I've forgotten and it just--it simply didn't impress itself upon me at the time, but I really don't have a firm recollection of the celebration of what then would have been Negro History Week [Black History Month] during my years in school.  I'm not saying that we didn't, but whatever the reason, I simply have no recollections of that having occurred.
Story_ID: 569079
Speaker 1: How did you spend your time, both in school and your extracurricular activities, or--like did you play sports or anything like that?
Speaker 2: When I was in high school [McKinley Technical High School; McKinley Technology High School, Washington, D.C.], I participated in a variety of sports, both in school and outside of school.  I was actively in terms of sports, on the track team.  I also was a writer of scholastic sports, both for my school newspaper, as well as for the Washington Daily News, which was a tabloid newspaper, during the 19--at least, during the 1960s when I was in school.  I also would have participated in any range of other kinds of table board games, just a whole range of kinds of things that I think young people would have been accustomed to.
Speaker 1: How did it come about that you were able to write for the newspaper?  For the tabloid?
Speaker 2: I began writing--once when I was in high school, I tried to take as wide a range of courses as I possibly could.  I was in an academic program, but we had an environment in which we weren't simply limited to certain kinds of material.  So I took classes in, in virtually everything.  Among those was journalism, and I took journalism both for credit, and not for credit.  Simply because I had an interest in writing, I guess, and that is one of the things that certainly would have been influential, and writing for the school paper, I also then had the opportunity, I sort of applied, I guess, I was aware that they needed scholastic writers for scholastic sports.  And I simply went to the paper and, and inquired if I could be involved in doing that, and I was given that opportunity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Was that a paying job, or a volunteer?
Speaker 2: It was a paying job of sorts.  And I think the best way to express it, for me, it was all about the experience.  But the--I would not suggest that I was on any sort of regular payroll, but the--I was given some, some money as a result of the work that I was doing on a regular basis.  It was probably a lot then to a young person who virtually had nothing and no job.  It wasn't a lot, so to say that it was paid, is probably to overstate it.
Speaker 1: What were some of the social activities that you engaged in?
Speaker 2: The period in which I grew up is one where there was this great awakening of music in the 1960s.  Certainly, I would have participated in that whole sort of activity of the burgeoning of black American music during the '60s [1960s].  So dancing, and all of the things that young people would have been involved in, certainly would have all kinds of sports activities.  There is nothing that I can think of that I didn't have some interest in, except there were those things that were certainly not available to us.  If I had an interest in golf or tennis, as an example, those were not things that were easily available to people of color to take advantage of.  Although, at some point later, I did get very much involved in tennis.
Story_ID: 569080
Speaker 1: During that time of your growing up, were the schools integrated, and did, if you went out to social activities like to the theaters and things, were they basically segregated?
Speaker 2: Many things are--often people do not have the appreciation of just what a segregated city Washington, D.C. was, certainly through much of its history through the 20th century.  And while that segregation may have played itself out slightly differently than how we associate it with some of the other more severe aspects of it in the deeper South.  There was certainly a segregated Washington, but I think that there are some dynamics that existed during that period, and certainly in the black community that somewhat mitigated against the feeling of such a stock segregation.  There was an extremely strong and vibrant black community.  And, historically so, in terms of the nations capital, and I think that had a great influence on how we may have responded to the circumstances that we encountered here in Washington.
Story_ID: 569081
Speaker 1: What were you thinking you wanted to be and do?  Were you making plans about going to college?
Speaker 2: In some ways, it was always expected that I was going to go to college.  One reason was because I was a good student, another is because it was my father's [Thomas O. Battle] mantra.  I remember from when I was very young, he would always refer to me as professor, or the professor, having no idea that ultimately that, that sort of a thing, might, might become true, so it was that sort of, ongoing encouragement, the expectation that, that you needed to continue to go forward, as far as possible.  And that's certainly something that was instilled by my father and by my family generally.
Speaker 1: Did you go straight to college after you graduated from high school [McKinley Technical High School; McKinley Technology High School, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: I went to, I went directly Howard University [Washington, D.C.] after I graduated from high school.  It was, again, while growing up, I was exposed to things about all kinds of schools, about at that time having a specific understanding and realization of that, many of America's institutions of higher learning, were really not intended for my attendance.  Although these were things that often were presented to us, so that I, again, have a great indebtedness to my family for making me as aware of the historically black colleges [HBCUs], certainly Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina] where family had attended earlier, was an institution that I would have known about, certainly one other reason being in North Carolina.  But because family talked about black colleges and had experiences with black colleges, as I had consideration about institutions, the one that kept being put forth to me was Howard University, Howard University.  I was certainly aware of Howard University, being a native of Washington [D.C.], but didn't have the same appreciation for it because, it wasn't presented in the same sort of medium as many of the majority institutions.  But because my family had such a profound understanding and appreciation for what historically black colleges had done for the, if you will, the upliftment of our race, the, the expectation of being able to go to Howard University, was one that I can only say that I am so indebted to have had the opportunity to come, because it is the Howard University experience that really opened up the world to me.
Story_ID: 569082
Speaker 1: Could you tell us a little about your experience here, what organization did you belong to?  Did you play sports or what kind of academic organizations?
Speaker 2: One of the things that I should note, is that I am the oldest of eight.  And as such, there would have been different responsibilities and expectations on what I needed to do in terms of helping the family along.  So, in coming to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], one of the things that I had to do was that I was always a working student.  I've, in a sense, I paid my way from the time I've been out of high school [McKinley Technical High School; McKinley Technology High School, Washington, D.C.].  So the opportunity to participate in certain kinds of extracurricular activities was simply something I wasn't able to pursue.  Because when I wasn't in class, when I wasn't in the library studying, I was working on a job.  I don't feel so much that there are things that I missed out on, although there are obviously things in which I wasn't involved.  But Howard was a very vibrant community during that period of the 1960s, and the other area of extracurricular activity that might not be clearly seen is the general student protest activities that were ongoing.  I was always a sympathizer, if not always able to be an active participant, in many of those activities.  But I think what we were doing was trying to bring our institution to a better level of understanding of what it could be in the 20th century.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So those protests of--what were the students protesting at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, during the 1960s, we were existing in this period of the Vietnam War.  There was the, the Black Power movement, there's the black arts, black awareness movement, the Civil Rights Movement--generally, this was a period of great activism among students regardless of the kinds of institutions they attended and where they may have been.  And so all of those things that were affecting the nation at large, and then very specifically, the black population would have been those things in which Howard University students would have been very, very, much involved.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were some of the jobs that you had during your high school years?  During your college years rather, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Actually, I had essentially one job.  I worked for the D.C. Public Library [District of Columbia Public Library, Washington, D.C.], and that as much as anything, probably has had an influence on where I find myself professionally today.  It seemed such a wonderful marriage of opportunity and need, that I had the need for a job and then I had the opportunity to work in a library, which is where I would have liked to have been just on my own free time.  So, in a sense I was being paid to be around books, and to do the sorts of things I wanted to do, but I did work for the D.C. Public Library throughout that period I was in university.
Story_ID: 569083
Speaker 1: Let's look a little bit at your, at your family.  Can you name your brothers and sisters, and tell us what rank you are?
Speaker 2: I am first.  I then have four, five sisters born.  My sister Saundra [Saundra Battle Greene], then Wanda [Wanda Battle Washington], and Betty [Betty Battle Tanner].  I then--and Janice [Janice Battle Fountaine].  I then have my two brothers, and since we are more than ten years old, we don't have the same kind, it would not be the same kind of brother relationship because they were just simply a younger generation.  But my brothers, Vann [Vann DuWayne Battle] and Michael [Michael Battle], and then my youngest sister Carol [Carol Battle Johnson].
Story_ID: 569084
Speaker 1: And you graduated from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] in what year?
Speaker 2: I graduated from Howard in 1969.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was your, what was your major?
Speaker 2: I majored in political science and graduated with a major in sociology, or rather a minor in sociology.  I had intended interestingly enough, had hoped to have majored in journalism.  At that time, Howard University did not have a journalism department, or a school of communications, and I began ostensibly majoring in English.  But I quickly learned the ropes of the university, and going through the registration process, and getting advising, I changed my major as a matter of convenience to political science, but that was probably the best thing.  Interestingly, I had intended to minor in business, but by the time I should have graduated, I had never had an opportunity to take a course in business, because it was the--those courses were always oversubscribed by majors so that, in order, literally, to graduate, I changed my minor to sociology where I had taken quite a number of elective courses.
Story_ID: 569085
Speaker 1: Dr. Battle [HistoryMaker Thomas Battle], let's go back a little bit, back to your school years, here in Washington, D.C.  Tell us a little bit about the education system, and the, and the Washington, D.C. system.
Speaker 2: For much of the history of Washington, D.C., schools in Washington, D.C., there were two separate schools systems.  There was the--and they, they were all within the board of education, but they had separate management.  There was the system that, and, you know, for majority students, and there was a separate system for minority students, for black students, for colored students, a colored school system, as they would have called it.  This changed--Washington was expected to be the model for integration, following Brown v. Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], although the reality was that there was much resistance here to that integration, but it did ultimately break down those two separate approaches to education.  It did lead to some other developments in terms of how the education system responded to the needs of black students, as they sought to integrate the Washington, D.C. school system.  But those would have been occurrences, pretty much at the time that I was in elementary school and moving forward to junior high school [Carter G. Woodson Junior High School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: The track system in D.C. put you into a certain category.  Were you ever--is that the category you stayed in the whole time that you were in school?
Speaker 2: Washington, D.C. had an interesting development, I don't know that it was so unique, I think other--there have been a number of efforts in terms of how to group students.  Washington had developed some ability grouping system.  Some thought it would be very unfair because most black students would probably find themselves in the lower stages of this tracking system, and perhaps it was a way to reinstitute a certain kind of segregation.  But there were certainly high achieving black students who earned the grades, if you will, or they had the abilities to be in the highest track.  As I recall, that system consisted of an honors track system, which was supposed to have been a step above the college prep, and then I think there was a general track system, there may have been another.  But that was the, the way in which the, I think, the junior high and high school experiences of mine [at McKinley Technical High School; McKinley Technology High School, Washington, D.C.] were developed.  It was within this track system, which eventually would have been challenged in court and was initially, eventually in the 1960s, was abolished.  The--you essentially, was tested into the system, as I recall your parents had to agree, was seen to be something that was fairly experimental at the time.  I think the notion was that you would be able to move between tracks.  That if students were really not able to perform at the honors track level, they would have been, not demoted, but placed in the--another track.  And those who were in a lower track, and whose performance increased and warranted elevation to a higher track, would have had that to happen.  I don't know that that actually occurred in practice.  I think there were some issues as to whether or not the level of mobility that was implied, was actually a reality, and I think there was a great level of concern.  I also believe that there was the opportunity to take courses in other tracks, certainly in a higher track if your abilities apparently indicated that you had the stuff, if you will, to do the work.  But that's the sort of system that was, was being developed during that period.  Not necessarily as a response to integration, but certainly as another development in how, how people of color would be educated in this community.  We didn't have busing in quite the same way as it may have existed in some rural areas.  But there was some interest, and there was some degree of mobility.  Another factor would be, the schools integrated very quickly because much of the white population simply left.  Left the school system and left the city, and pretty much abandoned the schools and--as black students moved into those.  Those that had been predominantly reserved for white students in the white population.

Speaker 1: Testing, did you do the standardized tests, is that how they put you into the track system?  Was it from your test scores?
Speaker 2: I believe that there was certainly some testing that was done for this purpose.  I believe students were given examinations as--perhaps as some sort of a screening method to determine what track he or she should be placed.  I can't speak for whether this happened to all students, because I'm really only familiar with whatever, vaguely familiar, with whatever conversations my parents [Lenora Thomas Battle and Thomas O. Battle] were involved in, in agreeing for my participation in this, in this program.  I know that it eventually extended to throughout, but I don't recall those details, not really being involved as a young person, but pretty much, the decisions being made elsewhere.  One of the things that I do recall, is when I was in the sixth grade in elementary school [River Terrace Elementary School, Washington, D.C.], and the class in which I was a student was tested, that there were concerns at the board of education level that we had been given some unfair advantage, in essence that we had cheated.  That our teachers had provided assistance, perhaps giving us exposure to the exam before we took it, and our class was retested.  And the individual came, and after conducting a new test, literally had a sort of a question and answer period with the students, and expressed at that time, to my recollection, that they were surprised to see just how competent we were, and that apparently we were as competent as our earlier testing had indicated.  And I would say that that was certainly supported by the retesting in which I think that the majority of individuals in my class went on to junior high school and were placed in the highest level of the--of that tracking system.
Story_ID: 569087
Speaker 1: Did the teachers work with you sometimes after class, I mean for tutoring or anything of that nature during the time that you were in school?
Speaker 2: My recollection was our teachers made themselves available, tried to provide the opportunities, were willing to give additional work.  They were very much concerned about achievement of everyone, not simply those who were demonstrating that they had some great ability.  Our teachers were really about trying to get everyone to appreciate the need for education, and the importance of education, so there was very, very much encouragement.  More of our teachers were in our neighborhoods [in Washington, D.C.], were more likely to be known to us.  Their children may have been attending the same schools, so I think there was a, not necessarily a maternalistic and paternalistic approach, but there was certainly this sort of caring, parenting approach of many other teachers.  And I think those who sorted out, certainly would have gotten whatever kinds of assistance they needed.  I think they were very encouraging of those that they felt had potential and, and were willing to do whatever it is that they could do to encourage them to be successful, to encourage their parents to involve them in extracurricular activities and programs, to allow them to go on the field trips that would broaden our experiences, and I think much of that had to do with the deep involvement and caring of the teachers that we encountered.  Many of whom, obviously had existed, or coexisted in the segregated school system and had long had a responsibility for trying to minimize the effects of segregation and to try to bring up, as far as possible, the black students under their care.
Speaker 1: Do you know of any parents that might have objected to their child being in a particular track?
Speaker 2: I believe there were a number of parents who were very much concerned about the tracking system.  Some, feeling that it was a negative approach, not wanting their children to be segregated in a new form of segregation, felt that poorer performing students, might be encouraged to perform better about being in classes with their better performing classmates.  There was certainly a lot of controversy around this.  And I believe what we see in the flaws of such a system is a criticism that they had encountered, which ultimately led to its demise.  I think a lot of it was fear, a well-founded fear, because of the lack of equal opportunity that had been provided.  And I think many parents thought that this new tracking system was a method not designed really to elevate their children, but really to depress their abilities and opportunities because I think if we look back, we will probably find--and looking at the school system as a whole, while it is evolving into a predominantly black school system, I think we will still find that black students probably occupied most of the lower rung of such a tracking system, and white students were probably more likely to be in the higher rungs.  And I think that is what was most of greater concern by parents, was whether or not their children would really have an opportunity to be placed in the appropriate academic environment that their abilities and potential would have reflected.
Speaker 1: Now, when did the system end of tracking?
Speaker 2: I'm not exactly sure.  I think it was probably around 1966, '67 [1967].  I do recall that Julius Hobson had been, and individuals like Douglas Moore [Douglas E. Moore], had been very much involved and engaged in the community and very much concerned about those things that may have not been as progressive as intended.  But I think it was because it was obviously court cases and appeals before it was ultimately settled.  But I think it was probably somewhere in--towards the late 1960s.
Story_ID: 569088
Speaker 1: Were a lot of the black parents involved in things like the PTA [Parent Teacher Association]?
Speaker 2: I believe that black parents were involved in the PTA, they were involved in a whole range of activities.  At the same time, I think it depended upon the opportunities that parents themselves had to participate in such activities.  For example, my father [Thomas O. Battle] worked two jobs, my mother [Lenora Thomas Battle] was primarily a homemaker, so their ability and opportunity to participate in a number of the kinds of regular school activities would not have been the same for those who had a greater degree of free time.  Homemakers that did not have large families to manage, professionals who had time in which they could devote to certain activities, I think this made a difference.  At the same time, those parents who did not always have an opportunity to participate more formally in some of these activities, were still very much concerned about their children, and I would say that often their views were represented by other parents, those who did have an opportunity to participate.  So when it was possible to do so, my parents certainly would have participated or attended school activities, which I would have been involved.  But much of that would have been a result of whether they literally had the time that they could come to some of these activities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you said your father had two jobs?  You said he worked in the federal government?
Speaker 2: Well, he worked for the D.C. [Washington, D.C.] government.
Speaker 1: The D.C. government.
Speaker 2: The D.C. government was almost a part of the federal government in some ways, so they sort of blend together.  In, in some ways, my father was very fortunate.  The--he did not hold a high position within the District government, but knowing how the system was at that time, he was one of those fortunate enough that he actually had a regular government job, if you will.  During this period in which black Americans were often only at the, at the lowest levels, he had a clerical position.  But at the time, that was seen as a white collar position within the context of the federal government, of the D.C. government.  At the same time, because he did have this large family, because it was not in some high paying position, you know, to supplement income, he drove a taxi.  As I think back, he was not unusual in that.  It seems like many parents who were not in professional positions; doctors, lawyers, those kinds of independent businesses, often--and had large families--often would supplement their salaries by some other job.  In my father's case, well in my family's case, his being a taxi driver also afforded the benefit that that was the family car.  It also afforded the opportunity for myself in particular, being the oldest child and the first born son, I had a great deal of interaction with my father when I was young.  The boy going off with the father, and daughters being with the mother in a, in a certain way.  And because he was a cab driver, it afforded me an opportunity to see the city in a way somewhat differently that I was seeing only in my neighborhood.  While we were a segregated city, it did not mean that black taxi drivers were not having also, as passengers, white people.  And, certainly, my father did, and that afforded me an opportunity to see this other part of the world, this other part of our city, this other part of our existence that in some ways we were more removed from.

Speaker 1: Your job at D.C. Public Library [District of Columbia Public Library, Washington, D.C.], what was that?  And who were some of the people that would be coming into the library?
Speaker 2: My job at D.C. Public Library is an interesting one.  It started out simply as a summer job between my freshman and sophomore years, needing ongoing compensation just to support myself paying my tuition and things.  I, I was very fortunate that the public library at the time, employed lots of part-time workers.  Many of whom were students, and I had the opportunity for, much of--well, for my sophomore year forward, to work at the Mt. Pleasant Public Library [Mt. Pleasant Neighborhood Library] in Northwest Washington [D.C.].  That was an interesting experience, because it much more exposed me to the burgeoning, of what we call now the Hispanic community in Washington, which at that time, was, I don't think, very visible or noticeable.  But, again, did expose me to another part of the city, and in many ways became the foundation for the kinds of things that I would pursue in the future.  I, interestingly enough, also met, as a coworker, an individual who had attended Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], was attending Miner Teachers College [District of Columbia Teachers College; University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.].  And who to this day, his name is Dr. Oswell Person.  And to this day, he is very much like a big brother.  He's someone that, sort of, helped me to see and to understand what was going on in the larger world.  He was a few years older.  And in terms of looking back upon those who may have influenced me from a, from an earlier period, who've had a continuous influence, he would certainly be one of those people, and there were some others who went on.  I remember our branch librarian later in my tenure, Mrs. Lottie Wright, who had gone onto--she had a major role in the development in the new library at what was then, Federal City College [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C], the District's new land grant college that was just opening up.  So, with her encouragement, with Oswell's encouragement, I found myself going to work at the Federal City College, and in many ways, I imagine, that was my introduction to professional academic librarianship.
Story_ID: 569090
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about Federal City College which, you know, later became the University of the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: One of the interesting things about Federal City College is that when it was proposed, it was proposed to serve the purposes of the population of the District of Columbia, in the same way that other state schools have been developed in other jurisdictions.  Whether during the segregated period, in which there were separate public systems, black and white students, or however they may have been developed.  At Federal City and its proponents, felt very strongly that such a public institution should be available in Washington, D.C. for its black population.  One of the interesting things about that, and the development of it, was there were many who said, "Isn't Howard University [Washington, D.C.] already in Washington?"  Howard was, I believe, a very strong supporter for the development of Federal City College, and was able to point out that it was not, while it was in this local community, it was not a local university.  It's an international university whose student population comes from all over the United States and other parts of the world.  And that it should not be expected to substitute for the needs of what a state institution or in this sense, the city's institution should provide.  And I think that argument was ultimately was realized, and we did, then saw the development of the Federal City College, which eventually evolved into what is today the University of the District of Columbia.
Story_ID: 569091
Speaker 1: Getting back to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], some of the people that influenced you, and made, and also like you said, worked toward getting Federal City College [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] started and things of that nature, who were some of the people, or players, during your time, at Howard?
Speaker 2: At Howard.  As a student, one of the people that I remember most clearly, is Dr. Nathan Hare [HistoryMaker Nathan Hare].  Dr. Nathan Hare went on to be editor of The Black Scholar magazine.  Dr. Hare was one of my earliest sociology professors, and I remember him for two reasons.  One, because of the scholarship that he brought to the black experience, and the opportunity to learn from someone who was so knowledgeable, and also coming here to Howard, as a part of this longer and larger tradition of black scholarships, one of Dr. Hare's students, had been Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] who obviously went on to much greater acclaim later.  And I initially met Stokely, as we knew him then, when I was in school, when he came back to talk to the students, in Nathan Hare's class.  So Nathan Hare would certainly have been one of those important figures that I remember from my earlier years at the university.  I also remember, President James Nabrit [James M. Nabrit, Jr.].  I remember, while we as students, and they had been quite critical later in my academic career, I was always reminded of the warmth with which he had greeted me as a freshman student at Howard University.  Really not having a clue about what was going on, and the very fact that this great and eminent person would have taken the time to greet and to speak to some insignificant freshman student, was something that always impressed me as he was, no matter what achievement, he was not too large to speak to the least of us, and certainly, that was one.  Also, I think generally, the influence would have been just a broader impact of the university.  This is where, I first really met the black world in one place, so to speak.  I--this is where I met students from all over the Caribbean, from all over Africa, who were attending Howard University so that I began to have a first-hand experience, rather than, sort of a second and third-hand experience and understanding the other cultures of the black world.  And I can't imagine that I could have gotten a better introduction to all of that than here at Howard.  So once I looked beyond the students, beyond just a faculty member here or there, at what he or she may have contributed, I would have to say that it was the Howard University student population at large, of which was most influential in just this coming of development, just the exposure to such an extraordinary range of individuals and talent to come to this institution and see such an extraordinary range of scholars in every field.  It was just an amazing thing for me to experience at that young age.
Story_ID: 569092
Speaker 1: After you graduated in 1969 [from Howard University, Washington, D.C.], where did you go?
Speaker 2: When I graduated, my graduation date actually came, I actually completed my studies in 1968, at the end of 1968.  The reason I was essentially a semester late had to do with the changes in--initially, there was an expectation that I would have continued on in the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] program, and would have gone off into the [U.S.] military.  Once that did not occur, that caused me to have to make changes in my academic program in order to graduate.  The, the inability to move forward in my business minor, simply delayed my, my graduation.  So while I technically graduated in 1969, I actually finished in 1968.  So I was continuing to work at the public library [District of Columbia Public Library, Washington, D.C.] while trying to determine what it was that I would do in my future.  I had initially thought quite frankly, that I would become a lawyer.  The law was something that was of great, great interest to me.  But what I discovered, I guess, I anticipated going to Howard's law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.]; but at that time, it was not the simple easy thing to do to be a full-time working student.  Because I had to work during the day, we didn't have the same kind of evening program, so that was somewhat incompatible, and law, in that instant, sort of moved to the side.  I also had a great interest in the [U.S.] Foreign Service.  The reason being that I wanted people elsewhere in the world to have a better understanding of who we were as black people.  And I felt that that could be done by being able to go to other places and to say, and to talk about who we really were, and I initially thought of going in that area.  But this was at the time when I was recruited to work at the Federal City College library [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.], and that is where I went.  And that is what ultimately set me on the track of being here in a research library [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 569093
Speaker 1: What was your job at Federal City [Federal City College; University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C]? You were in the media (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think--(cough) excuse me--Federal City College, I think at that time was beginning to look at different ways of which library services would be provided.  There was the development of what they called a media center idea.  That this was--libraries were something with the kind of facilities that included a wide range of materials and all kinds of formats.  And that media, in its general context, would be an important element of library work in the future.  So Federal City College had what they called a media center.  I was not a trained professional librarian by any means, but I did have a great deal of experience and understanding and knowledge from having worked in the public library [District of Columbia Public Library, Washington, D.C.] for a number of years.  Both, certainly initially as a--as sort of a student worker.  I believe my title was senior media intern, although I was not an intern in the context that we might describe it today, but I do think that that may have been the title initially.  And, basically, it was a non-professional position, probably involving, probably in the circulation area of the library, in which I had a lot of contact with students and faculty who were using the facility.  And it was there that I was encouraged to take my experiences and perhaps use them to move into the professional area of librarianship.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the people that you came in contact with; students and faculty at Federal City?
Speaker 2: One, certainly would be Oswell Person again.  He seems to have preceded me in steps along the way.  As, as I think about it, he was certainly there at the Federal City, and is one of the individuals, perhaps the single most important individual in my decision to go to the University of Maryland at College Park [Maryland], and to pursue library training.  I don't have any real strong recollection.  There may have been some people like Dr. Russell Adams [HistoryMaker Russell Adams], that I later met at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], I believe was on the faculty there.  I think I may have met Professor Leon Damas [Leon-Gontran Damas], during that period at Federal City College and then again later at Howard University.  It seems like it's been such a long time ago now, that I don't, don't recall so many of those specific individuals who, who, who were there when I was there.
Speaker 1: So it seems like a lot of the--some of the faculty at Howard were also teaching at Federal City at the time?
Speaker 2: That may have been the case, it may have been a matter of their initially coming into this area, initially coming to this university, and I don't think it's unusual going from one institution to the other.
Story_ID: 569094
Speaker 1: --Try to get this clarification when we get to it because I was at D.C. Public Library [District of Columbia Public Library, Washington, D.C.], then I was at Federal City [Federal City College; University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C], then I was at the D.C. Public Library again very briefly, so it may be the impression that I graduated from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], worked at Federal City, and came to Howard as an employee from Federal City.  But that's not the case.  But I think with your next follow-up questions, I can clarify that too.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You were talking about your experience at Federal City, and some of the teachers that influenced you.  What did you--what happened after that?
Speaker 1: While I was in Federal City College and working in the media center, one of my coworkers encouraged me to take advantage of recruitment efforts that were underway at the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland], which was seeking to increase the numbers of African American professional librarians in our communities, both in traditional, as well as non-traditional settings.  And that is the point at while I was continuing to work at Federal City, I also began to pursue graduate studies and library science at the University of Maryland that ultimately led me to--back to the D.C. Public Library briefly as a professional.  I was interested at that--in the D.C. Public Library, again at that time, because they were in the process of establishing a black studies division.  And my interest was certainly to work in some area related to black studies, while I had always been pursuing whatever my formal studies were.  My applicational interest was always in history and in black history, so regardless of what I was pursuing formally, I was always informally engaged in the study of history.  And the notion of being able to use that knowledge and experiences in black history at the public library, was something that appealed to me at that time.  So once I had gotten the professional degree, I did work as a professional at the D.C. Public Library before eventually going on to employment at Howard University.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Let's go back to University of Maryland.  Did you go on fellowship?
Speaker 1: Yes I did, as a matter of fact.  The University of Maryland had--well, one of the interesting things about this whole experience, is I went out and met people, had an opportunity to see what, what the place was about.  I think they were very encouraged about the possibilities of my coming into the school, and I sometimes say that I had been awarded a fellowship for graduate study before I had ever formally completed an application to attend the school.  And I decided to--I obviously went forward with the application.  There was a, a program that was being developed at that time for what I think was described as urban librarianship, which I think is probably a euphemism for black librarians in urban black communities.  And then there was what was considered the traditional program.
Story_ID: 569095
Speaker 1: Dr. Battle [HistoryMaker Thomas Battle], you were talking about the fellowship that you got to go to the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland], and we were talking about urban librarianship.  What else was going on, as far as the community, you know, Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had happened, and the riots and things of that nature.  What was going on, as you were, as you were beginning to pursue this--your professional career?
Speaker 2: The, the time I was at the University of Maryland is a--here right as the '60s [1960s] have ended, starting out into the '70s [1970s].  And then this is when we had some of the great triumphs, if you will, of the Civil Rights Movement, the--also some of the tragedies, but I'll just speak to the triumphs first.  With the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 [Civil Rights Act of 1964], the Voting Rights Act in 1965 [Voting Rights Act of 1965], there were certainly--and with the general student movement and, and people seeking rights within the larger Civil Rights Movement.  There was lots of pressure on institutions that had not been very welcoming to black people to be much more responsive.  We're in a period in which there is integration, but as many of us know, it is forced integration.  The University of Maryland was an institution that had not been very responsive to the requirements of integration that was going on at a national level.  And it is my understanding, that as a part of their effort to make certain that they did not lose federal funding, that they were implementing some programs that were much more conducive to recruiting black students into a wide range of activities.  And one of those had seemed somewhat natural, given the work experiences that I'd had, as well as some of my interests, was the program in librarianship.  In which they were trying to bring more black people into professional librarianship as information peo- information specialists.  That is the sort of circumstance at the time that I was entering the University of Maryland.  The urban librarianship, was to me, a much more unsettled proposition as to where it was going and what its intentions were.  I decided for fairly practical reasons, simply to pursue a somewhat traditional library course of study during that period.  But I must say that there was a constant interaction among the African American students regardless of what program they were in.  One of the things that I think may have been interesting at the time was--I'm not certain, but there may have been some lessening of requirements for students to enter the urban librarianship program.  I do recall that there were some who were accusing the institution of allowing students to enter that program, although they did not have the requirements that would normally allow them to be in graduate school.  I certainly avoided any kind of criticism such as that, since no one leveled such charges against the traditional program at the University of Maryland.
Story_ID: 569096
Speaker 1: As a D.C. [Washington, D.C.] native, what was some of the things that, during that particular time period that were going on in the communities?  Were there some black book stores, were there reading groups?  And who were some of the folk that were the D.C. players?
Speaker 2: Well, by the 19--by the end of the 1960s, by the 1970s, there had certainly been a number of things that had gone on, and my recollection is that there were a number of community-based activities.  When I reflect back, I was probably as much influenced by some of these community activities, that I forget often that I was involved in as a member of the, let's say, D.C. Civic Association [D.C. Federation of Civic Associations, Washington, D.C.].  We, we had, you know, segregated citizens and civic associations at that time, one for black, one for whites.  One of the signal events, for instance, that occurred while I was still in high school [McKinley Technical High School; McKinley Technology High School, Washington, D.C.], was the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.  And as a result of my activities and activism in civic association affairs, I was in, literally, involved in the March on Washington as a marshal.  I was a student, a high school student at the time, but I was involved in that, that whole process.  And one of the lasting memories I've always had, is knowing that I was on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial [Washington, D.C.], not too far distant, watching Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] at the time that he gave the speech that we know so well of, you know, I Have a Dream.  That was certainly one of the important things, because of having seen Dr. King at that time, and then later on while I'm literally working at the D.C. Public Library [District of Columbia Public Library, Washington, D.C.], learning about his assassination from a patron coming in, and having had an opportunity to see him while I was a student at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  Just sort of that expanse, I find very telling in terms of having seen him at both the heights, as well as at the depths of his career in many ways.
Story_ID: 569097
Speaker 1: The Howard University [Washington, D.C.] experience during that period is also one in which, in terms of the sorts of community responses.  I think today, we don't have as much of an understanding about how black history came to be a part of our lives as we may now.  When I was in college, although it was a historically black university [HBCUs], there was not really any, to my recollection, I do recall taking one course, but there were not all of these courses that we see today that focus in on black history and culture.  The reality, however, is that it was imbued within the curriculum depending upon who your professor was.  So a professor like [HistoryMaker] Nathan Hare, for instance, certainly would have included this.  And any other number of university professors included the black aspects of this history, whether or not it was clearly seen as a larger part of this curriculum.  So, in that context, much of my approach and learning in black studies, does not come directly from that in classroom experience.  It's really that, that coming of age and gaining of knowledge that we acquired as students outside the classroom as we were being exposed to this new literature that's being brought to us in the 1960s.  Now, certainly, so many of us have been influenced by black publications, whether it's Ebony and Jet, and all of those kinds of magazine publications, the black press.  We're certainly influenced by the things that have brought to us and the Afro, as an example.  the Afro-American newspaper [Washington Afro-American; Afro-American Newspapers], as opposed to the, the other traditional city newspapers, that very little focused on black people except if there was some crime committed.  Whereas the black press, like the Afro, is focusing on black life across a very broad spectrum.  And so that afforded us the opportunity to, at least, become aware of some things, and as there was this great, this development of the black, black awareness movement, there's a rise of this Black Arts Movement.  We find that there is the publication and republication of materials to address the interests, to heighten interests in black history and culture that I saw developing in the 1960s.  So as students, we would find these materials wherever they were, and we were fortunate enough that there were bookstores and booksellers that were coming about, such as Drum and Spear [Drum and Spear Bookstore], a bookstore which was here in Washington [D.C.], and was a place that you could go and find materials that were not generally available, and that was certainly, an important part of that.  So while there may not have been the kinds of study and reading groups we find today, I think there was a, a lot of discussion among us as young people just trying to understand the--what was a major national and international affair, and which were also simply current events for us.  And being here in Washington, D.C., and being at Howard University, I think that we should appreciate that this is a natural, national stage for activities.  So many national figures came to Washington, D.C., and some also came to Howard University and there would also have been this greater exposure to those larger issues that affected us.  So I think being here in the nation's capital, and attending university, probably had a very profound impact that might not have been the same if I had been in some other community because its--much of it has to do with the, with the locus that is served as the--because of Howard University and Washington, D.C.  So I think that has a great deal to do, about some of the developments that I would have seen during that period.  Both positive and negative, because there were, at least from my perspective, some developments that were going on, on our campuses that we did not, at that time, fully understand.  I may have been apprehensive about some things, that later on I came to have the validation because I, in my later life, came to understand that there were events going on, on our campuses and within our organizations that none of us knew about until the COINTELPRO [Counterintelligence Program] activities, for instance, of the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] were exposed at some later point.  But there were certainly questions and--that I could not easily find answers to, that influenced some of the activities that I would have engaged in during the 1960s, whether formally or informally.

Speaker 1: What were some of the places that the people would meet in the city, like, would they meet at, like, Drum and Spear [Drum and Spear Bookstore, Washington, D.C.], or would they meet at, like, Ben's Chili Bowl [Washington, D.C.] or maybe there's churches, community people that were trying to advance black his--blacks in the--
Speaker 2: I think it's all of those things, I think it's a combination.  Certainly where we had book stores, individuals would have had an opportunity to come in.  Whatever was going on, I used to, I used to attend the local mosque, for instance.  Because I wanted to understand what the Nation of Islam was about, I wanted to understand this interest that black people had in Islam, and what better way?  I don't simply want to be told something, I also want to be able to come to my own conclusions through firsthand observation.  So I think as a collectively and as individuals, we took advantage of whatever kinds of activities that were going on, and availed ourselves of them.  For instance, here at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], I frequently attended classes that I was not formally monitoring in any way.  I certainly wasn't enrolled in them, but teachers were very accommodating for students who were interested in just sitting in on their classes and, and being able to learn what it was that they had to impart.  We sat just simply as students and talking to each other.  I sometimes remember back the notion of each one, teach one.  And just in informal groups, there were things that I had learned, either through my own readings, through my exposure and interactions with other people, and as I simple sat, you know, as they say, shooting the breeze with the fellas, I would--I've always been known for talking and sharing.  So I was always, in a sense, imparting this knowledge that had come to me about black history and culture that, that others might not have been aware.  So I think it was a very dynamic experience, and we took advantage of whatever the activities were.  And certainly there were those instances in which faculty and other individuals may have formally and informally tried to bring people together just to talk.  So I think it was a matter of a wide variety of activities, and most, if not all of them, were largely self-motivated.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of those faculty members that would, that did those kinds of things?
Speaker 2: Not directly, because quite frankly, I did not, for the most part, have an opportunity to participate in them.  Certainly those, those things that were occurring in the evening and off campus.  It was simply a matter that I had many other kinds of responsibilities.  But I was aware in just hearing other people talking about the opportunities that they had to do this.  I think there are some different experiences you have when you are a student in university, and you're living on campus, as opposed to being a local student who's working and living off campus.  So there's simply some things that I was aware of, my classmates may have shared with me, but I was not directly perhaps involved in, in those meetings or those discussions.
Story_ID: 569099
Speaker 1: What were some of the students reading about that time?  Was Chancellor Williams, for instance, was his--was he a popular professor?
Speaker 2: I think it depended upon whomever was supposed to be, you know, the popular person at the time.  One of the names that comes to my mind, for instance, is Frantz Fanon.  And I remember being in school [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and you'd have people--and since so many of us didn't know our own history and culture, we had to rely upon what we were being told by other people.  And I--one of the things that I remember is standing and hearing someone talking, for instance, "Fanon said this, Fanon said that," and hearing my classmates cheering, "Right on, right on."  And here I'm thinking, Fanon didn't say that.  Because I had read Fanon, and he had said something different, so that was one of the things that also came to influence me, was, was the important role that teachers play.  And especially, the, the notion that, this person knows, and I'm just simply going to accept it, so that I would find myself cautioning people that you need to learn and know this for yourself.  You simply can't accept what you're being told by someone else.  And, and certainly, we should have known better since much of what we experienced as black people is a result of what we have been told that has been incorrect.  The mis-education that Woodson [Carter G. Woodson] would allude to, so that we should be questioning and challenging, not simply accepting.  So at the same time, one of the disappointments I had was how many of my classmates were simply willing to accept what they were being told without going forward to investigate.  But there was always a dynamic group of students around who were questioning and challenging authority, and who were coming forward with materials that they had read, and that they knew, and that they were able to share with students, and certainly as there was this, this interest, this commercial interest.  These were books that could be sold.  The more books that became available, the greater opportunity we had to read and to learn and this is certainly something that continued to influence me for much of my life.
Story_ID: 569100
Speaker 1: So as you matriculated to the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland], what were some of the things that went on there that were of interest to you?
Speaker 2: Well, I found the University of Maryland an interesting experience.  Those who know me, know that I am, I always say that there's something about Africa that's, that's a part of my body.  You're going to see it in my physical attire.  Today there are other aspects that are not as easily seen.  But, certainly, we were noticeable at the University of Maryland.  Black students stood out, if you will.  There were certainly a few of us, and, and I remember being the student dressed in African attire, quite different than virtually anybody else, that was an exception.  Probably part of a Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] experience that I had, you know, I was so closely allied with African culture.  But I do remember the looks that I got, or the inquiries that I got from what I think was an entirely white faculty at the University of Maryland.  And sometimes I know they were speechless, not quite sure what to say or do as it related to me as this very obviously projecting of blackness in my attire and my hair.  I--that was the period of natural hair styles and many of us let it grow out as Afros that were very large.  So in that sense, I stood out, and so one of the things that I remember is that kind of relationship.  Another is a--is similar, but at some point different with the University of Maryland.  There was an active undergraduate student body, an undergraduate, I think like black study, one of the black organizations, and it was very interesting that during this period, issues that had come up in library school and library education, the administration couldn't understand why undergraduate students would be interested in what is going on in this graduate program, especially as some of it related to urban librarianship.  And what no one ever knew and, probably, I'm not even sure if I've talked about this before, but at that time when I was at the University of Maryland, the head of what was the black student union, I think it was called, coincidentally, had been someone that I had initially met while working at the D.C. Public Library [District of Columbia Public Library, Washington, D.C.] before going to the University of Maryland.  So, in essence, since this was someone I knew, the reason he and the black student union at the undergraduate level knew what was going on in the graduate level programs, was because we were having this kind of contact.  And they were able to, as a group, take on causes that we had, as graduate students--and I found it interesting that the university was sort of scratching its head trying to figure it out.  And it was just simply one of those things of having that personal contact.
Story_ID: 569101
Speaker 1: I also remember at the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland], the--I think it was the invasion of Cambodia.  And--or Route 1 [U.S. Route 1], which runs through the campus was closed down and the university was closed down and there was a lot of activity going on and lots of student, and not necessarily violence, but things going on.  And there were two things of interest.  One, the individual I referred to was with a black student union, in being asked about these activities, made it very clear of the disappointment of black students in the university being closed down because of the impact it was having on our ability to become educated.  And I thought that was very telling since there had not been this great desire for us to be there anyway.  That black students and the black cause was something that was featured as an important issue.  And I also remember it was one of the few times that white students felt that they would be safer by walking with black students, because as it turned out no one was bothering the black students on campus, although, white students were having their own problems among each other.  And I clearly remember white classmates, and certainly some of the white women I was in class with, saying, "Do you mind if I walk with you to the parking lot," or "Do you mind if we do this."  And the reason was because they felt much safer being with us as their black classmates and other black students, than they felt being out on the campus and subject to being abused, if you will, by the police forces that had been brought on the campus to quell the student disturbances that were going on.  And, in essence, the feeling was that black students are not responsible for and involved in this.  So the black students are immune from this because there's no reason to bother the black students.  It's the white students who were starting all of the trouble.  And I've always found that, that's probably one of the few times that white people felt that the safest place for them to be was to be with black people who could provide for their security.
Story_ID: 569102
Speaker 1: What else was going on, on the campus at the time that would have been of interest?
Speaker 2: The University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] was an opportunity, my views about the institution would be somewhat different today.  It has certainly evolved over the last three, four decades into a much more diverse and inclusive institution.  But at that time, the University of Maryland would have been struggling with its prior racist heritage, with the pressures put on it from the national and local community levels, for it to become much more the institution for all Marylanders, and not just simply for the majority of the community.  So I think what I would find at the University of Maryland, is an experience within a predominantly white academic environment, having come from this largely black academic environment of Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And if I could sort of summarize what those experiences at Howard had been for me, I've sometimes told people that both in my family life, my community life, and certainly my experiences through the university, is that I never grew up with any feelings of inferiority.  There was nothing about being inferior that was ever projected to me by my family, by my community.  This was always an external projection by the majority about this inferiority.  So that coming from an institution like Howard University, in which we were surrounded by people of great achievement and became much more aware of all of this achievement as we are learning this history.  That, I think, we have a, a new generation by the time I am going into the University of Maryland, where my generation of students, those baby boomers that were my colleagues, that we were not at this point going into these majority institutions in any way feeling that we are inferior.  And I think much of that had to do with how well prepared we felt we had been by what was almost exclusively the historically black colleges [HBCUs], which we had developed.  So that for me is also a part of the exposure I had had to the broader white community in Washington, D.C. as I grew up.  And I think, perhaps, those kinds of experiences may have given me an advantage, because I did have these interracial experiences that many of my colleagues who came from other kinds of black communities, may not have had the same degree of exposure, and may have interacted with the majority community in different ways.  So I do believe being here in Washington, being exposed to the white community at every level, certainly, the national and international level, and coming to Howard University, in which I think one of the themes was, we are not the black minority, we are the chosen few, was one of those catch phrases that I sort of remember.  And certainly, I've always said there was nothing inculcated in me about inferiority.  If I reflected back upon the experiences of enslavement of people in the Americas and what we had been able to achieve in spite of the segregation and the--all of the discrimination, all of the oppression that if we have been able to survive that, and to have doctors and lawyers and people who have been able to achieve, that far from being, or harboring any feelings of inferiority, I would probably say I was harboring feelings of superiority as a people.  So those were my Washington and Howard experiences that I think have had as much to do with influencing how I interact with other people, and if we want to use that, that kind of phraseology that was very common then.  There may be those who grew up feeling inferior, but I was not one of them, my family was not one of them, I don't think the Howard University community was one of them.  And I think all of those things have very much influenced where I find myself today.
Story_ID: 569103
Speaker 1: Also during that time, was the time of the war [Vietnam War] you said and also the Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] administration.  Any comments about that?
Speaker 2: The Nixon administration.  You know, I actually voted for Richard Nixon to be president.  Now, of course, I was in junior high school [Carter G. Woodson Junior High School, Washington, D.C.] when he was running against John Kennedy [John Fitzgerald Kennedy], and I certainly felt that my reasoning at that time was very sound.  I thought he should be president because he had the greater experience, having been vice president.  Obviously, as I evolved and grew older, I came to have a different understanding and appreciation about who these figures were, and as I came to university, majoring in political science and government, starting to look at factors in a somewhat different sense, and actually looking back as to who these people are, not just names, by the time Richard Nixon was actually running for president again, I was no longer, you know, the immature high school student who simply thought, "Well, he had experience as vice president, he's best prepared to be president."  That I could now understand who this Richard Nixon was, how he had come to rise in politics in California, the kinds of things that he had been involved in.  I should also say that Richard Nixon as a Republican, helps me in the appreciation of this whole transition of black America from the Republican to the Democratic Party.  And this certainly holds for me with 1964 and the election of Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] when he's running against Barry Goldwater.  It is at this juncture that I come to see that there is a different Republican Party in America at this time.  And that it is not the party of Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln] that was positing the freedom of black people, and that set in motion those things that we know that occurred in the early days of Reconstruction.  So that, as a student of history, I then was able to go back and to see how the community had been largely abandoned by this party as America evolved after Lincoln's death and up to 1876.  And then the very, very negative period of our history over the course of that, until the mid-1960s.  And then with Barry Goldwater positing these positions that were very antithetical to the best interests of African Americans, and here is this racist Democratic Party, as we had known it, positing these things for the benefit of our community.  I see very clearly here, in this period of 1964 and 1965, this great political shift.  I see it in terms of those who had been racist Democrats, who for me, then became the racist Republicans.  So I no longer saw Richard Nixon as a representative of that party that had bought freedom for us, but as a representative of that party that was prepared to keep us in oppression because it appeased many of those interests in the South.  And I see that as it has continued right here into the 21st century.  So, Richard Nixon for me is representative of this real, real shift in the political consciousness of black people and in black people really reaching out and, and starting to look at themselves differently, and to make different judgments about who has their best interests at heart.

Speaker 1: Dr. Battle [HistoryMaker Thomas Battle], what year did you graduate from the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: I graduated in 1971.
Speaker 1: What was your degree?
Speaker 2: It was in--Master of Library Science was what it was called at that time.
Speaker 1: After your graduation, what did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, just at the point before I completed the degree at the University of Maryland, I joined, I rejoined the staff of the D.C. Public Library [District of Columbia Public Library, Washington, D.C.].  I left Federal City College [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] and went to D.C. Public Library.  Specifically because they had two programs they were in the process of developing.  One was a black studies division, and the other, for want of a better term, was urban librarians--(cough) excuse me--another program they was developing, was an, sort of an urban librarians program in which individuals would not be assigned to a specific branch, but would have the opportunity to go to various of the branches throughout the city.  So that is what had interested me in terms of going back to the D.C. Public Library.  Interestingly enough, my friend Oswell Person had come to--from Federal City College, to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] to work on the developing, the development of a new library research activity in the social sciences.  And he became aware that they were looking for new employees in what was then known as the Moorland-Spingarn Collection [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.].  And he told me about it knowing one, that I was aware of the collection, but knowing more importantly of my great, great interest in black, in black history and culture.  So I was, I--at that time, in December, literally December of 1971, applied for a job in Moorland-Spingarn Research Center as a librarian, and I guess you might say, the rest is history.  I was formally employed effective, January 1, 1972.  I've often said that the most wonderful thing that could have happened was that my first day on the job was a day off.  A paid day off.
Speaker 1: A paid day off.  Okay.
Story_ID: 569105
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] experience?  You came as a reference librarian?
Speaker 2: Interestingly enough, there are those who have no idea that I have a library background, other than my sometimes commenting that I have worked in a library.  People have seen me in so many of my other professional activities, see me essentially as an historian, but don't realize that there are these other areas of preparation that I had.  So while I may have gone off eventually to do other graduate work in history, when I came to Howard University, I came to work as a librarian, in the reference department, at Moorland-Spingarn Research Center [Moorland-Spingarn Collection; Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.].  And it was that experience that has led me to everything else.  It was in many ways a surprise in coming here, having been a student, I knew that Moorland-Spingarn in many, many ways was sacred ground.  I don't know that I would have applied for the position if I had not been encouraged to do so.  Thinking that, frankly, I wasn't worthy, you know, to be in this, in this kind of an environment.  When I think back about it, it goes again really, to my undergraduate experience.  I grew up in an era, in which one of the videos that I remember, I think, I'm fairly certain, Bill Cosby was a narrator, and I think it was titled something like 'Black History: Lost, Stolen, or Strayed,' something like that.  And I remember, when I came to Howard University, and was exposed to Moorland-Spingarn, I said to myself, it was neither lost, stolen, nor strayed.  It's right here on the campus of Howard University.  So that also became one of the great windows into all of this knowledge about black history, and the opportunity to start to use this collection as a part of my academic activities, so that the notion that I would somehow come back, and be a part of this institution, was just absolutely amazing to me, so that in many, many ways, I was shocked that the esteemed Dorothy Porter Wesley would have felt that I was worthy enough to join the staff, and I've been here ever since.
Story_ID: 569106
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about Dorothy Porter [Dorothy Porter Wesley]?
Speaker 2: She was dynamic, is probably one of the best things that I can say.  She was small of stature, and large in every other way.  She was already a legend when I met her.  I had seen her as a student [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.], but would never have had the temerity to approach her.  I remember when I came here for the interview, that literally, I had come directly here from the dentist, and I've often said, I could not imagine how to be interviewed when I couldn't feel my lips moving and anything.  And I think I had dug out the shirt I had with a tie and a blue sports jacket to come for that interview.  And, and really because I had been encouraged to do so, but not having any real expectation that I would be chosen.  So I guess in many, many ways, I've been, I'm grateful, but at the same time, have felt very privileged that Dorothy thought that I had, to some extent, what it takes to be able to play an important role, well to play any kind of role here at Moorland-Spingarn [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.].  So when I think back, I, I just simply think of one of the great, great people involved in black librarianship.  Someone who also showed me what it was to be both the librarian and the scholar, and that these things can, are really brought together.  They're really not separated.  And certainly since librarians and those who handle information, or tend to know much, much more about it than, than many others who are simply coming to use it.  The opportunity to be able to bring these elements together, and to know that I was, I was chosen by Dorothy herself, was something that I've always cherished.  I sometimes say that I'm the missing link, might be more appropriately, I'm the connecting link, but in terms of Dorothy's era and whatever came after, I'm the surviving person who has worked, who actually had worked with her.
Story_ID: 569107
Speaker 1: What was Moorland's [Moorland-Spingarn Collection; Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.] reputation here on the campus, and also, across the country?
Speaker 2: Moorland as a repository, I think some might have felt it was not a very welcoming environment.  I would say, quite frankly, I was not welcome in here as an undergraduate student.  One of the ways that I got access was that my teachers had to say it was essential and important for me to be here.  Some have often said that white scholars may have been given access to Moorland that black scholars were not achieving.  I know that to be a fact with comments made to me by black scholars, once I began working here.  I think it was a no-nonsense place.  One of the anecdotes that I remember, and I've heard this from different sources, including Dorothy [Dorothy Porter Wesley] herself, is that there were students who wanted to come over and burn down Moorland-Spingarn, whether, you know, whether they were gonna actually do that, but that was the notion.  Because they didn't feel it was appropriate to have this institution of Negro history on the campus of Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And as I understand it, after Dorothy had the opportunity to educate some of our young people about what that Negro history was, they turned around and became, if you will, the guardians of the collection.  Because basically, they had to come to an understanding of what this was all about.  That this so called Negro history was black history, was the African experience, it was all of this.  And that's just one of those things that, that reflected the lack of really knowledge or understanding on the part of young people.  Another anecdote that I remember, goes back to the '70s [1970s], there used to be bomb threats often, for whatever the reasons.  And sometimes we felt that this was simply an effort of students to get an exam cancelled, or something, that these things were coming up.  But what would often happen, obviously, they would close facilities and everyone had to get out.  We had a bomb threat here and Dorothy, as a matter of fact, refused to leave, refused to allow us to close, and, and we stayed open.  And what I can say is that we never had another bomb threat because I think they finally realized that they were not going to be able to run us away or scare us away.  We--I'm not suggesting that these necessarily came from black people, but it is one of those things that I remember, and I remember how she reacted.  In that sense, she was not easily threatened, she was very strong willed.  She was, I think, just to see the great respect that she had from scholars was something that was very much influencing in terms of knowing that they, the kind of role and the kind of impact that you could have.  To see scholars approach her, as this great font of knowledge, when the expectation is that they are the great ones with the knowledge, was very, very telling.  And this appreciation of the role and impact that a librarian could have, for me was embodied in the small stature of this woman, who was in many, many ways, larger than life.
Story_ID: 569108
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about the collection, from the Tappan Collection [Lewis Tappan Collection, 1847-1860] on, what are some of the things, and some of the more unique things that you found in the collection when you came?
Speaker 2: The--whatever it is that I thought that I knew or understood about this collection from my exposure to using it as a student, was absolutely nothing to the understanding that I came to have once I was working here on the staff.  I have, I have in many ways known from that time, that this center [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.] here, is the greatest repository for black history and culture that there is.  And I've said that fully with an understanding of the existence of the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.].  And one of the reasons I came to understand that, was the numbers of people who were being sent to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] to look and to find things and who were being referred to Howard by the staff at the Library of Congress.  I came to understand what it meant to be a library of last resort, in the sense that, if you can't find it anywhere else, look at Howard University.  So it is the overwhelming volume of material.  If I'm someone coming and having no real appreciation, for just how voluminous the collections are, and then to be on the inside, and to just see the tremendous numbers of things, the first editions, the autographed copies, things going back to the 16th century.  I mean, just utterly amazing to me to see the scholarship from all over the world, while I knew there was this material here, I simply could not have grasped just how, how tremendous the amount of material here was.  So just exposure to all of this stuff, to see--name someone that I may have heard about, Frederick Douglass, and to see on the shelf, not just a reprint of the autobiography of Frederick Douglass ['Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,' Frederick Douglass], but multiple first editions of all of Douglass' biographies was just astounding.  To see the original Phillis Wheatleys, to see Benjamin Banneker's almanac.  I guess perhaps Benjamin Banneker and his almanac would have been one of those things that first hit me because he was one of the people that you knew something about growing up as a young person.  Certainly in Washington [D.C.], you heard something about this black man named Banneker and there's a school [Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, Washington, D.C.] named after him that was right here near Howard University, and to have heard about Benjamin Banneker and his almanac, and here is Benjamin Banneker's almanacs, right here.  Those kinds of things were just tremendous to me, to have--to be aware of them and to literally see them.  Then to start to have an idea of, how long have we been doing this?  Quickly find out, well, the collection was founded in 1914, Dr. Jesse Moorland, an alumnus, donated his collection.  The imminent Kelly Miller had been someone very much involved.  That said a lot to me because, I did not have any idea that we had been so much involved in doing this that early in the 20th century.  It, of course, made me wonder, so how come no one knew about this?  How come no one, and obviously there were those who did, but then, more so than that was in having this great amazement that we've been doing this at least since 1914, to be told, oh, but no.  The materials have been coming here basically since the founding of the university.  And as an example, the Lewis Tappan antislavery collection, which had come to the university in 1870, so again, it made me somewhat bewildered about all of those who said that there was no black history and culture, there was nothing documenting it, or anything else.  It made me wonder exactly, what was the agenda of these individuals?  'Cause obviously, materials such as this had long, long been available.  What excuses were there for nothing substantial about black history being included in any of our textbooks, in any of our history books?  So in many ways, the exposure to those materials at Moorland-Spingarn made me that much more dedicated, if you will, to sharing it with a much broader community.  That these may be treasures here, but these are treasures that everyone needs to know about.  Because, in so many ways, I'll go back to Mr. Woodson [Carter G. Woodson], we are continuously mis-educated because the information about our experiences is denied to us.
Story_ID: 569109
Speaker 1: One of the interesting aspects is we have been a public facility within this private institutional setting.  And while we have certainly been widely used by all scholars of the black experience, we have not had, perhaps except within the Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] community, as much of a public presence as I think that we could, or should have.  And I think that certainly where Dorothy [Dorothy Porter Wesley] was concerned, she was doing her part in making the materials available, and I think simply a matter of time, before others came to have a real understanding of the vast resources that are not only at Howard University, but at all historically black colleges and universities [HBCUs].  Because we have all made the effort to document our history and culture going back from the beginnings of our institution.  And I think this is something that, while Howard may have the largest collection dedicated to this purpose, that as institutions and as a people, we have long been mindful about our history, and that we've made the effort to document that history in spite of the oppression we've suffered, and in spite of the obstacles that we've faced.
Speaker 2: Who are some of the scholars that came through while you, as a reference library?
Speaker 1: If they worked at Howard University in history, they were coming here.  Individuals like Rayford Logan, as a matter of fact, you'll hear about [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin as an example.  Someone who had been at Howard, and who had moved on to another institution.  To see some of these names coming through here, that for me had simply been in textbooks.  Certainly with some of the Howard University people, I was aware and familiar with them as a student.  But then to, to see them in their research settings, to see Benjamin Quarles [Benjamin A. Quarles], I remember from Morgan State [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] coming here.  Or, or there may have been some others that are not immediately coming to mind.  But whomever these scholars, that, whose names were familiar to some of us, and at various institutions, both minority institutions and majority institutions, to be aware that they were riding in and coming in was very important to me.  Now quite frankly, many were coming and interacting with Dorothy because of the great wealth of knowledge that she had to impart to them.  But just being able to be on the periphery, and to know that this individual had passed by, or had come through was just a phenomenal experience.  And I don't think you could have had it anywhere but here.
Speaker 2: Were there any foreign scholars that were coming at the time, maybe Fulbright scholars that might have been coming through?
Speaker 1: I think there were quite a number of scholars coming that I would not have known, would not have recognized, may not have had any contact with, may have simply been individuals that came in, met with Dorothy, but we as staff didn't have any great requirement to be involved with them.  I do remember, one of the white scholars that I do remember coming through, was August Meier, Elliott Rudwick, John Bracey [John H. Bracey, Jr.].  I remember them early on here.  But I must admit, that one of the things that struck me about that and one of the reasons that I remembered individuals like that is that because some of them had privileged access to the collections.  And that was very early, as I was trying to understand, why is it that certain individuals get the opportunity to come back in here, because we have closed stacks and closed collections, and how is it that some individuals get the privilege to do this, and I must admit that that sort of privileged access is something that changed when the center [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.] was reorganized under new administration and new management.  And one of the interesting things is we had some scholars who complained because they no longer got privileged access.  We had far many more who commended us because they were getting access that had been denied, but we also found that many appreciated the fact that we were far more egalitarian.  And that we were operating on the principles of equal access, and one of the side benefits that came from that is that there were some who may have criticized us initially, but when they saw that we were trying to be fair to everyone else, then became some of our staunchest supporters, because they realized that we were trying to serve all scholars of the black experience, and not simply provide opportunities to a few.  So I think while it may have grated on some at the beginning, I think eventually they came to see the wisdom, and that we were a much, much more open institution over the--since the 1970s.

Speaker 1: Early in your career, you got an opportunity to be an exchange librarian.  Could you tell us a little bit about your experience?
Speaker 2: The experience of being an exchange librarian is one of the defining moments in my life.
Speaker 1: In what year did you--
Speaker 2: This would have been in 1972.  It is hard to imagine that Howard University [Washington, D.C.] allowed me to leave for a year and go to Africa while I had been at the university for less than a year, and was probably the most junior member of the professional staff in the entire library system at Howard University.  But the justification of the university librarian, was that I was the most appropriate person, I had the greatest flexibility.  I was younger and single at the time, and I was also the one who could benefit most because I was in Moorland-Spingarn [Moorland-Spingarn Collection; Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.], and that is where the university's Africa and Africa centric materials were located.  And that those experiences would allow me to bring them back, and to use them within the context of my work at Moorland-Spingarn.  I--it was amazing that the university librarian had called me in, after having returned from the American Library Association meeting.  And quite coincidentally, that day at lunch I had lunch with Oswell Person, and he said to me, "Why don't you ask the librarian," who was William Cunningham, "about the opportunity to go to Africa.  The Black Caucus of the American Library Association is collaborating in this project."  And I said, "Oh, they would never send me because I'm the newest person."  And all of the other things that I offered.  And to have been called into the librarian's office, a couple of hours later, and he basically said, "I needed to talk to you today, because since you're going to Africa in two months, there's some things you need to do."  And I remember looking at him and then realizing that he wasn't joking.  And no one in my family believed me when I told them, "I just learned from my job today that at the--in September, I'm leaving to go to Africa.  I'll be gone for a year."  They all knew that in my heart of hearts, my dream was to, in some way have the opportunity to visit the motherland, and I think they just thought it was just some wishful, fanciful thinking.  But over the course of the next weeks they saw that I was indeed going through all of the processes that ultimately took me to Sierra Leone, where I worked with their national library, as well as, with a number of other institutions within the country.  Certainly many of them, academic institutions.
Story_ID: 569111
Speaker 1: What do you remember most about that experience?  Being in Sierra Leone?
Speaker 2: The first thing I remember about Sierra Leone, once I had literally arrived is taking the ferry from the airport, and when it landed at the dock in Freetown [Sierra Leone].  I remember getting off and kissing the ground.  I remember--I just felt full of spirit.  This was in the evening, but everything just seemed so alive and I just sort of just remember the smells.  I cannot remember anything negative about it.  It was, in a sense, a dream come true and just the--I mean, although I'd first touched ground at the airport, I didn't quite get down on my knees on the tarmac.  But in a sense, once I was, sort of, at Freetown, at Lumley, somehow, just that notion.  One other thing I should probably say is that there are these things that you read about Africa, and you come to have certain expectations, and among the things I had read was Star beer, was an African beer, an African brand.  You know, and I had just seen references to it in literature.  And I remember my host, as we had gotten on the ferry to cross over, had asked, "Can I get you something to drink?  Would you like something to drink?"  And I said--he said, "Would you like beer?"  I said, "Sure, that's fine."  And he said, "Would you like Heineken?"  And I said, "No, I want Star."  And I remember the look of surprise on his face that you know Star beer.  So I think it was also a very good start that my host realized that I did not come in total ignorance.  That I knew something about Africa, and I knew something about Sierra Leone, and I think that that was one of those things that, that put me off on good footing.  I should admit as well that my knowledge came not only through my readings, but I think I was smart enough that before I travelled, I actually, I wrote to the state department [U.S. Department of State], and asked them if there were any briefing materials that they could share with me, and I think what they shared was a kind of briefing package that is often given to members of a diplomatic corps that are travelling.  So I had the advantage of not simply learning about Sierra Leone from the traditional, historical materials in a collection like Moorland-Spingarn [Moorland-Spingarn Collection; Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.], but also having the advantage of some of the contemporary kinds of materials that the state department was using to help people to have an understanding.  And I would probably say they were similar to the materials that Peace Corps volunteers were using to have an understanding of the countries that they would be visiting.
Story_ID: 569112
Speaker 1: (LARRY CROWE):  What were--this is Larry Crowe now on the mic [microphone] here.  What were--what was the collection at the library like in Sierra Leone?  What was the name of the library?  What was the collection like, what was it--was it comparable to the collection here in Moorland-Spingarn [Moorland-Spingarn Collection; Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.] in terms of the age of the materials and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: The library collection that I was working with in West Africa, in Sierra Leone, was really just a basic public library collection.  The structure of it was that it was the Sierra Leone Library Board [Freetown, Sierra Leone].  And its responsibility was for the library that was there in Freetown [Sierra Leone], as well as, I think it was called the primary school service.  Which meant that there literally was a truck that went to different parts of the country at different times of the year, literally taking supplies of new books to be exchanged for old books that were in primary schools throughout the country.  Many of the books that we're talking about would have been donated by places such as the United States, Britain, the old Soviet Union, perhaps China.  Other countries that were simply making things available.  Often they had embassies that may have been there.  And the national library, I think its collections would pretty much be, at least from my perspective, what may have been a kind of standard library in a British colony.  With the understanding that Sierra Leone has a very long, relatively speaking, history of somewhat, of independence, obviously it's the colonial experience.  But it was one of the early places that developed higher education that had a very good reputation in the sense of Fourah Bay College [Freetown, Sierra Leone].  So there may have been already established some precedence for a greater library science in a place such as the nation of Sierra Leone than perhaps some of the other colonial places elsewhere on the continent.  So there were some colleges in various places, teachers colleges, or whatever, that also may have had a relationship with the national library in addition to those public school libraries (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 569113
Speaker 1: (LARRY CROWE): --I just thought that because it was like a place where slaves from the British in power repatriated, and even some from here, before Liberia was opened up that it might, that there might be some documents about that kind of activity.  I know that's where Sengbe Pieh [Joseph Cinque] was from of the Amistad [La Amistad], he was from Sierra Leone and went back to--
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, the--when I think back about that kind of a library, in a sense, it does not reflect what we might think of the library of an independent African country.  Where here, it's documenting its own history and the history of its own people.  I believe what we really see, as they say, colonial era library that has evolved in some kind of way.  So that I don't really recall anything there substantially related to black history and culture.  But a much more general and generic kind of a library.  I remember that it was very heavily used by the local population.  I was very struck by, what I saw as a deal of literacy among people who had such few opportunities to move ahead, and who were trying to take advantage of the library and its collections, to take the examinations that were part of the British educational system so they could begin that process of moving up.  Because I believe more of them were going to school in Britain and perhaps some other places of Europe, as opposed necessarily to coming to the United States.  So in terms of finding African history, in this library in Africa, that was not it.  At the same time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (LARRY CROWE): (Simultaneous) Did that trouble you any, though?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, because I'm gonna tell you what did trouble me, was my coming into contact with materials that had been made available for circulation and distribution among the population, that I found in my evaluation, to be absolutely outrageously racist.  Things that were talking about pickininnys that had the kinds of negative depictions that we see.  It came to give me a different understanding and perspective about some British writers whom I'd only seen or heard a name and knew that this was some significant person.  But now I'm seeing some of this work, and I'm seeing it certainly from the eyes of an African American in this time of the early 1970s, when we have all this black awareness going on, and I'm seeing what to me is very, very racist material.  The reason I share that is I refused to include that material among the materials I was circulating throughout the country [Sierra Leone] as a part of the primary library service.  As I was going through the materials, I intentionally dumped that stuff and would not take it.  Although it had been routinely circulated, and I actually brought back some copies, a few copies of this, so that I would have it as examples of how this was going on.
Story_ID: 569114
Speaker 1: Did you, before we leave Sierra Leone, did you make any significant contacts with African librarians or historians in Sierra Leone?
Speaker 2: There were a few.  I encountered some people at the university of--at Fourah Bay College [Freetown, Sierra Leone], the University of Sierra Leone [Freetown, Sierra Leone].  And the country was still then in the process of transition.  I certainly met the library staff there.  There was one individual, in a sense, that I had to meet later, because he had come to the United States to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] while I had gone to West Africa, and I did eventually meet him.  I met those individuals who were in positions at the various libraries.  One person would be Gloria Dillsworth, who was one of the senior black librarians at the national library.  And the interesting thing is she had been educated in the United States.  She had hosted me and we had maintained some contact in the years after I left Sierra Leone.  Another interesting aspect is that the--William Jones [ph.] who was the head of the Sierra Leone library system coincidentally had a son, or sons, who had attended Howard University.  So I was aware of one of his sons who had been on one of our championship soccer teams, so that gave another level of connection that I had not realized until I was there and I'm told that his son was here.  A third person would have been a British librarian, a woman from Britain who was married to a Sierra Leonean, and who was the number two person at the library.  And those were the people who were most involved in the process so, in a sense, you sort of see that evolution from the colonial experience and the great involvement of the British into seeing the greater involvement of black librarians.  There was a black librarian heading the college library at the University of Sierra Leone, whose husband was politically active.  So, interestingly enough, the opportunities I had to talk with her, were much more about the political climate, and things that were going on in Sierra Leone than actually about the library profession, because I went there during a period in which there had been some attempted coup d'etat, I believe, and during a period in which relationships with the United States were strained because of our supposed involvement in some of that activity.  But there was--I was certainly a guest, and I never experienced anything negative while I was there.  But I was aware that there were some issues involved when they looked at the role of the national, international powers and the kinds of things that they were involved in in places such as Sierra Leone.
Story_ID: 569115
Speaker 1: I want to go back and revisit the access.  You were discussing in the last roll, restricted access to the Moorland-Spingarn Collection [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.], and the privileged access, I guess, to, of people like August Meier, and Elliott Rudwick, and, you know, some of the white--a friend of mine used to call them the white godfathers of black history.  They had access all over the country to exclusive material.  And they'd show up there, everybody knew they were coming, they'd roll out the red carpet and give them a cup of tea and they'd go get what they want.  What--and, and I was surprised to find out this was actually happening at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  I guess it wasn't just for white scholars, but there were some black ones involved and who were part of the privileged access group.  How did you get privileged access?  I mean, how would one get that?  I mean, who gets it and who can't--couldn't get it at a certain point in time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It would be my view that any of the black historians of any note and consequence had access to the collections.  And I really can't fully explain or understand.  I don't recall that I had these kinds of conversations with Dorothy [Dorothy Porter Wesley] about--and part of it was because I actually worked with her for a relatively short time, because I did go off to Sierra Leone and she had retired when I returned.  But the, I think it was a more welcoming environment for white scholars coming to this black institution to use collections, than black scholars enjoyed in going to white institutions to use their collections.  And I think [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin has commented in his autobiographical statements about his experiences in going off to use collections when they discovered that this scholar is a black scholar who has all these credentials.  I think the problem rests more, in terms of access, with that newly emerging and emergent generation of black scholars.  Those who are a part of the baby boom generation, and perhaps its extension, as opposed to say Dr. Franklin's generation of scholars.  It would be that generation of scholars that's being trained by Dr. Franklin's generation, that senior generation of scholars.  I think it was a matter of their coming into this.  I think much of it may have been the collection's protectiveness of its resources, so that you had to have a seriousness of purpose.  I would--it might be a way of saying, "She wouldn't suffer fools."  If you weren't serious about this history, there's no reason to be in here.  This is not a place just to come for casual reading, like a reading room in a public library.  This was a place for scholarship and serious individuals.  And perhaps some of the limitation was more protective of the things.  And some of the privileged access would be these are individuals engaged in some serious research for publication.  They're going to be using materials in depth over a period of time.  So they may be here on a grant, this may be the work they're doing over the summer or the work that they're doing over, let's say, the Christmas holiday or something when there's a finite amount of time.  This individual has come from some other part of the country, so I think there are probably different factors for this, but I think it began to grate upon those who were increasingly demanding access to this collection who were being filtered through the de-access process.
Story_ID: 569116
Speaker 1: --Say, a brother that's in Drum and Spear Bookstore [Washington, D.C.], he reads a lot of books, he wants to come over here and do some research.  He may not really have research, formal research skills.  Is that the kind of person that would have a problem trying to get in there?
Speaker 2: To some extent, and I would also suggest that we don't like to talk about it, but libraries are victims of theft.  And as time evolved, there have been different kinds of security measures put into place.  But we would have been as subject to theft as anybody else, in terms of someone taking stuff and walking out of it, walking out with it.  I hate to use it as an example, but we know it's true.  We've gone back through materials to discover that someone has come in and ripped pages out, has torn illustrations out.  And we might not like to think about it, but students often avail themselves of materials that they have no right, simply for their own need and satisfaction.  So we'd have students who would take materials, and we know they took it because sometimes it was returned.  And this is a non-circulating reference collection, so nothing circulates away from the center, so that it is always here for those scholars.  So in the sense of not having a police state, a police environment in which we have the kind of armed guards and security that you literally found at the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.], during its time, they'd make certain you took nothing in, you brought nothing out.  Those kinds of things that we have a somewhat more fluid situation being part of a library system.  And while we were maintained, historically been maintained separately, in terms of the facility and all, and the provisions for use, I think a lot of these factors come into play in terms of the real access.  You're not expecting senior scholars to be ripping pages out and stealing material.  We do know that this has occurred (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I remember--
Speaker 2: You don't expect them to do it, but we know it has occurred, but perhaps the feeling was students were more likely to do it as a matter of convenience, because they didn't really fully appreciate what they were handling.  So there are probably a variety of factors.
Speaker 1: People in the community used to euphemistically refer to doing this as liberating books and liberating materials.
Speaker 2: For sure.  And it's, like, from whom are you liberating it?  You don't liberate it from your own people, and because, in a sense, it's already liberated.  It's already within the family, and I'm familiar with that euphemism, because often it was a euphemism for theft.  You weren't, we weren't liberating certain kinds of things from the grocery store.  I could deal with that in some other instances, but you're quite right.  That liberation, that form of liberation.
Speaker 1: So then being a part of a collection like this, I mean, there are security issues that are raised, so when you talk about increasing access you really have to have some systems in place to really make sure the material is safe too.  Because if you love this kind of material, and this kind of institution, I mean this is more than a notion to open up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's true, and I mentioned that materials don't circulate.  They're not loaned out.  The reality is that sometimes they were or they were taken.  And I simply say that because over the years of my experience, I've encountered some of our material in library collections that we've acquired.  Or we've acquired some other materials and in looking through them, I've seen a book.  And it's, like, this belongs to Moorland-Spingarn [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.].  How the person came to have it, it could have been loaned.  Dorothy [Dorothy Porter Wesley] may have extended some special courtesy to a particular scholar, but what it pointed out was the issues involved when things go out.  They may not always come back in.  And that certainly could have been a problem.
Story_ID: 569117
Speaker 1: So, Dorothy Porter Wesley, she basically was a part of, I guess, a group of people who convinced Howard University [Washington, D.C.] that it was worth spending money and time to keep this material protected.  Because I know at some institutions; Tuskegee [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], ten years ago for instance, was a tarp the library's leaking in the special collections room right over the works of Monroe Work, you know, his encyclopedic study of 'Negro Year Book' ['Negro Year Book: An Annual Encyclopedia of the Negro,' ed. Monroe N. Work]
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And there were only two copies left of it and, you know, and there was no--I was in there with some other scholars, some of whom work in this building.  And we could not believe that it was nobody in there to monitor what we were doing or what was going on in there.
Speaker 2: One of the things that I should say about Moorland-Spingarn [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.], in relationship to other historically black colleges and universities [HBCUs], is that we have been fortunate that the university made a commitment, historical commitment to the existence of Moorland-Spingarn.  When we were founded in 1914, it was to--so that this, this collection, these materials were to be the foundation for the study of black life in the world.  And it was initially known as the Moorland Foundation, A Library of Negro Life.  And many people thought it was a philanthropic foundation, and were writing for funding.  And we had to explain to them, no, It was the foundation for the study of history and our culture.  So I think in understanding, that this was a very specific effort initiated in this institution, at a time when other institutions, certainly were not focusing on black history, certain majority institutions.  But if you look at other special collections, regardless of the subject matter, in any given institution what Howard University did was to make it's commitment to black history and culture, and it did so in 1914.  Dorothy was a graduate of the university, and she became the librarian here after graduating from Columbia University [New York, New York] in 1930.  And the university made this a research library in 1933.  With that understanding, she was here until 1973.  So she presided over all of this development, certainly had the support of the university's faculty, had the support of the university's president, Mordecai Wyatt Johnson [Mordecai Johnson], who was president, she was librarian here throughout his entire tenure as president.  And he and the scholars here were supportive of her efforts in building Moorland-Spingarn Research Center.  Dr. Moorland [Jesse Moorland] lived on for a number of years after donating his collection, as an example.  Arthur Spingarn whose collection was purchased in 1946, continued to donate materials until he died some fifteen years later.  Or twenty-five years later, actually, and actually returned the purchase price to the university in his will.  So it was an institutional commitment, I think, that sets us apart from other historically black colleges.  And then in 1973, the university made this a separate independent research center within the university.  And I think therefore we occupy a somewhat different status than the special collections in the historically black college and university libraries in other institutions.  Those are probably, as we had once been, a special collection within the university library system.  So some of it has to do with scale, some of it has to do with the nature of Howard University.  As this, Howard has always been viewed at the top level of historically black colleges, and it is the one historically black college that occupies the upper rung among America's majority universities.  And the upper rung of those research oriented universities.  So in that sense, much of it has to do with this is Howard University, a graduate level Ph.D. granting institution, that has developed collections that are appropriate for that, and our concentration as an historically black college is in the history and culture of our people.  So I think that's the context in which Moorland-Spingarn's development has come.  Not because our other institutions aren't willing and interested, but perhaps because we were able to devote greater resources.  Another thing that I should also mention is our location in Washington, D.C. I think is also important.  This is the site of the national library [Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.], the national museum, the National Archives [National Archives and Records Administration].  In the sense, that Moorland-Spingarn has library, museum, and archival programs.  We then are the national facility in this context of black history and culture.  So we have a relationship, in a sense, to those other national institutions, so it is appropriate that such a nationally important and nationally based collection be developed here in the nation's capital.  And what better place than America's premier institution of higher learning, designed primarily for the education of people of African descent?
Story_ID: 569118
Speaker 1: Let's pick up your activities after you returned from Sierra Leone.  Now, you came back and picked up here?
Speaker 2: When I returned from Sierra Leone in 1973, one of the single developments that had occurred was the retirement of Dorothy Porter [Dorothy Porter Wesley].  She became Wesley later, upon her second marriage [to Charles H. Wesley].  The university [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] took the opportunity of her retirement, to evaluate the Moorland-Spingarn [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.] and where and what it should be in the future.  It was that evaluation that resulted in it's creation as an independent research center, and also the notion that such a center did not necessarily have to be headed by a librarian, but that an historian could be considered.  Upon my return, in the late summer of 1973 Dorothy had retired, a new director had been selected, and coincidentally, my return to the job coincided, my official return, coincided with his first day on the job.  So in 1973, I began the next phase of my career when Michael Winston [Michael R. Winston] had become the founding director of the newly structured Moorland-Spingarn Research Center.
Story_ID: 569119
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, Michael Winston [Michael R. Winston].  Now, he has a--he's also a Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] alumnus too, right?
Speaker 2: Michael Winston is a Howard University alumnus--
Speaker 1: There's a picture right over here with him and Malcolm X and--
Speaker 2: He was very much involved in student activities.  One project that he was involved in brought Malcolm X to the university campus early in the 1960s.  One thing about Howard is that it traditionally brought in all of these voices to be heard.  Many people think that our institutions are fairly conservative and we would not provide that kind of platform.  In my experience, that's not the case.  We have been afforded the opportunity to have a broad range of such individuals come and interact with us.  Michael Winston, also as a student, worked in Moorland-Spingarn Research Center [Washington, D.C.] or in the old Moorland-Spingarn Collection.  So he had some awareness of the collection as a student of history.  And as he moved into the professional development as a historian, and his association with the university at that time, in many ways placed him in an ideal position to become that founding director.  And under him, we developed the basic structure that we find in Moorland-Spingarn today.  Previous, previously, we were essentially a library that had some other library related activities as a part of it.  Under Winston's leadership, the center developed various research divisions.  In addition to the traditional library, we brought together all of the primary resource materials into a newly formed manuscript division, which also included our music, oral history, and graphic materials.  We also, as a part of the restructuring, developed the Howard University Archives [Washington, D.C.] as an institutional repository, and the Howard University Museum [Washington, D.C.], as an exhibit and interpretive space.  And in all of these areas, we began to develop the kinds of professional staff that were appropriate to those professional disciplines, so that our staff grew beyond the traditional librarian to be able to encompass a broader range of activities.  And, coincidentally, I found myself the one person who has worked in all of these areas.
Story_ID: 569120
Speaker 1: I came initially in the library, under Winston [Michael R. Winston] I was asked to become the founding curator of the manuscript division.  And my career then took on a different tact beginning in 1974.  I was also asked to become involved as curating the museum's collections.  And in the absence of anyone else, I was also functioning as the initial university archivist, and was involved in the development of the charter for the Howard University Archives [Washington, D.C.].  So in many ways, I've had the broadest experiences of any other staff, certainly in the newly structured Moorland-Spingarn Center [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.], and eventually becoming director.  I think my experiences in all of the units have been a benefit because I bring insight from a variety of areas, professional development, because I also had to go out and gain training and experience in addition to already having a library degree and already working towards the Ph.D., to also become knowledgeable in areas of museology as well as in archives.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, you were the founding curator of the manuscript collection in '75 [1975], did you say?
Speaker 1: In 1974.
Speaker 2: Seventy-four [1974], okay.  And you became the university archivist when?
Speaker 1: I functioned in the absence of there being an archivist.  What I did was develop the foundation for the university archives, and once we had a charter for the archives, we then moved forward to the, the formal hiring of a university archivist.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you set the stage for them.  Okay.  All right.  And you became director?
Speaker 1: I became director of Moorland-Spingarn in 1986.  July of 1986.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So the staff had to expand here to some technical, I guess, and add some, for instance, I guess, some way to play recordings and to process photographs (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The staff did expand.  When Moorland-Spingarn was expanded under Winston, the initial staff was, all of the existing staff, became the foundation staff of the new research center.  But as you can imagine, that staff was essentially a library-based staff.  As the other units were being developed, they would begin to seek out staff who had the expertise in those very varied and specific areas.  We also were engaged in our own professional development and training of staff in these various areas.  So we had to develop the appropriate expertise in whatever the area that we were developing, and that was an essential part of the university's focus for us.  So in addition to whatever had been the preexisting staff, Winston also laid out in that early stage, the projections for a larger staff that will begin to flesh out the new structure that had been developed for Moorland-Spingarn as I assumed a position of responsibility within the manuscript division, as well as the museum.  Then I worked closely with the director for developing the kinds of staffing patterns that would ultimately prevail in those parts of the center.  And again, I largely developed with some outside assistance, outside consultants, actually Dr. Harold Pinkett [Harold T. Pinkett], one of the premier and pioneering black archivists in the United States, who was also teaching on the faculty of Howard University [Washington, D.C.] served as a consultant to assist us in developing all of the appropriate elements of the university archives, and that was during a period in which I served as acting director of the research center, which was 1979, 1980.

Speaker 1: I don't want to move too fast, but in terms of Ph.D., now where did you go to earn your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: One of the interesting things about pursuing a Ph.D. as I did, I keep referring back to Oswell Person.  He had actually made me aware of a program, interdisciplinary program called American studies, at the George Washington University in Washington, D.C.  He initially was going to enter that program, but ultimately went off to pursue a doctorate in education at another institution.  But I remembered the diverse nature of that program, actually while I was abroad in Sierra Leone, and applied to that graduate program while I was in West Africa and gained admission so that when I returned to the university [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] in 1973, I not only returned to this newly reorganized Moorland-Spingarn [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.], but I also returned as a beginning student in a Ph.D. program at George Washington University.  I was very much supported in that academic effort by Michael Winston [Michael R. Winston] as director, as well as by the president of the university, and the vice president of the university who, who were every supportive of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the president then was [HistoryMaker] James Cheek?
Speaker 2: At the time, the president was James Cheek, who had come in 1969.  Andrew Billingsley, initially, was vice president of academic affairs, serving under Dr. Cheek.  He was succeeded by Dr. Lorraine Williams [Lorraine A. Williams], who had been a faculty member in the department of history with whom I had been aware, whose class I had sat in on as a young undergraduate student, who also had been a mentor of Michael Winston who graduated from the history department and whom he succeeded.  Winston, that is, succeeded Dr. Williams as vice president of academic affairs.  So there was a continuation of a certain association that benefited Moorland-Spingarn, and the appreciation with which it was held within the institution.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think Janet [HistoryMaker Janet L. Sims-Woods] asked earlier about Chancellor Williams in the early '70s [1970s], and I forgot to ask about him, because he became such a popular cultural figure in the black community.  His book outselling all other books published by Third World Press [Chicago, Illinois] way back when; 'Destruction of Black Civilization' ['The Destruction of Black Civilization,' Chancellor Williams], Tony Brown featured him on his show ['Tony Brown's Journal'] quite a bit.  What was the--do you remember Dr. Chancellor Williams?  Do you have any thoughts on this?
Speaker 2: I don't remember Dr. Chancellor Williams directly.  I remember him more indirectly, and much of that has to do--most people assume I majored in history at the university, and then I actually didn't.  So that my experiences with the history department was more on a--by chance basis, that I would have had the opportunity to go to this lecture or to sit in on this class.  But, I, as not being a history student, I didn't have that same kind of relationship.  For me, he was much more of an icon.  One of those figures that you've heard about and read about, and then realized that you were walking the same grounds that this person had passed.  I became aware of Dr. Williams, after his tenure here and many other ways, and certainly was--would be influenced by his, just the dynamism of his work.  And as in the ways in which he would have influenced a number of young students at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your primary influence then was Dr. Lorraine Williams of the history department?
Speaker 2: Dr. Lorraine Williams more so certainly in the--during the period in which I came back to Howard to work.  And that's because, and certainly through the extension of Dr. Williams--Dr. Winston rather, I would have had that contact.  I also had contact with Dr. Rayford Logan.  Dr. Winston had worked as a principle researcher for Dr. Logan while Dr. Logan completed the centennial history of the university.  Dr. Logan would have been a frequent user of the collection and in subsequent works that he pursued.  We would have been providing some sort of research assistance.  So there are some individuals that I didn't have experiences of direct contact with them as a student.  But I came to have a variety of contact as I used the collection or as I had, professional contact with them as a result of my responsibilities at the research center.
Story_ID: 569122
Speaker 1: We were talking about Ph.D.--the pursuit of the Ph.D., and then we asked some questions about acquisitions and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: One of the things I'll say about pursuing the Ph.D., some might ask, "Well, given the kind of faculty you had at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], given the, the, the black history focus that might have been there, why would you have gone to George Washington University [Washington, D.C.]?"  And I would say there were two reasons: one, given my position at Moorland-Spingarn [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.] and controlling access to the research collections and all of this, I certainly wanted to avoid any conflict of interest.  Not that any pressure was placed on me in any way, but I knew I could certainly avoid it by not being in that kind of a--an environment.  But perhaps the most telling reason was that it was a multidisciplinary approach, it wasn't just history.  And I was interested in looking at the broad aspects of the black experience from whatever vantage point was appropriate.  So we--you, you were dealing with economics and history and a whole--the, the sociology, a whole interdisciplinary range.  Although, its primary focus was history-based, I appreciated the, the more diverse nature in which that was treated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your Ph.D. was in American studies?
Speaker 2: In American studies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or American civilization, as some might call it.  And the way in which the program was structured was that it required a foreign field of study and for me that foreign field of study was Africa.  My concentration within the American context was the African American experience, so I was able to combine all of these elements.  And then the important--another important aspect is the various colleges and universities here in Washington [D.C.] are allied in a consortium, and you are able to take courses that are not available in one institution at another institution.  So while I did my graduate work at George Washington University, and that's the degree granting institution, all of the African studies-based work that I pursued was actually done at Howard University and by the faculty of Howard University.  So that was another reason I was able to make that judgment, I knew while attending George Washington, I still had the benefit of the education that I could get from Howard University; in a sense, it was somewhat, you might see, the best of two worlds.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That sounds good. Now, what did you do your dissertation on? What was your dissertation?
Speaker 2: What did I do my dissertation on?  Ah, that's a good one.  The expressions of George Washington were interesting.  One of the things that benefitted my experience there was the historian, Letitia Brown [Letitia W. Brown], who had initially been at Howard University and was then at George Washington.  So when I went to George Washington, my initial interviews once I was in the program asking me what I was going to pursue, and I said Africa.  And when--what foreign language did I have experiences with, and I said German and that's because German had the shortest line in--for registration at Howard.  The, the question came to me, "Well, what use would the--would German be for studying Africa?"  And I must admit that I was shocked to have had such a question asked of me 'cause I would've assumed people understood the German presence in Africa.  That, while my mouth was open, Letitia Brown went on to make some comments about the, the German experience and, and what we now know as Namibia what had been known as southwest African and some other things and then I picked up on it.  After the class she said to me, "I realize your problem was that you could not believe they didn't know Germans had been in Africa."  But that was just another important element of that, was the fact that there was black faculty at George Washington which would've benefitted the broader understanding, and it wasn't ju- and in--within that department, so that was also a factor in why that experience would've been beneficial.
Story_ID: 569123
Speaker 1: So what was your dissertation (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The dissertation, back to that.  One of the--in the process of doing certain things there, I proposed different fields that were not especially welcome.  They didn't see and have the same perspectives that I did about pursuing certain kinds of things.  Without getting off into some of the other projects that had been proposed and we debated back and forth, I ultimately--actually, I was asked why I did not use my background in black history, as well as in librarianship and to do a bibliographic kind of a project, which I did not realize was, was appropriate within a dissertation context.  I was planning on doing actually, a dissertation on the political philosophy of Benjamin Mays, as expressed in his columns in the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier].  And Dr. Mays and I had already talked and discussed that.  When the university [George Washington University, Washington, D.C.] asked me about doing such a project, I proposed doing a project based upon an earlier project I had completed for at--while I was in the program for Letitia Brown [Letitia W. Brown], which was on slavery in the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.].  And what I proposed was to do a research guide on black history in the District of Columbia, specifically because most of these histories had absolutely nothing about Washington's black population in it or did so in relative passing.  And, of course, I was told there is not enough information to comprise such a dissertation, but what they didn't know was that we had already been working on a project that we had planned to do with the D.C. Public Schools [District of Columbia Public Schools] in developing a black history curriculum, and I was already compiling materials on blacks in the District of Columbia.  So I, I knew it could be done and I went forward and presented it to them and that's ultimately, what the dissertation's on.  It's a research guide to blacks in the District of Columbia.  And in addition to an annotated bibliography of all those materials that I could identify at that time, books, journals, newspapers and, and research collections, those were the, the important elements of it, but I also looked into any other things that would've been appropriate to trying to define this black history in the nation's capital, the, the whole experience of black history in the nation's capital.  Many didn't feel it could be done, but once I think having identified the materials, it provides the basis of many other people to go forward.  And I think the collections of Howard University [Washington, D.C.] were also critical to that because we had collected a lot of material related to our local community.  And, and while other scholars may not have been aware of it, I had become aware that because we're left out of the history doesn't mean we don't have the history and doesn't mean we don't have the documentation of that history.  So that's where I focused my dissertation, and it also included a historical piece so that it would provide some context for the bibliographic materials.  So that historic piece is a sort of a brief history of blacks in the nation's capital.
Story_ID: 569124
Speaker 1: What are some, in your opinion, what are some of the features of black history in the nation's capital that make it unique?
Speaker 2: I think one of the things about Washington [D.C.] is as the nation's capital, all local history has largely been ignored so that the white community has also been pursuing its efforts to have the, the community, the non-federal, the non-monumental aspect of Washington better preserved and better acknowledged.  There have been black people on what is now the site of the nation's capital since before the nation's capital was built.  There's always been a strong free black presence.  The, the way slavery played itself out in Washington and its surrounding environments might be somewhat different than in other parts of the slave South.  So that Washington, D.C., as a community, just simply offered some different kinds of ways to look at our history and, certainly, this juxtaposition of what we see at the national level and what is going on here at the local level.  So part of it was to make visible this invisible community.  An earlier history of--is looking at the secret city like Washington's--like all of these other things that are not the federal aspect of Washington, it's like unknown to people, so unearthing this was important.  I was not the first person to, to write about this history and, and certainly there were some other efforts.  Constance Green [Constance McLaughlin Green] had, had done work on the black community; Rayford Logan had been one of her consultants.  She had done prizewinning work on Washington, D.C.'s history generally, and then went forward to do a work on the black community.  So that was a somewhat pioneering work, but my effort was to demonstrate that the broader manner in which all of our experiences in Washington could be included.  Because I think the black population in Washington is a dynamic part of what we need to understand about the experiences of black people in the Americas and, and how the land of the free and the home of the brave is played out within a slave society in which there is slavery existing right here in the nation's capital while we're propounding all of these things about our ideals of freedom and democracy, which is very well noted by foreign travelers in the United States whose experiences were often right here in Washington.  So I think it's important (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They would write about that in contrast, yeah.  Well, go on.
Speaker 2: --for people to see the, the city in its fullness, not just simply monumental Washington and that's one of the reasons that I thought exploring this black community which developed and evolved a little differently than black communities in the other parts of the slave South could be quite an important matter of understanding and obviously, again, because of Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and its influence of how the community here had developed.
Speaker 1: Right.  As you said, foreign travelers in the 19th century--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --would often comment on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen century, 18th century.
Speaker 1: --the--yeah, the White House [Washington, D.C.] and their environs and then just around the corner is a tenement of black people, you know.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: It's been like--I mean, it's pretty much until the recent years of development (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, things that people--the, the issues that played out in Washington because it was Washington, the whole effort to abolish slavery begins in Washington, D.C. to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia in the 1830s.  Now, ultimately, it's thirty years later when we get the Thirteenth Amendment which abolishes slavery as the Emancipation Proclamation had its own--the input into this process.  But if we look at the central role that Washington has played because all of these national issues are played out in Washington, D.C. within this black community that is right here, constantly observant of all this going on and some ways, able to put to the lie many of these things that are being said about black people.  You can say these things about black people, look at this free black community right here in Washington.  You talk about education, the first school for black people was established in Washington in, I believe, 1807 by those who had been formerly enslaved.  So if we look back at the progress of this African community in the nation's capital, I, I think that we can better understand America by looking at Washington, D.C. and its black community.

Speaker 1: You earned your Ph.D. in--when was it, what was the last--?
Speaker 2: My Ph.D. officially is 1983.
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-three [1983].  Okay.  All right.  And did you publish your dissertation?
Speaker 2: Actually, there was not a great deal of interest in the publication of the dissertation at the time; I, I can't say why.  I, I--there had been an earlier piece that had been published locally by the historical society, the Columbia, what was in the Columbia now, The Historical Society of Washington [Columbia Historical Society; The Historical Society of Washington, D.C., Washington, D.C.] that focused on, on some of these black resources.  Perhaps some of what I was doing, they may have seen as redundant.  But what I did do was to make--I, I made copies--I, I purchased and made copies of my book available for the D.C. Public Library [District of Columbia Public Library, Washington, D.C.] for the collection here at Washington, D.C.  There was a period in which there was a, a textbook being developed to study Washington [D.C.], the 'City of Magnificent Intentions' ['City of Magnificent Intentions: A History of Washington, District of Columbia,' Keith E. Melder and Melinda Young Stuart], while the scholars were working on that book, I made all of my unpublished research available to them.  So, to the extent that it has any benefit, it has been used in the library collections, but publishers at the time weren't interested in the--in, in that kind of a research guide.
Story_ID: 569126
Speaker 1: I want to go into the acquisition of materials.  We were sort of talking about that off camera and just mentioned the kinds of materials that become available, you know, the collections of the famous and the not so famous; what are some of the stories?  I know we mentioned off camera a huge collection that [HistoryMaker] Mayme Clayton has on California and you had some opinions about that, but I know there are lots of--I'm talking about Charles Young's materials and you mentioned--whose materials was it you mentioned before?
Speaker 2: Well, we talked about just a variety of people (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: We, we can come back to Mayme Clayton--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --maybe the second--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --part of this.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And I'll--I'd like to say something generally about that collecting and then maybe use her--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as an exemplar in a different way.  One of the things that we did under Winston [Michael R. Winston] was very specifically set up a program that we were going to pursue, collections of personal papers and organizational records and that we were going to solicit as broadly as possible.  And to the extent that we were successful, we sent letters of solicitation to an extremely wide range of black organizations of all kinds, of black individuals who were well known.  We responded to those who brought to our attention collections that they thought would be important.  We developed a collecting strategy in which we were not simply interested in collecting the papers of, of the, of the elite.  We took the approach that history has always often been approached from the perspective of the elites, from the top down, from the highest achievers.  And we wanted to take what had been more associated with the sociological approach, looking at the average man, looking at the everyday citizen, in a sense, looking at it from the bottom up.  So while we would have materials that reflected certainly the, the efforts of the elites, the great achievers, we intentionally began to seek out materials that would document every aspect of the black experience so that we not only went after the well-known, we went after the unknown.  We took the position and we continued to take the position that in order to explore fully the black experience, we have to collect things that reflect all aspects of it.  We cannot do it all alone and we encourage people not simply to deposit here, but to deposit in other institutions, especially when it is a material of a more local focus than a national focus.  So for us, our collection [at the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.] is a nationally focused collection for things that affect us in a much broader sense and we collect what is local history within the context of Washington, D.C. and its broader environment.  So that we would not expect to see things that are of a specifically local nature to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in Washington, D.C. because Washington--people studying Philadelphia have to come to Washington, D.C.  The exception would be if there's no repository there that's willing to take material that we know is historically valuable or is unable to do so, even if it wanted to do so, we would want to see that preserved.  And we would make the evaluation it's important to understanding our history and we would prefer for it to be preserved here in Washington, to be lost in some other community where there was not an appropriate facility.
Story_ID: 569127
Speaker 1: You asked me about [HistoryMaker] Mayme Clayton and that allows me to comment about the role that private collectors play as opposed to what I consider public and institutional collectors.  Many people don't think of me as a collector, but I'm a collector.  I'm an institutional collector.  All of the collecting that I do is not to benefit me, personally, and any library mat- of materials that I have at home, I do it for, if you will, the race, for the people at large, for the nation, for the university.  So that if I see something, I am trying to acquire it to be a part of the collection at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], as a part--as opposed to being a part of my own collection.  And I think there should be a broader understanding of what institutional collecting is all about and it is to serve a collective and larger purpose.  We have benefitted from the individual collecting activities.  I mentioned the Tappan Collection from 1870 [Lewis Tappan Collection, 1847-1860], that's an individual that brought those materials together.  Jesse Moorland, his collection, his personal collection of artifacts and materials is a foundation for, for our collections here.  He was a private collector who donated his private collection.  Arthur Spingarn sold his collection initially, continued to donate materials and then gave us the money back, but he was a private collector who put it within an institution.  An individual like Mayme Clayton is representative of these private collectors.  [HistoryMaker] Charles Blockson, as a private collector, has his collection [Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection] in Temple University in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And there's some others.  The Schomburg collection [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture] resulted from the personal collection of Arthur Schomburg [Arturo Alfonso Schomburg] that's at the, in the New York Public Library [New York, New York].  Schomburg, as an individual, helped to develop the collection at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee], but his own private collection becomes a part of the New York Public Library.  So the role of private collectors can be extraordinarily important to what it is that institutional collectors do and we should always keep that in mind.  One of the things about a collection that, that interested me in the reportage of the collection of Mayme Clayton, I had been aware of Mayme Clayton because of as a black librarian and her being in the, in the field of library science, not being as wi- fully aware of all that she had collected as we discovered at the time of her death.  My disappointment would be that private collectors sometimes don't realize that their collections might be better served in public institutions.  That is specifically why Mr., Mr. Spingarn's collection came to Howard, he could not accommodate the researchers and scholars who wanted to use it in his apartment and felt that the best way to do this was in a larger institution.  I think Mayme may have attempted to do this at her home, to some extent, but now upon her death, it's--what happens to it?  Are you going to attempt to build a new institution around a singular collection that has as its limitations whatever its collecting is or let it become a part of a larger collection where it allows us to expand and, and, and broaden all of that kind of a documentation?  That's--those are individual decisions that any potential donor would have to make or anyone who's selling a collection would have to make.
Story_ID: 569128
Speaker 1: But what strikes me more so about the media coverage of the [HistoryMaker] Mayme Clayton collection has been that in virtually no instance did I see any mention--I, I saw no mention of the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and only one instance did I see any mention of Howard University as a re- as a place where one might find some black historical materials.  And there would've been some other majority institutions and some other public library-based institutions like the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York].  I find this extraordinary, given the fact that virtually all HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] have been collecting material documenting the black experience since their creation, inception as institutions.  With all of the scholars and scholarship that has flowed through Howard University since 1867, and certainly scholars know this, so obviously this is a weakness in the media, that you would not even imagine that a black university, America's premier black university, might have materials documenting the black experience that you should acknowledge.  It's absolutely amazing to me that for the most part the media has totally overlooked the collecting that is ongoing within black institutions and has, for the most part, highlighted the collecting that has occurred within majority institutions as universities and as, as institutions like the New York Public Library [New York, New York] or the Chicago Public Library [Chicago, Illinois] or the Detroit Public Library [Detroit, Michigan].  Now, while these may be important collections documenting our history and culture, they are still within the context of majority institutional collecting and it was not their priority if you look at the whole progress of this collecting.  And the, the consistent overlooking of historically black institutions is just astounding to me and, and I think that is something that, that we need to try to have a better understanding about.  How is it that we would ignore black institutions?  Can we ignore them if we talk about education in the United States?  If no ins- black institutions are not mentioned and we talk about education, we would think something is strange since they carried the burden of that education for generations but yet, we don't think that they've also been involved in documenting and, and promoting our own history and culture.  I think this is something that we need to be very, very mindful of as to why is it that some of our major institutions are left out of this discourse, but majority institutions are highlighted that we know had no real commitment to collecting and documenting our history and often have only done so because they've been forced to do so or in order to respond to what their changing demographics have been either in the late 20th century or the early 21st century.
Story_ID: 569129
Speaker 1: What did happen to Ms. Clayton's [HistoryMaker Mayme Clayton] collection (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As I understand it now, one of her children, her son, I believe, has become interested in the materials.  I don't know of what interest he may have had while she was living and what efforts he may have had to assist in doing anything.  But now that the collection and its--the fact that it has individual volumes of, of some monetary value and, and obviously many of these things have been republished or reprinted or available in other collections, but she certainly has a, a fine collection of an individual collector.  And I understand that her son and, again, this is from the media, is attempting to identify the resources to try to create some newly established and independent center that will be built around her collection.  I wouldn't--I, I think that this is an issue for her heirs to determine what's going to occur, but I would encourage them to look at the experiences over time that our institutions have had.  And, and perhaps they would like to reconsider trying to create another new and independent initiative when we are struggling to try to bring to life many previously proposed efforts to achieve the kind of documentation and preservation of our history and culture and perhaps there is some existing institution that can form a partnership or a relationship that would help to maximize the value of, of Mrs. Clayton's collection.  I am somewhat surprised that she may not have sorted this out while she was alive, given her professional background, but certainly, I think the family should look at the, the difficulties and the great expense in trying to create and maintain the kinds of institutions that have the responsibilities that we have.  Because our responsibility is to be open to the public and to be able to make these things available to the research community on a continuing basis and, and as part of a, a commitment that we have and it is a part of a major investment that Howard University [Washington, D.C.] makes and any other institution makes in order to do the kind of work that, that has gone on in these kinds of research facilities.
Story_ID: 569130
Speaker 1: You started teaching also in the '80s [1980s] right?  In institutions (unclear) and at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) One, one of the things I'm sometimes asked about whether I'm on the faculty at Howard University; I'm not formally on the faculty of Howard University, but I--you might say I'm a faculty resource.  I do lecture for anyone, both on the campus and, and away from the campus.  I, I lecture in the university's leadership academy which is a staff development entity that has a range of course offerings.  I think the one on the history of Howard that I teach is one of the few that has a, a, a subject orientation such as that, but it is one in which we have the opportunity to talk about the role of Howard University in--and its larger role in the nation and within the black community and Howard relates to all of that, not simply as an exercise to, to promote ourselves.  But I've also had the opportunity to, to lecture at other institutions.  I've taught as an adjunct on the faculties of the University of Maryland at College Park [Maryland] and American University [Washington, D.C.] both briefly and I've lectured abroad as a result of various travels and I speak whenever I'm asked, whether it is at institutions within the local community or elsewhere around the country.  I've done speaking, for example, as part of state department [U.S. Department of State] lecture series during Black History Month in Africa, so that's also afforded an opportunity to be able to share these, these experiences that, that we've had and to have a greater awareness and understanding within Africa about America's development of its own black community.
Story_ID: 569131
Speaker 1: I guess, in the late '80s [1980s] or early '90s [1990s], you published 'Black Bibliophiles and Collectors' ['Black Bibliophiles and Collectors: Preservers of Black History'] with some other members of the Moorland-Spingarn [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.] staff?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Black Bibliophiles and Collectors' was a project initially proposed by Dr. Elinor Sinnette [Elinor Des Verney Sinnette] and Paul Coates [W. Paul Coates], who were colleagues of mine on the staff.  And they presented the, the notion about such a project and, and we thought it would be a wonderful thing to do to point out the road that black collectors had played at the development of these various research collections.  It was a nationally funded project that afforded us the opportunity to bring scholars here to discuss the whole realm and range of, of black publishing as it related to the research of black materials and those who had been collecting all of these materials over time.  So a number of people whose collections have wound up in various other institutions, whether it's [HistoryMaker] Charles Blockson, the collections that have gone to Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], other black collections, it was an opportunity for us to explore the role that black collectors have historically played, whether as individuals or as institutions in documenting this history.  It was always expected that we would collect some, if not all of the presentations in some form to offer a, a, a wider understanding of that role.  'Black Bibliophiles and Collectors' was our initial publication with the Howard University Press [Washington, D.C.] and it was, to some extent, not exactly proceedings of that conference, but they were the significant papers out of that conference.  They were not simply papers related to the, the substance of various subjects in black history, but we also included some practical elements in there for those individuals who might have an interest in trying to determine what they should do with the materials they may have been collecting, even within their own families.  And we did that because we also go out and, and lecture about collection and, and preservation of materials, even when those things have not intended to come to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  Our intention is to make people as aware of the importance of doing this and to give them whatever skills we can to do this on their own.

Speaker 1: We were talking about 'Black Bibliophiles and Collectors' ['Black Bibliophiles and Collectors: Preservers of Black History'], a historic book and the book ['Arthur Alfonso Schomburg: Black Bibliophile and Collector'] that Elinor Des Verney Sinnette wrote on Arthur Schomburg [Arturo Alfonso Schomburg] too was another profile of black book collector.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And the importance of that, you know.  So I think that we have to say that you and the staff here [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.] have sort of institutionalized, I guess on some level, the importance of collecting in the black community.  I mean, it's been--I mean, people now know about historical people who collected and, you know, it gives, I think, maybe a different perspective on what our thoughts are about the black community of yesterday, what were people doing.
Speaker 2: We have, and one of the interesting things I think is there's been a lot of collecting going on within black communities, among black people, by black people for quite a long time.  But there's a point in the late 1960s, early 1970s, for me, in which there's greater attention from whites and from majority institutions to collect this material 'cause they don't have any of it, sometimes to help support some of their academic programs.  So we get this wave of reprinting materials that have been in black college libraries and which have been out of print and which black people themselves have been using, but many others hadn't, so there became a market for that kind of black material.  Then, as there's a greater interest in this, you have people starting to look at this as memorabilia in which they can invest and it will increase, and then they can--so they are investing for whatever monetary values that it may have.  There are those who are doing it simply because of the love of the history or whatever these other factors may be.  And as an institution, we come into contact with a whole range of these kinds of individuals often and simply because sometimes, they're trying to see how much they can sell something to us.  But the reality is that most of our collecting of non-book materials and non-serial newspaper kinds of publications have come as a result of gift.  There are specific items that we've had to purchase because that's--they were only available that way, and it may have been through some deal or through some other kind of, of a source, but most private--most private collectors, individual collectors, with whom we've come in contact have, have been donors of ours.  They have felt that we, as an institution, might be the best place to, to house and make these things available. But there continues to be a whole separate group of individuals who are collectors and who do so for a variety of reasons.  Again, sometimes for their own personal satisfaction, they may be collecting family history, but many are, are collecting things with the intention of, of buying and selling, as the expectation that our history will become more, more valuable as more people are interested in it.  One kind of example would be Alex Haley and, and his death and the unfortunate circumstances of his collection being broken up and essentially sold off piecemeal.  There were those who went in as quickly as possible to buy up various pieces of this, only to turn around later and to try to profit and profiteer by selling it back--or selling it to some black institution that they think would, would be so overwhelmed by it--
Story_ID: 569133
Speaker 1: We are often surprised when we see collections of material that could consist of, let's say, 150, 250 items being described as somehow being comprehensive.  We know we are not all encompassing and comprehensive, and we have the largest library collection and primary resource manuscripts collection probably of any institution in the country or the world, specifically documenting black history and culture.  And we have other collections that we feel are only comparable to our brother collection in, in New York [New York].  So the notion that a collection of a couple of hundred items could somehow be comprehensive and here, we have collections that number literally in the millions of items, and we're still trying to collect to fill the pieces into this puzzle.  There's this disconnect and often a real lack of understanding from the perspective of those who don't always appreciate the distinctions between what an individual collector can do and what institutional collectors can do.  And if I were to look at it that way, we, as the archival repository for a hundred other black organizations, those are a hundred archives that could be existing elsewhere.  And as a repository for the personal papers, the personal collections for hundreds of individuals, each one of those could've been a collection that that person is, is harboring, holding within their home, garage, basement, attic or, or whatever.  So there's often a disconnect in the view of what individual collectors are doing, vis-a-vis what institutional collectors are doing and many of those in the outside population are not making the clear distinctions that they should and what these differences are.  So for us, there are collections that are identified as being major that would, quite frankly, be very, very minor components of what we have here.  And except in those instances in which there's an item that is obviously unique, because there's only that one letter or that one whatever it may be, we normally have what all these other collections have anyway.  Certainly, if it's in book form, newspaper periodical and then quite frequently, we might not have the exact same artifact, but we're going to have a, a similar artifact.  If it's an African artifact, we might not have your gold weights, but we have our gold weights and we have lots of them.  We may not have your Ethiopian processional cross, but we have our own collection of processional crosses.  These are in, in multiple forms and multiple formats when we look at artifacts.  But, I, I do think it's a, a matter that people often misled by how the media projects what major collections are and we often say, "You want to see our collections [at the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.]?  Go visit museums and exhibitions that are dealing with black history and culture.  And if you look, you may find that where they've gotten those items are from Howard University [Washington, D.C.], as well as a larger cohort of black institutions."

Speaker 1: I know the last, I guess, three years' collections of material of Malcolm X and Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] were made available for auction and so forth, and I know that Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] bid on the Malcolm X material and they, they have it now on exhibit.  And there was Dr. King material had to be repurchased by The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia], I think, to--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --or not repurchased, but purchased by The King Center.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's some different, different aspects of this.  Often, nobody wants stuff until they find out someone's willing to pay for it and that they can put a dollar amount on it; that's not necessarily the case with, with King and Malcolm X, but generally speaking.  But the, the Malcolm X situation does offer us one of these insights, in terms of what do families do with inherited material?  The Schomburg had always been there.  Malcolm spent much of his life and career in--right there in New York City [New York, New York] lecturing right there in Harlem.  One would think the most natural place for his papers would be right there at the Schomburg Center.  Whether these could have been sold to the Schomburg or given to the Schomburg, was an issue that had not been addressed until some tragic circumstance almost occurred.  These things were put in commercial storage and nonpayment of bill, this happens.  It became well known because it's Malcolm X, but put in storage, didn't pay the bill.  The storage company sells it as they do and then when that person discovers what they have and says they're going to put it on the market, then individuals are upset because they know this is not what should've happened to Malcolm X's material.  We're very fortunate that the Schomburg was able to engage in whatever the process was and to have the resources to be able to bring that collection to, to the New York Public Library [New York, New York] and a part of the Schomburg's collection because we may not have had any of that material because it's not necessarily duplicate material.  But one would've hoped a decision had been made earlier and it would not have found itself--those materials would not have found themselves in those circumstances.  Right here, the Henry Slaughter collection ostensibly went to Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  One of the things I found most interesting is that we were called by individuals living out here in northern Virginia, this is in the mid to late 1970s, who asked us about coming and looking at some materials that they had acquired by purchasing some boxes of unclaimed freight.  And as we were looking and my colleague and I looked at this stuff and said, "This is, this is amazing.  This stuff should be at the Atlanta University," because we immediately started recognizing that, you know, this was some Henry Slaughter material.  We could never understand how this could've been unclaimed freight and never made it to its destination.  Now, we didn't need to pay to acquire this material because we had this material already in our collection, but that does point out how some of these materials can be lost inadvertently and come into the hands of individuals who acquired it through legitimate means, but not necessarily the, the manner in which we would like to have seen it acquired and going into places that we would have hoped wouldn't have been even much more desirable.  But that comes back to the role that the, the collector, the creator, has to do and in our work, we often say you don't have to deposit anything now, but you should make the decision and so that your family knows what it is that you want to do or where you want these things to go.  And that doesn't mean it should be Howard University [Washington, D.C.], no matter where, because we can recommend all kinds of places, but making a decision to assure that the materials will be preserved once you're gone is vitally important, and it's one of those things that we often overlook.

Speaker 1: I hear that you have a new book out. A new book.
Speaker 2: The center has been very fortunate in 2006, in November, was the official publication of a book titled 'Legacy: Treasures of Black History' [ed. Thomas C. Battle and Donna M. Wells].  And it, it, it is a book that we have contemplated doing for quite a long time.  It is coincidental that it has come out as it has and allows us to, in essence, comment about some other kinds of things.  It's very interesting that those individuals and institutions that are often engaged in documenting and presenting black history programming know to come to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] to identify, locate and find this material.  And there are many, many projects and museums, other people's publications, all kinds of research in which they've utilized the resources of Moorland-Spingarn Research Center [Washington, D.C.].  But then we often find that it's as though we are invisible and that no one, you know, pays any attention and, and, and notices.  We think sometimes that's a result of being within this kind of an academic institution as opposed to how people see, see public institutions.  We had actually started this project a year before [HistoryMaker] Mayme Clayton's death, but since the publication of our book was more coincident to her demise in 2006, and the subsequent awareness of her collection, it, it was interesting because that's during the same period in which these major collections are being identified in the media, but certainly, no acknowledgment of Howard University.  So for us, it was a very timely publication that for those who, who apparently don't know anything about what's collecting and what collections are at historically black colleges [HBCUs].  That here's an opportunity for you to see these vast resources at Howard University, some of which you may have seen before, but don't necessarily make a connection with our institution.  And even more so, to try to make a much broader audience aware of the death and breadth of the resources that are within an institution such as ours and the extent to which our materials are used by many other institutions that are often assumed to be major collections of black historical material.

Speaker 1: You became director in, was it eighty--
Speaker 2: I became the director in July of 1986.
Speaker 1: Eighty-six [1986].  Okay.  And what's your future prospectus on the institution?  I mean, where do we want to take it?
Speaker 2: In terms of where we want to take Moorland-Spingarn [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.], it's where we've needed to go for the last quarter century.  I mentioned that we had embarked on this major collecting program and certainly concentrating on primary resources beginning in the 1973, '74 [1974], '75 [1975].  We have been very, very successful.  Some might say we've been more successful than for our own good, meaning that we have overwhelmed our own facilities.  Our facility, within the Founders Library [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], which was constructed nearly seventy years ago and we have not expanded greatly.  We have a variety of, of facilities in which we professionally store materials, but as we project where we ought to be, we should be looking for, and this is what we have--has been proposed for quite some time, is the, the, the development of a facility that can house the--this comprehensive collection.  Within an institution such as this, we are obviously competing with all other kinds of library and resource needs and I--we realize it's a matter of priorities that have to occur within the institution.  But, at the same time, when we look at many of the external initiatives that are going on, including the development of the new National Museum of African American History and Culture [Washington, D.C.], we know that many of these new initiatives that have had millions of dollars investment, whether they're exhibition facilities or whatever, are still often reliant upon resources such as ours to help make their institutions a success.  So in order for us to best serve all the other needs that are developing and that have been developed, we need to, in this 21st century, move into a modern facility that can allow us to bring together all of our resources and to maximize them in a different kind of way.  But we are finding that while we are nearly a century old, people often tend to pay and focus attention on whatever is the newest thing that's happening.  And we know that in terms of, of identifying things, there's a lot of tension on how many projects can, should or will be supported and some have not been supported in the ways of which we might imagine like the, the King memorial project [Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial, Washington, D.C.].  So we realize that we're competing with some other projects that have a far more national focus, that may be--have some greater interest to some individuals, it's--has a different kind of attraction.  Sometimes people want to say that they helped to build something new, what we think is vitally important also to help sustain these existing institutions that also have their needs.  So, in a collective sense, I would hope that all of our existing and, and preexisting institutions will continue to receive the kind of attention that they need and, and desire and that are required for them to continue to function and they would--are not simply distracted about whatever is the newest thing, and then we go and support that new thing while neglecting whatever has come before.  I--we need to have a commitment for all of our institutions.  We need to be investing in the King memorial; we need to be investing in a new national African American museum; we need to be investing in what we're doing here at Howard University [Washington, D.C.]; we need to be investing in oral history projects and being developed wherever they're being developed; we need to be investing in other kinds of institutions.  What we see in Atlanta [Georgia] is a circumstance that may not have occurred if we did not have the kind of political structure that is currently there.  If we did not have that level of black leadership in Atlanta, one might question whether or not that community would've been able to gain the kind of corporate and other support to be able to make the kind of offer that was made to bring those King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] materials there.  But one of the interesting things in, in terms of another impact that that has is that people will use an example such as that.  Well, if they were--if someone, anyone, was willing to pay that much for this collection, then I wonder relatively speaking, how much can I get for mine?  So the, the dampening effect is that it does, in some instances, make it more difficult to current donors because many of these donors are now fascinated by the notion that they're going to be able to sell their material certainly for some new institution or new entity that's being created which doesn't yet have any collections.  The, the notion for many is that they're going to hold their stuff, not give it to an institution like Howard University, wait to see if they can sell it to some new entity that's just coming about, whether it's a new national museum here, whether it's a museum of slavery, whether it's some other museum in another city that's being developed.  So those are some of the tensions that we deal with today.  Our efforts will be the same, we will continue to appeal to those who think that we provide a kind of a repository that overcomes simple fiscal considerations for where a collection should be located.  You sell it, you sell the rights.  What we offer people is the, the integrity, the respect that we have for our own history and culture and the absolute commitment of this institution to its preservation.
Story_ID: 569137
Speaker 1: What do you think, of all the holdings you have here, what would you consider to be the most valuable piece that you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, I am frequently asked what, what's the most valuable, what's the most impressive.  I, I--my, my answer sometimes is like, "Well, it's like the blind man and the elephant; depends on where you touch it."  There is no single item.  There's an item in the collection that has a certain appeal to me, it's a, it's an image, a rare image called 'The Hunted Slaves' [Richard Ansdell].  This is a, a, a print based upon a, a painting that is in a museum in England and it took its inspiration from a Wadsworth--Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem, 'The Slave in the Dismal Swamp,' which is actually reproduced on, on this engraving.  But what appeals to me about the engraving is that--and, as I say, it's the, the--this inspiration to 'Slave in the Dismal Swamp,' is you see these vicious dogs that are in the process of attacking this black man and this black woman.  But what you do not see is this fear and this docility that is often projected about the enslaving experience, but what you see is this black man there with this, this hatchet or axe in his hand protecting and preserving not only his freedom, but that of his woman and by extension for me, that of the black family.  And I think that whether or not that was the, the true intent of the, of the artist, that's sort of the inspiration that I draw from it.  That this was not a situation in which we just accepted our fate, but that shows that these were and we were at people that was willing to stand and fight for our rights and, and for the preservation of our lives; that for me, is a, is a very powerful piece.  Every member of our staff has his or her own favorite piece.  For me, it is the, the collection, this is the comprehensiveness of what is here [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.] that is important.  That you have in one place, the largest collection of materials documenting the black experience.  A library of more than two hundred thousand volumes, all of it on the black experience from Africa throughout the Americas; north, central, south, Europe and all other aspects of the black diaspora.  It is that, that wealth of material that I think is overwhelming and helps us to put to lie black people have no history; here is the documentation right here.  If I offer you another ques- example, I could say we have a Babylonian clay tablet from several centuries B.C., that might be the rarest, the most valuable, but there are others.  And something that might appear to be insignificant could really be something that is vitally valuable because it might have a, a bit of information that expresses or exposes something about our history that is otherwise unknown.  It may have no real monetary value, but the informational value should--could be key.  So depending upon how one interprets value and how meaningful things are to one as an individual, probably gets you to answer the question, we have a million items, we have a million favorites.
Story_ID: 569138
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Education.  The value of education.  One of the things about the black community that I think has sustained us over time was that we had a, an embodying belief in the value of education.  This is not that--to, to diminish anything else, but we understood that and I think if for no other reason we understood its value because it was intentionally and specifically denied to us in order to keep us oppressed.  That--and we needed to be kept as ignorant as possible about our own sales, our own personal surroundings, about the surroundings more broadly around us because if you have no idea about anything, it is much easier to control you.  And the, the, the absence of education was an intentional effort among slaveholders, historically, throughout the experience to keep the black population oppressed so that our people, within the pain--same period understood that there must be something about this learning experience that is important, otherwise, it would not be denied us.  Our people knew that.  It's reflected in the creation of our institutions.  The, the value we've always placed on education so that as we have come to a much later period and have a generation that somehow sees that, that learning and the attainment of knowledge and education is somehow a white thing is just absolutely antithetical to the, to the black experience and to the belief system that historically been that of black America and not simply black America, but black people wherever they are who have been denied just that most fundamental element which is to learn.  So, for me, that is a, a major, major key.  We, we talk about it.  We talk about it in our schools, but we have to be very, very serious about what are the benefits of education?  What does education do?  It, it, it makes you a person.  It makes you human.  It, it, it makes you whatever it is that you need to be and without it, in a sense, there's death.  So it is to avoid that death.  It is to avoid repeating the, the errors of the past that concerns me.  So the valuing of education is vitally important to me among all of our young people and not to be so distracted by some of the other more popular aspects of, of the black experience to the extent that we negate what our scholars do.  I want to see the time in which scholars and teachers are, are the heroes and sheroes and not the entertainers and the athletes.  We can enjoy their performances, I do.  They're great contributors to our life, but it pales in comparison to what our educators bring to us and, and that's--so there's a shift in our value system that for me is essential.  And, and our young people need to appreciate that these are the most important players in our lives, those that educate us, not simply those that entertain us.
Story_ID: 569139
Speaker 1: I know you have a full plate of activities, but you do have boards and organizations outside of the, the work here [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.] that you participate in and many of them have to do with the library profession.  I know we mentioned the Black Caucus of the American Library Association [BCALA] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: But there's also something called the National Conference of African American Librarians.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us some of those?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the--like many organizations that were--where African Americans had difficulty becoming full partners, they often found that the best and most effective way for them to have a voice was to bring themselves together.  The Black Caucus of the American Library Association is, is reflective of that and is also inspiration for many of the other ethnic caucuses that currently exist within the American Library Association.  I've certainly been involved with the Black Caucus since my professional in- involvement in the library profession and the Black Caucus was responsible for the travel that I took to, to West Africa.  The National Conference of, of Black Librarians has been an effort on their part to find another way to collectively bring together these black librarians within a forum in which all of the focus is on black librarianship.  Within the context of the American Library Association, the BCALA activities are usually early during their conference and the conference is much more broadly based.  So bringing that together was the opportunity, because there are a tremendous number of black librarians in institutions all over the country, but the--so that they could come together in a forum in which the concentration was on issues that related to them.  So the other institutions or organizations that I've become involved in, some are for cultural reasons, others are for simply professional reasons, I've been a member of the, the Society of American Archivists for most of my professional life.  I maintain membership in the ALA Black Caucus, but I do not maintain membership in the American Library Association simply because in my professional work, I don't really function as much as a librarian as I have as an archivist, as a curator and as many of us aside from that professional work as I do as a historian.  Many of our staff have had training in whatever the professional discipline was, as well as the, the subject training, whether master's [degree] or Ph.D.'s in history and usually a concentration in African or African American history.  So one of the reasons of being involved in the Society of American Archivists is for the practical reason of the, the training and expertise that it brings to us, but at the same time it afforded us an opportunity, once we got involved in such an organization that this is an organization from a professional standpoint that influences decis- decisions that relate to the archival development in the United States.  So it became clear to me through the encouragement of someone like Dr. Harold Pinkett [Harold T. Pinkett], to become involved in this organization because if you're not in a room, much less if you're not at the table, then what voice can you have in the conversation?  So it was to make sure we had a voice in the conversation by, by doing that.
Story_ID: 569140
Speaker 1: The o- organization, however, that is probably closest to my heart and of which I am a life member and which I've served and, and I've been in--on boards of all these organizations, is the Association for the Study of African American Life and History.  The organization started by Carter G. Woodson and in which, in a sense traditionally, individuals at Moorland-Spingarn [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.] have been involved going back to Dr. Moorland's [Jesse Moorland] own involvement with Dr. Woodson in the early stages of that organization and continuing throughout Dorothy Porter Wesley's tenure and, and my own, as well as any number of other staff who've been here.  That is an organization that would--I would be involved with and would participate in, regardless of what my professional activities are simply because it is one that, that focuses from a professional standpoint on our history and culture.  And it is the one that reflects Dr. Woodson's efforts and intent to see that we, as a people, are no longer mis-educated about who--about who and what we are as a people and it's an organization that really pioneered in the study and the professional study of black life and history and that included the voices of black scholars, white scholars, African scholars, all scholars who committed to the study of black history and culture.  So again, if I think back to those who talked about black people having no history, I wonder where they were because an important journal like The Journal of Negro History and now The Journal of African American History has been published for some eighty years.  So this information has been there, the scholarship has been there, how was--why was this scholarship not paid attention to?
Story_ID: 569141
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  When you look back on everything you've done up to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently now?
Speaker 2: No, there isn't.  I've gotten old enough to know that we need to take the life we've lived.  There's, there's no great regret I have in I wish I had done this, I wish I had done that; like going to law school, I don't have any great with not having gone to law school, because I find that I've actually done what I'm supposed to, to be doing.  I was asked once by an elder how is it that I came to be in this profession and I gave some sort of roundabout answer, in terms of how I'm really sort of an accidental member of this profession.  I didn't start out to do this, I just sort of found myself here and haven't offered an explanation.  You know, people acknowledge and accepted it and when it was over, a woman came up to me and, and looked at me and just said, "You're doing what God intended."  And I, I thought about it, not just trying to interpret it from any kind of a spiritual and, and religious point of view, but simply that I was doing what I was intended to do.  And I--I've always taken her, her statement to heart because in a, in a, in a very real way, she was right.  Anybody who knows me and knows that I grew up, in a sense--I spent--and my friends will say it, you know, I'd be in the house reading, I'd be in the library, I'd be doing this sort of stuff that defined, and this is what I'm doing in a library surrounded by all of this knowledge of black history and culture, in a sense, how could I have determined a better place for me to be?  So in that sense, I'm doing what I'm supposed to do.
Story_ID: 569142
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look back at everything you've done to this point and you're still working with a full plate of stuff, what would you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: In, in some ways, perhaps the longevity; it's not something I would normally think about, but I, I would say that I could never have had any intention, as a young person, to imagine that I would still be in, in this place [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.] at this point in my life.  It is not I started out I'm here, I'll be here forever, it was always I could never imagine being somewhere for forty-three years, as Dorothy [Dorothy Porter Wesley] was, but, but as I have passed and moved into the thirty-five year mark, it, it's made me wonder.  But I do remember one of the things that Michael Winston [Michael R. Winston] said to me early on in his tenure was that in a sense, in, in order to build and maintain every institution, that institutions needs long distance runners.  It needs individuals who, in essence, are there for most of, if not all of their careers.  They don't know who they are, they, in a sense, emerge, but that is what sustains institutions.  So as I, I look back in, in, in that sense, it is the, the opportunity to be part of sustaining an, an institution and being able to, to move it forward, you know, and to have whatever mentoring impact that I could have on, on other people.  We can't hire everybody, but we can reach out to others.  The experience that I've had with my, my coworkers has been tremendous.  I--there have been few and I, I don't think of any professionals, for the most part, who have been here who are not absolutely committed to the work that we do.  Many individuals who are here sacrificing only in the sense that whether or not they could do better economically, position-wise in other places, felt that they could make their greatest and best contribution right here.  So to whatever extent that I, too, have made that sacrifice, I could not be making a better sacrifice. I'm making it for my alma mater [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and in my hometown [Washington, D.C.] and for my people.  And I think that's been reflective not only of me, but a--any number of my, my, my coworkers who have seen that there's a larger purpose that we can serve and if this is it, then this is where it must be.  This is what we must do.

Speaker 2: Well, in looking back, I've been probably very fortunate.  My, my father [Thomas O. Battle] has been dead now for twenty-five years; my mother's [Lenora Thomas Battle] still alive.  Obviously, at, at their age and their generation, many of my--they--their contemporaries are certainly gone, but we still have a large and, and, and vibrant family.  I have three children [Brima Battle, Idrissa Battle, and Mensah Battle] of my own and as they have grown, they, they all have attended Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and they are now blessing me with grandchildren, so that in addition to my, my three sons, I have three grandsons.  And, most recently, we've had the addition of a granddaughter to my family, which given the fact that there's been so many boys, certainly where I'm concerned, there was a notion that I would sometimes say--they said, "Well, where's the, where, where's the girl?  Where's the girl?"  And my comment would be, "We make boys."  Well, that has changed and, you know, we've been very blessed in, in terms of being able to see that that next generation is coming along.  So, in terms of where I am now, it is perhaps looking back and, and seeing that maybe I've, I've played my role and it's, it's time to start preparing for that next generation that needs to come in and, and take over so that people like myself can start to think about retirement and, and how much time we can spend with our own families and in, in my case with my grandchildren.
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I haven't asked you do you think we need to cover before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No.  There's nothing that's just jumping out at me, something that I wish I had said or want to say that I haven't yet.

Speaker 1: Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Pause) As a race man.  I, I, I have a simple role to play.  I'm a caretaker and I think a race man--I, I--and I, I normally say I'm a race man not a racist and that hearkens back to some late 19th century, early 20th century conceptualization about who and what we are.  And all that, in essence, that means for me is to know that I was fully and absolutely committed to the aspirations of my people and that I did whatever I could do to make a contribution.  And if that contribution is in the field of history, and library science, and archiving, and collecting, and preserving the evidence, the material and documentary evidence of that experience, and to the extent that I've been successful in doing so and encouraging others to do so and being able to help to educate people about our history and culture and that, people can, can say, "Oh, yeah, Battle [HistoryMaker Thomas Battle] was a good brother," then I, I will, I will have been satisfied.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Pleasure.
