Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm the interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Paul Bieschke.  Ma'am, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Surely.  My full name is Blondell Reynolds Brown; B... as in boy... L-O-N-D-E-L-L, R-E-Y-N-O-L-D-S, B-R-O-W-N.
Speaker 1: And what is your date of birth?
Speaker 2: My date of birth--do I have to tell that?  Okay, my date of birth is (laughter) Sixteen, sixteen, '52 [1952] [sic.].
Speaker 1: You're younger than that.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Where is your place of birth?
Speaker 2: My place of birth, I was born in Sumter, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Currently, I serve as a member of the Philadelphia City Council, City Councilwoman-at-Large--legislator.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Story_ID: 72595
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five People Magazinish-type questions I'm compelled to ask you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They just require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: One, the first one, is what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is chicken.  Probably... no, no, no.  It would be salmon... salmon.  Unbelievable... (Laughter) salmon.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is absolutely purple.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of the year would be the fall, yes.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I like to get to the beach anytime that I can.
Speaker 1: So, wherever the beach is?
Speaker 2: Wherever there's water... and lots of water, where you can see for miles--wherever it is works.
Speaker 1: [OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION]
Speaker 2: Yes, now do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 1: I do.  And it really depends upon if you're talking about family, or success, or career.  On the family side, it would be, "You reap what you sow." And for career, I often tell young people, "Shoot for the moon.  And if by chance you trip and fall, you'll catch a star."
Story_ID: 72596
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's talk about your background.  Can you give us the names of your parents and their dates of birth, places of birth, and please spell their names for us?
Speaker 2: Okay then.  The name of my parents are Sadie--Whittimore Reynolds and Sadie Reynolds.  My dad's full name, spelled, is W-H-I-T-T-I-M-O-R-E.  And Sadie is S-D-I-E [sic].  My family, my parents are from Columbia, South Carolina.  My dad died when I was sixteen years old, back in 1967.  My mother is still living.  Her birthday we just celebrated September 5, and she's seventy-five years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your parents pass along stories, or did your grandparents pass along stories about your family history, and what your ancestors were doing during slavery or Reconstruction?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  My mother has, and still does--my mother came as one of sixteen who came from a large farm there in Elliott, South Carolina.  And today, they're one of the few people of color who still own more than a hundred acres there in Elliott, South Carolina.  And she always tells us the stories of how she and her brothers and sisters had to pick the cotton and take care of farm animals, and had all kind of pecan trees and apple trees around the farm; and did everything... everything that they ate, they actually grew themselves right there on the farm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But did they have stories about what the family was doing during slavery or Reconstruction, and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Not... not that I can remember.  Her, her grandparents were... her great...father...let me get it right.  Her father, her grandfather, was a slave, in that he actually acquired the land from the slave owner.  And her parents on her mother's side were Indian.  So, she's really of African and Indian descent, American Indian.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you know what tribe?
Speaker 2: I do not know, I do not know.  We have a family history--you wouldn't call it a scrapbook.  You would call it a history of several generations back that we actually pulled together about four years ago at one of our family reunions.  And that's at home, where we were able to trace back a couple of generations where our roots really are.
Speaker 1: Do you know where--you know--how far back could you go?
Speaker 2: To my mother's grandparents, my mother's grandparents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And on my father's side, because he died when I was relatively young, a teenager, we didn't have the benefit of the kind of stories that we learned from our mother.  I do know that my grandmother on my father's side was also an elementary school teacher.  My mother's a teacher.  All my aunts were teachers.  So, my life was surrounded by educators.  And I'm often told that I sort of, I have a lot of my grandmother's traits on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 72597
Speaker 1: Did you father [Whittimore Reynolds] go to school?
Speaker 2: My father did not complete college.  He was a construction worker by trade, yes.
Speaker 1: He completed high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did complete high school, yes.
Speaker 1: And your mother [Sadie Reynolds]?
Speaker 2: My mother completed her bachelor's degree at Bennett in South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Bennett College is a--
Speaker 2: Historically... yes.
Speaker 1: Do you know who founded Bennett, or what group founded Bennett?
Speaker 2: I do not... I do not know that history, I... do not.  I've become more aware of Bennett and its rich history by a Council colleague, who is now trustee, a president.  She's actually president of the trustees at Bennett University.  So, only recently have I become more aware of what she's been doing for the University.
Story_ID: 72598
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your mother [Sadie Reynolds] is from Elliott, South Carolina?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And I guess at one point, she must have--did she when she... she met your father [Whittimore Reynolds] in Columbia?
Speaker 2: That's correct, that's correct.  And they got married, and had me as the first of seven.  And my mother came here when I was six years old.  So, I'm quick to claim my southern roots, because I'm the only one of the seven of us that was born in South Carolina.  I think there's much to be said for being born in the South.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how they met, that they passed along to you?
Speaker 2: My mother never shared that with me.  The little I do remember is she took the bold step of leaving South Carolina after they became married.  And it was bold for her, because she was the first of the family of fourteen to make that courageous move to come to the North, knowing absolutely no one.  And she often shares that with us as a reminder that sometimes you have to take steps in life where it's a solo act, and you have to go with the confidence that you have and, you know, move forward alone.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she moved... I mean... now you, she moved after you were born?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She moved after... when I came here, I was six years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I've been here ever since.
Speaker 1: And you moved here with your mother?
Speaker 2: And my dad, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The whole family moved?
Speaker 2: Yes, the three of us, that's correct, that's correct.
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest of six girls and one boy.  There are five girls, my brother, and then my youngest sister, Alisha.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 72599
Speaker 1: Can you kind of--so you grew up in South Carolina, in Sumter, I guess.  And then--
Speaker 2: Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So you have a lot--in fact, you did more growing up, I guess, here than you did in Sumter?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: So, can you tell us... kind of think back, and give us a sense of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sure, I can.  On the farm, it is purely a farm world, where there were still pigs on the farm and fields for as long as you could see, and the actual equipment that they used when they were actually picking cotton.  So, I remember those well.  And going back, you know, every summer after that for many years, my mother [Sadie Reynolds] would often tell those stories.  In fact, there's still a family home in Sumter, South Carolina, where we all go back to every couple of years--all the members of the, of the Tony family on my mother's side.  So, there's a still a connector there for us.  And my sister--my mom and her parents still take care of that home every year.  So, that's what I remember well during those early days as a child, and going back during the summers.  And the sights and sounds of Philadelphia... I clearly remember when we came to North Philadelphia, there were two bedrooms--my mother and dad [Whittimore Reynolds] in one, and the seven of us in the other.  So we were poor by, you know, today's standards.  And I would say poor in terms of money, but not at all in terms of family closeness and spiritually rich.  Because we were required to go to church every Sunday when we were coming us.  In fact, you know, you had the five days a week when you went to school, and then the sixth day of the week, Saturday, we were not permitted to sleep late.  And that came from my mother's tradition that when you were on a farm, you never slept late.  You had to get up every morning and pick cotton.  And then on the seventh, on the Sabbath Day, on Sunday, it was real clear where we were, and that was no option; we were at Sunday school and then at church.  So, the sights and sounds of the inner-city, and the sights and sounds of the house with a bunch of kids running through it, each with very clear responsibilities about what we were to do as, as children.
Story_ID: 72600
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, what was the neighborhood like, and what was the name of the neighborhood you lived in?
Speaker 2: We lived in North Philadelphia, as I say.  And it was very close-knit, in terms of adults looking after little people.  And I mention that, because we don't see so much of that anymore today.  And then we moved to a section of Philadelphia called Southwest Philadelphia, which was in many ways a step up, for what that means.  We were now coming to a house that had five bedrooms instead of two bedrooms.  And so, you know, the sisters and brothers were able to spread out.  But it was a block where every home was occupied.  And I mention that, because we visit that neighborhood today, and it's devastated in terms of empty housing and torn down buildings and graffiti, and the like.  But at that time, every home was occupied.  There were grocery stores, which we don't see a lot of anymore; the neighborhood church, of course; the neighborhood school; and a block where folks really kept up the block.  You know, we swept in front of the house every day, and neighbors really looked out for each other, and looked out for each other's kids.
Story_ID: 72601
Speaker 1: Okay.  What kind of a little girl were you?  Did you, what were you interested in?  And what did you like to do?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Sadie Reynolds] tells me that I... I clearly remember spending a lot of time at the neighborhood Y [MCA].  It was called the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association]... today... Boys and Girls Club--Boys and Girls Club.  And whenever I went there, I'm told I was always in the library.  I actually have a picture of me sitting in the library with the counselor there.  And the first award I got as a child was the Librarian Award.  Because whenever I went to the Boys and Girls Club, I ended up in the library.  I liked arts and crafts a lot, to work with my hands.  And when I reflect and when I listen to my mother... I was a good student.  I have a six-year old now, and I've had to put her on time-out.  My mother tells me that she never had to put me on time-out to get her point across.
Story_ID: 72602
Speaker 1: And being the oldest, I was always burdened or showered with responsibility... it depends upon your perspective.  But I had to set the example all the time.  And there were some decisions I made in my life, not for me, but because I had to open the trail and blaze the trail for my sisters and brothers.  A number of decisions I made in my life was because I had to set an example, you know.
Speaker 2: Did you, how did that make you feel?  Did you feel like, did you feel a sense of accomplishment, or did you feel kind of burdened by, you know, all the responsibility?
Speaker 1: I... now that I'm older and recognize what my mother [Sadie Reynolds] was trying to get through to me, it is a sense of accomplishment.  Only one time in my career--and I can't say career, because I was coming out of graduate school--did I feel some angst about the decision that my mother compelled me to make.  Shall I share now what that was?  Or we can get to that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you can share that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, my last semester in graduate school, I, like most, you know, students, had to figure out what we were going to do with the rest of our lives.  And I've always wanted to work with kids.  So, I went to an orientation session for the Peace Corps, and was truly inspired by the notion of going overseas and working with children, and I signed up.  So, when it came time to call home and let my mother know that I'd completed my graduate education, and I had a plan for what I was going to do, (laughter) I told her that I'd signed up for the Peace Corps.  And there was a deadpan silence over the phone, which was clear to me that she was not happy about that decision.  So, I asked her how did she feel about it, and her response was, "You've gotten your education.  You've gotten your college education, and now it's time for you to come back home and help your sisters and brothers get theirs.  You have two sisters in college, and four--three more and a brother waiting to go.  So, I'm asking you to come back home and help them get their college education as well."  So, I abandoned that notion of going overseas to the Peace Corps, and I came back home, and did what I could to help the rest of my sisters and brother get through college.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's, you know, that's the kind of decision I guess that you... who knows what it would led to--
Speaker 1: Had I not come back home.  So, at the end of the day, it was the right thing to do.  And I take small credit, because ultimately it was on them to finish.  But my mother saw great value in me coming back home and being an example of having gone to college and completed... and come back home to help out... help out my other brothers and... my other sister and brother.
Speaker 2: There's a lot of value in that.
Speaker 1: Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.
Story_ID: 72603
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me about school.  What school did you attend?  I guess you didn't attend school until you got to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: That is correct.  We came here, and I went to the Morton McMichael Elementary School in the Mantua section of West Philadelphia.  So, I remember writing an essay titled, "The Youth Looks at Tomorrow."  And remember being sick at home and getting a call from the school saying that they wanted me to come to school, because I actually won that essay, and received a small stipend for that essay in eighth grade.  So, that's, that's a highlight of those first eight years of my elementary school education.  My school went up to eighth grade.  And I had a, my life was touched by wonderful teachers.  I had a math teacher there who recommended me for the Philadelphia High School for Girls, which was a highly competitive all-academic college prep public school.  And he felt I had sort of the right stuff to persist in that school.  So, he recommended me for Girl's High, and I ended up going to Girl's High.
Story_ID: 72604
Speaker 1: And it prepared me in a magnificent way, not only for college, but for life.  It was extremely competitive.  It's where I first got a taste of civics and government, because we were required to take government courses every year.  We had to read Newsweek and Time every week and get a test on it every week.  We, and because the academics were so intimidating for me, I excelled in gym.  That's where my self-esteem developed and my self-confidence developed.  And that's where I did excel.  I was on the gymnastics team.  And my junior year, I ended up being a finalist, much to the surprise of everybody.  And my senior year, they actually elected me captain of the senior team.  So, I wasn't a finalist my senior year, but my team came in first.  And when I think about it, for me, again, it represents, you know, early leadership.  Being the oldest of seven, having to look out for the team versus self... and that actually revealed itself at Girls High [Philadelphia High School for Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] during my senior year there on the contest team.  But Girls High taught me what discipline means.  Because the only way you could get by, get through that school, was to have the discipline to come home every night and hit the books.  And so, that--
Speaker 2: Was it a long trip to Girls High?
Speaker 1: It was, it was.  I had to travel about an hour and a half on public transportation from West Philadelphia all the way up to the Omni section of Philadelphia.  So we had to get up early, you know, 6, 6:30 in the morning, be out the door and in class by 8:05 a.m.  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 72605
Speaker 1: Now had you been exposed to gymnastics prior to attending--
Speaker 2: Not at all.  The first opportunity, the first exposure was when I got to Girls High [Philadelphia High School for Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], where I didn't even know what the equipment was.  But I went to the gym and tried my skills and, you know, surprisingly, including me, was good at it, even at the first try.  So, and that's what, at 15 years old?  So, you know, often I wonder how life, how life would have been had I had that exposure at five or six years old.
Speaker 1: Because most women gymnasts peak when they're fifteen or sixteen.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.  And they start when they're three, four, and five years old.  You know that... and dance.  I got exposed for the first time to the world of dance and loved it, absolutely loved it, was good at it.  And but again, that... to start dance classes at 16 years old is not late, it's very late.  The ideal is to start a little person at four, five, or six years old.  And then if the passion is there, if the interest is there, they can grow and develop, and move on to New York and do whatever they want to do in theater.  But I got that taste of the bug at sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, what other activities were you engaged in in high school?
Speaker 2: That was primarily it--gymnastics, dance, and cheerleading.  I mean, even though it was an all girls' school, we still had cheerleaders.  And those were the three areas that I spent my time in; I stayed in the gym.  When I wasn't in the classroom, I was in the gym.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were still active in church, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes, church was a requirement.  And it's interesting you mention that.  Because during that period, too, I started taking organ lessons.  My mother [Sadie Reynolds] actually found a way to get us a piano.  And I took organ lessons and played the piano for my neighborhood church for the children's choir when I was in 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th grade.  So, yes, I was still actively involved with church as well.  That's amazing, because I actually forgot that.
Speaker 1: And yeah, that's significant.  I mean that's... you know, you were busy.
Speaker 2: I was a little--
Speaker 1: Did you have any time for a social life at all?
Speaker 2: No such thing.
Speaker 1: Dating, or--
Speaker 2: Not really.  No, no, no, no, no.  My mother wasn't having that. (Laughter).  No, I was in high school.  No, I didn't get my first boyfriend until I was seventeen years old.  (Laughter).  And I had to get one, because I needed a prom date.  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 72606
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, what role did your father [Whittimore Reynolds] play in your upbringing?  I mean, you mentioned mother basically.  But did your father--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes.  As I said, my father died when I was sixteen.  But the one thing he liked to do was read.  And he loved Hollywood.  I mean I would sit at the bottom of his feet, and he would just call off movie stars, like Richard Widmark and, you know, that era of Hollywood stars, as if he was calling off his children's names.  He followed stars in Hollywood.  And that's why when I actually really developed an interest in that whole circuit--knowing their names, following their lives.  And that's what I remember most about him, him being... always having a "j-o-b," but loving to read and following the Hollywood stars.
Speaker 2: Do you watch old movies now?
Speaker 1: When I can... when I can.  And it's rare.  I enjoy old movies, particularly because I know who the stars are.  But certainly not as much I'd like to.
Story_ID: 72607
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, at the point of graduation from high school [Philadelphia High School for Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --I mean, how did you... did you have an idea of what you were going to do?  Did you have a career idea?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  I had it very, very, very early.  In fact, sometimes I believe I was in second grade, and knew that I wanted to be a teacher.  And it was re-enforced because my life was touched with wonderful, wonderful teachers.  So, I knew going into high school that college was not an option for me, it was required.  My mother had made that exceedingly clear all of our lives.  And there were two institutions I applied to--West Chester State University and Penn State University [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania].  And I applied to West Chester [University, West Chester, Pennsylvania] because it had a strong teacher's program at that time.  But West Chester turned me down, and Penn State University gave me admission.  And you know, I always say that was West Chester's loss.  But I went on to Penn State as a commonwealth campus, public-funded institution.  And the great thing about it, it had what are called commonwealth campuses, where you would go to the commonwealth campus for a couple of years, and then to the main campus at University Park which is four hours away.  And that was great for me, because it was a middle stepping ground from leaving home to being kind of sort of independent, where you're still commuting... you're still living at home, but going to college.  So, I was really ready to head to University Park my junior year, in terms of my own development and level of independence, and the like.  And those first two years at Penn State were wonderful, in terms of being able to meet the curriculum regiment.  Because Girls High [Philadelphia High School for Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] had more than adequately prepared me for volumes of reading, and that kind of thing.  So, my college experience was wonderful.  I was a party animal, but I was a good student.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You were a party animal at that point, really?
Speaker 2: I was a party animal.
Speaker 1: You made up for the high school life, the lack of social life in high school.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  You could say that, when you really think about it.  I loved to dance, was able to join the dance company when I went to Penn State.  And remember, I started my formal training late.  But I went to Penn State, and was admitted into the dance company there.  In fact, I was the only African-American female in that company, and got a chance to travel around the campus and around to some of the commonwealth campuses as a member of that company.  So, I met the demands of my academics, because I graduated just missing the Dean's list; stayed on the Dean's list most of the time.  But then when it came time to graduate, I just missed it by like a tenth of a point.  But I was able to hold to my academics and travel with the dance company, and still enjoy a good, positive, wonderful, social life.
Speaker 1: And what kind of music did you like?  I mean, who were your favorite musicians?
Speaker 2: The O'Jays and War... War... War.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: War?
Speaker 2: So, anytime War comes back to Philly, I'm there.  I've gotten everything that War ever made, along with my number one all-time recording artist, Marvin Gaye.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have everything he ever made, too.
Story_ID: 72608
Speaker 1: Alright, okay.  So you went on to grad school at, at--?
Speaker 2: Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Penn State.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Did you go to State College, or did you--
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  I was offered a graduate assistance-ship to come right back that September, which was wonderful, because I loved my college experience.  So I came out in January for my undergraduate experience, and went right back that September to pursue a graduate degree in education.  And I completed that, and had the opportunity to go overseas as an exchange student.  And so, I was confronted with another--I guess probably one of the first decisions related to my career.  But I still wanted to dance.  So, I declined the opportunity to go overseas as an exchange student so that I could stay on with the dance company there at Penn State.  And with the benefit of hindsight, would that have been a rich experience?  Probably.  But dance was truly in my blood.  So, I continued... finished up my graduate experience there, and continued to dance with the company there.
Story_ID: 72609
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any teachers that stand out as--particularly as mentors for you when you were at Penn State?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I actually have a couple of pictures of one.  I had a fifth grade teacher named Mrs. Evans.  And she was the teacher who gave me my first C, and I was devastated.  But what I learned from her is the real value of excellence, that you have to earn your A's and B's.  And I actually ultimately stayed in touch with her throughout high school and college, and went to her funeral when she passed, about a decade ago.  So, Mrs. Evans was one.  And then at Girls High [Philadelphia High School for Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] there was a teacher named Mrs. Chalickian, who was the chairman of the contest team, gymnastics team.  And she, too, helped me understand the importance of excellence and what it means to practice until you get it right, and not set mediocrity as your standard, but excellence as your standard in everything that you do.  And that's the only thing she required in the gym.  So, Mrs. Chalickian there at Girls High was another one.  And then at Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania] it was a teacher I had during my graduate experience, who was the professor for international education--the one that made me the offer to be an exchange student.  And from him I learned just the value of education from an international perspective.  And for me, it just really underscored what I always heard from my mom [Sadie Reynolds], that, you know, education is your ticket up and out of your circumstance, no matter who you are and where you are.  So, because of their example, and my long-standing interest in education, it was, you know, sustained throughout my college experience that education and teaching is what I really want to do.  And oftentimes I think that's where I'll end up at the end of my career.  Because I really would like to get back in the classroom, once I'm re-elected.  And when I think about where I want to be ten years from now, being a professor at a university may be it.  It's certainly an option.
Story_ID: 72610
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you run for office in college?
Speaker 2: I was treasurer my freshman and junior year... it's amazing... when I was college.  I actually forgot about that.  We had to run to be elected to one of the school offices.  And so, I ran for treasurer and won that opportunity.  And to put it in perspective, I mean, I went... that campus was ninety percent white and ten percent minority, including Latino, Asian and African-Americans.  And even in that environment, I was able to garner the support of enough of the student body to have the opportunity to be a member of the Student Council.  So, yes, I forgot about that.  But I did run when I was in, a freshman at Penn State, you know.
Story_ID: 72611
Speaker 1: Now, the early seventies [1970s] were times of--
Speaker 2: Tough times.
Speaker 1: --a lot of social upheaval.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right, that's exactly right.
Speaker 1: It was the tail end of the changes of the late seventies.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And the late sixties [1960s].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were you involved in the black student movement on campus?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was.  It was the first time that Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania] had had such a large enrollment of African-American students at one time.  I don't remember the number.  I only--and I know this because I was just at Penn State a month ago to get an update on what's happening with minority enrollment at Penn State.  And they reminded us that 1970, '71' [1971] was when they had the largest influx of recruitment enrollment numbers for minority students.  And at Delaware County campus, which is where I attended, I was a member--not an officer, but a member of the Black Student Union.  And I remember discussing what we as students should do to involve ourselves in student life, but still hold on to the support and connectedness we needed to persist in a predominantly white institution--which is one reason why I decided to run for Student Government.  Because that... then a face... one of us would be represented in the student body.  And I was elected captain of the cheerleader team my sophomore year there at Penn State, yep.

Speaker 1: Did you have any experiences in college [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania] where you... any conferences or lectures that opened up, you know, any new ideas for you in school?
Speaker 2: I didn't have the opportunity to travel off campus to conferences like that.  I became active with the Paul Robeson Cultural Center there.  In fact, it was because of my involvement and presence and activity--student body activities--at the Paul Roberson Cultural Center that led me to a fellowship for my graduate degree.  And just going there and being there, eventually it was asked a part of the Black Cultural Festival that the campus hosted every February.  And I got... I think that was probably my first taste of sitting down with a team of folk and beginning to talk through details and iron out... and then executing details related to an event of any type.  Because we brought "Earth, Wind, and Fire" there my junior year.  And that was a result of the team of us being on that Black Arts Cultural Planning Committee and actually planning out the entire weekend, not just for African-American students on the University Park campus, but students who were coming from around the state to the Black Cultural Festival.  And that festival was cultural and entertaining in one respect, but also gave us a chance to talk through workshops and forums about who we are and why we have to persist on a campus like that, and what we needed to do with each other in supporting each other to make sure we persisted and graduated at the end of those four or five years.  So, that was the little experience I got on campus--being a part of planning a conference, and then being responsible for the execution of the details around that conference.  And I did that my junior and senior year.
Speaker 1: Well, that's great.  That's kind of--that's a good experience.
Speaker 2: It was a terrific experience.  And it wasn't a part of the plan; it wasn't a part of an agenda, is the word we would use today.  But it actually led me to being offered a fellowship, to actually now be on staff at the Paul Robeson Cultural Center, and be responsible for the programming of a lot of the activities there as a part of my graduate assistantship program, which helped pay for my graduate education, you know.
Speaker 1: What kind of activities would you program in (unclear)?
Speaker 2: The Cultural Fest was the centerpiece for all of those for that year.  But then monthly, we tried to bring in a renowned author, or someone extraordinary in their field of endeavor, of color, who could be an inspiration and example for the students there on campus.
Story_ID: 72613
Speaker 1: Did you all ever get a... the answer is probably no.  But did you all ever get a chance to meet Paul Robeson?
Speaker 2: We did not.  We did not, not on campus... not on campus.  But we were--if that happened before I got there, then great credit goes to those who recognized his value and his worth to our community, and saw fit to honor him by naming a building after him.  And now, 30-plus years later, that building has been completely re-outfitted.  And it's a two-story, wonderful state-of-the art structure that has portraits, and captures his life in that building.  So, in addition to the building being named after him, it now, through interactive materials and the like, have just re-faced... we've re-faced that building.  It was a magnificent structure on Penn State's [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania] campus.  So, credit to them for making the financial investment to re-do that building entirely, and dedicate it again to Paul Robeson.
Story_ID: 72614
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was there anything else in your college career, I mean, in your college life that you'd like to discuss?
Speaker 2: That sort of--?
Speaker 1: Something that--
Speaker 2: That sort of stands out?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: I know that the only... if I had to offer up a regret, it would be that if I had to do it all over again, I would have gone to law school.  Because I think that a law degree just gives you wings, in terms of the analytic training and the skills that you can take anywhere, I mean even if you never decide to practice law.  The training and thinking that it gives you, and the knowledge base that it gives you, can take you in so many other areas.  And I decided after working for about fifteen years, that I wanted to do law school.  And I tried it under some really severe circumstances--took four classes one semester.  But I was commuting to my job and commuting to law school, having to rely on someone else for transportation.  And it was not in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], but in Harrisburg [Pennsylvania], and it... it basically gave me a good kick, you know.  In one of the classes I got a C in... I got a C in contracts.  And you know, in law school, C's are just not acceptable.  So, unfortunately, I never got accepted.  But the only regret is if I have to have one now, with hindsight being 20/20, it would be that I would have definitely pursued law school after graduate school, to have that additional training under my belt.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So, in my next life, I'll be a lawyer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You're still young, relatively, so you've got some time.  I, if I wasn't a mother, I would definitely go to law school, without a doubt.  But I have, there's a tremendous sense of obligation and responsibility, naturally when you become a parent.  And I'm, I'm committed to making sure she has the best in terms of education.  So, something has to be sacrificed, and for me it would be a law degree.
Story_ID: 72615
Speaker 1: Now, when was your daughter born?
Speaker 2: My daughter [Brielle Autumn Brown] is six years old.  So, she was born very late in my career.  Some might say the alarm clock was about to go off.  So, she's six years old now.  And I had her in-between two elections.  In 1999, I ran for public office.  And I have to say public office was never a career goal.  I sort of happened upon elected office.  But the short story is that I got a chance to work for the then State Senator Chaka Fattah [HM] in Harrisburg [Pennsylvania].  He made me an offer to work for him as his legislative aide on the Education Committee, Senate Education Committee, in Harrisburg.
Speaker 1: Now, how did that come about?  I mean, how did he think to choose you for that--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: I mean, without skipping over a lot of history leading up to that.
Speaker 2: The short, well, the short story is I came out of college [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania].  And my mother [Sadie Reynolds], you know, believed in making sure you get a piece of dirt.  So, she insisted she buy a piece of property, and I did.  And someone sprayed graffiti on my property.  So, that led me to asking in the neighborhood, "What do you do when someone destroys property?"  I ran into a community leader who told me the process, and said to me, "You need to be the committeeperson.  And the committeeperson, of course, is the bottom rung of the Democratic Party structure, the person in the community responsible for handling those kind of neighborhood kind of matters.  And it led me to--I had developed an interest in the Democratic National Convention in 1980... decided I wanted to go, went through the proper channels.  And on my way to the Democratic Convention, I met the then State Representative, Chaka Fattah.  After the convention was over, he approached me about joining his political organization.  And I said, "What does that mean?"  And he said, "You have an interest in politics.  I'm building an organization..."  And this is 1982, '83' [1983].  So, he invited me to become a member of this team he was building.  And I started off stuffing envelopes.
Speaker 1: Now, were you teaching school then?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was on my career path.
Speaker 1: Now, you were--?
Speaker 2: In the classroom.  At that point, I had actually been working for Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania] as the director of their admissions program, recruiting young people to come to Penn State.  So, I had a career path--
Speaker 1: And you were--
Speaker 2: --in the area of education.
Speaker 1: And you were dancing, too, for Philadelphia Dance Company?
Speaker 2: And still at that time carrying my briefcase on one side, and my dance bag on the other--doing what I still refused to give up at that time, and that was dance.  So, I was a member of the Philadelphia Dance Company.  So, I had my career... still loving, you know, doing what I loved most... my passion, which was dance... and now approached by the State Rep to join his political organization.  So, for ten years I did that--put up envelopes... I mean, you know, put up posters, stuffed envelopes, raised hundreds of thousands of dollars--did everything one could do in a campaign.  And he approached me to ask me if I would now work for him, which... to work in Harrisburg.  So, I took it, because I'd done the teaching in the classroom; I worked for Penn State recruiting young people in higher education... become, you know, very familiar with that breadth of knowledge.  And this was an opportunity to now do public policy in education.  So, I took it, and I commuted back and forth for over a year as his legislative aide on his Education Committee.
Story_ID: 72616
Speaker 1: And then he [Congressman Chaka Fattah, HM] decided to not, no longer be State Senator, he wanted to run for Congress.  So, he ran for Congress, and asked me if would be on his campaign organization.  I did that, and afterwards I knew I did not want to go to [Washington] D.C., so I stayed in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And the experience in Harrisburg [Pennsylvania]--where you get a chance to see someone have an idea, do the homework, get attorneys to craft the language, get supporters in with your colleagues, get a bill passed that becomes law--inspired me.  And that's really where I got the inspiration--or the inspiration is really what it was to run for elected office.  So I decided in '94' [1994] that I wanted to do that.  And in '95' [1995], I ran.  We ran a great campaign; we raised money, we got the necessary endorsements.  We, my training was grass roots campaigning--door to door, you know, at the transit stops, going to the churches, meeting with--the number one voter in this town are African-American females.  So, I went to all of the women's organizations.  And at the end of the day, we lost.  We lost by 1.6 votes per division, less than two votes per division.  So, when you lose, you have to do what I call is a gut check.  What you have to decide is--for me, the question was, "Do you really want to do public policy?  Do you really want to do public service in really a magnificent way?"  And I did, but I wanted to first become a mother.  (Laughter).  So, I became pregnant and we got, delivered a wonderful little girl [Brielle Autumn Brown].  And then after that, you know, the question re-emerges, because now I have a toddler.
Story_ID: 72617
Speaker 1: And I decided that I wanted to run again.  So, 1999, I ran with a three-year old.  And I had a wonderful support system with my husband [Howard Brown] and my mother [Sadie Reynolds].  I asked my aunt to move in with me, and the four of us managed to help raise her while I'm on the campaign trail.  And it's an incredibly tough thing, to be a candidate and to be the mother of a toddler.  But with a lot of support, we won in 1999.  And there were fifty-two candidates, seven of us were women.  Three of us were African-American women.  And at the end of the day, for the five Democratic slots, I was the only female that got through the gate, and ended up coming in number three of the five candidates that won.  So, it was tough, but we had a great team.  We raised now a couple of hundred thousand dollars, and won the nomination for City Council-at-Large.
Story_ID: 72618
Speaker 1: How many City Council members are there in--?
Speaker 2: In Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: And how many are selected?  I know that there are some represented wards and some--and there's another half, I guess, as many who are elected.
Speaker 2: At-large, that's exactly right.  There's seventeen of us.  Ten are district Councilmembers.  Seven are at-large Councilmembers.  And whatever the predominant majority party is--and this town it's the Democrats--five of those seven go to Democratic nominees, and two go to Republicans.  So, there are five Democratic at-large members and two Republican-at-large members.  And I am one of five, and the only woman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they've mandated by law that there have to be two Republicans?
Speaker 2: By city charters.
Speaker 1: As city charters, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh, yes.
Speaker 1: In Chicago [Illinois], they can all be Democrats.
Speaker 2: Is that right?
Speaker 1: Yes, and they are.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: How many?  Fifty Council members?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: But, you know, it may be... if the wards are smaller.  I don't know how they do it.
Speaker 2: How many of those are district?
Speaker 1: Well, there are fifty wards in the city.
Speaker 2: Okay, fifty wards.  So, there's a councilperson for each ward?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Unbelievable.
Speaker 1: And an alderman for each ward.
Speaker 2: Okay then.  Well, that's huge.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's huge.
Speaker 1: And all are Democrats.  But that's... you know, Philadelphia is similar in that the... that same Democratic preponderance of--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Is state government here largely Republican, or--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  The governor is Republican, and right now both the State Senate and the State House are Republican-controlled.  But in this upcoming election, we have the unique opportunity to--well, I'm fairly confident we are going to get a Democratic governor.  And the hope is that he will have coat-tails, and bring with him a number of Democratic State Representatives and a couple of State Senators, so either the House or the State Senate can become Republican--can be become Democratic--yes.  We're crossing our fingers and toes on that one.
Speaker 1: Is the split basically between the urban and rural?  Well, I know in Illinois the rural part of the state is largely Republican.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And the city of Chicago is Democrat.
Speaker 2: That's pretty much the analogy here.  I mean the--it mirrors the same way in Philadelphia as well--I mean, Pennsylvania as well; that is true.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interest--.
Story_ID: 72619
Speaker 1: Well, have you found it... has this been...  You've been around politics... electoral politics for a long time.
Speaker 2: Since 1983, yes.
Speaker 1: And being a City Councilperson, has that been what you thought it was going to be, in terms of what your expectations were?
Speaker 2: It's met all my expectations.  But there's been, there have been a lot of... it's been a steep learning curve.  And there's a lot of what you never see as a staff member of an elected official that you only see when you become an elected official.  I worked for two State Senators, and I learned a lot.  As a legislative aide, I learned that segment of working in an office.  And as director of Community Affairs, I learned community outreach, and what it means to reach to different constituencies to get them to support... and to work for them for your elected official.  And that was great training.  It was a wonderful foundation, because I know those two positions on my staff.  But there's still a level of learning and a level of awareness that you only get when you become an elected official; you can't learn it as a staff member.  And, but you only discover that once you're elected.  You have to be in the seat to get this additional breadth of knowledge, awareness, understanding and enlightenment, yes.
Story_ID: 72620
Speaker 1: So, would you think that the longer that you're here, the more you'll know?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  There are a number of areas of doing this job that you only get with tenure, you only get by being here.  And that has its merits.  You want to come here and not have to deal with the learning curve, but that's just the way it is.  You've got to be a freshman in college before you can be a senior.  And the same thing applies here.
Speaker 1: Now, I noticed when we came down the hall...  We're in Room 580.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right next door are the offices of Frank Rizzo--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --who's still a public servant here in the City of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Frank Rizzo, Jr., that's right.
Speaker 1: Oh, this is the junior, this is the--
Speaker 2: The son.
Speaker 1: --son of the former--
Speaker 2: Of the former Mayor, that's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: He still has a presence.
Speaker 1: We see a bronze statue of his father around--
Speaker 2: Across, right in front of the MSB, the Municipal Services Building.  Yes, of Frank Rizzo.  In many ways he's continuing his father's legacy of public service, except that he's a Republican, and I'm a Democrat.  So, we do have some philosophical differences.
Speaker 1: Right.  This is a--Philadelphia is an interesting place to, I guess to be a City Councilwoman.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It's always had an interesting political history.
Speaker 2: Yes, it has.  Some might say checkered, (Laughter) you know.
Speaker 1: Some might say.
Story_ID: 72621
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: What have been some of the biggest challenges you've had to face in City Council?  Now, your constituency is basically--?
Speaker 1: City-wide.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's city-wide in terms of responsibility and duty.  I would say with a lot of confidence, and happily, that African-American women are the number one voters in this town--have been for a number of years.  So, I pay particular attention to their needs and their interests and the like, because that's who I am, and I'm real clear that they helped me get here.  Education is something I care deeply about.  When I think about... it's the number issue facing America, facing states, and for sure, facing urban cities.  So that's been a big elephant to get my arm around here in the city.  Because we're going through education reform in a huge way here in the City of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  So, that's been a steep learning curve.  There's been a lot to learn about the Philadelphia Public School System.  The legislative process... I've relied on my legislative aide to help me with that, because there are some nuances that are different from working in the State Capitol.  But so, that's been a challenge.  I would say the biggest challenge is when...  I want to only focus on the merit--the rightness, or correctness of public policy.  I mean that's really what I enjoy.  I enjoy the debate and trying to figure out what's going to be, at the end of the day, the best for the people that we serve.  What I've had to learn is that oftentimes public policy is confused with politics.  And at times, you can't make public policy void of the politics.  So, alliances on City Council become important, because they help move your legislation through.  And so, that's been a surprise in some ways for me--that public policy oftentimes can't be pure, you know.
Story_ID: 72622
Speaker 1: Some things can't, don't always turn out exactly the way you think they ought to.  But they, but you've got to--
Speaker 2: You've got to figure out a way to negotiate in a way that you get ultimately what you want for that piece of legislation you care about.  I had a very personal example with that.  The first bill... actually, it was the second bill that I introduced... was a child care bill.  Quality child care is one of the areas I campaigned on, and I pledged to try to make a difference in that area.  And so, we put forth some legislation that had been tried before by three different Council people over the last twenty years, and each time it failed.  So, I put in the bill.  And of course, you've got to do your homework.  And I read testimony from when the legislation had been attempted in 1995, because I needed to know who, where the opposition was.  And I found out where the opposition was, and went and met with the opposition at their kitchen table in the Northeast section of Philadelphia.  And it was an important thing to do, because they needed to know that it wasn't about being against them, but trying to figure out a way to make life different for women who were taking care of little people in their homes and on their blocks.  And at the end of the day, the compromise was that that section of the city was exempted from the bill at the request of that District Councilperson.  So, ninety percent of the city said, "Yes, we will accept this bill," meaning the District Council people from those other sections of city saw that it was a good thing, recognized that it needed to happen. And that one section of the city, represented by that particular Councilperson, said "No, we don't want it."  And so, if I wanted to get the bill passed, I had to compromise.  And ninety percent versus zero, sort of speaks for itself.  And I decided to go with the ninety, and accept the ninety, and exempt that section of the city.  So, compromise is something that you have to be prepared and willing to work towards, you really do.
Speaker 1: It's part of statesmanship.
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.  Yes, it is, and to think long-term about the relationship that you have with members of Council.  And clearly, there are some issues where there is no, there is no gray; it really is black or white.  But there are other issues where if you work it through, you can figure out a way where it can be a win-win.  But you've got to be willing to work it through.  And that's what that experience taught me.
Story_ID: 72623
Speaker 1: Now, do you have--is it easy to convey the sense of what you have to do to your constituents?  Do they understand...?  Sometimes... I think sometimes people, you know, simplify a particular issue to the point where they put their representatives on the spot.  I mean, they think that they have sometimes more power than they have.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And sometimes they feel that something should passed in its purest form.
Speaker 2: Form.
Speaker 1: And if it's not, they're upset and they think that, you know...  I know one example I guess would be, you know, it would be some of the experiences that [W.] Wilson Goode [HM] had when he was the Mayor.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: People had an expectation, you know, that exceeded the power he actually had.
Speaker 2: The ability, exactly, the ability to get some things done.  I think that's absolutely true.  I think elected officials of color do get the added responsibility.  And I think we should take it willingly, or else we shouldn't offer to accept the job.  There is an added level of responsibility and expectation.  And so, my response to that is on us as elected officials to educate and inform our constituency on what's possible, what's not possible, and why.  And that does take some extra work.  Because even with that child care bill I was working with, I actually pulled together a coalition of child care advocates, because I knew I couldn't get it done by myself.  And every single step of the way, I had to update them and keep them informed about what I was doing, and why.  Were they overjoyed with the fact that I compromised with that ten percent that didn't get in?  They weren't happy about it, but I helped them understand the alternative.  The alternative was we would get nothing passed if I didn't agree to accept the ninety percent.  So, yes, it is tough; it does require more work.  But I think you've got to do the work, and just keep your constituency informed.  Now, that was one small constituency of child care workers.  You get to, to broader issues, then it's more work and it takes more money.  But if we're serious our work, and if we're serious about wanting to help those who are interested in public policy--what that means in terms of process--then we need to do that.  And I pull on my teaching experience when it comes to that kind of thing.  I don't speak to any group without handouts.  I just don't do it.  Wherever I go, I take a handout, and I say to my audience, "Forgive me for putting my teacher hat on.  But as a teacher, you always give your audience some talking points."  And so, that's part of the teaching and the educating, and then informing your constituents about where you are and why you are at a certain position on an issue.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's very important, yeah.
Speaker 2: I find it incredibly important.
Story_ID: 72624
Speaker 1: Now, what's been your greatest triumph, or the thing you're the most proud of that you've been able to accomplish in City Council?
Speaker 2: I think first, getting here.  Because I was up against some tremendous odds. Fifty-two people in a race for five seats.  And three of those fifty-two were incumbents.  And historically, in this town incumbents always return.  So, we're talking about two slots--fifty-two individuals, two slots.  So, the triumph was mounting a strong organizational campaign to get the job done.  Because I'd already been through it once, and had a pretty good sense of what was required--a raise in the amount of dollars that we did--over two hundred thousand dollars.  Some of the opponents were actually party officials, Democratic Party officials, and I ran without the support of the Philadelphia City Democratic Party.  So, the triumph of beating those odds and getting here was wonderful, and I believe a great triumph for African-American women.  Because in some ways, they are represented by me being at that table of seventeen.
Story_ID: 72625
Speaker 1: Since I've been here, it's been great for me to just honor my campaign pledge.  The clearest, exciting, triumph for me after getting here--my first year here, all of the discussion at any level in the city was in stadiums.  Stadiums had to be built in Philadelphia--multi-million dollar capital investment.  And I agreed that stadiums needed to be built.  But I was more interested in what was going to be in it for children and youth.
Speaker 2: Okay.  These stadiums, I take it, were not the top agenda items for African-American women?
Speaker 1: Not at all. (Laughter).  Not at all.  Let's talk about fixing up these rec centers, so our children and youth have someplace to play.  And you know, that--reality being what it is--that reality was that at the end of the day there were going to be stadiums built, because the state had made its investment... had given up the $300 million it was going to give up.  And therefore, the city was obligated.  So we had to, at the end of the day, call for legislation that would be in the best interests of the taxpayers and the citizens of this city.  And so, I did a lot of homework, and discovered that San Francisco [California] was the only city in the nation that as a result of stadium negotiations, got out of it a children's fund, where one dollar per ticket goes into a children's fund for kids in San Francisco.  And I liked that idea.  So, I thought, "What can we do to get some facsimile of that in the City of Philadelphia?"  And I began to meet with church and youth advocates--the members--the team leaders, you know, the team owners, the team lawyers, the team lobbyists--met with the Mayor, and opted not to introduce a bill because that would have complicated the stadium process.  But under the radar screen, met with them over six months, back and forth, letters and phone calls.  And all of that's required to, you know, get something done.  And at the--and the Mayor was my spokesperson at that table.  He knew what my interest was, and that was to get something in that stadium legislation for kids.  And we couldn't get one dollar per ticket; because they wanted to do something, but they didn't want to do that.  They felt that that was too expensive.
Story_ID: 72626
Speaker 1: So at the end of the day, we were able to negotiate one $1 million dollars per team per year for the next thirty years to go into a children's fund for children in this city.  And that, for me, was a triumph.  Out of that multi-million deal, you know, to support major expensive ballplayers, we were able to get $60 million for children and youth in this city.  And all those dollars must be spent on after school programs, arts and culture programs, parent education workshop programs--strictly for children and youth.  And for me, that was a triumph.  It took a lot of work; it took a lot of back and forth--and that's okay, I don't have a problem with that; a lot of meetings, and a lot of the review of language, review of text, because they wanted to make sure it was just right for the legislation.  But at the end of the day, that was a part of the legislation that we would get... that we will get.  So, when those doors open next year, 2003, $1 million will be donated by the Philadelphia Eagles, and $1 million will be donated by the Philadelphia Phillies, going into the Philadelphia Foundation.  And those dollars will be distributed to arts and culture and after school programs--children and youth programs across the city.  It's a wonderful accomplishment.
Speaker 2: It is, that is.
Off-Camera: Tape change.
Speaker 2: What about the 76'ers?  They already had... have...
Speaker 1: They had their, their stadium.  So, they were not a part of, a part of this new deal, stadium deal package.
Speaker 2: Alright.
Story_ID: 72627
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you don't have any...you don't have a lot of specific neighborhood issues that people come to you with?
Speaker 2: No, no, I do not.  That's one of the, for me it's one of the beauties of being an at-large Councilperson, because I like public policy; that's why I wanted to do this.  And as an at-large member it's, you're, there's greater opportunity to focus on broad public policy issues and the like.  Now, that's not to say that District Councilpersons don't do that, because they do.  District Councilpersons, however, also have the important responsibility of focusing on neighborhood matters--zoning, and the like.  But as an at-large person, I stay out of zoning matters, quite frankly, and I'm able to--and really like focusing on broad-based public policy matters.
Story_ID: 72628
Speaker 1: Now, you're Chair, I think of the Cultural Committee--
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: --for the City Council?
Speaker 2: That's exactly correct.  President Verner appointed me Chair of the Committee on Recreation, Parks, and Cultural Affairs, that's right.
Speaker 1: And you are very much committed to the arts in the life of the people in the city of Philadelphia.  Tell me about some of the initiatives that you've supported, and why you're so committed to the arts.  I mean there's an argument, you know, that people make, you know in cities.  I mean, there's a dialogue between those who say you need more stadiums and, you know, less... you know... why you need the support of arts--why can't they support themselves?  And aren't they going to do something obscene or something built around money, that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But those who don't see the, those who don't see the beauty and value of arts and culture need to be enlightened; that's my editorial comment.  But yes, I am Chair of that committee.  And I really give credit to President Verner for appointing me to that.  Because it really is an outgrowth of a lot of where I come from.
Story_ID: 72629
Speaker 1: I, as I said, I got introduced to dance late in life at the, you know, tender age of sixteen.  But that's late for anyone who's interested in the performing arts.  And, but never lost the drive or passion for it, and went on to do that in college.  And then when I came out of college [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania], came back home, heard about the Philadelphia Dance Company, which was then the fourth largest African-American performing arts company in the country.  Went to a dance class, and was invited to audition... audition for the company, and made the company.  Green.  And that for me was the ultimate, to be now a member of a professional dance company and able to do what I always wanted to do.  So, while I was busy getting my real career on line, I got a chance to do dance and study all the art forms, perform in major cities across the country, and loved and lived my life as a dancer, from sun-up--when I wasn't in the classroom teaching, or in my regular job where I worked with young people, I was in the dance studio.  And I did that for many, many, many, many years.  And when the performance part of that ended, I...the...
Story_ID: 72630
Speaker 1: I guess the final chapter of the performance part of dance happened when a bunch of us decided to go to Atlantic City--decided to go to New York to audition for a show that was opening up in Atlantic City [New Jersey]. About five of us from the Philadelphia Dance Company.
Speaker 2: What was this show?
Speaker 1: The show was called "Hello, Broadway," back in 1980, '81' [1981].  So, a bunch of us decided to take, you know, take the leap.  And still members of the dance company and went up to New York City and auditioned, and some of us made it, and some of us didn't.  I didn't make it, because I wasn't tall enough.  They wanted dancers who were 5'6.  So, I, you know, came back to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] a bit wounded.  But then a girlfriend called me and said, "Blondell, all of the dancers didn't show up, and you should come back down and audition again."  So I went back down, though I was 5'3, and they were looking for dancers who were 5'6.  But I wore three inch pumps.  So, now, I met the criteria and (laughter) I could already dance.  So, I got the job, and lived my life.  I mean for that year and a half, that's how I paid my bills--dancing in "Hello Broadway" in Atlantic City.  So, when that, that short life ended, I started teaching, and taught all the way up until I ran for elected office--teaching dance to children of all ages, from six to seventeen.
Story_ID: 72631
Speaker 1: And so, with the interest and love of dance, and having served on the Board of Directors of the Philadelphia Dance Company, President Verner appointed me Chair of Recreation, Parks, and Cultural Affairs.  So, now, I get a chance to do public policy as it relates to dance.  And since I've been here, the city was challenged by one of its real estate developers on what we have... what we call the "One Percent for Art" program.  And what that is, is a city regulation where any developer who wants to build anything of any kind in this city, and is receiving any level of city dollars, city support, must devote one percent of that budget to art.  And recently, there was a developer in the city who, who in his own way wanted to challenge that.  We had to remind him that that is a city regulation, and we expect him to honor it, especially if he's receiving city support.  So, our "One Percent for Art" program works, because there's art all over the city.  Philadelphia is number one in the city for city murals, art murals.  In 1980 under the leadership of W. Wilson Goode [HM], he was sick and tired of the graffiti.  So, he actually put an agency in government called "The Philadelphia Anti-Graffiti Network," and I was one of his first board members.  And from then to now, there are well over two thousand murals in the city of Philadelphia... very little, very little graffiti anywhere.  But it's an outgrowth of the leadership of W. Wilson Goode, who decided to take those graffiti artists, many of which were aspiring... doing it... artists themselves--and put them in workshops and taught them the skills of fine art.  And now, we see some of their murals all around the city.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I see them everywhere.
Speaker 1: They're everywhere.
Speaker 2: Downtown and (unclear)(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) We're the number one city in the country.  And city and recreation departments from other cities--city leaders from other rec departments from other cities in the country--come here to find out and learn how we do it.  But we are the leader in that area.
Story_ID: 72632
Speaker 1: So, the other thing I've been able to get done as Chair of that committee is, for the past five years, the funding for the city's cultural fund which is the number one funding agency in the city, has been at like $1.5 million.  So, we crafted a strategy to get an increase in that fund.  And in early spring, the mayor of our city, Mayor John F. Street, increased that fund by $250,000 for the first time in close to eight years.  So, that took a bit of work--you know, talking with the right people; lobbying with the right leaders in government.  And at the end of the day, the Mayor increased the cultural fund by $250,000.  So, we still have some other work we want get done in the cultural community.  But the cultural community is the leading component for the tourist industry in our city.  And to the extent that you have a vibrant arts and cultural network, or some culture community, it attracts tourism.  And there is a link, a strong economic link, to arts and culture; it's important for cities to have that dimension in government.  And we have that in a great way here in the City of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: In Chicago [Illinois], I know the Illinois Arts Alliance published statistics that demonstrated that more people actually attend the museums and the ballet, and the opera, and the other cultural events than sports teams.
Speaker 1: Than sports teams.
Speaker 2: Than sports teams, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's a fact.
Speaker 2: But most cities don't realize that, for some reason.
Speaker 1: And espouse them and promote that, absolutely.  And that fact... we were reminded of that fact during the stadium negotiations.
Speaker 2: Right.  It's a different world than what people suspect, yeah.
Speaker 1: Are led to believe, that's exactly right; that's exactly right.  And for children, I sponsored a resolution on the value of arts education here in the city.  And again, as a result of our work, arts education programs are now a bona fide program activity for our after-school programs.  In other words, if you're an arts and culture institution and you want to provide arts education, you can apply for after-school program dollars.  Before we got here, people didn't see the connect.  But arts education can be a great option for young people after school--music classes and art classes--you know, and mural classes after school.  And so, as a result of our work, now arts education can--is a part of one of those areas that can be funded in the city's after-school programs.  And we're excited about that--that we were about to make the case and make the defense for that, and now it's an option that people have available to them for after-school programming.
Story_ID: 72633
Speaker 1: Just, this is kind of--well it's not that unusual.  But could you kind of describe some of the rich culture that Philadelphia offers.  I mean there's so many... since I've been here we talked to Kenny Gamble [HM] and others.  And Philadelphia is so rich in terms of its cultural--
Speaker 2: It's a quiet kept secret, we would like to think.  You know, the sound of Philadelphia was born right here in Philly with Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff [HM].  And Kenny Gamble has taken his wealth, and he is really building a neighborhood.  I mean in a magnificent way, in every... in housing, education, arts and culture.  He's just taken a segment of our city and is bringing it back to life.  And we are, we're really so happy that he, he's decided to stay here and turn his fortune into, you know, real tangible kinds of benefits for the people there in South Philadelphia.  We had the Philadelphia Dance Company, which is now the third largest, and is now an international dance company.  It travels all over the world giving rave reviews.  It goes to New York and sells out every year at the George Theater in New York City [New York].  So, it is one of our diamonds here in the city.  And of course, we have the world renowned Philadelphia Art Museum, and the first zoo of our country, the Philadelphia Zoo, right there in West Philadelphia. Philadelphia enjoys its only African-American theater arts production company, the Freedom Theater, founded by Johnny Allen over twenty-five, close to thirty years ago.  And from what I understand, it is one of the few on the East Coast that is still thriving and providing a theater experience for young people aged five to fifty, right here in Philadelphia.  There are, we have the West Philadelphia Cultural Alliance which is in the business...  In fact, they brought the Paul Robeson Cultural House back to life.  They took his residence there in West Philadelphia and have completely refurbished it.  And now, that's becoming a museum and library for the life of Paul Robeson, right here in Philadelphia.  John Coltrane in North Philadelphia, right out of North Philadelphia.  And we know his work and his contribution to jazz.  But he, too, right here out of Philadelphia.  Chubby Checker who, again, from Philadelphia, where it's rich with personalities old and...  I mean, the Boys II Men, right here out of Philly.  So, we have Will Smith, right out of West Philadelphia, who is just a, you know, a wonderful example of a boy from the neighborhood who still remembers West Philadelphia Overbrook High School; a wonderful example for young people here in our city.  So we're rich with talent, and opportunities as well, for people who care and love arts and culture.  And we've been fortunate, in that on the government side, we've had elected leadership that understands the value of arts and culture.  Philadelphia is now home of the Kimmel Center, the largest performing theater opera house on the East Coast, state-of-the-art.  I mean it has a theater that can convert and remove the seats by way of a motor and make it into a ballroom.  It has three large performing art spaces in there.  It's state-of-the-art.  It is shaped like a violin.  The architect was both violinists and an architect.  So, what a wonderful combination.  And it's called the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts.  It's our newest cultural treasure for the region, and can stack up to Carnegie Hall or the Kennedy Center any day of the week.
Story_ID: 72634
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there anything else about... that you want to discuss in terms of City Council and your activities in the community?
Speaker 2: I would like to share with you a major signature event that I do every year.  Oftentimes, I get a chance or I get the opportunity to be invited to speak about women in politics.  And so, I talk about the challenges that come being a working mother and an elected official.  But I also like to talk about the opportunities.  And one of the opportunities is that you get a chance to put some issues on the table that ordinarily might not get a hearing, be it not for... were it not for a woman.  And I get a chance to salute women who are doing extraordinary things.  So, every year since I've been here, we've started my signature event, which is called "Women Making a Difference," where each year I identify four women from across the cultural divide who are doing--ordinary women who are doing extraordinary things.  And we have a major luncheon, and all the proceeds from that event go to support arts and culture and children and youth organizations.  So, we're now into our third year.  We've had to actually move out of the Rittenhouse Hotel, because we maxed out our space over there.  And that's a good thing, because it's growing.  And this year we had to take it to a larger venue down on the waterfront, to the Hyatt Hotel.  I like it a lot, because these are women who are unsung heroes, but each in their own field of endeavor doing wonderful things.  This year we saluted one woman, Dr. Loretta Sweet Jemmott, who is a professor at Penn [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania], but the leading AIDS [Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome] researcher in the country.  She is going to open up an AIDS prevention center in South Africa.  And I think that's just so extraordinary, that's she taken this issue and is doing a lot of research in terms of abstinence and sex education with Philadelphia young people.  She's gotten a major multi-million dollar grant from the Institute of Health.  And so, she's doing that research.  But her focus, her expertise, or her passion is finding out how we're going to control AIDS, the AIDS epidemic in our country and also in South Africa.  And she's an example of the type of women who we strive to salute every year.  I identify five of all cultural persuasions.  And women from across the city come to hear how they can be inspired, you know, in the worlds that they live.
Story_ID: 72635
Speaker 1: Now, what are your hopes and concerns for the African-American community?
Speaker 2: My biggest concern rests with our children and youth.  It is, it's worrisome when I think about we still have so much to do with regards to making sure that young people are adequately equipped and prepared for tomorrow.  And one way I try to work with that is, in November and December of every year we have a "Warmth and Winter Drive," where we collect new hats, gloves, scarves and mittens for homeless children.  And we make sure... there are over two thousand homeless children in shelters in this city, if you can believe that--you know, two thousand children who have no home.  And you know, that's a startling number, but it's a woeful reminder of how much work we still have to do.  So, we make a contribution and try to make a difference that way, by collecting warm garments for them and distribute them to the twenty-five shelters around the city.  So, that's one example of the reminder that we still have so much work to do in trying to make, you know, the world of children and youth who didn't ask to come here--and many of whom are in a circumstance they didn't create--and try to make their life better.  And that's exacerbated when you think of the education, and how important that is, and how so many of our children are not meeting the grade in our city.  And how, you know, elected leadership, you know, just doesn't get it when it comes to equal funding and making funding fair for school districts around the state, and most specifically for Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  So, that concerns me, it's worrisome.  But it's also fuel for why I chose to do this job, making life better for kids.  That's really where my passion is.
Story_ID: 72636
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I know you are still young and have a lot to do.  But as you look--
Speaker 2: That's a compliment, I'll take it.
Speaker 1: As you look back over what you've done, over the body of work that you've already been able to accomplish--what do you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I would like to think I haven't gotten it all done yet.  Because I still have a real interest to write children's books.  I just haven't found the time yet, because I'm trying to raise a little girl [Brielle Autumn Brown] to be spiritually anchored, smart and nice, and culturally aware.  And so, my legacy I hope to leave to her is that she had a mother who tried to make a difference; who at times sacrificed time with her to do what I do.  And I always get filled when I talk about her... because it is a sacrifice.  And my hope is that she'll understand that at the end of the day, in making life better for her peers that I was trying to make life better for her, too.  So, after I get these books done--and that's a little ways down the line--because I've got to raise her first--I hope she'll understand that I tried to make a difference.
Story_ID: 72637
Speaker 1: Are you...can you... have you written any yet?
Speaker 2: I started a couple, (laughter) but I haven't been able to get them done.  I even tried to do taping--you know, you're in your car and you're taping.  But I can't, you know, do that and attend to her [Brielle Autumn Brown, daughter], because she has needs and she wants to do things.  You know, I've got her in dance class, I've got her taking music classes.  And now's she's talking about track, but we'll wait and, you know, see if that's really what she wants to do.
Speaker 1: And she's six years old?
Speaker 2: And she's just six years old.  So, so I can't...  I'm just not able to focus on... get it done.  Because I started it twice, and I got, you know, the written transcript and manuscript at home.  And I don't talk about it a lot, because, because, because then you're not taken seriously.  But it is a goal that I have, and I'm a goal setter.  So, once she's well on her way and well-anchored in terms of her education, I might be able to, you know, burn the midnight oil and get that done.  Because you know, I've talked to a publisher, I got my illustrator.  Up here... I've even spoken with him as an artist here in the city.  But I haven't been able to pull it all together.
Speaker 1: There's so many of the great artist of children's books--
Speaker 2: It really, really is--
Speaker 1: --is right here in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: --that are doing it right now.
Speaker 1: Jerry Pinkney and his son--
Speaker 2: I'm not familiar with him.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Is that right?
Speaker 1: You've got Tom--well, I shouldn't try to get into all of them.
Speaker 2: Tom McKinney?
Speaker 1: Well, that's one I didn't know about.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but it's--
Speaker 1: I was thinking about--
Speaker 2: Philadelphia is--
Speaker 1: I was thinking of Tom Heelings--(ph.)
Speaker 2: Also from Philadelphia?
Speaker 1: He's here, yeah, he lives here.
Speaker 2: Well, okay.  I need to get their names.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  There are so many good ones here.  You know, seems like it would be the perfect place, to do that.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I want to get that done, I'm just not able... able to right now.  And that, that's a burning passion the way I wanted to teach was a burning passion, and the way I wanted to...  When I made the decision to do public office, it became a, you know, a burning passion.  And that's one I haven't been able to fulfill yet.  So, when I get that done, then I will feel like I'm really leaving my daughter a legacy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I'm not there yet.  So, I'm prayerful that the Lord will continue to bless me with good health, you know, to see her grow up and become a contributor herself--you know, to set her sights on something where at the end of the day, whatever it is, and whatever profession--because I'm not persuaded that, you know, that politics is the only arena where you can make a difference; but that she will be committed and understand what that means to, you know, to have the drive and the gumption--that's a word from my mother [Sadie Reynolds]--and the gumption to do whatever's required to get it, to get it done.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 72638
Speaker 1: Now, speaking of your mother [Sadie Reynolds]--I mean, how has she felt about your success?  Is she proud?  Does she think that you've gone far enough yet?  Or does she... you know, well, how does she feel?
Speaker 2: I think she has mixed feelings about it.  She is a little awe struck at why I want to do this, because she sees how demanding it is.  But she's proud of me in that I was able to get it done.  And you know, whenever, you know, I have to go speak she says, "What are you speaking about this time?"  (Laughter).  That's the question.  And the mixed blessing, or the mixed feelings, comes from she doesn't want me to shortchange my daughter [Brielle Autumn Brown], you know.  Her--and for that matter, her granddaughter, one of twelve, you know.  So, her view of this has been mixed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 72639
Speaker 1: This is a slightly different question.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: But, this is also premature in a sense.  But how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  Well... boy, that's... you know, that's...  When you think about Martin Luther King [Jr.] and what he said...  I would like to be remembered as a woman who, who didn't back down from a challenge; who was prepared to always roll up my sleeve; who really understood what gumption meant, because that's the word we heard when we were coming up as kids, "You must have gumption..." and did her best... in spite of my circumstance to...  I am so committed to raising a daughter who becomes a young lady who gives back.  And in today's world, that's not easy.  Because you can do everything right, and there's no guarantee that you will end up with the quality individual that you want in a daughter or a son.  So, I, it's important to me that folks know that I gave my best to get that part right--you know, to raise a daughter [Brielle Autumn Brown] who, as I said... is spiritually anchored, smart, culturally aware, and knows what it means to be more than about self.  You know what I'm saying?  So, that's what I hope my legacy would be.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: You're welcome, you're welcome.  That's a powerful question.
Speaker 1: It was a powerful answer.
(VIDEOGRAPHER):  That's the finisher!

Speaker 1: This is the former First Lady, Hillary Clinton, now U.S. Senator, Hillary Clinton, with me and a number of other persons during the year of 2000 when she was coming to help us try to get the then Democratic nominee for President, Al Gore, elected.
Speaker 2: And where's the location?
Speaker 1: The location was City Hall, Mayor's Reception Room downstairs.
Speaker 2: In Philadelphia?
Speaker 1: In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, next one, and describe it for me.
Speaker 1: Surely.  I am one of seven siblings, the oldest of six girls and a brother.  This is all of my sisters--my sister, Cynthia, Angelina, Alicia, myself, Blondell, Yvonne, and Pandora.  This was a family picnic at the--
Speaker 2: From left to right?
Speaker 1: From left to right, Cynthia, Angelina, Alicia, Blondell, Yvonne and Pandora.  And this is at a family birthday party for my sister Pandora's first daughter, and the first grandchild of the family, Candace.
Speaker 2: Okay, next one.
Speaker 1: Surely.  The anchor for my life, and my hero, is my mother, Sadie Reynolds.  And here we are attending a banquet when she came to see me receive an award from the Fattah political organization in the late eighties--1988, 1989 at a banquet in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 2: And what's the award?
Speaker 1: What's the award?
Speaker 2: Yeah, do you remember what it is?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's up there.
Speaker 2: The blue one on the wall?
Speaker 1: Yes, uh-huh.  In recognition of my--
Speaker 2: It was the Fattah Organization?
Speaker 1: Yes, the Fattah organization, which is the political organization I'm a member of, gave me that award for my fundraising... exemplary fundraising efforts on behalf of the Fattah organization.
Speaker 2: Alright, next.
Speaker 1: I was taught early that books are important.  And at the neighborhood Boys and Girls Club, I spent all my time in the library.  And this is me at age seven or eight probably in, my gosh, the 1960's at the Boys and Girls Club in the Mantra West Philadelphia section of Philadelphia.  And I'm sitting here with my counselor, whose name I don't remember.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Once again, how old were you?
Speaker 1: I was eight years old.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Describe that for me.
Speaker 2: This is on the occasion of my youngest sister, who's sitting in the middle.  She's graduating, the last sister to graduate from college, Drexel University.  And the request of my mother was that all of us get our caps from our college graduations and take a photo to capture that moment.  Because her only expectation was that we all go to college and graduate.  And Alicia, the youngest one in the middle, seated, this was on the occasion of her graduation from Drexel University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] which was 1985, ten years after I came out of college.
Speaker 1: Can you name the people on the, the front three?
Speaker 2: Surely.  The youngest one is in the middle, Alicia Reynolds.  And going counter... going clockwise it would Angelina Graston, myself, Blondell Reynolds Brown, Cynthia Reynolds, our sister who is now no longer with us, my brother, Angelo Reynolds, also known as the Tiger Woods of the Mercantile Exchange in Chicago, Pennsylvania, Pandora Woods and Yvonne Reynolds.
Speaker 1: He's the Tiger Woods of the Mercantile Exchange?
Speaker 2: Making money.
Speaker 1: Is he? (Laughter).

Speaker 1: My high school experience was a good one, and really gave me some wonderful foundation.  And this picture reflects a dear friend I met in ninth grade, and we're still friends today.  We went through high school [Philadelphia High School for Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] together and college [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania], and remain very, very, good friends today.  This is the celebration of our 20th anniversary celebration, which was in 1995.  As you can see, I was very, very, very, pregnant.  I'd just lost my election.  I was very pregnant, and looking forward to becoming a mother.
Speaker 2: And her name?
Speaker 1: I am seated here with Janice Thomas.
Speaker 2: Okay, next photo.
Speaker 1: I love dance, and this is me... it captures a dance performance.  And the photographer overlaid it with my profile.  This picture was taken at the height of my dance career in the late 1970's with the Philadelphia Dance Company.  I was a part of a spiritual number, performing with the Philadelphia Dance Company at a concert.
Speaker 2: Alright.
Speaker 1: This is on the occasion of the 25th Anniversary of the Philadelphia Company, when all of the dancers who were still able to, were invited to come back and perform.  And this is at one, a major concert held at the Annenberg Center... Annenberg Theater there at the University of Pennsylvania during the 25th Anniversary Celebration of the Philadelphia Dance Company.
Speaker 2: Are you the lady in the purple?
Speaker 1: I'm dressed in purple, my favorite color... which would be in the foreground.
Speaker 2: Okay.  It is hard to tell you from the others.
Speaker 1: Here I am standing with Joan Myers Brown in the middle, who's the founder and executive director of the Philadelphia Dance Company, and Sheryl Lee Ralph, who we know is currently on Broadway.  And I'm going to get shot... I don't remember what show she's in... I'm going to get shot.  But Joan Myers Brown was recently celebrated as one of the extraordinary women of the city of Philadelphia this past May, 2002.  And I was asked to present the award to Joan Myers Brown, as a former member of the Philadelphia Dance Company.  And Sheryl Lee Ralph was in the audience, and decided to come up and share with me giving Miss Brown that award.  Because Sheryl, also a former dancer, a current dancer on Broadway, knows of Joan Myers Brown's contributions to the arts.
Speaker 2: This is Sheryl on the left?
Speaker 1: Sheryl Lee Ralph is on the left, in the orange.
Speaker 2: Next photograph.
Speaker 1: Blondell... I was still Blondell Reynolds then, in my career while working at the Pennsylvania State University.  That picture was taken late 1980's when I worked for Penn State as the Director of the Philadelphia Recruitment Center, and Director of Admissions for Philadelphia, for my alma mater, Penn State University [State College, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: And the next photograph, and describe it for us.
Speaker 2: This is a picture during my career stop as the legislative aide for the then State Senator, Chaka Fattah [HM], who's seated to the left of the former Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Bob Casey.  And here we are seated because of the signing of a major education bill--on the occasion of the signing of that bill.
Speaker 1: And the year that it was taken?
Speaker 2: And the year, that was 1992... 1992.  And I'm dressed in the blue and white.
Speaker 1: Next photo.
Speaker 2: Can we do that one up there?  This is a picture of me as one of the members of the Fattah political organization at our 1981 treaty at Lock Haven University [of Pennsylvania, Lock Haven, Pennsylvania], where we went to sort of chart out our career political agenda for the next decade.  And I was then serving as the fundraising point person for the Fattah political organization.  The now Congressman Fattah is to the extreme right.  And the now State Senator, Chaka Fattah, then State Representative and now Congressman Fattah--who sits on the Education Committee and is a new member of the Congressional Appropriation, Democratic Appropriations Committee--is to the extreme right.  To the extreme left is the now State Senator Vincent Hughes, dressed in all black, to the extreme left.

Speaker 1: There she is.
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: I didn't recognize you.  I looked and I said, where is she?
Speaker 2: That's me.

Speaker 2: No, I have not.  Chaka Fattah is spelled C-H-A-K-A; Fattah, F-A-T-T-A-H.

I took her to work with me shortly after I went back to work in fall of 1996.  I was then working for State Senator Vincent Hughes.  I was sitting at my desk talking on the phone and feeding her.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Alright.
Speaker 1: This is the campaign poster from 1995 when I first ran for Philadelphia City Council as a Democrat running for City Council-at-large.  And again, that was fall 1995.
Speaker 2: And this one?

Speaker 1: This is Blondell Reynolds Brown standing at the Liberty Bell in Downtown, historic section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on the occasion of women and choice, supporting Vice President Candidate Al Gore for president.
Speaker 2: Is that just a jacket?
Speaker 1: Actually it was a judge robe.
Speaker 2: That's what I thought it looked like (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. They just give you a judge robe for this occasion?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. They wanted to raise the awareness of the fact that choice was really in question if Bush [President George W. Bush] got elected, you know? So they did a national publication on choice. They had some elected officials from around the country speak up.
Speaker 1: That's your intense look.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. That's why you wanna (unclear) serious. Okay.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) to happy to be (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Laughter). Happy as he can be. He's a lead anchor down here, news anchor.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Happy as he can be.
Speaker 1: And describe this for me?
Speaker 2: This is Congressman Chaka Fattah [HM], founder of the Fattah Organization, and my husband, Howard Brown, on the occasion of a Fattah fundraiser that was being hosted by my husband and me. Raising dollars for him in his pursuit for Congress, of which he ultimately won that seat. And now sits on the appropriations committee, and is a rising star in the United States House of Representatives.
Speaker 1: How did he get his African name?
Speaker 2: His mother is Sister Falaka Fattah, who back in the '60s [1960s] helped curb gang war here in the city. So I don't remember her name, but she changed her name to Fattah, and he and all of his brothers have Fattah as their last name. Yeah. And Chaka has a special meaning in African, I can't remember what.
Speaker 1: Oh, Chaka.
Speaker 2: Chaka.
Speaker 1: I remember Chaka Zulu.
Speaker 2: This is on the occasion of the former President Bill Clinton visiting our city. Mayor John F. Street did a fundraiser for him and invited anyone who wanted to come pay the tab. And, as a new member of City Council, was able to attend. So this is a reception being held for former President Bill Clinton in the Mayor's reception room, here in City Hall, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He could have easily been elected another time.
Speaker 1: He could, yeah. That's why Gore's decision...he should have gotten as close to him as he possibly could.
Speaker 2: Somebody gave him bad advice.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) spiced his image up a little bit.
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: But I think he, coming from that Bible Belt and all that, felt stigmatized by the, you know, Clinton's affair and all that.
Speaker 2: (Off-Camera Discussion)
Speaker 1: This is...I was Director of Community Affairs for Philadelphia OIC. And at that time, the first African-American mayor of our city, Mayor W. Wilson Goode [HM], was our keynote speaker.

Speaker 2: About what year is this?
Speaker 1: This is year 1983. Shortly after I stopped dancing professionally. 1983.
