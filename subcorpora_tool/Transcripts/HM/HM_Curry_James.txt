Speaker 1: Good morning.
Speaker 2: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm the interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please give us your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 1: My name is James Howard Curry.  J-A-M-E-S, H-O-W-A-R-D, C-U-R-R-Y.
Speaker 2: Sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: Date of birth is 7/24/48, and my place of birth was Oakland, California.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Sir, what is your title and occupation?
Speaker 1: Wow.  Official title is Professor of Applied Math at the University of Colorado, Boulder.  My current position is Program Director, Division of Math Sciences at the National Science Foundation [NSF].
Speaker 2: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 1: Oh, gosh.  1/16/2013.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 1: Burlington, Virginia, just outside of Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia].
Speaker 2: Okay.  At the National Science Foundation.
Speaker 1: At the National Science Foundation facility.
Story_ID: 25576
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we ask as a warm-up, I guess.  And they only require a short answer, okay?  So, if you're ready--
Speaker 2: (laughter).  Let's see if I can give short answers to questions.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Good.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I love to eat, but I don't have a favorite food.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: I never thought about that.
Speaker 1: A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Oh, I know I don't like winter in Colorado when it gets to be five degrees below zero.  But aside from that, it's okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Ah, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, I like very much.
Speaker 1: Okay.  For scientific--
Speaker 2: Well, it's a very relaxing place.  I mean, you can sit the water and you can watch the boats on the water, and you can just sort of let your brain go.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: "Do more math."
Story_ID: 25577
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll keep them separate so that we don't get them mixed up.  So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Henrie Mai Curry, H-E-N-R-I-E, Mai Curry.
Speaker 1: M-A-Y or M-A-E?
Speaker 2: M-A-I, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  M-A-I?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  What was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Her maiden name was Andrews.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Let me say Brookshire, Texas, 1916.
Speaker 1: Now--in 1916.  Is a story behind her name?  That's an interesting name, Henrie Mai, and the spelling.
Speaker 2: She told the story that everybody had told her parents that it was going to be a boy.  And they had already decided on the name, H-E-N-R-Y.  And guess what?   "Hi, I'm a girl."  (laughter).  And so, she said that at some point she decided she was going to be Henrie, and she was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them, and what were they doing in Texas?
Speaker 2: Well, I know a little bit about my grandmother and a little bit about my grandfather.  My grandfather's name was Abe.  My grandmother's name I believe was Elizabeth.  And they were born slaves.  They were freed with Emancipation, and after freedom they lived in and around Brookshire and they were sharecroppers.  I believe my mother had eleven or twelve brothers and sisters.  I don't know very much about that part of the family.  And at some point she decided that being a sharecropper was not what she wanted to do, and she wanted to do more.  She wanted to become more educated.
Speaker 1: Let me go back a little bit, because I'm concerned that the dates might not match up.
Speaker 2: They may not.
Speaker 1: With your grandparents being born in slavery, I don't know.  Were your great-grandparents born during slavery?
Speaker 2: I believe my grandparents were born in slavery.  My mother was certainly free.
Speaker 1: She was born in 1916?
Speaker 2: She was born in 1916.
Speaker 1: 16--, say, if one of your parents was born during slavery, the latest they could have been born was about 1865.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That would have left what, thirty-five more years?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then 1916--that puts it pretty late for a woman to have a baby.  That's my concern, that she was born--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I believe my mother may have been the second to the last, or something like that.  But everything is vague there.  The thing that I found most amazing was my parents didn't talk about their history.  But I'll come to that later on.  All of that is sort of very, very murky.  It wasn't important.
Speaker 1: But there's another aspect to this, too, that a lot of people didn't know slavery was over, and perceived it as you do, because they didn't get the information.  It wasn't like you turned on CNN and find out--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  You're right.
Speaker 1: There were stories even in, I remember as a kid, in Jet Magazine and people just finding out in the '60s [1960s] that slavery was over.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.
Speaker 1: Which seems bizarre, of course, and it probably is, because--
Speaker 2: Bizarre today, but I do know that there was freedom.  There was movement, and the movement led to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that isolation then--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --may have been a prolonged period where they thought they were still in slavery.
Speaker 2: You're right.  I think the comment you made is insightful, because right now we're sort of data dense, increasingly so.  We have our cell phones, we have everything--computers, web access, Google [search browser].  And then everybody was living in an isolated, small community.  You were several miles apart.  You were across a valley, etc., and information wasn't readily, as readily available.
Speaker 1: And especially, you know, considering literacy, too.  Not everybody could even read the information that--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.   Specifically, along those lines.  My mother had a sixth grade education, and she thought it was valuable and important and all of that, but I never got the sense that--no, I know that the family was never multi-generational as far as education was concerned.  I mean it was, it must have been an amazing time, an amazing time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your grandparents, as far as you know, were they literate?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They thought education was important because they saw folks getting educated and moving forward, moving up.  But as far as I know, they were not educated.
Speaker 1: Now, did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: I met my grandmother once in 19--, I guess maybe I met her twice, in 1952 and then in 1954.  That was when I was four and six, or something like that.  And I remember (laughter)--so here's a story about my grandmother.  I grew up in Oakland, California.  The parents went on a trip back to Houston [Texas] at that time.  And so, they were outside of Houston, Texas.  And there was a farm, and I saw all of these chickens.  And so, I began chasing these chickens.  And my mother tells the story--and I sort of vaguely remember chasing after these chickens.  And my grandmother said, "Boy, stop chasing those chickens."  And I thought, do I have to respond to this person who's telling me that I should stop chasing chickens?  (laughter).
Story_ID: 25578
Speaker 1: Not a lot of connection between that part of the family in Houston and Texas and my parents.  My parents left Texas.  My dad left, I believe, around 1946.  My mother [Henrie Andrews] left a couple of years later.  No, my dad left in '46 [1946] and my mother left in '47 [1947] or so.  Don't really know the circumstance of their leaving, but after they left Texas, we went back maybe twice in the '50s [1950s].  But in general, I don't know very much about that part of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, did your parents have the means to go back, or was it just a matter of they just weren't that interested in going back?
Speaker 1: From a kid's point of view, I suspect that we could go visit.  I don't know the circumstances of the family.  My sense from my father, at least, was that yeah, been there, done that, namely Texas, is the past.  My mother, on the other hand, she had this large family that I mentioned, and I think she wanted to be closer to the family.  And she would talk on the phone and all of that, but, anyway--.
Speaker 2: So, your mother is part of a large family?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: How many brothers and sisters did she have?
Speaker 1: Oh, eleven or twelve brothers and sisters.  I've sort of, I don't want to say that there were thirteen folks in the family, but eleven or twelve is the right number.  Some died, of course.  Some--, the ones I remember, are my Aunt Doreesee Talbert, and I've gotten to know her daughters.  But in general, all of that is sort of behind this veil for me.  And again, getting folks to talk about it was, "Why do you want to talk about that old stuff?" they would say.  Never quite figured out why.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, just one last question I guess about the deep past.  Is there a tradition on your mother's side of the family of coming from some other state, or from the East?
Speaker 1: They never talked about that.  As far as I can tell, they were grown there in that part of Texas, and they lived there for a fantastically long time.  And then at some point, there was this movement.  At least my mother moved, my mother and father moved.  In general, the main body of the family may still be there.  Certainly, I know that my cousin Ruth and her sister, Doreesee's daughters--that's funny, I can't remember the other girl's name.
Story_ID: 25579
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, your mother had a chance to go to the sixth grade.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think.
Speaker 1: Now did she, what was your mother interested in?  Did she ever express an occupation that she wanted to pursue or something that she wanted to do?
Speaker 2: What she said, and I remember this, was that she had been out there farming and maybe even picking cotton.  And she thought that was unbelievably hard work for the return, and she wanted to do something else.  And I think at that point she left wherever they were living and maybe moved closer to the city, or wanted to get work there in the city, and then thought that education was the right way.  But again, all of that's, I mean it's behind the veil for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, here's a comment along those lines.  In the later part of life, this is after I became a faculty member at the University of Colorado, I tried to engage my parents in a discussion about that, especially my mother.  And it was, there was a veil, yeah.  It never led to very, very much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I never quite figured out quite why.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you suspect that there's some story there that they didn't want to talk about?
Speaker 2: Well, you know--come on, I mean, you get educated and you begin thinking about the great narrative of your family and why nobody tells the story, and you begin to think, what's going on here?  But as far as I can tell from talking to cousins, there was nothing special there, nothing special at all.  Except my mother really believed that education was a major future.  I mean, that was a huge thing.  She wanted us kids to become more educated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  Now, let me go to your father's side of the family.  Well, is there--just a little bit about your mother's side--now I don't, you probably don't know this, but was there a name for her school?  Did she share a name for the school that she attended?
Speaker 2: Nothing like that.
Speaker 1: And the little community she lived in was Brookshire?
Speaker 2: Brookshire, Texas.  That's what I know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But where the family came from to get there and how long they were there--I mean, all of that is--. And occasionally I talk to my cousin Ruth who is still alive down in Texas.  And we try to search through and figure out what the threads--but I mean, those folks are all dead now, except one or two.  No, most are in fact deceased now.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But there are a lot of relatives still there?
Speaker 2: Yes, there are.  And none of them know anything, because the mothers and fathers, they didn't tell them any parts of the story, or stories.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Now, that's not unusual.
Story_ID: 25580
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: James Curry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was he born Curry?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  Howard was my mother's [Henrie Andrews] brother's name.  And she wanted me not to be James Curry.  She wanted me to be James Howard Curry.  And I think she gave me that middle name with a twinkle in her eye, because she and her brother Howard, I understand were pretty close.  My dad, James Curry, was born September 16, 1913.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: In and around Cady, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I have no idea if it's C-A-T-I, C-A-T-Y, but Caty, Texas [Katy, Texas].
Speaker 1: I think it's C-A-D-Y, I think.
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Speaker 1: I think, and it's just because--I just--I don't know.  Something tells me that it is, but I don't, you know, I'm just (unclear), I don't know.
Speaker 2: It's part of that history that, why they were there and how they got there, and all of that.  My dad's father's name was William Curry.  And William Curry had three children, two girls and a boy.  The boy, of course, was my father, James Curry.  How my dad went from William to James, I have no idea why he was named James.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they had a small family by comparison to--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. Compared to my mother's family, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, he was born in 19--
Speaker 2: Here's the other part of that.  My dad's mother died when he was four years old.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  I knew you were going to ask that.  I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And she died when your dad was four?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then my dad moved around, and he was pretty much taken by my grand-dad's mother, whose name I can't remember.
Speaker 1: So, this was your great-grandmother, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  So, let me get this right.   So, my dad was raised by my father's mother who was my great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: Your dad was raised by his--
Speaker 2: My dad was raised by my grandfather's mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's your great-grandmother.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, good.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Not his great, but your great--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: He was raised by his grandmother.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And what was her name?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: I have to ask.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.   So, a thing that I saw in briefly browsing some of the information that you sent as preparation for this interview, it was the names of these people.  And I realized, I don't know those names.  I don't remember my folks talking about those names.  I don't remember there being a big Bible, for example.  By the way, there's a little irony there, a big Bible where all of these names are written down.  I don't ever remember seeing that.  The irony is that my grandfather was a Baptist minister.  He was a preacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is--now, Katy, Texas is, do you have any idea where it is in relationship to one of the major cities?
Speaker 2: I have looked at a satellite map.  I typed in C-A-T-I, or maybe you're right, C-A-D-Y.  I typed it in and did a Google map and there's some land. (laughter).  I mean, there was no reference point.  I saw roads.  I saw, I mean, it was a satellite view.  I had no connection at all there.  The answer is no.
Speaker 1: Is it near--
Speaker 2: It has to be near Brookshire [Texas].
Speaker 1: Brookshire?
Speaker 2: At least, that's my guess.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: And I think I'm demonstrating a huge lack of interest.  But you know, it's almost as though my parents' lack of interest sort of transferred to me and then sort of forward looking always.  Anyway, we can make up stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, you know, as I say, it's not that unusual.  A lot of people can't go past their grandparents.  And I've only interviewed black people, you know.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: And I don't know what others can do, but I know that's pretty much true in all these interviews.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: It's not that unusual.
Story_ID: 25581
Speaker 1: But I did meet my [paternal] grandfather in, I think 1954.  They lived at 114 West Gray in Houston, Texas.  And I remember telling my grand-dad that I was going to beat him in a foot race.  And we ran a foot race from the edge of a parking lot to his house.  And of course, he beat me.  And I remember thinking, wow.  And Houston, Texas, that was sort of the only memory that I had.  I mean, I remember seeing my [maternal] grandmother out there chasing the chickens.  I remember seeing my grand-dad once, and I remember being in Houston in '54 [1954].  And that was sort of it.  Everything else was just, okay we're in California.
Speaker 2: You were like five or six years old?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, five or six, that's right.
Speaker 2: Alright, so--
Speaker 1: But I also remember him being tall, I mean being tall, and maybe that's because I was five or six.  I mean, everybody looks tall when you're five or six.  But, yeah, I remember him being--, he had height.  He was taller than my dad, for example, and I think my dad [James Curry] was five-nine, five-ten [five feet and nine inches; five feet and ten inches].
Speaker 2: Did he look like your father?  Did they look alike?
Speaker 1: I don't remember, I don't remember.  But he was my grand-dad and that was kind of cool.
Story_ID: 25582
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now, did your father [James Curry] have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: No, my dad got a third grade education.  And I'm not sure of the circumstances, but a third grade education--1913, I mean he must have been--what are we, 1920 at most?
Speaker 1: Yes, he was done in 1920.
Speaker 2: And then, what did he do from 1920 until 1945, '46 [1946] when they came up to Oakland [California]?  I mean, he had various jobs.  He obviously met my mother [Henrie Andrews].  Going back to your question about why they may have left [Texas], I remember my dad telling the story where he was working for Sinclair Oil, Sinclair Refinery.  And somehow he was told to go down into a vat and clean out a vat or something, and he was supposed to use acid to clean it out.  And the story was that other people had gone down in there and there had been lung damage and they couldn't breathe, and all of that.  And he refused, and he just yelled at the guy, apparently.  And I'm making up the yell part, because he wasn't that explicit.  But whatever happened, that seemingly was a trigger event, where he had to leave that part of the world.  And he went to Oakland, California.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That makes sense.  I mean, there's a lot of stories like that, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: --that people have that they vaguely remember and then they say, oh yeah, maybe that's probably why they left.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: It makes sense.  So, now, how was that facilitated?  Did they know somebody on the railroad, or did they drive?  How did they--
Speaker 2: (laughter).  I have no idea.  Well, what I do know is that once he got to Oakland he found a job on the Southern Pacific Railway.  And a couple of years later he said, "Mom Henrie, why don't you come on up?"  And they relocated.  But how he found the job--I know that he started out basically as a dishwasher and then he became a cook on the train and he loved going from Oakland to--was the terminal in Chicago [Illinois]?  I think--but that was sort of the route.  And maybe the train was called the Southern Daylight Special, or something.  But he would tell stories, and he would be there at the house for three days a week or so, and off for four, or gone for four, back in four.  But he was a railroad man, and he seemed to like it very much.
Speaker 1: So, what did he do on the railroad?
Speaker 2: So cook, dishwasher, anything in and around food preparation, I thought.
Speaker 1: These jobs surprisingly are hard jobs.  I mean--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: I know when I first started, I didn't believe it.  I mean--I said, "Well what could be hard about being a porter or a cook?"  But the hours they kept, they couldn't sleep.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Being a cook--the stove, the distance between you and the stove, you could get burned and--.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I mean, if you think about the confines of a train car--and this is hindsight versus actually being there.  It had to be relatively small.  And then how do you navigate, and how do you navigate with several people who are doing those kinds of tasks?  The memory I do have is once touching my dad's hands and they were very callous.  He had cut his fingers because of, I guess, cutting up food or something like that.  And you could see the cuts and the scars and--you're right.  It had to be a hard job.  But it was honest work.  He seemingly enjoyed being there at the house, and then being gone.  He seemingly enjoyed that.  I remember once he had left maybe his wallet at the house, and I had to get on my bicycle and chase him down before he got to the Southern Pacific train yard.  And I rode and I rode and I rode, from our house on Tenth Street to, I don't know, someplace under the Nimitz [ph.] Freeway, and down on Filbert Street and gave him the wallet.  "Hey Dad, hey Dad."  Yeah, yeah, and then I drove back.  I mean, rode back.  I mean it was a huge deal.  Riding your bicycle that far was like, oooh, that's exciting.  It was like two and a half miles, or three.  (laughter).  Yeah. Long ago.
Speaker 1: It was a mission.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a mission.  It was a mission, and I accomplished it with satisfaction.
Story_ID: 25583
Speaker 1: Alright.  We were just talking off-camera about some of the--I guess I was trying to probe for some of his [Curry's father, James Curry] experiences on the railroad [working at Southern Pacific Railway]. Your father's--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Porters usually meet a lot of celebrities--or they meet some every now and then.
Speaker 2: If he met them, then he may have told my mom [Henrie Andrews] those stories, but again, I mean I don't know any of those things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said sometimes he'd bring something back, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Every so often he'd bring back, you know, a little, a comic book or something like that.  You know, of course, in hindsight somebody had left it on the train, and you know, you'd give it to your kid, and it's like "Oh, you brought me something, this is cool."  And then you'd play with the comic book for a long time.  Yeah.  Gosh.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: My mother told a story that they were at a picnic and they in quote, unquote "looked across and made eye contact".  And the next thing she knew she was married and (laughter) setting up a family.  I mean, it was almost that, I guess electricity--I mean, a very, very romantic story.  But she never went into any great detail.  There was a cookout, and some guys came from the city down to this rural area and, you know, they were eating the dishes of the day.  And he was a sharp dresser, she said.  He was a sharp dresser.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they got married about when?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  Sometime in the late thirties maybe, early '30s [1930s], late '30s [1930s], early '40s [1940s].  I wonder, did I ever see their marriage certificate?  Again, I don't remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's see.  Do you have siblings?
Speaker 2: Before I do that, let me back up a bit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Trying to probe my dad, his greatest memory was when he was eighteen years old standing behind two mules plowing the field.  He used to tell that story and I thought, that's an interesting story, because here's an eighteen-year old guy at the height of his physical powers probably, and out there in the hot sun plowing with two mules.  But he was in control of the two mules.  And for some reason, that image of him has always stuck with me.  And that was one of the few stories that he was willing to sort of tell me.  I mean, there was the Sinclair Oil refinery [in Texas] story and getting to California.  But everything else was just sort of, I mean it just collapsed into--we don't talk about it, and you move on.  And there weren't enough people around who knew him who could, say, fill in any details.  And so, that was, it was strange.  But anyway, you asked me about siblings.
Speaker 1: Right.  Well, I'm glad that you told that story.
Story_ID: 25584
Speaker 1: So, siblings.  I had a sister named Gloria Curry.  She died in 1964.  She was born in 1947 and then I was born in 1948, and we were great friends.  We were very close.
Speaker 2: So, she was only a teenager--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: --when she died.
Speaker 1: It was--okay, so here's a little bit of history.  My sister [Gloria Curry] was very smart, very very smart.  I think I was the typical young male, class clown, cut-up, didn't want to work hard, all of that kind of stuff.  And my sister on the other hand, she was dutiful.  She did her assignments, she was practicing the piano, I mean all of those things.  I mean, she was a good person.  And I followed her from elementary school, Cole Elementary School to Lowell Junior High School.  It's called a middle school today.  And then at some point I decided I did not want to follow her to the local high school.  The local high school in our area was called McClymonds [High School], an historically black school.  And so, instead of going to McClymonds High School, I went to Oakland Technical High School across town.  Oakland Tech was a predominantly white institution.  And having no desire to follow my sister, [Oakland] Tech was a great experience for me, because nobody knew my sister at Oakland Tech.  But my sister--as I said, very bright, very capable--a group of students were invited from McClymonds, they were invited on a ski trip, a snow trip.  And these kids had never seen ice, they'd never seen snow.  I mean, inner city kids.  And they went to an area and a group of them saw a rock in the middle of this frozen lake, and they ran off toward the rock.  And the ice around the rock was thin.  She was lost immediately.  And then several others, three others, I think, I remember were also drowned.  And it was obviously a catastrophe for the school and for my parents and for the family.  I mean it was, it was one of the hardest parts.  And shortly after that event, a counselor--so, I took algebra when I was in the eighth or ninth grade, I can't remember--and a counselor from Lowell Junior High School, his name was Edward L. Dry, he moved to Oakland Technical High School.  And Mr. Dry called me in and he said, "Hey buddy, you're going to go to college."  And it was like, "What?  I'm not going to college.  What do you mean, I'm going to college?", etcetera.  And what he said was that my parents [James Curry and Henrie Andrews] had been planning for my sister to go to college, really to the University of California at Berkeley.  And I--I mean I was a cut-up.  I mean, I was, you know, good at some things, but--.  But he said, "You will go."  And I was put on this college prep[aratory] path, and it all turned out.  But Edward L. Dry was the guy who when I was in the tenth grade said, "You will do this."  And he had been my algebra teacher.  And it was unbelievably fortuitous that he moved from Lowell Junior High to Oakland Tech, that he knew the family, and he put me on a pathway.  I mean, quite amazing.  I've often reflected on that, because that intervention at that point was, I mean, I can look back and I can see the switch that went from me not going to college to me going to college.  And it was all around this catastrophic event for the family.  It was quite amazing, quite amazing.  But it also changed the way that I thought about the world.  Everyday became important.  You work as hard as you can.  I mean, it was motivating.  Anyway--yeah. Edward L. Dry.
Speaker 2: That's quite a story.
Speaker 1: But now, here's another part of the story.  Edward L. Dry, he always dressed.  I mean, he was always tabbed to the gills.  I mean, he looked good (laughter).  Walking around with his tie and coat and jacket.  I mean, he was always professional.  And he could tell stories, and the fact that he taught algebra and told stories about the world.  He had been a merchant Marine guy, and I mean he just would, every so often he would just sort of tell us these stories about his life.  He was really a great teacher, he was a great teacher.
Speaker 2: Edward L. Dry.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Alright.
Speaker 1: I remember seeing him a couple of days before he died.  He had this, he had this large blue two-door Chrysler 300.  And he was driving, and he stopped and he said, "Hey, what are you boys doing?"  I was with a friend of mine named Mark Hollis.  And he said, "What are you guys doing?"  And we said, "Mr. Dry, we're just walking around."  And so, I remember him saying, "You know it's really hot, it's really hot."  And he was perspiring.  But you know, he was just kind of driving around.  And a couple days later, he was dead.  He had died of a heart attack.
Speaker 2: About how old were you when that happened?
Speaker 1: Oh, I think it must have been after my sister died, but I'm not sure.  I remember being kind of young and--
Speaker 2: So, you were still a teenager when--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, absolutely, absolutely, still a teenager.  But I don't remember the details.  But he was the guy who said, "You will do this."
Speaker 2: Did he pass away before you got out of high school, or--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think so.  I think so.
Story_ID: 25585
Speaker 1: And then from there, from high school, the next person who sort of gave me that kind of guidance is a teacher, still alive.  Her name is Mary Perry Smith.
Speaker 2: Now, I'm going to stop you, because we've got to back and recoup some other history.
Speaker 1: Okay, sure.
Speaker 2: But I know the story of Mary--well, I know some of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we're going to talk about her.
Speaker 1: Oh, you'll have to tell me how you know Mary Perry Smith.
Speaker 2: I will.  We'll go back to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I just want to go back to some questions we always ask about growing up, and we haven't asked that because you got into a real good story.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: There's nothing wrong with that.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: But we'll go back to--we always ask this question.  When you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their attitudes, their sense of humor, how they look, how they walk and talk, their views, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 1: I think both.  My dad [James Curry] was very private, and that's the language I will use today, because I don't know a lot about his history.  I don't know a lot of family stories.  And so, quiet.  He did his job and did it well.  That's my sense.  Mother [Henrie Andrews], also very solid.  But mother really wanted more education.  My dad, as far I could tell, third grade education was fine for him because he was able to buy a house, he had a family, he did lots of things.  As a matter of fact, my dad would occasionally tell a story that "I have a bought and my dad was not able to buy a house."  So, he would say that.  And so, he viewed the house as an accomplishment, purchasing a house as an accomplishment.  Who do I take after?  Probably both.  But then at some point, and it was in and around the time when my sister [Gloria Curry] died, I think the family was in crisis, and didn't know what to do.  Mother, she lost, just lots of weight.  She was kind of heavy, and she went from over 200 pounds to about 160 pounds.  And I mean, she was really grieving.  And so, during those formative parts of my life, there was Mary Perry Smith, there was Edward L. Dry, there were other teachers.  And so, the focus moved away from just simply my parents.  My parents, my mother, was religious.  My dad, well, my grand-dad who I mentioned, was a Baptist preacher.  But my dad, he was maybe a man of the times, whatever that means, whatever that connotes.  He was happy driving his cars, he wasn't very much into education.  As a matter of fact, I remember having a discussion with him.  I had a discussion with my dad about education, and I had gotten very close to high school graduation.  The discussion was "Well, what are you going to do now?"  And it was clear to me that he wanted me to get a job.
Speaker 2: He didn't have the same vision your mother had?
Speaker 1: He did not have the same vision.  "Get a job, get out of the house, move on," etcetera.  And I think, with hindsight now, I think that that was a reflection of what may have happened to him in his life.  Well, you're eighteen years old, go out and get a job.  I, on the other hand, had other options.  I mean, Mary Perry Smith was telling me to go on to the University of California.  Edward L. Dry was saying, "Hey, you're going to go on, you're going to be in these college prep[aratory] courses."  And there was this tug.  I remember the conversation walking down the stairs at our house on Tenth Street.  And he said, "Well, what are you going to do?"  And he was at me.  "What are you going to do now that you're about to graduate?  What are you going to do?   What are you going to do with your life?"  And I'm a seventeen-year old, and having someone ask you what are you going to do.  And, I mean, I had no idea.  What I knew I did like, I did like being educated.  I did like school.  I did like those kinds of things.  And so, doing more of that was an easy thing for me.  And also, there was this motivation, this pushing by Mary Perry Smith and several other things.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, we're going to get to them.
Speaker 1: Okay, sure.
Speaker 2: This is chronological, so we're just trying to--
Speaker 1: Sure, I'm sorry, I'm just--
Speaker 2: We're going to take you through grade school first.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm spinning, I'm spinning.
Speaker 2: No, no.  You're doing fine.  I just have to be the one to remind you just to come back to grade school. That's all.
Speaker 1: (laughter) You have the right to remind me, Sir.
Story_ID: 25586
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this question.  This is one we always ask.  Now, you were born in Oakland [California], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was your--, did you live in the same neighborhood, the same one all the time?
Speaker 2: 1948--yeah.  We lived in West Oakland.  We moved--let's see, I think I was born at this house maybe on Filbert Street, sort of in Lower West Oakland on the other side of the Nimitz Freeway.  And then we moved to Tenth Street and lived there for just years, until there was a major urban redevelopment in Oakland, and they bought all the land in that area.  The City of Oakland bought all that land.  And so, there was a housing--I mean there were sort of single family dwellings and some apartment houses just across the street, initially.  They tore all those down and put up a new, what do you call it?
Speaker 1: Expressway or something?
Speaker 2: Well, apartment complexes.  I mean, these were sort of one or two-story sort of homes.  And that happened almost, it happened very close to the time that I was heading off to University.
Speaker 1: Were those housing projects, or were they--
Speaker 2: Well, so, first single family dwellings, and then they became sort of housing projects.  But they weren't "housing projects" in the--they were more modern housing projects.  There's a very famous baseball player whose name was Vida Blue.  And Vida Blue played for the Oakland As.  And Vida Blue actually had a place in that area.  And everybody was pretty excited about Vida Blue being there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so those were, you know, more upscale places, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Vida Blue got paid pretty--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  And he also had a blue Cadillac that he would drive around in the neighborhood (laughter).  But for a very long time, for as long as I can remember, there were lots of houses in the area.  Beth Eden Baptist Church was just down the street and we'd go there on Sunday morning.  There was a Bible School at Beth Eden.  We'd go there during the summers.  And so, I had a paper route in that area and delivered papers there.  I was FS31.  That was my handle.
Speaker 1: Was that your newspaper handle, or--
Speaker 2: So, I was a carrier for the Oakland Tribune [newspaper].  And my route was FS31.  I have no idea what FS31 meant.  It may have been the designation of that particular area.  But I'd walk down, I'd get the papers, then I'd deliver them.  And I did that for several years.  I really wanted to be a paperboy.  I really wanted to be a paperboy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now we always ask--now, is it just you then growing up, you and your sister [Gloria Curry] and your mother [Henrie Andrews] and father [James Curry] in the household?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.  There were four of us.
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, no grandparents lived with you, or other relatives?
Speaker 2: No.  Remember, all that extended family was in Texas.  And we didn't have very many relatives in the area.  I mean we did have Rosie Lee Burton, she was there.  She was I guess on my mother's side, a cousin.  And not very many others were in the area.
Speaker 1: So, most of the time growing up, with your father being on the [Southern Pacific Railway] railroad and being gone for--would he be gone like a week at a time, or--
Speaker 2: Well, several days at least.  I mean a good portion of the week, certainly more than half of the week.  And then he'd be there for a couple days.  I mean, the train schedule was like--let me make up some numbers.  It was like four or five days on, two or three days off.  And so, I mean, again, he was gone more than he was there.  And--
Speaker 1: So, in the household it was basically your sister and your mother most of the time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mother ran the house.
Story_ID: 25587
Speaker 1: Now, this is a question we always ask.  We ask it like this for some reason, but I don't know what it is.  But what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Cooking.  Chicken, cornbread--fried chicken-cornbread, greens, black-eyed peas.  I mean, all of the quote, unquote "prosperity dishes" (laughter).  Chitterlings, God, what a horrible smell (laughter).  But, yeah, I mean just--sights and sounds.  So, the smells, the smells were easy.  The sights, I mean, we didn't have a television until the early '50s [1950s], mid-'50s [1950s] or so.  And that was really surprising.  But books, the neighborhood, school, studying, things were pretty much focused around the house.  And we didn't have a lot of people dropping in.  There were the Sanders who lived next door.  There were the Browns who lived across the street.  Oh, yeah, and there was a guy who lived across the street.  I can't remember his name.  But they had a really nice house.  He was also a retired railroad guy.  And he had actually had a heart attack and they had resuscitated him.  And there was an article in the newspaper about him.  But, I mean, it was just sort of a family neighborhood.  There were just a few kids around on the street.  The Sanders had some grandkids next door.  And then there was a large kind of apartment house.  Okay, so what I'm doing is, I'm remembering the street.  I'm facing outward toward Tenth Street.  And on the left side were the Sanders.  On the right side was this apartment house, and then there were some kids down at the end of the street, the Andersons.  And there was Beverly and Ron Anderson and their whole clan.  There were a lot of Andersons.  And then further down the street there were some other kids, but I didn't know them as well.  Yeah, it was an interesting neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Sounds?
Speaker 2: Sounds, oh God.  Do I remember any?  I remember the sounds of church, but that was typically on Sunday morning.  I don't remember a lot of radio.  I don't remember being engaged by a lot of radio.  I remember it being quiet.  I mean, we had a nice backyard which I hated to mow.  I did not like mowing the backyard.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Not a lot of music or anything?
Speaker 2: No, not a lot of music.  We did have an old Zenith radio, though.  My dad [James Curry], he really loved that radio, this old huge--I mean it was one of those hugh monstrous pieces of furniture.  And it had, you know, it had an SW band on it, it had the FM band on it.  It had all of this stuff, and it was a big piece of furniture.  And in the top there was a record player that played 78s.  And I don't remember lots of music there, no. I don't remember lots of music.
Speaker 1: Was it the Zenith with the lightning bolt going across the top?
Speaker 2: Yeah!  It was exactly that one.  But it was the big floor model, and my dad was really pleased, you know, that we had the Zenith (laughter).
Speaker 1: I remember, I think we had one like that, with the lightning bolt dial or something like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep, yep, yep.  Oooh, boy.  I hadn't thought about that radio in a long time.
Story_ID: 25588
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, were you influenced at all by radio or television?
Speaker 2: No, I think I was more influenced by the quiet--reading.  Again, Mother [Henrie Andrews] wanted us to be more educated.  And so, there were books in the house.  No, I don't remember--I remember my sister [Gloria Curry], on the other hand, she liked radio.  I mean she liked--because I mean it was that period of time.  It was the early '60s [1960s], late '50s [1950s], early '60s [1960s] and things were happening.  I mean there was lots of music.
Speaker 1: That was a transition to rock and roll--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --that she listened to?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: R&B [rhythm and blues genre] and rock and roll?
Speaker 2: I mean, she was much more socially connected.  I mean, I could care less about that stuff.  Sorry.
Speaker 1: So, what were your favorite books as a kid?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  Favorites?  I don't know if I had a favorite.  I liked sort of math books.  I remember being in seventh and eighth grade and liking the math books.  I mean that was kind of fun stuff.  And my sister, who was a year or so ahead, she had these really interesting math books, because they had lots of symbols in them, and they didn't make any sense.  And so, that was cool.  I mean for me it was cool.
Speaker 1: So, were you trying to make sense out of the symbols?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, sure.  I remember even having discussions with my sister.  She would be sitting and working--I think she was in the ninth grade maybe.  She would be sitting and working, and you know I'd be kind of there, "What's that?"  And we'd sit at the, we had a big dining room table, and she would do her homework at the dining room table.  And I would look over, and she would tell me some things.  And it was, I mean I learned some things, and then I taught her some things.  I mean it was hard, it was challenging.  Oh, here's a story for you.  My mother told a story about a math problem that she had worked on.  And she had worked really, really hard on it.   And she couldn't get it, she said.  And then at some point, she put the book under her pillow, and the solution came to her at night during her sleep.  And I thought, oh that's really cool.  Literature, literature I don't remember a lot of.  I mean, newspapers, yeah, magazines maybe a few.  But math books and science fiction and comic books, oh yeah.  So, I have a comic book collection.  Well, I had a comic book collection before my parents died.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite genre of comic books?
Speaker 2: I mean, this was when Spider Man was there and Superman was there and Batman and Thor.  I mean, and all this wonderful language around Thor, Asgard--I mean, just, just stuff.  I mean that, of course, didn't make any sense, but was part of mythology.  I just flashed on Fantastic Four, science fiction in general.  Maybe that was the genre.  Yeah, maybe that was the genre.  Isaac Asimov [American author, especially known for science fiction], stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25589
Speaker 1: Okay, we were just discussing these comic books.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were discussing comic books, and Thor and Spiderman and the Fantastic Four, and all of those comic books.  And just the richness of the language, I mean, I think really attracted me.  I mean, you could play with the language.  You could say funny things in the language.  It was--yeah.  So, comic books influenced my life.  Science fiction influenced my life.  I really enjoyed reading science fiction, and sort of dreaming about what could be.  And during the '50s [1950s] in television, there were always these guys in white coats who would walk around on television, and I really thought that was cool.  And then there was the whole Sputnik [first artificial satellite sent into orbit; launched by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957] thing that sort of just came, and science became important, and yeah, you could do something.  I mean that was, the universe was open.  That was--
Speaker 1: A lot of drama centered around scientists in those days--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --on television, 'The Twilight Zone'[American television series]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Doctors, mad doctors--
Speaker 2: (laughter)  'The Twilight Zone', Rod Serling, "Today we're about to enter the twilight zone."  And just the way, I mean, the enunciation and the cadence.  I mean I love that, I love that.
Speaker 1: So, you seem to have a really interesting focus on math, more so than most people I've ever talked to.  I mean, you were actually, you know, trying to read math books as a kid.
Speaker 2: I read math books as a kid.  I liked math.  I liked the symbols.  They were mysterious.  And so, figuring out what the mystery was about, I mean, that was always sort of like wonderful and exciting.  Literature, naaaah, but science fiction was really great.  I loved that.  Over time, I've come to appreciate literature, but I mean, it was the science and the science fiction.  And I remember when I was in high school, I read parts of the biography of Albert Einstein, and I thought that was kind of cool.  I mean, that was when I was at Oakland Technical High School [California].  And then I just sort of--Mary Perry Smith, Edward L. Dry [teachers who were influential in Curry's life]--I mean, they were motivators.
Story_ID: 25590
Speaker 1: Now before, in grade school, were you, you were saying earlier that you were kind of like the class clown in school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I was.
Speaker 1: Were you like that in grade school?
Speaker 2: I was like that in grade school.
Speaker 1: But during that period of time, did you get good grades in math?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, sure, sure.  But math was kind of easy, and you didn't think about it.  And you never--well, as a kid it's difficult, at least for me, it was difficult to assess where I was or what I was doing.  But what I do know and what I do remember is that both my sister [Gloria Curry] and I, we were viewed as, well, they're kind of smart kids, smart kids.  We had book sense.  And I never appreciated what that meant, but I mean, I could do the reading, I could do the math.  I could do that.  And then when I went to Lowell Junior High School, there was sort of more math there, and it was always fun and a challenge to learn math.  My math teacher was Mrs. Glenn.
Speaker 1: This is at Lowell?
Speaker 2: This is at Lowell.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Mrs. Glenn was a robust person.  And she really had us learning math.  She really had us learning math.  And that was one of the places I got my hands slapped with a ruler, because I had been talking to a guy sitting behind me.  His name was Cal Hobby.  And Cal and I, we were figuring out how to draw things.  And Cal had figured out how to draw a human, a human body.  And so--I mean the muscular, the legs--he could draw.  And so, he and I were drawing things, and this was in math.  And Mrs. Glenn saw us not doing math, and so she came over and she said, "Hold out your hands."  And she took her ruler and she gave me a couple swipes in each hand.  And I remember that.  She was an interesting person, Mrs. Glenn.
Speaker 1: Did that help you focus on--
Speaker 2: (laughter)  I'm not sure what it helped me do, but I remember not ever talking to Cal about drawing pictures anymore in the math class.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: And maybe I was bored, but I'm making that part up.
Speaker 1: So, you went to Cole Elementary School?
Speaker 2: Cole Elementary School.  That's through the sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Were there any important teachers at Cole?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  I remember Mrs. Lee, but I don't remember very much else.  I remember being in the portables.  There were portables on the Cole school ground.
Speaker 1: These were temporary structures?
Speaker 2: Yeah, temporary structures.  And I remember going from the portables into the main building, and that was really cool.  I mean, that was a big deal.  No, I don't have a lot of memories about Cole [Elementary] School.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, at Lowell--
Speaker 2: I remember the library, though.  The library was kind of nice.
Speaker 1: Okay, you remember the library?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, Lowell Junior High School.  Now, there's a story here that's in all of your bios, that at age twelve, you find this physics book in the library.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, you know, and you're fascinated with physics.
Speaker 2: I mean, it was, first of all, it was a pretty book.  It was pretty.  I mean, it was, it had a black cover.  The pages were really, I mean they were really sort of a nice white.   As far as I could tell, the book had never been checked out.  And for a long time, I mean, I'd walk around with that book.  And there were all of these symbols in there.  I mean, just symbols and words, and symbols and words, and the words were tying the symbols together.  And it was like, okay, what's going on here?  What's going on?  And so, it was this, it's almost a quest to understand.  I mean, and quest is my language versus the language of that kid.  But it was like, what's going on here, what's this about?
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is a big mystery that has to be solved?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how far did you--now, you say you took algebra in middle school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Algebra in middle school.  That's like seventh grade, or--
Speaker 2: Eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Eighth grade, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, with Edward L. Dry [Curry's algebra teacher and counselor].  And part of it was, again, Edward L. Dry's stories and the math and all of that kind of stuff sort of blended together.
Story_ID: 25591
Speaker 1: But now, what did I take in the ninth grade?  Oh, in the ninth grade, I think I moved to--no, that couldn't be right, could it?  In the ninth grade did I move to Oakland Technical High School [Oakland, California]?
Speaker 2: It could be.
Speaker 1: That doesn't sound right.
Speaker 2: Some high schools have four years--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --freshman through senior.  So, middle schools go all the way--well, I don't know.  Yeah, it does make sense that you would be there in high school.
Speaker 1: You know, but I remember the books that we had.  I mean, these huge monstrous books that would weigh like 200 pounds apiece.  And you'd have to carry them around.  And I remember sort of carrying books.  And I know that was in high school.  And then in high school in the tenth grade, we got a computer, the Bendix [Corporation, manufacturing company in existence from 1924-1983], the Control Data G-15 computer.  And me and a student whose name was Pershing Lum, we were learning how to program that computer.  Pershing Lum--he became an engineer.  He graduated, I think, from [University of California,] Berkeley.
Speaker 2: Here's a Bendix computer in high school, and--
Speaker 1: Well, Bendix was originally there, and then it was bought out by Control Data [Corporation, supercomputing firm].  So, it was a Control Data machine.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: It was called a Control--
Speaker 1: Control Data Corporation.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was a Control Data G-15 computer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: A big green box that had vacuum tubes in it.  And we could open up the box and look inside, and all of that.  And that was really cool.  And so, Pershing Lum and I, we learned a lot about those machines.  It had paper tape (laughter), paper tape.
Speaker 2: Pershing Lum, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So--
Speaker 1: A partner in crime.
Speaker 2: So, did you have to learn--what, Cobalt, or Fortran [programming languages]--
Speaker 1: It was, it had this--look, no, no, no.  This was before those.  It was a numeric language that would say something like, "50, 1420."  And 1420 was an address.  50 was the command to add something to the address at 1420.  And so it was this, I don't know if it was machine language, but it was some language that you--, I mean you'd type into a teletype machine and then you'd hit some command and it would execute this program.  And high schools at the time got these Control Data G-15 computers.  And I remember it was the ninth grade, it was the ninth grade.  Because I remember sort of spending a lot of time playing with that.  And I had a notebook that actually had these commands written in them.  I mean, it was really cool.  It was really, really cool.
Speaker 2: Now, what did the high school use the computer for?
Speaker 1: Oh, for nothing.  I mean, it--
Speaker 2: So they didn't store data in it?
Speaker 1: Oh, gosh, no, as far as I could tell, and now I'm making up stuff.  But as far as I could tell, every school in the district was donated a G-15 computer, and we got one at Oakland Technical High School.  And some of the teachers figured out how to do some things with it.  Edward L. Dry [Curry's algebra teacher and mentor] was one of them.  And then the math teachers sort of did some stuff with it.  And Pershing and I, we were the guys who became sort of the computer mavens.  It was really, really cool (laughter).  I mean, we could spend hours just sort of trying to figure out how to get a computer to compute a square root.  Well, I mean, the square root says 'x' squared is equal to a number, 'x' times 'x' is equal to the number.  And so, you could actually build a little program that says are you above the number or are you below the number if you square it?  And then you sort of chop down and you actually get to the square root.  I think it had six digits accuracy or something.  But that was motivational.
Speaker 2: This is 1962?
Speaker 1: Yeah, early sixties.
Speaker 2: '62 [1962] I guess, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, '62 [1962], '63 [1963], sometime in there.
Speaker 2: So, you would have been a freshman in '62 [1962], I'm thinking.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Wow (laughter).
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: (laughter) Bendix G-15.  I don't even think the Bendix Corporation is even remembered anymore.
Speaker 2: I've heard of them, yeah, I've heard of them.
Speaker 1: And Control Data, I mean, I know they got out of the big hardware business back in the, maybe back in the '80s [1980s], maybe--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --'90s [1990s]?
Story_ID: 25592
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about Mary Perry Smith.
Speaker 2: Mary Perry Smith was one of the most amazing people I have ever met.  So, let me jump way forward and then come back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mary Perry Smith's husband, as far as I can tell, was president of Merritt College in Oakland, California.  And he also became, maybe Vice Chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley.  For me, Mary Perry Smith was a math teacher.  And Mary Perry Smith was one of the people who said, "You have some talent in math."  And part of her mission seemed to be to identify people and push them, and say "You have talent, you can do more."  And in the '60s [1960s], when the doors opened to universities and higher education, etcetera, Mary Perry Smith was one of the people who was pushing.  She was pushing people who would take her math class, for example.  And I was one of the people who took her math class.  And she said, "Oh, next year you take calculus."  And so, in twelfth grade, I took calculus.  And I remember getting a table of integrals and derivatives and memorizing just large parts of it.  And the guy who taught the class, I had memorized more.  And so, I remember having a back and forth with him about a particular problem.  And my answer was based on memorizing the table of integrals.  And he said, "Oh no, you can't get that this way."  And I had remembered it.  And so, I wrote down the solution from memory.  And he said, "Oh, that's going to get you in trouble."  But, Mary Perry Smith was the one who pushed.  She pushed real hard.
Story_ID: 25593
Speaker 1: Now, which--I guess the push from Edward L. Dry [Curry's math teacher and counselor at Lowell Junior High School and Oakland Technical High School] came first?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: So, first was Dr. Dry, Dr. Dry, yeah.  I think he had a Ph.D. in counseling maybe.  But Dr. Dry, and then Mary Perry Smith.  And there was almost, and this is almost the story of my life.  There have been these handoffs.  I mean, when I got to a certain point, there'd been these handoffs.  And I'm not sure if I was looking for mentors, but there would always be, if you will, a mentor there.  And that mentor would then move me along.  And instead of taking a trajectory that might flatten, it was a trajectory that was headed upward.  And when I reflect on my own life, I can see those mentors.  I can see the Edward L. Drys.  I can see people like Mary Perry Smith.  I can see colleagues and faculty like Don Sarason from University of California, Berkeley, or Calvin Moore from the University of California, Berkeley, or others.  I mean, my own dissertation advisor.  I mean, they said, "Oh you can do more, you can do more."
Speaker 1: Okay.  So-
Speaker 2: But anyway, Mary Perry Smith.  Yes.
Speaker 1: So, this high school.  Just to recoup what we did before when your sister [Gloria Curry], when your sister passed--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You were encouraged by, in fact you were you told by--
Speaker 2: Edward L. Dry.
Speaker 1: Edward L. Dry that--
Speaker 2: "You will go."  And as far as I could tell, the model in the black family, and this is hindsight now, the model in the black family was that the daughter would get more education.  And the son would go off and get a job.  And that was the model that we were running with in the family.  My parents [James Curry and Henrie Andrews] never used the word "model" (laughter).  But as far as I could tell, that's the model that we were running with.  And at some point, that model derailed, because my sister died.  And then it became me.  And Edward L. Dry was the guy pushing.  I mean, he pushed.   He pushed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Dry pushed, and then--
Speaker 2: And then there was a handoff to Mary Perry Smith.  And then she pushed.  And then there was this Bendix G-15 computer.  And Dry and Mary Perry Smith, they were in there saying, "Learn about computing."
Speaker 1: So, you're being pushed ahead of the curve in a couple of ways.  First of all, you're taking calculus, which a lot of high school students in those days did not get a chance to take.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're pushing yourself beyond what's being taught.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're dealing with computer science.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I mean, all of that.  And here's the funny thing.  I remember looking at those computers and saying, if computers are really important, they will become part of my life, okay.  And I remember doing this when I was in the tenth grade or so.  And guess what, I mean, every time I wanted to walk away, we'd come back every time.  And as part of my Ph.D., I had to do some numerical experiments, and got some nice mathematics and some computational stuff.  And it was like, oh yeah.  And then I went on to the National Center for Atmospheric Research, which is just a huge computer place.  And then I went to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] for a couple of years and worked with a guy named Ed Lorenz, who was just amazing.  And computing became, I mean, part of my life.  But anyway, yeah, Mary Perry Smith was the push.  She was the push in high school.
Speaker 1: Now, she's quite a person otherwise, too.  From what I've read she was involved in the arts--
Speaker 2: Filmmaker, I mean she was filmmaker.  She was on the board of maybe Filmmaker's Hall of Fame.  She was on the board of Lawrence Hall of Science in the Oakland, Berkeley [California] area.  I mean, she was just everywhere.  And she was always nurturing students.  And I know that in the math classes that she taught, there were a large number of Chinese kids.  And so, many of the kids I grew up with in the math classes were Chinese kids.  And we just sort of, I mean, we challenged each other in math.  And it was just wonderful, it was just wonderful.  And Mary, she pushed us, she pushed us.  As a matter of fact, I mentioned that she's still alive.  And there's a group of maybe ten of us, seven of us, who constantly stay in contact through e-mail.  I mean, there's Frank, there's Pershing, there's Ted Lee, there's Loris Devonso, there's several others, and we stay in contact.  I mean, we exchange Christmas cards and e-mails every so often, and all of that.  And it's because of Mary Perry Smith and us being in the math course.   I mean, yeah.
Story_ID: 25594
Speaker 1: Now, when you were in high school, now, how were your grades?
Speaker 2: Oh, the last year they were perfect, 4.0, okay.
Speaker 1: The last year?
Speaker 2: The last year.  Before that, I mean, it was 3.5, 3.6.  It was good enough.  But in that last year, it went, bingo.  And I got into [University of California,] Berkeley, and I mean it was just, I mean, trust me when I say I was a cut-up, and it took a while to say, "Okay, I can do this."  I remember chemistry, I remember physics.  I remember the teacher from physics.  His name was Jack Morrison.  He was also a karate master.  And he and one of the English teachers there, they were both studying karate.  But Mr. Morrison, he had the big physics lab, and I didn't understand anything about physics.  I did not understand physics.  But math, math I understood.  And of course, ultimately, I figured out that mathematical thinking and physical thinking, they're just different, they're just different.  Math I could do.  Physics was like, "Oh yeah, well, I guess."  Because I mean, there's a sort of physical intuition that would motivate solutions sometimes.  And I mean, I don't think I have physical intuition (laughter).  But, math, oh yeah, that's my home.
Speaker 1: So, you would say that the difference between math and physics is the intuition?
Speaker 2: Yeah, intuition.
Speaker 1: People often say well, math and physics is the same thing.
Speaker 2: The answer is I don't think so.  I think mathematics, you build these abstract structures and then you argue logically from the abstract structures, or you use those structures to then probe parts of the world.  I mean, that's applied math and computation.  But in physics, I mean, you're building theories that predict.  You're doing experiments, and you have to be clever and have the physical insight.  And your training and thinking, I think is different.  But at some level, at the very highest level, really great theoretical physicists are really, in fact, mathematicians.  I mean, they play with the structure but they focus outside, they focus on the universe.  I mean, it's--I think it's a different way of thinking.
Speaker 1: So, they test--
Speaker 2: They test hypotheses.
Speaker 1: --theories with mathematical--
Speaker 2: Well, they build mathematical theories to test physical reality.  And then the physical reality is tested by experimentalists.  And then there's a closing of the loop.  But at the very highest level, I think theoretical physicists are in fact wonderful mathematicians.  And you can sometimes see that cross-over.  A very famous theoretical physicist is David Ruelle.  He's still alive.  He's in France.  And he did lots of physics, statistical mechanics for a while, and then he lodged into something called dynamical systems, which is an area I'm very interested in.  And it's clear--and he's just strong, he's just really strong.  Anyway, yeah, I digress.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, when you were in high school, and I have to ask this question for the sake of young people watching this, was there any stigma to being a mathematician or a student of the sciences?
Speaker 2: I didn't notice, because the group I was running with, I mean, all of these kids were interested in computers.  All of these kids were interested in physics.  All of these kids were interested in math, and just sort of taking calculus.  I mean, it was a group.  And the fact that I was the only African-American in there, that was fine, because the community supported me and embraced me. They're my friends.  I never thought about the stigma, except one day when I was riding the bus to Oakland Technical High School.  I think this is the story, and there was a kid on the bus.  So, I went from West Oakland, I took the 51 Bus, to, okay, up Broadway, and it left us at Tech, Oakland Technical.  And there was a kid on the bus one day who said I was an Uncle Remus because I was always studying.  And so, there were communities where I was not a part of the community, but in general when I was in that environment, when I was in the high school environment, well, I was fine.  I also had a friend whose name was Larry Newsome.  And Larry and I both lived in West Oakland.  We both went to Oakland Technical High School.  I believe we both had gone to Lowell Junior High School, and we were also friends.  And Larry and I were just, I mean, it was okay.  It was okay to be who we were, namely these kind of nerdy kids who liked math and science.  And we read comic books and watched the guys in the white coats on television, and all of that kind of stuff.  But there were clearly other kids who didn't like that that much.
Speaker 1: I think that it's odd, the term Uncle Remus, of all things (laughter).  They were associating Uncle Remus with studying or something?
Speaker 2: Maybe being a person who would--yeah, yeah, I can't get into his head.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He was trying to put you down or something?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, sure, but I mean, hey.
Speaker 1: He hadn't analyzed his history in order to come up with a good one.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Uncle Remus.  'Tales of Br'er Rabbit' (laughter).  That's funny.
Story_ID: 25595
Speaker 1: So, as a senior, now, you knew you were going to U.C. [University of California,] Berkeley?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.
Speaker 1: Why?  I mean, was there any other choice?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I hadn't really thought about it.  I mean, Mary Perry Smith was saying, go here.  Oh, another choice was Merritt College [Oakland, California].  It was a community college.  And I remember sitting for the entrance exam there.  There's a very famous actor whose name is Ted Lange, who was on 'The Love Boat' [1970s television series].  And Ted and I were actually taking the entrance exam for Merritt on the same day.  I remember him.  And he looked around and he saw me and he laughed.  I mean, he's really had a fantastic career.
Speaker 1: Ted Lange.  Okay.
Speaker 2: 'The Love Boat' (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, U.C., Berkeley.  So, you're admitted into U.C. Berkeley?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were going to major in math?
Speaker 2: I thought I was going to major in math, and I did major in math.  Before that entrance, there was a summer, an induction program, and in that induction program we did a little math, we did some writing, we just sort of got acclimated to the campus.  And then I took a course called math 11A and 11B.  And it was calculus without analytic geometry.  So, it was essentially going over some of the things that I had done in high school.  And I met a guy.  His name was Don Sarason.  And Don is still alive.  He's a professor at Berkeley.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his last name?
Speaker 2: S-A-R-A-S-O-N.  And he was very welcoming, and he was--so, I mentioned this handoff.  And so, he became a mentor for me.  How do you navigate Berkeley?  And here's really the story for me about [University of California] Berkeley.  I told you about my fascination with all of these symbols in these books.  I looked in the Berkeley catalog and there was a class called Math 206A and 206B--206A and 206B.  And I read the description of 206A and 206B, and they talked about spaces of continuous functions.  They talked about Hilbert spaces.  They talked about Banach spaces.  I mean, this was really sort of abstract stuff.  And there was some symbols, C bracket A,B, so, C bracket A,B.  And I wondered what that was.  And I saw Banach spaces, and spaces of continuous function and Hilbert spaces, etcetera.  And I said, I want to take that class.  And I took that class when I was a sophomore.  Was I ready for it?  No, wasn't ready for it, but this was a graduate math class, and I took it.  And it was like whoa, did I get my socks knocked off?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, but it was like, I mean I was in over my head.  But at that point I met a guy named Calvin Moore.  So, Don Sarason, Calvin Moore.  Calvin Moore was a wheeler-dealer, very cool guy.  And he was, once again, a person who put me on a pathway (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, is Calvin Moore black?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Calvin Moore is a white guy who graduated from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] who went to Berkeley, who was a chain smoker.  And when he got to Berkeley, he must have been fourteen years old (laughter).  But he was a really young looking dude.  And he, yeah, he pointed me in directions.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25596
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Calvin Moore.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Calvin Moore.
Speaker 1: A young genius, right?
Speaker 2: So, Don Sarason, he was the guy who taught me the calculus course and became a mentor, and I think, a friend.  And then Calvin Moore was just this young genius, yeah, over the top.  I mean, he had such a command of abstract math, that it was wonderful.  I mean, and I kept saying, "Wow, I want to learn this stuff."  But I knew I was in over my head, and I'm surprised I got through that course, but gosh.  But I majored in math at [University of California,] Berkeley, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, you entered Berkeley in 1966?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is the year, I think, the Black Panther Party [African-American revolutionary socialist organization; active from 1966-1982] was born.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The revolution, my brothers (laughter).
Speaker 1: And U.C. Berkeley had like, well, that area, the Bay area [California], you know, the hippie movement was growing.
Speaker 2: Yes, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Flower power and all that.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: The Oakland Raiders [American football team]--
Speaker 2: The Oakland Raiders were--
Speaker 1: All these things are going on--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --when you're in school.
Speaker 2: Good times.
Speaker 1: So, I just raised some of these--now, what did you feel about the Panthers at the time, how did you feel?
Speaker 2: Oh, so Huey Newton [co-founder of the Black Panther Party] actually lived in West Oakland [California].  I think I--okay, so let me digress and come back.  So, during that period of time, I worked in a gas station on 73rd and East 14th Street.  The gas station was owned by Nelson Broom, and Burt, I can't remember Burt's last name, but the Broom family.  And Huey P. Newton and company, they would drive this huge Lincoln Continental into the gas station.  We'd fill it up, we'd clean the windows, we would do all of that kind of stuff.  And I remember one day cleaning the windows and walking back inside the shop.  And somebody said, "Do you know whose windows you just cleaned?"  I said, "Naw, who is that?"  He says, "Huey Newton."  "Huey who?" (laughter).  And so, the Black Panthers, they were there, but again, I was part of another community.  I was at Berkeley.  And at Berkeley, yeah, there was a lot of stuff going on, but here's the thing.  My parents [James Curry and Henrie Andrews], especially my mother, she really wanted me to finish that degree.  I mean, I had gone on to get a high school degree.  They were funding me at Berkeley, so the first year I got some money.  This was as an undergraduate.  And then throughout my graduate career, I was funded.  And so, it was, I mean, it was wonderful for me.  And so, those were ten years that really literally changed my life.  And so, in the '60s [1960s], yes, I was there--As a matter of fact, here are two images that stick in my mind.  I'm sitting in a class.  I think it was 206B with Mark Realfore.   And Mark was also from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And he was also, when you said young genius, he was also a young genius.  And I remember Mark Realfore standing at the board lecturing.  And I'm sitting in Wheeler Hall, and I'm looking out the window.  And there is a, there's a group of students running up toward the Campanile.   So, it's on a slope between the library and Wheeler Hall.  And so, they're running up toward the Campanile. And then I see the police run up after them, okay.  And then I see some tear gas go, okay, toward the students.  And then I see the tear gas canister coming back.  And so, Mark Realfore--and so, I'm sitting looking out the window seeing all of this, and Mark Realfore is lecturing.  And of course, the tear gas begins to sort of waft in the room.  And so, Mark is writing some--I think it was the Riesz representative theorem or something, and he's talking about invariant measures, and he's just doing stuff.  He's going.  And then he pulls out his handkerchief and he begins dabbing at his eyes.  And he says, "I apologize, I can't go on because the tear gas is too strong"  (laughter).  And I remember that, and I thought, "Get out of here."  And so, he dismissed the class, one of the first times he dismissed the class.  We got up and walked out.  And as I'm walking out through, say, the gate, you walk out and there's some kids and they have these huge boulders and they're throwing them through windows, so they're breaking these plate-glass windows.  And there's just lots of stuff going on.  And I'm walking, walking, walking.  I walk off campus.  I was initially going to take a bus, but then I decided I to walk home.  So, I walked home.  And the campus was closed for like a day or two.  And I mean, that's a memory that I have, of the glass being broken, of the tear gas.  And I just wanted to, I'm sorry, I just wanted to do math, right.
Speaker 1: Was that during what they called the Free Speech Movement?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Mario Savio?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  All of that stuff was--As a matter of fact, Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] actually visited Berkeley and gave a lecture in Sproul Hall.  And I actually saw that lecture, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, you were also in school when Dr. King was assassinated?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what happened at U.C. Berkeley?  I mean, what was the atmosphere like at U.C. Berkeley?
Speaker 2: Unbelievably--so, during that period of time, I also had a job at American Telephone and Telegraph.  And I would ride BART [Bay Area Rapid Transit; heavy-rail public transit and subway system] over and work for half a day a couple days a week.  And I remember having a conversation the day that, shortly after, [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was assassinated.  And one of my colleagues, he was an engineer.  He asked me, "What's going on, what's happening?"  And this was a guy who, I mean, he had a huge family, and he was worried.  Maybe he lived in Walnut Creek [California] or something like that.  But he wondered about potential eruptions there.  In Berkeley [California], I don't remember a lot.  I mean, I really don't.
Speaker 1: Were there riots in Oakland [California]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  There were things going on in Oakland.  But you know, my parents had moved from 10th Street to 46th Street, and I had moved to a place on Adeline Street.  I think it was 2980 Adeline Street, Apartment, I think it was Apartment D.  And I just kind of held up there for several days and just kind of worked.  And it happened all around me, but it was quite amazing.  No--I'm thinking how inactive I was there.  I mean how focused.  Maybe I'll give myself the benefit and say how focused I was there.
Speaker 1: Now, did your family like--, were you used to paying attention to the news?
Speaker 2: Well, not really so much.  I knew that news was happening, I knew it was important, but I didn't have context.  I wasn't--, I was about getting that education.  I was about getting that degree.  I was about getting--I was about doing math.
Story_ID: 25597
Speaker 1: Now, I wonder, now, as you expressed this--was it more--because some people are driven by the position they can attain or the degree itself, and some are driven by the work.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: What part--
Speaker 2: I think I was driven more about learning, because I really wanted to learn this stuff.  I mean, it was all of a sudden in high school [Oakland technical High School, Oakland, California] and at a university [University of California, Berkeley], you could learn stuff.  You could learn lots of stuff.  And I wanted to learn it all.  And I hadn't really ever thought about where it could lead to.  I mean, remember I said that my dad [James Curry] had asked me these questions when I was graduating from high school, "Well, what do you want to be?"  "Where do you want to go?"  "What do you want to do?"  I mean, he'd ask me all those questions.  And I had no answers.  I just wanted more education.  I mean, that was sort of my mother's [Henrie Andrews] position.  And I know I ran as fast as I could down that pathway, because I wanted more education.  And ultimately, I understood that I was living her dream, which is probably not a bad dream.  But I never thought about position.  I didn't even know what you could do with a Ph.D.  I mean, I never knew what you could do.
Story_ID: 25598
Speaker 1: Now, did you know any Ph.D.s?  Other than Edward Dry, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Edward L. Dry [Curry's counselor in school] was there, and the faculty who I interacted with.  And then I met a guy whose name was Harry Morrison.  Professor Harry Morrison was a professor of physics at Berkeley, and he was a guy who at some point identified me and I mean, I told you about these handoffs.  I mean, and then you meet a Harry Morrison.  Harry Morrison was a black physicist, and he pushed me along.  He said, "Well, here's some other things that you could do.  And so, you can get a post doc.  You could do research.  You can go to work for a federal lab, you could--" because Harry had that history of having worked at, I think, Lawrence Livermore [National] Labs [Livermore, California].  He was a physicist at [University of California,] Berkeley.  Really, really nice family.  His wife was Harriet.  So, Harry and Harriet. They had a nice little house.  And oh, Harry had this amazing library.  I mean, I house sat for him for a while, and I think he was MIT [Massachusetts Institute of technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] during that period.  And he had this wonderful, wonderful library.  And so, when I was house sitting, I could just kind of walk, and I could look at all these physics books.  But he also had math books.  And so, this physics and math was sort of in there.  I mean, just this wonderful, wonderful library.  He was a guy who pushed me along, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now he, is this the gentleman who's passed away now?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He passed maybe three, four years ago.
Speaker 1: Yeah, some of the, I think some of the people we've interviewed this year have mentioned him at U.C. Berkeley.
Speaker 2: Right.  Ron Mickens [also a HistoryMaker] certainly knew of him.  (unclear) probably knew of him as well.  But yeah, he was pushing people along.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think someone mentioned him as one of the smartest, brightest people they ever met, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, it's funny how Harry was interested in everything.  And that seems to be a characteristic of many of the people who I've sort of interacted with.  Yeah, not only can they do the science or the math, but they're interested ultimately in everything.  I mean, there's almost an activation threshold.  And once you get beyond a certain point, you're activated.  And then you can think about literature, you can think about history, you can think about context.  And yeah, Harry was one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then Harry introduced me, or led to an introduction to Warren Washington [also a HistoryMaker].  And Warren Washington has been a mentor and friend for a very long time.  And then Raymond Johnson [also a HistoryMaker] has been a mentor and a friend for a very long time as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Warren Washington.  Now, Warren Washington, you worked with him at the University of Colorado, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Well, I first met Warren [Washington] at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  So, here's the story.  I finished my Ph.D., and as I was finishing my Ph.D., Jim Donaldson [also a HistoryMaker] was visiting the University of California at Berkeley.  And so, I'm out in the hall going up to, I think, my office.  And there's this large black guy standing in the hall.  And he says, "Hey man."  Okay, and I said, "Hey."  And he said, "Yeah, who are you?"  And I said "I'm James Curry."  He said, "Are you a student here?"  "Yeah."  "Who are you working with?"  And I was working with Oscar Lanford, the Ph.D. advisor.  And he said, "Oh yeah, what are you working on?" And I said, "Some partial differential equations."  And he said, "Are they elliptic, hyperbolic or parabolic?"  And I showed him, and I said, "They're non-linear."  And he said, "Yeah, those are non-linear."  And I said, "Who are you?"  And he said, "I'm Jim Donaldson from Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia]."  And I said, "Okay."  And so, then shortly after that, Howard was looking for faculty people.  I was graduating, and got a job offer from Howard.  But it was really amazing.  I mean, I was in the hall, met Jim Donaldson, and that led to a position at Howard.
Speaker 1: Now this is back in, this is in--
Speaker 2: This is in the '70s' [1970s].
Speaker 1: 197--
Speaker 2: Yeah, '75' [1975]--
Speaker 1: '75' [1975]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '76' [1976], yeah.
Speaker 1: Just as you were about to graduate?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just as I was about to graduate.
Story_ID: 25599
Speaker 1: Once again, we're probably jumping too far, but we've got to go back a little bit, to undergrad school at U.C. [University of California,] Berkeley.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: That was interesting (laughter).  I worked in the library for awhile and that was kind of fun, with all of these books around.
Speaker 1: Oh, I have to ask you about David Blackwell.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, sure he was there, he was there.  I remember being on an elevator.  I know this was when I was a graduate student, because I had an office in Evans Hall.  I remember he and Lester Dugan getting on the elevator on the first floor, and they were talking about negative probability measures.  And he and Lester, they were going back and forth.  And then somebody else on the elevator said, "You guys should stop talking about that, because some graduate student is going to try to write their thesis on this now."  And so, it was really funny.  And David Blackwell, he was a presence, and he was there.  I met him a couple of times, attended a couple of lectures.  He became, I think, a member of the National Academy at some point, and there was a general set of lectures, or at least a lecture that he gave at [University of California,] Berkeley.  But I knew of him.  I didn't work with him.  I talked to him maybe a couple of times.
Speaker 1: You never took a course with him?
Speaker 2: Not that I remember, no, not that I remember.  But he was there.  I mean, probability measures and those kinds of things.  I mean, I think with hindsight I'm embarrassed to say that there were all these people who I just thought--well, you know you see David Blackwell in the hall.  You've just got to talk to him, you just kind of chat with him.  You never think about the fact that these guys are prominent.  As a matter of fact, there's a very famous mathematician whose name is Steven Smell.  I never thought that Stephen Smale was prominent.  He was just, you know, kind of a cool guy.  But his prominence, I mean, I really wanted to do my Ph.D. with him, but he was kind of booked up.  And so, I worked with Oscar Lanford who also did dynamical systems, mathematical physics.  But I never thought of these guys as being prominent.  You know, they were just kind of hanging out, they were there.  You know, you see them at coffee or tea and you chat with them.  The undergraduate part, I mean, I remember, I guess I don't remember a lot about it.
Story_ID: 25600
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you finished in '70 [1970]?
Speaker 2: I finished the undergraduate degree [in mathematics] in 1970 [at the University of California, Berkeley], in I think December, and I immediately went on to graduate school.  And I went on to graduate school because Calvin Moor--Oh, here's the story.  So, I'm sitting out in front of Evans Hall and I'm getting close to graduation, and Calvin Moore comes by.  And he's the guy who I'd taken this 206A course from.  And he comes by and he's sort of waving  his hand.  It looks like he's sort of practicing his backhand.  And so, he walks towards Evans, the door of Evans Hall, and he stops and he comes by and he says, "What do you plan to do next year?"  And I said, "I don't know."  He says, "I'll write you a letter of recommendation to any school you want to go to."  I had not thought about going to graduate school.  I had thought about where I wanted to go in graduate school, so I applied several places--
Speaker 1: What were your grades like, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: I mean, the grades were good.
Speaker 1: You had like--
Speaker 2: I mean they were decent.  I don't remember the GPA [grade point average], I don't.
Speaker 1: But you weren't struggling or anything?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  As a matter of fact, it was fun, but you know, I was taking these advance courses and thinking, "This stuff is really intriguing and interesting, but you know, I'm just--"  I also realized that I was competing with graduate students who had seen a lot more mathematics, had a lot more mathematical maturity.  And so I was struggling--struggling is too strong--no, struggling may be the right word, okay.  But I was learning this stuff and I was feeling good about what I was learning, but I already knew that there were other kids who were just, I mean, they were just jetting around.  And so, Calvin says that he would write me a letter to any place.  And by that time, I'd taken several graduate courses, and just thought this stuff was just wonderful, just really exciting stuff.  And I said, okay.  And so, Calvin wrote me a letter.  I looked around, and my parents [James Curry and Henrie Andrews], especially my father, he wanted me to stay in the area.  That's his vision, he wanted me to stay in the area.  And so, Berkeley was an option, go to Berkeley.  And then another miracle happened.  I got a teaching assistantship.  That wasn't the miracle.  But I applied to something called maybe the Ford Foundation, or some fellowship, and the night that I had decided that I was going to quit graduate school, the letter came telling me that I received funding for the next three years.
Speaker 1: The same--
Speaker 2: The same day.  I remember going home telling my parents, crying, because I thought I'd failed.  It was hard, it was challenging and I didn't know if I could do it.  And it happened, the money was there.  Amazing, I mean amazing.  And so, guiding--,guiding--,amazing.  Anyway, sorry, yeah, I hadn't thought about that in a long time.
Story_ID: 25601
Speaker 1: So, I want to go back just a little bit to 1969.  I don't know if you were there, but let's see, in January of 1969 at the Annual Meeting of the Mathematics Society, some graduates named Johnny Houston [also a HistoryMaker] and Scott Williams called together a group of African-American mathematicians.  And this group became the Black and Third World Mathematicians, which in 1971 changed its name to NAM [National Association of Mathematicians].
Speaker 2: NAM, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you there at the beginning?
Speaker 2: No I wasn't.  As a matter of fact, and this is reflecting on this discussion as we're having it.  I think about how in quote, unquote "isolated" I was, or maybe "insulated".  Because there was mathematics going on, there were these organizations going on, but I never felt the need to part of those groups.  Because at [University of California,] Berkeley at that time there were seven, maybe eight, Afro American graduate students there.   And we sort of knew each other.  Many of them went on and finished Ph.D.s.  I don't really know where they are now.  And that was a little community, and working on a Ph.D., I was, I burrowed into that work.  I mean, I liked the work, it was fun.  I had time to think.  And people were paying me, okay, and so that was really cool.  And so, I studied a lot, I studied a lot.  I took a lot of courses.  I enjoyed my time there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But as far as the organizations, no, I didn't know about NAM until maybe in the '80s [1980s].  Yeah, this is good.  I'll have to think this through.
Story_ID: 25602
Speaker 1: Now, did you, before we--well, you're going to be at Berkeley for a few more years during this discussion.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet Robert Bragg or William Lester [also HistoryMakers]?
Speaker 2: Bill Lester, yes, sure, sure.  Well, see, Harry Morrison knew everybody.  And he'd say "Hey," and this is Harry. "Hey, here's a brother that I want you to meet."  And so, we walked over to chemistry, and there's Bill Lester.  And Bill Lester was a mover and shaker.  I mean, I guess he still is.  But I mean definitely a mover and shaker.  I mean, he knew what he was going to do, and I mean, he had a plan.  And it's almost like I sort of stumbled through this thing (laughter).  I mean, there was, I mean, becoming a faculty member, all of those kinds of things.  I mean, getting a post doc, all of those things.  I guess--I remember people who sort of said, well you can do this, but no, no, no no.  Bill Lester, I did meet.  I remember Harry Morrison introducing me to him.  Bill Lester was standing in front of the chemistry building and, "Hey, there's this brother you have to meet."  And Harry was always, I mean, he was always making connections and chatting with people.  I mean, he was very, very much aware of the context.  And over time, you become aware of the context.  But as a student, I mean, "Who? Bill Lester, who is he, what does he do?"
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Robert Bragg you don't remember?
Speaker 2: No, Robert Bragg I don't remember.
Speaker 1: He's material scientist (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, Robert Bragg, sure!
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Sure.  Oh, he was about five-eight [five feet, eight inches].  Yes.
Speaker 1: Light-skinned.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I do remember meeting him, probably because of Harry.  And Mel Branch was there as well.  He was an assistant professor who subsequently came to [University of Colorado] Boulder.  But yeah, there were a few people around.
Story_ID: 25603
Speaker 1: Okay, so you go, like a lot of people we've interviewed in science or math, you just go right through, you know, to your Ph.D.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You didn't stop to savor the--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  Once Calvin Moore [at the University of California, Berkeley] said, "What do you want to do?" and I got admitted to Berkeley, I never looked back.  I mean, this was the pathway.
Speaker 1: Now, were you clear that it was a Ph.D. you were trying to get, not, you know, not a job or a master's degree or anything like that?  Were you clear at that time, once you started--
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I just felt, hey, I can keep going to school, that's cool.  And oh, hey, people are going to give me a TA [teaching assistantship], oh yeah, that's cool.  And then I got the funding from Ford [Foundation], and oh wow, I can stay here, I can do stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, let me now ask you about the part that only you can, you know, that I can't contribute much to at all--not that I'm contributing that much anyway, but it's the dissertation.
Speaker 2: You are. Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And your dissertation was entitled 'Transition to Turbulence in Finite Dimensional Approximations to--
Speaker 2: --the Boussinesq Equations'.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What's that about?
Speaker 2: Here's what happened.  In 1963, an atmospheric scientist named Ed Lorenz wrote down a set of differential equations.  These were three non-linear differential equations, three and non-linear.  Linear differential equations you can solve analytically.  Non-linear differential equations, you typically cannot write down a closed form solution.  And Ed Lorenz was studying a model of a fluid layer.  So, think of a saucepan.  In the saucepan you have heat at the bottom and it's typically cooler across the layer.  So, heating from below, cooling at the top.  And at some point, if you turn the heat up high enough, the water begins to boil.  That's a transition to turbulence.  So, if you turn up the driving force high enough, then the water will boil.  Well, what Ed Lorenz did was, he built a little model that only had three ordinary differential equations.  Three is really important here, because originally he had studied fourteen, and that was way complicated.  Then he had studied six, and that was way complicated.  And he finally distilled it down to three.  And three, he was able to see everything.  He was able to draw pictures.  He was able to, I mean, granted it's difficult to draw in three dimensions, but he could draw pictures.  He could look at computer output.  He could do lots of things.  And with three, he could run the numerical solutions very, very quickly.  He's the guy who created 'chaos' [Chaos Theory].  He was looking for a simple model that was not predictable, because he believed that the atmosphere is not predictable.
Speaker 1: This is the Chaos Theory?
Speaker 2: This is the Chaos Theory.  So, can the flap of a butterfly's wings in the heart of the Amazon jungle [in Brazil] cause a thunderstorm in Kansas [in the United States]?  Can a small change way away from everything cause a small change--cause a big change, somewhere else?  And that's chaos.  Small input, huge change, non-linear change.  And so, Ed came up with that set of equations in 1963, I mean, after working for a very long time, going from fourteen down to six, then he got to three.  And then in 1963, he wrote this paper, and he put it in the literature and nobody noticed for a long time.  And then around 1972, '73 [1973], lots of things began to happen.  For example, Stephen Smale, this faculty member at [University of California,] Berkeley, said we have to move from studying dynamical systems in an abstract way to studying more concrete systems.  So, we moved from abstraction to concrete models.  And then people began to look around for concrete models.  Jim Yorke, at the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland], he said are there simple systems where you can have very complicated behavior?  And Jim Yorke went down another path.  In the early '70s [1970s], David Ruelle and Floris Takens, European mathematicians, they discovered Ed Lorenz's papers.  And then my thesis advisor, Oscar Lanford, knew David Ruelle, and Oscar was doing some computing.  Oscar and I loved to compute.  And so, we did computing on that model.
Story_ID: 25604
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we were talking just now about David Ruelle, we were talking about Ed Lorenz--
Speaker 1: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: R-U-E-L-L-E, Ruelle.
Speaker 1: R-U-E-L-L-E.
Speaker 2: Right.  First name is David.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he's this really very, very prominent scholar who started out as a mathematical physicist and then moved into dynamical systems and did some really very important seminal work.  But in the early '70s [1970s], he grabbed hold of this idea of how does a system transition to chaos [theory]?  How does a system transition to turbulence?  There were several mathematical models out there, and Ruelle and Takins, they came along with another model of how it might transition.  And so, think of several watches.  So, you have--and these are pendulum watches or clocks--and so, they have these pendulums moving back and forth.  Suppose you couple two of them.  Then you may get this kind of swaying back and forth.  Suppose you now couple three of them.  What can happen?  And Ruelle and Takins thought that maybe with these three oscillators, you could get something very chaotic, so, three oscillators.  And so three for oscillators and three for Lorenz equations, my goodness.  Somebody said, "Hey, what's going on?"  And Oscar Lanford was the guy who said, "I don't know what's going on, but there may be something there."  And so, when he said there may be something there, he was working in one aspect of it.  And he said, "Take these equations, generalize them, and tell us what you get."  And that was what's called the generalized Boussinesq equations, finite dimensional normal approximations to them.  "Finite" means you just take a few differential equations, maybe twenty, maybe thirty, maybe fifty, but not the full system.  You just take a few.  So, you went from three, in my case, to fourteen, then to forty or fifty.  And I got some mathematics there, proved a theorem or two, got some nice numerical experiments done, got a really nice publication out of it, or two, and got a Ph.D. thesis.  And that was, I mean it was fortuitous.  It was this convergence of just all kinds of things that happened in the early '70s [1970s].  It was Ruelle, it was some of the work that Lorenz had done, it was the work of Jim Yorke, it was Oscar Lanford, it was all of those things sort of focused, and it became part of my thesis.  And it was great fun.  It was really, really great fun.  And oh, by the way, did I mention I wondered whether or not computers would be important for my future?  The answer was yes, yes, absolutely, absolutely.
Story_ID: 25605
Speaker 1: What was the state of computing in 1976?
Speaker 2: (laughter)  Okay, so here's a little story.  The Department of Mathematics at [University of California,] Berkeley had just gotten a PDP-11 computer, a PDP-11.  And a PDP-11 was also a tape machine, and all of that kind of stuff.  And it was more powerful than the computer I worked on when I was in high school, but it was a super mini-computer, super mini-computer.  And this super mini-computer, it would take hours to do these simple calculations on this particular model we were working on, this 14 variable model.  And it would take hours to do things.  And at one point, my program on the machine was taking so much time that Oscar Lanford said, "Oh, you have to punch up these cards, and you have to get this program and move it from this machine onto the big machine downstairs in the basement, the big machine."  So, the big machine was a Control Data 60-400, maybe 6600, but it was a Control Data machine.  Control Data, recall, was the company that had bought out Bendix.  And so, I had now a box of about 2000, 3000 cards.  And you take this box, you take it downstairs and you give it to a technician.  They read it into the card reader and then you wait for several hours before your output comes.  And I also wanted to draw some pictures, and I wanted do to other things.  And I wanted to do an analysis of this problem.  And I was looking for chaos [theory] in this system.  I was looking for the transition to chaos in this new system.  And so, I went from that computing environment to PDP-11 to the Control Data machine running with cards and big decks of cards.  And there is, again, a whole culture of people who were sort of playing with big decks of cards.  There were guys who would walk around with six boxes of these cards, man.  I mean, they were really cool.  That's 12,000 cards (laughter).  I mean, it was just sort of, I mean, it was a culture unto itself, a culture unto itself.  But I ran the experiments, got some decent results, proved some theorems, got a Ph.D., and then the next step for me was to go to Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia].  That was just after the Ph.D.
Story_ID: 25606
Speaker 1: Now, was, how did you feel about earning your Ph.D.?  I mean, that seemed like a big thing, and how did your father [James Curry] and mother [Henrie Andrews] feel about that?
Speaker 2: I got a job.  My dad wanted me to have a job close to Oakland, California.  My job was at Howard University in Washington, D.C. [Dictrict of Columbia].  He didn't like it so much.  My mother didn't like it so much--, but let me back up a bit.  Before I got a Ph.D., I went to France for nine months with Oscar Lanford.  He had a sabbatical, I believe, and this was in 1975.  And I went to Le Juch, and I went to Bures sur Yvette in Paris, just outside of Paris.  And so, I'd started international travel then.  And here's a kid who had grown up in West Oakland whose parents had respectively a third and sixth grade education, who was walking around the streets of Paris, who had fellowship support from the Ford Foundation, and so I could relocate to Paris.  And so, I stayed in Bures for nine months, went to Le Juch, Chamonix, and saw a little bit of--let's see, I also went over to Warwick and thought, wow, this is really something.  I guess I didn't think about how transformative it was at the time, but yeah, it shaped me.  I mean, it shaped how I thought.  It also showed me the world stage, really for the first time.  And the world stage, wow.  I mean, that's where we play.  That's where mathematics is done.  And I hadn't appreciated that.  I hadn't really appreciated that.  I gave a lecture at one of the international mathematical physics conferences, and I didn't think very much of it.  I didn't think of it as a big deal.  They asked me to give a talk.  Okay, I'll give a talk.  And then with hindsight, it was a big deal.  I guess I don't think about those things as being big deals.
Speaker 1: Does it seem bigger when you look back on it now?
Speaker 2: Now, I can now see how others might interpret it as a big deal.  For me, it was just my life.  I was living, I was doing things.  Oh yeah, going over to Warwick, yeah, I'd never been to Germany, okay.  Oh, what am I going to do there?  You're going to give a talk?  Okay, that's cool.  I mean, do they speak English in Germany?  You know, you give your lecture and you move on.  I never really, really thought about it as being a big deal.  I never thought about it as anything more than, oh, this is what you do if you're a mathematician, this is what you do.  I was at Howard [University] for one year.
Speaker 1: Just one second--
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh huh--
Speaker 1: How many months were you in France?
Speaker 2: About nine months, yeah.
Speaker 1: About nine months?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, this is 1975?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '75 [1975].
Story_ID: 25607
Speaker 1: And then you took up a position at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia] in '76 [1976]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1976.
Speaker 1: And you officially then had your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Well, see, here's the story.  I had done all the work for the Ph.D., but I graduated in August.  The position at Howard started in September.  And so, I'm driving across country.  I mean, all the work is done, and the thesis is submitted or will be submitted etcetera, signed off on all of that stuff, done.  And so, I mean, the transition, and you said this earlier.  Going straight through, I mean I went from the bachelor's to the master's to the Ph.D. to Howard, and there was virtually no transition there.  I mean, it was just sort of, well, this is what you do.  "Oh, hey, I got a job."  "You got a job?  Oh, man, that's great."  And then I drove across country.  I drove across country with a guy who also graduated from [University of California,] Berkeley.  His name was Gerald Sasaray.  We were both faculty members at Howard.  Gerald is now deceased, several years ago.  But he worked at Howard for a very long time.  I was there for one year, and then I got a post doc[toral position].  The post doc changed my life.
Speaker 1: what was that one year like?  I guess you were teaching--
Speaker 2: (laughter) I mean, come on.  I grew up in Oakland, California.  I had never been around the historically black anything.  I mean, I had gone to Oakland Technical High School.  I had gone to Berkeley.  All of those are places where there are few black folks.  And man, I got to Howard and it was like say, what?  People are standing on line, it's a historically black college.  I mean, it is this place.  And I taught, I mean I taught among the best and the brightest there.  Learned a lot.  Learned something about the history of the institution.  But Howard was different.  It was really different for me.  I hadn't ever experienced it.  I didn't know what to expect.  It was a first foray to the East Coast.  I mean, just all kinds of firsts were happening there.  And at the end of, during the first year, I invited this guy, Warren Washington [also a HistoryMaker] to come and give a talk at Howard.  And he pointed out that oh, there are some post doc positions at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and maybe you want to apply for them, and all of that.  And I said, okay, and so I applied.  I got an NCAR, National Center for Atmospheric Research post doc.  And I went in 1977 and arrived at NCAR during the summer of 1977.  So, I stayed at Howard for one year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 25608
Speaker 1: Then, so NCAR, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, took you to the University of Colorado [Boulder]?
Speaker 2: Well, okay--
Speaker 1: No, I said--
Speaker 2: Yes, that is right.  But here's the story.  So, remember I had finished my Ph.D. [at the University of California, Berkeley] in 1976.  I had taught for one year.  And after you finish your Ph.D., after I finished my Ph.D., I felt like I didn't know anything, really did not know anything.  I had some ideas, but didn't know anything, and so I needed some time.  And so I went down, I went and got the post doc at NCAR, and went down to the University of Colorado at Boulder.  And there were people like Wes Wilson there.  He's a dynamical systems type.  Robert Easton was there.  He's also a dynamical systems type.  And that year at NCAR let me begin to meet some of the people in dynamical systems.  Richard McGeehy of the University of Minnesota [Minneapolis, Minnesota], for example.  And I learned more dynamical systems in that year, I felt, than I'd learned throughout my entire thesis work.  That's not true, but it was a different kind of learning.  And I decided, okay, Colorado has these people who do dynamics, and so I went down and just, I mean, I think the correct phrase is "trouble maker".  I went down and just sort of, you know, would chat with people and interact with people.  And as I was leaving for MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], they offered me a position at [University of] Colorado [Boulder].  And I said okay.  And so, now, here's a story told by a theoretical physicist.  He said, "You are one of the few people that I know at one point who had a position at MIT, who had a position at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia], and you had a position at Colorado.  So, you had three positions at one time."  I said yes to everything.  I thought I was going back to Howard.  I thought I was going to stay at MIT for only a year.  I thought that Colorado was really never going to turn into anything.  And I never went back to Howard.  I was at MIT for two years, and I've been at Colorado for about thirty-five years.
Speaker 1: MIT took place, when, in '78 [1978]?
Speaker 2: MIT was, let's see.  MIT was '78 [1978], '79, [1979].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I was there for two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I was officially on faculty at Colorado, but I was really on leave from Colorado at MIT for two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was transformational.  I got to sit roughly three to five days a week with Ed Lorenz, talking about chaos [theory], talking about dynamics, talking about weather, talking about prediction.  And then I got to meet some of the critical faculty at MIT.  I got to meet people like Lou Howard, who's just one of the greatest mathematicians, I think, ever.  I mean, MIT was just, I mean--
Speaker 1: Lou Howard.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think he's someplace in North Carolina now.  He retired from MIT.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet Norbert Weiner?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, no, no.   I'm not even sure if Norbert was alive then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he may not have been.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But I did sort of pop over to the math department and figure out what they were doing.  But see, there was an applied math department and a pure math department there, or maybe an applied--there was a math department and maybe there was an applied math group.  But the people in applied math, they did real physical experiments.  I mean, they worried about things like rotating fluids.  They worried about physical applied math that was focused in and around geophysical sciences in some cases.  And so, that synergy between physical applied math and theory, I mean all of that was just sort of thrown together.  I mean, it was pretty exciting, pretty exciting.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  So--
Speaker 2: I remember an experiment that Harvey Greenspan ran, where he was looking, he and one of his post docs, or one of his students, were looking a dam breaking, and they worried about what the surge would be like.  I mean, and so he had this cylinder filled with blue water, and every so often the student would push a button and it would just simply raise this cylinder up, and then it would just flood this plain that was there.  I mean, real experiments.   Yeah, it was good stuff, good stuff.  And computing was, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 25609
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you're publishing works during this period, too, right?  You published something with James Yorke.  I don't have all of your publications here--
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Speaker 1: --but there some here that are highlighted from the website.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, here's the Yorke story.  I gave a talk at the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] when I was at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia].  And I was talking about my thesis work, the 14 Variable Model.  And I met this guy named Jim Yorke.  And Jim Yorke was an (unclear)--I mean, just very, very bright, very capable guy.  And he, I mean, he gave his talk--I gave this talk.  And then after being at Howard for a year, I went to the National Center.  Well, the National Center had just gotten in a CRAY-1 computer, Model Number 14.  And nobody was using it.  And so, Jim Yorke and I were corresponding back and forth, and he said, "Oh, you ought to take a look at this map and run some computer experiments on it."  And so since nobody was using this super computer, guess what?  You could run 100 experiments on the super computer on this particular map.  I mean, and by the way, solving a 14 variable differential equation takes time.  Iterating the map takes almost no time.  And so, guess what?  You run this little map, and they also had this really nice output system where you could output things to microfilm.  And so, I would produce forty frames, fifty frames.  And then I'd send them off to Yorke.  And Yorke got really excited because we were looking at--so, you take a circle and it has a particular structure.  And you twist it, you shear it in a certain way.  And by shearing it, you create periodic orbits, you create some dynamical structure.  And Yorke wanted to figure out how a circle might break down.  And so he ran the experiments.  We did some work.  We wrote a paper that appeared in Springer Lecture Notes, or something, and people thought, "Oh, that's really nice."   Excuse me, I didn't think very much of it.  I mean, it was, "Oh, yeah it's cool and Jim Yorke is cool."  And then the next thing that happened was Michel Ano in France, he did some work on the Ano Map, or he created this new map.  And David Ruelle was interested in that one, and so I could do some work on that.  And so, I mean, it was, yeah, it was interesting.
Story_ID: 25610
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, you're at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] for two years?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Anything about MIT you want to tell us before we get you back in Colorado?
Speaker 2: Oh, MIT.  I saw the original machine that Ed Lorenz worked on.  It was an LPG-30, either PG, yeah PG-30. And he said the following.  So, here's a little Ed Lorenz story.  So, he had worked on this machine and worked on this machine.  And somewhere in my files in Colorado, I actually have a printout from this machine that Ed Lorenz gave me.  And he said that he worked on this machine and then they got this new machine down at NASA Goddard.  The machine down at NASA Goddard was like a thousand times faster than the LPG-30.  He said when he could run on the NASA Goddard machine, he said he turned off the LP-30, and it was just simply this, I mean it was sort of like the Zenith radio.  I mean, it just became sort of this artifact.  But that was an Ed Lorenz story.
Story_ID: 25611
Speaker 1: Back to Colorado.
Speaker 2: Okay, alright.  So, back to Colorado.  You're now working for the National Center of Atmospheric Research [NCAR, Boulder, Colorado].
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was there for a year.  I worked with a guy named Jack Herring there.  Jack Herring, he did turbulence.  Well, he's still alive.  He did turbulence compilations.  And I had done this transition to turbulence, and so I got to work with Jack Herring and also deceased now, Steven Ursog.  And we did a two-dimensional model and we did a three-dimensional model.  We did a side by side comparison of the two.  And that was kind of a nice study.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Let's see.  I've got two papers going at once here.  Let's see.  Okay, so you got a chance at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] to meet--
Speaker 1: George Hardy, Edward Marlow Christenson, Lou Howard, Harvey Greenspan.  Who's the guy, Villa Marcus, just a bunch of people who were just, with hindsight, unbelievably prominent.  Then they were just kind of, you know, just folk, just folk.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Very nice people, though, very nice people.
Speaker 2: So, back at the University of Colorado.  Now, Warren Washington [also a HistoryMaker], you know, he came down there in '87 [1987]?
Speaker 1: Let's see, '87 [1987], I don't know.  The date's there.  But Warren has always been sort of a presence.  When I was at MIT, I mean, he was the person I would contact.  When I became a faculty member at CU, he was there.  There was a back and forth, at least for a while.  There was a back and forth for me between NCAR and Colorado, because NCAR, they let you compute on their big machines, I mean, and that was really cool for me.  And then at some point--
Speaker 2: So, you were on the faculty of University of Colorado?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you teach very much at all?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, sure, sure.
Speaker 2: And then you were at NCAR too, at the same time?
Speaker 1: Yeah, back and forth.  I mean, either in the summer or just visiting or just walking in, or using their computer.  So--
Speaker 2: NCAR, I'm sorry--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: NCAR was in Boulder, too?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, sure.
Speaker 2: Okay, I--
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry.  And so the University of Colorado, Boulder sits sort of here.  NCAR sits sort up on top of the Table Mesa Drive, and so there's just a long winding road.  And the National Center for Atmospheric Research was designed by Ian Payne.  I think maybe the building was physically built in the early '60s [1960s] or so.  And Warren, I think Warren has been there certainly since the early '60s [1960s].  And he, well, he's a very prominent guy.  Which by the way, I had not appreciated until--you know, these guys, they're just nice people, just really nice people, yeah.  But Warren is a person who's been sort of--and I said this earlier, every so often, you know, there are these times in my life when, you know, somebody says, oh, go do this versus this.  And so, if you listen--perspective--they have context.  And so, Warren was certainly a person like that.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, so--
Speaker 1: He's a good friend.
Story_ID: 25612
Speaker 1: So, what you did at NCAR [National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, Colorado], is that you were, it was applied math, I guess--?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: --your mathematical skill applied to some of the atmospheric models--
Speaker 2: So, there were atmospheric models that we looked at.  So, think of the ground being very warm, and above the ground being cooler.  Well, that's the problem I studied in my thesis, where you were heating something from below and cooling it at the top.  That's atmospheric science.  It's called convection.  And so, there are models of convection, lots of models of convection.  And I studied those models.  I studied small models where there were only fourteen variables.  I studied big three-dimensional models and two-dimensional models, but it was all in and around atmospheric sciences.  Then I got some nice publications there, and then I had a graduate student work with me for a while named Douglas Winsand.  And we studied lots of models that were intermediate between the models that have virtually all the physics in them, and some other ones.  I'm not going to talk too much mathematics here.  But you should do more math, do more math (laughter).
Speaker 1: You should talk about it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  No, it's very, very exciting.  But that pushed me off towards applied math.  I had never thought about it being any different from math, but it was math focused on applying, focused on getting answers, focused on predicting, focused on trying to tease out what might be true.
Story_ID: 25613
Speaker 1: Alright. Okay.  We were just talking off-camera about Professor William King, University of [Colorado] Boulder.  And he advised you about your contract?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  William King.  So, before I joined the faculty at CU [University of Colorado] Boulder--they'd made me an offer and all of that, and there were two prominent people there at the time.  One was Bill King, and the other was Charles Nilon.  So, Charles Nilon, he was the first Afro American to be hired at CU Boulder.  And he's a professor--he was a professor of English.  He died maybe ten years ago now.  He was a professor of English.  And he told the story of walking around in Boulder neighborhoods saying, "Hello, my name is Charles Nilon, this is my wife, Mildred.  We would like to buy the house in this neighborhood.  Would it be okay?"  And so, here's this black couple asking permission to buy a house.  And Charles was very, very thoughtful.  He loved literature.  He played with the language.  And he could rip you apart with just the language because, I mean, he spoke it so well.  Bill, on the other hand, Bill King, William King, Professor William King, he was a firebrand.  I mean, "Hey man, negotiate everything, get what you can.  I mean, these people, they'll pay you."  I mean, he was just sort of--he was at some level the opposite of--.  Earlier in the discussion you had mentioned the 60s [1960s].  Bill King, for me, was a child of the 60s [1960s].  I mean, he knew [Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.], he knew Malcolm X, he knew who the prominent people were.  I mean, you do understand, he's ethnic studies professor.  And so that was, I mean, that was part of the context of his scholarship.  But, I mean he was just so different than Charles.  But yeah, I talked to Bill.  And he just retired, just retired in May.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Story_ID: 25614
Speaker 1: Now, I don't want to speed too fast, but like, now, what is the--I guess the Cray [supercomputing system manufactured by the American supercomputer manufacturer, Cray Research, Inc., which was founded by Seymour Cray] high performance computing system played a big role in these early days at University of Colorado [Boulder] and at National--
Speaker 2: Well, it was really at the National Center for Atmospheric Research [Boulder, Colorado].  It was a super computer.  It was one of the fastest computers in the world.  And the National Center for Atmospheric Research, because part of their mission is doing fundamental research in the atmospheric sciences, they want to be able to predict the weather at least a day ahead, okay.  I mean, predicting the weather yesterday--well, what happened?  Okay, it just doesn't work.  And so, they get these monstrous machines.  And so, I had access to those machines, and that was really quite fun.  But for me, what I did was, I used them to do experiments in and around dynamical systems and Jim Yorke's stuff.  I mean, I used them to discover things about Julia sets and Fatou sets and Mandelbrot sets [mathematical set of points in complex dynamics, named after mathematicians Gaston Julia, Pierre Fatou and Benoit Mandelbrot, respectively].  And so, I was one of the people who early on said, "Let's use these computers to do some dynamical systems."  And it was exploratory dynamical systems.  It's sort of something that people do now, but thirty years ago, no, nobody was doing that stuff.
Speaker 1: Now, thinking back on what the Cray [supercomputing system] was capable of doing, what, I mean today, you know, what would be--I mean, do we--
Speaker 2: Ah--
Speaker 1: How does it measure up to what we have today?
Speaker 2: I hope it's not hyperbole for me to say that your laptop, maybe with a graphics card accelerator, is more powerful than the Cray-1 computer.  And so, in your Mac [Macintosh, Apple, Inc.] laptop, or in your Dell [computer brand] laptop, with the accelerator, you can do all those computations now.  And so, you can explore more.  You can find more subtle things now.  But exploratory dynamical systems is convenient.  But, I mean, that's been the upward march, right?  I mean, who was I talking to?  I was talking to someone about doing some numerical simulations now.  I mean the National Science Foundation [NSF] has all these centers now, at least several centers, where they have these super computers.  And the generation, there's Blue Gene, and Blue Gene 5 and 29.  But these monster machines, I mean, back in the '70s [1970s], you couldn't even--I mean, now they're talking about doing  teraflops.  Then, they were just talking, you know, a billion operations or so, a million, two hundred million operations a second.  I mean, you can do that on your cell phone (laughter).  You don't even think about that stuff anymore.  I mean, it's just been--well, anyway.  But the algorithms have gotten better, the hardware has gotten better, and the mathematics, the applied mathematics, has gotten better.
Story_ID: 25615
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, well, in the '90s [1990s], you had several students who went on to get Ph.D.s?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.
Speaker 1: I've got a little list here.  I don't know if it lists all of them, but Martha Nesbit, Scott Herritt, Linda Sunby--
Speaker 2: Sunby, yeah.
Speaker 1: Laura Billings--
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, thank you.  I don't think I, again, counted.  Laura Billings is now a full professor at Montclair State [University, Montclair, New Jersey].  And I just saw her about a week ago, two weeks ago.  She was in Denver [Colorado] at a conference called Dynamics Days.  And I was also there, of course.   And she's doing extremely well.  Scott Herritt works in private industry.  Let's see, Martha Nesbit, she lives in Boulder [Colorado], works for the [National] Center for Atmospheric Research, until possibly recently.  And who is the fourth one?
Speaker 1: Linda Sunby is a faculty member at, I believe, Metro State [Metropolitan State University] in Denver.  There's this old statement that says "Once you have visited Colorado, you're doomed to ever remain there."  And Linda Sunby--I think it's called Chief Nawa's Curse.  And Linda Sundy, well, she was cursed by Nawa.  But I think she's also doing extremely well.  Yeah, I have four students there.
Speaker 2: Four students, okay.
Speaker 1: And currently I have a student whose name is Richard Charles.  He is Afro American.  He's working on a problem on image analysis, image processing.  And he's making good progress, and I'm hoping that he'll finish at least by August of this year.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Richard Charles.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Richard's pretty cool, Richard's pretty cool.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 25616
Speaker 1: Now, in '95 [1995], the first Conference for African American Research in Mathematical Sciences was held in, I don't know where it was held.  Did you attend?
Speaker 2: I don't remember when I started attending those, but I remember going to several.  There's a very, very prominent mathematician, and you should interview him, named Bill Massey [William Massey; also a HistoryMaker].  And Bill Massey is the guy who's been pushing those ideas.  And he's been really, really doing an excellent job, I mean, I think literally single-handedly. He's been reinforcing and creating and worrying about the Conference for Afro American Mathematicians.  I mean, he's really, really quite good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's important work.
Story_ID: 25617
Speaker 1: At some point during that period of time, I got on the path of becoming the first associate chair in the Department of Applied--well, associate director of [the Department of] Applied Math at [University of Colorado] Boulder.  And then I became the associate chair of applied math of the department in 1996, and then that's when it became a department.  And then I became chair of the department in, I think, 2003.  And so, teaching, research--I mean--teaching, did lots of research.  I mean, it began to sort of move further to the background, just because of time.  I mean, that always happens.  I was very good doing administrative things, and I wanted to see this Department of Applied Math created at Boulder, and I spent a lot of time doing that, a lot of time.
Speaker 2: Now, by this time, now, had you married or had kids or anything?
Speaker 1: No, never married, no kids.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: As a matter of fact, I have often now thought about that, and thought about the single-mindedness, thought about the passion for doing--the passion that led from one thing that I got excited about to another thing I got excited about, to another thing I got excited about.  And I never thought about, I never thought about family.  I never thought about those kinds of things.  That saddens me.  I think if I had really been good, I could have done all of it, but it never happened, never happened.
Speaker 2: Now, did your father [James Curry] keep trying to bring you back to Oakland [California]?
Speaker 1: (laughter) So, here's the story.  I was offered a position at the University of California at Davis.  And my dad really wanted me to take that position.  [U.C.] Davis is a really good school, prominent.  I mean, lots of things would have been positive about taking the position.  But my dad said, "Well, that would just bring you closer to home."  And he really wanted me to be--I mean, he loved the idea of my being just an hour and a half or so away.  And I pointed out that "Well, you know, if anything happens I can get on the airplane in Denver [Colorado], I could be there in three or four hours, and so it's about the same."  And I liked being away from home.  I liked being, I liked establishing myself in Colorado, plus Chief Nawa's Curse.  I really loved Boulder [Colorado].  I mean, it's clean.  You can see the mountains, you can walk around, there's always good food.  I mean, the people are decent.  I mean it's just, it's a nice community.
Speaker 2: And they make Celestial Seasonings [tea] there.
Speaker 1: (laughter) Yes, Celestial Seasonings tea.  But by the way, I've never visited their tea-making operation.
Story_ID: 25618
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Now, you've done a lot of travel in regards to being a mathematician.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They say math is the international language.
Speaker 2: It is, it is.  Recently, most recently, I had two trips to Vietnam.  And those were again, life-changing.  I first went to Vietnam in 2005.  In Vietnam, I was on a mission.  The National Research Council invited a group of scientists over to interview some Vietnamese kids who wanted to come to graduate school in the United States.  The United States has the best graduate training program in the world, and some of these very bright kids really wanted to come here.  And I was invited to interview some of the kids.  And so I went.  And I sat on the panel for mathematics and computer science, and maybe electrical engineering.  And after being in Vietnam in 2005, I also wanted to be there again in 2007.  And so, I was there from 2005 to 2007.  And from '05 [2005] to '07 [2007], it really changed.  It really, really changed.  There was more a sense of hustle and bustle and prominence, and world stage, etcetera.  And whenever I talk to kids now, I say, "You're not preparing to be a student in Colorado or in Boulder [Colorado], you're not preparing to be a worker on the East Coast or on the West Coast.  You're now international.  That's the competition.  Everything you do, and everything you're preparing yourself for, it is for the world stage, the world stage.  We can't guarantee (and my father [James Curry] would have wanted this), you can't guarantee that you're going to stay in Oakland [California] all of your life and have a great life there.  I mean, the more education you get--I mean, you'll move around, you'll work for companies, companies that have international offices now.  And so, you may be in China tomorrow afternoon."  I was talking to a--I've never visited China, but I was talking to a colleague yesterday who spent two weeks in China--just, I mean, and got back on Sunday.  I mean, at the National Science Foundation [NSF], they want you to think about international travel, because mathematics are international.  And you're trying to position the United States and its students and its population for this international stage.  And so, this is amazing place for me, amazing place.  But you had another question.
Speaker 1: Well, I was just trying, so--in Vietnam--I was thinking when I saw this that, you know, a NAM [National Association of Mathematicians] member in Nam, you know--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  You're right, you're right.
Speaker 1: You never were drafted or anything--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no, I was never drafted.
Speaker 1: I guess what you're saying about your father, he never served either, right?
Speaker 2: He did not serve.
Speaker 1: In World War II, or--
Speaker 2: No, he did not.
Speaker 1: He was in that in-between age.
Speaker 2: He was.  And he also was an asthmatic.  And maybe that had something to do with his issue around breathing and lungs at Sinclair [Oil Refinery, Texas].  But, no, he never served.
Story_ID: 25619
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in 2008, you were appointed Associate Director and Professor of Applied Mathematics.  Is that, is that something new?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  So, let me back you out.  I was associate director of applied math from essentially '96 [1996] until 2001.  I was associate chair.  And before that, I had been associate director of the applied math program.  So, I was the associate director of applied math for about ten years, and then I was the associate chair for about three or four years.  And then in 2003 I became chair, and I was chair from 2003 until June 2012.  So, for nine years I was chair.  And that was also transformational.  And then that led to the position here at the National Science Foundation [NSF].
Speaker 1: Now were there any other black faculty members in the department?
Speaker 2: So, there's Keith Julian, and Keith is an Afro Brit.  He was trained and born in England.  He's very talented.  And he's maybe twenty years, maybe eighteen years younger than I am.  So, he's that new generation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he's on the faculty of the University of--
Speaker 2: He's on the faculty of [University of Colorado] Boulder now.
Speaker 1: At Boulder, okay.
Story_ID: 25620
Speaker 1: Now, in 2006 you received a $1.3 million grant from the National Science Foundation [NSF].
Speaker 2: Yeah, called Mentoring Through Critical Transition Point Grant.  I was a P.I. [principle investigator].  There was a team at [University of Colorado] Boulder.  Our goal was to transform the way mathematics was taught, get more students involved in doing research earlier, giving them small stipends, and essentially trying to prepare them for the world stage.  And we made some progress there.  The grant ended in 2012.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Was there some progress made?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, sure, sure.  And I think we had one Afro American student, one.  Not good.  As a matter of fact, part of the reason I'm at the National Science Foundation now, I'd love to better understand why STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics] areas don't attract under-represented Afro American students.  I mean, what's the bottleneck?  Why don't we get to Ph.D.s?  Or if we get to Ph.D.s, why do we take positions in business, industry or government?  Why do we do that?  What's the barrier to entry for the Academy?  I don't know the answer, but I'm very curious about that question.
Speaker 1: Do you think it might just be the lack of models in the community that are involved on the Ph.D. level in mathematics?
Speaker 2: I think that's part of it.  I think--remember, what I described for myself was a sequence of handoffs.  I mean, from Edward L. Dry to Mary Perry Smith, to Don Sarason, to Calvin Moore to Harry Morrison to Warren Washington, Raymond Johnson, Jim Donaldson, to just sort of that pathway.  And so, I'm connecting the dots now, but for many students maybe there is no Mary Perry Smith.  And then, you don't go on to a [University of California,] Berkeley.  Or maybe there is no Harry Morrison, and so you don't stay in the Ph.D. program, because the pathway was really frustrating.  And I told you the story earlier about thinking that I was going to leave, and then getting the money from the Ford Foundation.  I mean, it's--going after a Ph.D. is frustrating.  I mean, staying in the pipeline.  My student Richard [Charles], who I mentioned, he has three kids, he has a full-time job, and he wants a Ph.D.  I mean, he is passionate about doing the math and getting the Ph.D.  I mean, I find that phenomenal.  Oftentimes, it's a young person's game, because you have distractions.  But you can manage them if you have resources, either teaching assistant,  research grants or something.  You can manage the distractions.  But if you've got a family, how do you do that?  And so, I think the door opened and I ran as fast as I could.  And there were people who said, "Oh, do this, don't do that."  "Do this, go here, do that."  And so that guided running along that pathway.  I think that got me here,that really got me.
Speaker 1: Now your story--seems like there was a fortuitous, you know, set of circumstances that led to you achieving what you were able to achieve.   And some people would say it's destiny, some would say it's God, you know.  There's a lot of ways.  Has anybody ever calculated the mathematical probability--
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Speaker 1: --of producing a Professor James Curry, you know, like from West Oakland [California]?  You know, I mean, because you say you don't understand why.  But has anybody ever really tried to calculate the probability of--
Speaker 2: There's a very famous guy who received prominence, some prominence during the financial crisis.  I mean it's still going on, the crisis is still going on.  But his name was Nassim Taleb, and he will give a talk here at the [National Science] Foundation [NSF] sometime later in January [2013].  And what Nassim Taleb did, he wrote a book called 'The Black Swan'.  Here's the hypothesis:  The fact that you only see white swans does not mean that there are no black swans.  The fact that there are no--you don't see Jim Currys, that doesn't mean that Jim Currys don't exist.  We are, I don't want to say rare events, but I think given the opportunities, the guidance, etcetera, re-connecting the dots, I can look back and say, "Oh yes, this person, this person and this person."  But I can also say that I persevered, and there were people who helped me persevere.  There were structures that helped me persevere.  Now that I'm at the National Science Foundation, I look--and I know that the National Science Foundation has goals, intellectual merits and a proposal and broader impacts.  Broader impacts I construe to include under-represented minorities and women, populations that are typically not represented, say in the math sciences.  I want to see my colleagues do something in this regard, because I know that there are some Jim Currys out there.  And if we can tap into them when they're in middle school, elementary school, and move them along, in other words, pathway, I think more could be produced.  But think, it took me forty years to get here, maybe fifty years to get here.  And that's a lifetime.  I want to make certain that fifty years from now, there will be more, many many more.
Story_ID: 25621
Speaker 1: This leads me to a question--we don't have a lot of time left, but this is a question we always ask.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African-American community today?
Hope: lots more education.  Hope saying, "Hey I can do this.  Yeah, it's going to be hard, yeah, it's thankless, yeah, they pay you pretty well.  Yeah, you can have a good career, yeah you can have a good life, all of those things, yeah."  Concerns:  Not many kids seem to be on the pathway.  There needs to be, in my opinion, some major interventions that say, "Hey, you can do math, you can do science."  My story was I saw all of these guys in white lab coats, and there was Sputnik and the science, and people were going to the moon, and all of that.  It just grabbed my attention, and I said, "Yeah, that sounds exciting."  And I never thought about the fact that it might lead to me becoming a full professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder.  But with hindsight, I can see all of the people who helped me become that full professor and also get here to the National Science Foundation [NSF] now.  What I know is that it takes a long time.  And so, the nerdy kids--is it worth it?  Yeah, it's worth it, but my parents thought about long term.  They thought that maybe, well, we won't do it, but maybe you can.  That sense of long term.  Instantaneous gratification, that's a concern.  Wanting to be a millionaire by the time you're fourteen, yeah, that's going to happen for some people.  Or, you're going to create a company and be a millionaire or billionaire by the time you're thirty.  That's going to happen for some people.  But perseverance, staying the course, figuring out strategies that say, "Oh yes, I was knocked down, but hey, I'm going to get up and I'm going to make the next step."  Figuring out cognitive strategies that say that you can do that, feeling comfortable that you can do that.  General optimism.  I think that all of those things have been sort of part of my life.  Concerns:  Not more of me.  Concerns:  Students are not willing to sometimes make that investment.  And it's an interesting path, and it does pay off.  The only lesson I've learned in my forty years of being this person is that more education beats less.  And education always pays off, always.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25622
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything that you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could change it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably have a family, probably have a family.  But pathways are complicated.
Speaker 1: Now, are your parents still alive?
Speaker 2: No.  My mother [Henrie Andrews] died in '96 [1996], father [James Curry] died in '92 [1992].  And so, here's the story.  As I was--I'd just buried my mother, and I got on an airplane and came back here [Boulder, Colorado].  I got in my car and I was driving back to Boulder.  And I could almost hear a book closing.  I knew that that part of my life was over.  I didn't know the history, the history of the family.  I mean, that's a great sadness for me.  I would have tried to figure out strategies and doing things differently.  Getting my dad to talk, getting my mother to talk, a history.  Because with a history comes context.  With the context, you can begin saying oh, so-and-so in the family was pretty good in math many generations ago.  They were good problem solvers.  They were effective at doing that.  I don't know a lot of that. And that, it's troubling.   But yeah, I think I'm making progress.

Speaker 1: Okay.  When you back, again, on everything you've done to this point, what do you think your legacy is in the field of mathematics?
Speaker 2: (laughter) I have no idea.  Ah, I wrote some nice papers.  Hopefully, the legacy will be the people.  So, what was done for me--this mentoring, this pushing, this guidance, this direction.   So, in my real job when I'm at [University of] Colorado [Boulder], that's what I enjoy doing because I know that I am touching the future every time I get a student to do that.  So, what was done for me by Harry Morrison, Mary Perry Smith, all the rest, that's what I think will be my legacy.  Mathematics, I mean I've done some mathematics.  It's been, I think, good and decent, but I don't think that that will be--I like people.  I like--I know that the people can transform the future, and I know mathematics will help in that transformation.  But I what I really want to do as my legacy, is increase the base of people who are going on into math and science.  That's what I really want to do.  That's what I hope my legacy will be.
Speaker 1: And is there anything we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Why aren't I taller?  (laughter).
Speaker 1: It's probably not in the mathematical formula.
Speaker 2: (laughter).  Okay, good.

Speaker 1: Okay, what's your last question, sir?
Speaker 2: The last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 1: Oh, gosh.  Fair, respectful, had impact, made a difference.  And the difference I think will be people, people.  Every so often I get e-mails from students.  And they'll say, "Hey, you may not remember me, but you changed my life when you said this."  I don't remember saying it.  But I think about Mary Perry [Smith], I think about Harry [Morrison], I think about--yeah, okay.  There's a little bit of push there, a little bit of push, a little bit of change.  I think maybe that's not so bad.
