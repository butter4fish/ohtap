Story_ID: 7217
Speaker 1: Start with the early years, what are your earliest memories?
Speaker 2: Earliest memories, 5910 South Michigan, Chicago, Illinois.  We lived on the top floor of what was the family homestead.  My cousins lived in the same building.  I guess I must have been two, two or three years old.
Speaker 1: Would you describe your mother and father individually?
Speaker 2: Yes, I will start with my mother.  Mother was born in Columbus, Ohio, 1914, Caucasian, went to Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio]; did not graduate, became radicalized during the early thirties [1930s], and became a Baha'i.  And her name is Ruth.  And to understand Ruth Alexander, you would have to understand how intellectually she used the Baha'i faith as an azimuth [or compass] for her life in terms of what she believed in and the choices that she made, including how she decided to name her children.  I'm named after a martyr in the Baha'i faith.  And the lesson there, my mother said was, "that you had to commit yourself to something larger than your personal interests."  And the standard against which I measure is that there was a person who could have kept his life if he had recanted his, his beliefs.  Mother--basically was a housewife, and health problems, but totally committed to the Baha'i faith.  Father [William Foster], born in Chicago [Illinois] 1912, African American and European American and American Indian, but primarily African American; went to school--eventually went to Armour [Institute of Technology] Tech in Chicago, which is now Illinois Institute of Technology.  And as a, a young colored man coming up in the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s], as he once told me, he said, "If you were halfway conscious and you were black by the 1930s, you were either a Communist, you were a Garveyite [follower of Marcus Garvey], a Baha'i or something."  Otherwise, I mean there's just--and that's because of the contradictions of, of racism.  And he became a Baha'i in the 1930s.  And that really also became his azimuth.  He was a--he did not finish college.  He was in a small construction company, but in Chicago because construction was segregated, you could never get the big jobs.  And also he refused to cut up apartments into kitchenettes, which is the way the black middle class made a lot of our money, when--on the South side of Chicago, off of black folks coming up from the South.  And we'd--so he was a--in construction.  He was a master draftsman.  I can go on and on about him.  But--physicist by hobby, and worked on the Manhattan Project, one of the few Negroes to do that in the World War II, and most of his life was spent largely either teaching or working in various construction, mining industries, etc.
Speaker 1: Can you tell a little bit about the Manhattan Project?
Speaker 2: The Manhattan Project was the project then to create the atomic bomb.  And that was housed in Chicago at the old Stagg [Field], at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], the Stagg--not amphitheatre, but the gym.  And that's where they assembled the team to build the atomic bomb.  He--my dad was a master draftsman, and some of his drawings were just works of art.  But because also physics was his hobby, he played the role of sitting with the scientists who were trying to figure out how to do certain things.  And they would talk physics and sketch.  And then he would take those thoughts and then begin to design the kind of equipment that would be necessary to do the experiments, etc.  So he played a, played a, play, played a key role.  Interesting enough, he was never really proud of that because the atomic bomb was dropped in, in Hiroshima and Nagasaki [Japan].  And even up to the day he died, he wouldn't talk--I'd ask him, and he'd say, "Well, you know, things may still be classified, and he died in 1995.
Story_ID: 7218
Speaker 1: Who were their parents?
Speaker 2: Okay, my mother's [Ruth Alexander Foster] side, I know not that much because when my parents got married, her side of the family disapproved of an interracial marriage, and also she became a Baha'i.  So I really know--actually, I never met any of her relatives, even though they were in Ohio.  I may have as a, a baby, but I have no memory of that.  So the family history that I know is my father's side.  And it begins with the towering figure of Sarah, who was my great grandmother, and was born--I'm not sure whether she, I think she was born a slave in Virginia.  But Sarah was a towering figure.  And later was a force here in Washington, D.C. in terms of--they owned a house which was used as a place of meeting of powerful white politicians who had their girlfriends.  And so Sarah was part of that housekeeping group.
Speaker 1: Sarah's full name?
Speaker 2: Sarah--Dixon, I have a photograph later which has whole--name, but she married Mr. Johnson.  So that's, that was her married name, but Sarah Dixon--the Dixon is the, is Virginia (unclear).
Speaker 1: And this was about what, what time?
Speaker 2: Oh, she was born around 1860, '61 [1861], yes, maybe--actually, she was born just after--her, she's buried in Chicago [Illinois] at Lincoln Cemetery, and I can find out exactly when she died.  But in any case, she was born and raised in Virginia, from the end of the Civil War up to the beginning.  I think she died, actually, died in 1928.  So she must have been born in 1870s, '60 [1860s], '70's [1870s] something like that, long life.  She was the housekeeper for the Governor of Maine [sic, U.S. Senator].
Speaker 1: In Washington [D.C.]?
Speaker 2: No, in Maine.
Speaker 1: In Maine, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, [U.S.] Senator [James G.] Blaine, but she basically was part of the family, and as housekeeper, that's the top job.  So up in Augusta, Maine, and she married into a Negro-American Indian family in Augusta [Maine], the, the Johnsons and the Williams, and they're all buried in Gardner, Maine, which is just next to Augusta.  So she was really the power, the power figure, and when her husband, who was an organizer for the International Knights of Labor, he organized against the owners of the shoe industry in Maine and basically was run out.  And the Blaines and others gave money, and that's how the family moved from Maine to Chicago [Illinois].  Her husband--the stories of him was he was a kind man, very little about, about him.  Then there's my grandmother, Rebecca and my grandfather, Will.  And Will [William D.] Foster was one of the first black movie producers.  He was ubiquitous in terms music publishing, newspapers, Bronzeville Chicago, started "Chicago D" [Chicago Defender newspaper] sold it to old man [Robert Sengstacke] Abbott.  He was advance agent for William Walker minstrel shows.  He worked the national campaigns for old man Pullman.  He was the manager of Roscoe Simmons, who was Booker T. Washington's nephew, a great orator.  He would smuggle diamonds and, and horses from Mexico, and drunk a pint of gin a day.  And that marriage did not last because I think Sarah finally said, that's it.  And so Will and Rebecca were divorced when my dad was, I guess, a teenager.  But I do recall my grandmother, Rebecca [Taylor Foster], and I have a sister--I have two sisters [Tahirih, Zarrin] and two cousins, both female--I'm the only boy.  I'm the only man child.  So as long as Rebecca was alive, I literally had very special status.  So I have very, very fond memories of grandma, but never met Will Foster.  He died before I was born.
Story_ID: 7219
Speaker 1: What kind of child were you?
Speaker 2: What kind of child was I?  Easy going and peacemaker, and a runner.  That's in the family, liked to be out on the go.  So a favorite day would be to get up in the morning and have my breakfast, leave the house, and I'd be gone, and I couldn't tell you where I'd be going; and hang around with my friends, and just sort of enjoying the flow of life.  So I, I was a peacemaker, not particularly bright.  I mean I was, you know, I was well mannered because if I wasn't well, well mannered, there were consequences, real consequences, real consequences.  And I grew up in a, in a community where people looked out for each other.  And we were living at 69th and Cottage Grove [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  And I happened to be at 63rd and South Park [Avenue] fooling around on the 'L'.  And somebody saw me.  Now, this is a good fifteen blocks from my house.  And someone called my mother by the time I got home, you know.  So I was, I think I was a well-mannered, polite kid.  And, well, often a little bit of a mischief maker, would get into--if somebody had an idea to do something exciting, I was generally probably tag, tagging along and wanting to participate, setting off firecrackers, things like that.
Story_ID: 7220
Speaker 1: What was your community like?
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting, the community of the South side of Chicago [Illinois] was pleasant, warm.  We were, basically, my community was between 68th and 69th Street, Evans.  And so our rivals were the Langley Street group, okay.  So growing up on the South side of Chicago, I had jobs hauling groceries, working in barbershops, selling 'Jet' magazine, going to the Tivoli movie house at 63rd and Cottage Grove.  It was, it was, it was a pleasant community, clearly segregated.  We knew that.  But we had people of varying economic and social status.  So it wasn't economically.  I know we would walk by Ernest J. Wilkins' house when he lived on Evans just off 67th Street on our way to school.  We'd say that's where Julius, this guy got his Ph.D. University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] at the age of thirteen.  Well, we couldn't go to the University of Chicago and hang around because they would run us off.  But we knew that somebody in our community had got a Ph.D. at that institution at the age of thirteen.  So that was one side of the community.  The other is that because I was given a name of a martyr in the Baha'i faith, Badi, in the early or mid-'40's [1940s], you know, "What kind of name is that?"  I was always aware that there was another, something else beyond the South Side of Chicago.  And so we would go, once a week to Wilmette [Illinois] where the Baha'i House of Worship would be.  And that's where I'd interact with kids from other backgrounds, etc.  So--and that was also a warm community.  So therefore, when it came time for family to move to Africa, I was not, not prepared to do that.
Story_ID: 7221
Speaker 1: Well, my parents were Baha'i, so they decided to be self-appointed, self-financed missionaries (laughter).  This is what they believed in.  So when they decided to move to Africa, we had no choice.
Speaker 2: How old were you?
Speaker 1: I was thirteen--twelve, thirteen, twelve.  There is an expression that says "my calamity is providence."  To me that was my calamity.  I was senior patrol leader.  I marched in the Bud Billiken parade.  I had my little jobs.  Eddie Williams and Eddie Cooper and Willie, and, and Willie James Fuller and I had just won the talent scout at [James] McCosh [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  I mean everything was fine.  Why did we have to move to this place in the world that I only knew through Tarzan movies?  Well, well, my calamity is my providence.  Fast forward, I had to move to Africa.  I had to learn other languages.  I had to learn to manage change.  I had to learn to overcome adversity.  I had to learn that oppression could be caused because of your tribe, your nationality, and it wasn't purely because of race.  So I got a vaccination from this disease called American racism.  And it, I knew when I was catching hell in Chicago cause I was a Negro that that was man-made.  God had nothing to do with that, okay.  So you can see that now at the age of sixty, I have an enormous advantage over people my age because of this exposure of having left the United States.  So it turns out to be my providence.  If I had known in the beginning, I probably wouldn't have whined as much, but--.
Speaker 2: So you were where in Africa?
Speaker 1: Family, mostly was, I was mostly in Morocco.  My family lived in Liberia.  My father was the first Baha'i missionary in Liberia and is still known, you know, as the father of Liberia.  And what I find, found ironic is that I work for the Phelps Stokes Fund, and the Phelps Stokes Fund has a long, long history with Liberia.  So, in, in deciding to accept this position, one of the issues that I had wrestle with was would I be able to do as well as my father had done.  And they'd gone to Liberia with nothing, and here I am with the Phelps-Stokes Fund, and--anyway, it was mostly Liberia, family in Liberia and Morocco and then later, I traveled and worked in other parts of Africa.
Speaker 2: Your family was in Liberia and you were in Morocco?
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  We lived in Morocco for a number of years.  Then the family moved to Liberia.  They were over for about twenty years.  And I came back.  I went to college.  When I came back to go to college at University of Denver [Denver, Colorado] , they had moved from Morocco to Liberia.  And they did not come back until 1967.  So they were gone from the early '50s [1950s] to--my dad went over about two years before we did.
Story_ID: 7222
Speaker 1: So what was school like in Morocco?
Speaker 2: Well, it was interesting in the sense that I looked like a Moroccan, and these were the days when Morocco was a colony, were protected with France.  So I'd catch hell because they thought I was an Arab (laughter).  And I would say, wait a second, I catch hell because I'm a Negro in the United States.  I get over here, I catch hell because I looked like an Arab, and, of course, I had a first name which means "wonderfulness" in Arabic.  It's one of the ninety-nine attributes of God, okay.  So I grew in, in Morocco again, in this very interesting situation of being perceived as if I were a native, but I wasn't.  At one point, I became so adamant that I changed my name from Badi to Buddy.  And I had a radio show.  And after about two years, I realized, wait a second.  If you have a problem with my name, that's your problem, not mine.  So I switched back to Badi.  Now, every once in a while somebody will contact me or I'll bump into somebody, and they'll say, there's Buddy Foster.  And I will cringe inside, okay, saying what was I thinking?  Well, what you were thinking of at the time is that you really wanted to, in this case, emphasize your Americanism so that you didn't get beat up by the French cops.  But the other aspects of growing up in Africa and Morocco particular, extraordinary.  I met people from all over the world, refugees.  At one point, I boarded with a man who was traveling on League of Nation papers.l I met revolutionary from--who were in exile.  So when it came time to study history and to understand the development of social and economic political development, that came natural to me because I had been exposed to, to all of these people, languages, cultures, you know, that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: What were your teachers like?
Speaker 2: For the most part, very dedicated, very dedicated.  My classes were small, often as small as five.
Speaker 1: An American school in Morocco?
Speaker 2: It was an American school in Tangier, right.  And I had two teachers for two years, Elson Manter (ph.) who taught me English and history for two years.  And Mr. Biethly (ph.) taught me math and science for two years, Madame Amar (ph.), French, Dr. Sahabataba (ph.) taught me Arabic.  And I grew up, they knew me, small classes.  So, very fond memories of those teachers.  And I guess that probably also influenced me in terms of what I wanted to do with my life and, you know, what I'm think I'm good at, some form of teaching.
Speaker 1: Of those, who, who most influenced you over your elementary, high school, Chicago, Morocco?
Speaker 2: Well, I think in elementary school, Mrs. Gardner, who was my second grade teacher at [James] McCosh [Elementary School, Chicago,Illinois], Mr. Spears, my fifth grade teacher at McCosh, oh, how can I block on her name at St. Edmonds, oh, my goodness, Mrs. Crawley, Mrs. Crawley.  So that would be elementary, and then high school would be Mr. Biethly and the people I just mentioned.  But I was influenced greatly--I was boarding with a, an American Anglo family, the Buckinghams.  And they'd been there for many years, and they had a hotel.  And so they would have guests--that's where I met Tennessee Williams and all of these writers and artists.  And some of them stayed, Paul Bowles, people like that.  So while they weren't my, formally my teachers, they really, I think my high school years, really sort of influenced me more so, looking back, than maybe perhaps my classroom teachers.  And I guess that's why I encourage people to, to look for knowledge, not just simply in the, in the formal classroom setting, but--.
Speaker 1: So you boarded with them?
Speaker 2: Boarded with a family in Tangier.  My, my parents were living in Casablanca [Morocco].  And so I'd go home once a month or once every six weeks.
Story_ID: 7223
Speaker 1: What was your relationship with your siblings?
Speaker 2: Well, my older sister Tahirih--she who must be obeyed--very close.  My parents would say, while we're away, you are to do exactly what your sister says.  And even if she's cruel and unjust, you do it.  When we get home, you may appeal (laughs), okay, but other than that, you do what she does.  And Tahirih is iron-willed.  And she's two and a half years older than I am.  So if people are really gonna, if bullies were gonna pick on me, they knew they had to deal with Tahirih.  And you do not want to, you do not want to take on Tahirih.  Tahirih and Marion Wright Edelman have certain qualities, okay, and this persistence.  And once they get their teeth in, they won't let go, bossy or whatever.  And I love Marion and I love my sister.  So she was a great influence on me.  And then my younger sister was born thirteen years, well, there's thirteen years difference.  And I started boarding--I moved to Tangier [Morocco] to board with the Buckingham family.  And so Zarrin is my younger sister, but it's like almost a different generation, you know.  And I love her greatly and, you know, but we've never really had that much time together.  But all in all, we're very, very strong. And the Foster family, when the call goes out for assistance, there is no hesitating.  There's no question.  You respond.  Once you've gotten the person out of the trouble, then you can sit down, and you can say, well, look, how did this happen?  And how do you make sure it doesn't happen again.  But we have such a relationship that if the phone were to ring right now, whatever I have, it's theirs.  And that's, that's a wonderful feeling.
Story_ID: 7224
Speaker 1: Where'd you go to college?
Speaker 2: Went to the University of Denver [Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 1: How'd you pick there?
Speaker 2: How did I pick that?  It was second choice.  I wanted to go to Antioch [College, Yellow Springs, Ohio].  My mother wanted me to go to Antioch.  I graduated from the American School of Tangier [Morocco], which was not accredited.  And we had to take these standardized tests, which, well, never taken them.  And those were the criteria used, you know, the test scores.  And then if you came from accredited high school.  So Antioch turned me down.  I appealed, got turned down the second time.  And I had been at--someone suggested Georgetown [University, Washington, D.C.], and my mother knew me well enough to know that if I had ended up at Georgetown, I would have been with the diplomatic crowd, because mind you now, I had grown up in Tangier.  I was socially far more advanced than the seventeen year olds, languages, diplomatic receptions, the whole thing.  So Washington would have been a piece of cake.  I probably would not have studied, whatever.  So my cousin, Marion, had gone to the University of Denver.  And my mother said, okay, Denver would be a good place.  Being there were only thirty-three thousand Negroes in the state of Colorado in 1960.  So she said, "If the Mexicans and Indians are catching hell out there, you're likely to be lynched because having living in Africa, you know, as a teenager, you have different attitudes about who's gonna tell you want to do.  And if--she knew if I'd gone to a place where there was overt oppression, I probably would have opened my mouth and got in trouble, etc.  So--and then also I had had asthma in Africa and Denver was elevation, so for all those reasons, ended up at the University of Denver.
Speaker 1: Now, Marion was your cousin?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Whose child was she?
Speaker 2: My father had one sibling--well, that's not quite true, one sibling that I'm aware of.  I think he has some half brothers or sisters, but in any case, his one sibling, Marion, had two children, little Marion and Sandra.  And those are my cousins.
Story_ID: 7225
Speaker 1: In your neighborhood, what are some of the sights, smells and sounds that remind you of your home, your neighborhood, your community?
Speaker 2: Spring clean up.  The adults in the neighborhood would organize to clean the block.  So everybody got involved, and you swept up, except for newspaper drives.  The smell of hauling those newspapers, the smells of Mrs. Flowers' grocery store on 67th Street, the--Mr. Tatum's tobacco shop where you bought papers, the old streetcars.  We had streetcars on Chicago's South side.  Foods, my best friend was Willie James Fuller.  And his folks came up from Georgia, which is how I really got exposed to black Southern culture.  And I would go to church because my parents believed in exposing me [to religions other than their own Baha'i faith].  So I went to Mount Olive Baptist Church, it was a storefront church.  And Moses Fuller preached  ,you know, he was a freckled, red-haired guy.  He worked for the gas company.  And they would--that's where my first exposure to chitt--first and one of the last exposures to chitterlings.  I mean that's when I knew you had to trust somebody.  But foods, other smells, the fall, burning leaves and playing in the neighborhood, smells the cloak room at [James] McCosh [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  You'd have your wool jacket, and the steam and the wet jacket and the steam.  And, of course, in those classrooms, the, the desk were bolted to the floor.  And the smarter you were, the further you were in the front.  And the dumber you were, you were in the back, okay.  And I was, was somewhere in, in between, but the odors of crayons and those steam heaters--it's an interesting question.
Story_ID: 7226
Speaker 1: Tell me something about the--your, your experiences as a Baha'i?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all I'm named after a martyr in the Baha'i faith.  And the Baha'i basically believes there's one God, one planet, one people, so basic unity.  And there's unity in diversity.  And so, therefore, a very explicit value system that you were to live your life.  Service to mankind if worship of God.  That's how I was raised.  So while I'm not a, a fanatic in terms of religious expression, the, the values and the beliefs of the Baha'i faith go to the very core of who I am.  As I said earlier, I'm named after someone who could have saved his life if he had recanted his faith. So when I met Nelson Mandela, I told him, aside from Nelson Mandela and my father, these are people who could have--their lives could have been a lot easier if they had simply recanted what they believed in.  So I think that, that has an enormous impact on me.  Secondly, that I'm to be judged by how well I improve life, okay, and that ultimately, all this material wealth is not gonna make, the baggage won't make the flight, okay.  So don't worry about commum--accumulating material wealth.  What is it that you do it?  So, I guess those are religious beliefs, and then watching my parents [William & Ruth Foster].  My parents who were middle income people, I mean not wealthy by any stretch of the imagination, for them to decide that they were gonna leave the United States, the South Side of Chicago [Illinois] where, you know, you could have built some material, housing, etc. and wealth, for them to say they were going to Africa because of their beliefs, in the early '50s [1950s].  So I have by the example of my parents, you know, people who stood for something beyond, you know, the immediate self interest.  So that had an enormous influence on, on me in terms of--and then the basic unity of humankind.  It means when I see someone who is so different from me, it isn't just a cousin.  It is a human being.  It is a member of my family.  It's just somebody that I haven't seen before.  So I just begin with that assumption.  This is a member of the family that I got to get to know.  And I think that that is, you learn to realize that if you believe in racism which is a virus, that the only solution to that is spiritual.  And that, things you have to do if you're a black person is you have to guard against that virus eating at you.  So when I moved to Africa, and I saw that cruel and unjust punishment was meted out based on other criteria, other than race, I said to myself, "Okay, that's further evidence to me that, in fact, if I want to avoid being sick by racism, even when I'm assaulted, then I spiritually have to be focused, okay, not that it's very easy."  But at least consciously, it, it gave me an enormous advantage.
Speaker 1: So there you were on the South side of Chicago, a Baha'i, which was different, a different name, with a family that was a little different--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --looks are a little different, how did that all feel to you?
Speaker 2: I, I never really felt different.  I mean first, skin tone in our community, you had people lighter skinned than me, far darker skinned.  That wasn't the issue.  I guess there weren't that many interracial marriages on my block, but almost everybody, somewhere along the line--and I don't, I don't know how my mother--maybe she may have, might have had some experiences where she felt that she was not part of the community, but I don't seem to--I don't have a memory of that.  The first name, Badi, yeah, you get over it.  Where'd you get that funny name?  Now, fast forward in the '60s [1960s] when I was at Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] chairing the African American States programs, people said, "That's a bad brother" --"And the man changed his name" (laughs).  You know, and I said, no, no.  You've finally caught up (laughs).  I had this name starting in 1942.  So, but I was never ostracized so there was a capacity of managing diversity--and this is the irony.  I guess the constrictions of racial segregation forced us on the South Side of Chicago to manage diversity, okay.  And it really wasn't until the '60s [1960s], '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s] where, you know, we moved to the suburbs, etc. that perhaps there was less tolerance.  But, no, growing up inclusive, and then going to Baha'i events, I mean, by definition, you know, your diversity was celebration.  I mean we were all flowers in the same garden, you know, it's beautiful, all the different kinds of flowers and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: You went to, to a Baha'i church like once a week--.
Speaker 2: Once a week, yeah, all the way up to the North Shore, to Wilmette [Illinois], by public transportation.
Speaker 1: The whole family?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, yeah, that's a long trek, particularly in the winter, when the wint--when wind's blowing.
Story_ID: 7227
Speaker 1: You went to Africa--Morocco, tell me something about that.  What was that, what was your experience like?  You just went over. You told me you, that's--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --that was disruptive, you know, to your life.  But what happened when you got there?  What was the, what were your experiences like?  What was your relationship with your family?
Speaker 2: When I got there, first of all, I remember when we landed, I saw a dog.  And I turned to my mother, and I said, "Well, this can't be that bad, at least they have dogs here."  Now, this--mind you, this is coming from a kid, South side of Chicago [Illinois], so you knew how ignorant we were about Africa.  And I'm coming from a family that is reasonably well educated, yet I still have those kinds of biases.  This is the, the mid-50's [1950s].  So I think the first thing was to realize that my image of Africa was shaped far more by Hollywood, even though my parents had books.  It just didn't sink in.  We weren't taught in school much about Africa.  I guess the second thing is that all of a sudden, I look like I belong to the majority.  Now, in this case, France--Morocco was a protectorate, and the Moroccan Independence Movement was, was starting.  So people, bombs in cafes and violence, terrorism.  And the French cops were brutal.  So they took one look at me, and I was a "Arab", okay.  So, I mean and I can remember issues of trying to get an identity card to prove that I was an American because my mother encouraged me to make friends among Moroccans.  So at a very early age, I had Moroccan friends.  I was at their homes, etc. and really learning the culture.  Now, that turned out to be a great advantage later, you know, like most--unlike most other Americans who might live in their own American enclave, I mean I literally had lots of Moroccan friends.  Well, I'm thrown in a situation in which they're fighting for their independence.  So at the age of twelve, thirteen, you're politically aware now of colonialism and, and then asking yourself, well, that's pretty much what we had to deal with in Chicago, you know, in terms of fighting for Civil Rights.  And this is before Brown vs. Board of Ed [Education of Topeka, Kansas].  So I think that I was aware coming into Africa of this, this notion of anti-colonialism and the search for identity.  Now, it's fascinating that you ask that question because many years later, I was a Fulbright scholar.  And I went back to Morocco and spent a year in the shanty town to try to answer a question about Woodlawn on the South side of Chicago cause I was curious as to why my community in Chicago in the '60's [1960s] just imploded, where it just, just collapsed.  Well, why did that happen?  And I ended up going to, living in a shanty town in Morocco interviewing people as to why their world was turning upside down.  It all hinges on issues of identity.  Who are you?  Okay, and how do you know who you are, and so, therefore, what should you do?  So as a teenager going to, to Africa, first of all by definition as your teenager, you're struggling with your identity, a man, was it American, a Negro.  I mean I was raced to be Ralph Bunche or Ralph Bunche was my standard.  I wasn't very good in athletics so I wasn't Jackie Robinson.  So Ralph Bunche, Walter White, you know, these people who stood up to fight for the, the, for the cause of justice.  So I guess in Africa, when I got there in the midst of this anti-colonialism and this search for independence, that probably had a greater impact on me than I'm even aware of myself.  At least I now have an intuitive feel for the debates about political identity and social identity and how do we build new societies cause that's really what the colonialism was all--and, of course, that's the issue, as an African American, that we're, we're still dealing with today, what kind of society do we build based on what, what set of values?
Story_ID: 7228
Speaker 1: Who were your friends in Morocco?
Speaker 2: Who were my friends?  Oh, tons of friends.  Well, one--the first Moroccan friend was Abuhaq Benese (ph.), Muhammad Torres, Muhammad Naseri (ph.), Latvian fellow Yanis Balgulvis , Robert Buckingham, and there's Bohemi Narandus from India, George Waldheimer from Germany, Macheeto Benraba (ph.).
Speaker 1: Let me ask you the smells, sights and sounds question about Morocco?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all I'm allergic to donkeys, camels, and so I suffer from asthma. So in Morocco, you go into the traditional parts of the cities, the Medinas, invariably I'd get an asthma attack (laughs).  But the smells there are clearly spices, you know, and then, of course, incredible vegetables and flowers.  The flora and fauna of Morocco is comparable to California in terms weather and whatever so it's sounds of studying in high school.  And there was a, we called it the 'Donkey hotel'.  These people would come in from the countryside to the markets, and they would, their donkey stall was across the street from the school.  And so invariably around 2:30 in the afternoon, one donkey would start braying, and that would trigger the others, and you'd have a chorus of, you know, ten, fifteen donkeys, braying and, and generally, that would happen when one of our teachers that we didn't like would be trying to, to teach.  And we, we--but the smells, the sounds of--Morocco is, had a traditional city and a modern city.  And you look at the dress.  One day people would be wearing traditional dress, out of the fourteenth century, and the next afternoon, they're wearing the latest European-cut suits.  So you had these, these differences, if you will.  You go to Moroccan homes, they have two living rooms.  They had a traditional living room, Moroccan living room and they had the European.  So I found that--and cuisines, etc., I guess that's another thing that, that struck me, this duality of how Moroccans were handling, wanting to be Western, yet wanting to be Moroccan.  And, of course, that spoke directly to me in terms of racial identity and what does it mean to be African and American or I mean [W.E.B] DuBois, you know, black and white, black or white or whatever.
Speaker 1: What was your typical day like with, with interfacing with your family and friends?
Speaker 2: In Morocco?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Well, I was boardering--boarding with the Buckingham family in Tangier [Morocco]. So that was the last three years, three and a half years.  So the typical day when I was living in Casablanca with, with my family was different from the typical day--which one would you like?  (laughs)
Speaker 1: Both.
Speaker 2: Both.  In Casablanca, up 7:00 o'clock in the morning, breakfast, off to school by 8:30, out of school at noon with two hours lunch; come home, you have your lunch, you take a little nap, and then you get back to school.  We're out at 5:00 o'clock, maybe a little bit of sports.  And then homework.  And then you're home in bed.  Thursday afternoons, you, you got out, vacation and Saturday afternoon.  So the weekends were the time when you could go out and play, go to the movies.  And Sunday was the big day, in Casablanca at least.  We'd go to the movies or we would just walk up and down streets.  And so in Tangier, the typical day--I was older, living away of home.  The Buckinghams sort of gave me a great deal of freedom.  So I would sometimes not get home until 8:30, 9:00 o'clock at night, and my parents did not know that at the time.  So I would spend time in coffeehouses.  We had a group of, about twelve or fifteen of us, boys and girls.  We'd just hang as a group.  And there was no, you know, dating in the sense that, you know, you're paring up or whatever.  But you just were, like a crowd, and you just moved.  So the last two years of high school were extraordinary, you know, and particularly during the summer where you really didn't have much to do other than go to the beach and play volleyball, soccer.  And then we would make parties, and different people would sing, and we'd pool our money and buy soft drinks or what--it was interesting.  Once I think about it, never--I don't believe I ever saw anybody drunk.  People with a glass of wine, you know.  No, water was all around, hashish, you know.  I didn't know anybody who took drugs.  So it was, those high school years in Morocco were, particularly in Tangier, going to different houses, to people's houses for lunch on Sundays or Saturdays and Sundays.  And there might be ten, twelve, fifteen people at lunch.  And there'd be people who were refugees from Russia, people who were revolutionaries out of South Africa or Ghana, people from other parts of the world, writers, artists.  And I can remember--in fact, there's a book that some students gave me just recently called 'The Alchemist.'  And it is basically, an archetypal story of the journey of life.  Well, at the center of it is a little town called Tarifa, Spain.  Well, my bedroom was, looked out over the Straits of Gibraltar to the town called Tarifa.  And I just was, it was unreal that someone gave me this book for Christmas.  And I read it, and the setting is Tarifa and Tangier.  And it took me back to those teenage years, okay, and my journey.  And that was extraordinary period when I look at it because I was exposed to so much.  And that later in life helped me enormously when I, when I stop and think of it.  But typical days were basically lots of studying, school starts at eight till noon, two hours lunch until four or five.  And then homework.
Speaker 1: And the Buckinghams were right there with you?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were, extraordinary family.  He was American--the Buckingham Fountain in Chicago [Illinois] is his family.  And she was a British citizen, and her parents were missionaries in Turkey.  And they opened a little hotel called the El Farhar Hotel in the 1930s in Tangier [Morocco].  And that became a center for spies.  That's where Tennessee Williams, Paul Bowles, a whole bunch of characters, they used the Hotel El Farhar to do many things.  And so in the '50s [1950s] when they would pass through, the hotel was closed, but the Buckinghams still had a series of cottages.  And they would show up.  And the Buckinghams just basically treated me as a member of their family.  So that's how I got a chance to take a shower with the pretender to the Spanish throne .  I was taking a shower at the, after having played tennis, and this guy walks in.  And he's starting to shower and we start talking, and I'm talking to him.  And then I finished, and I go into the dressing room, and there is Mr. Gonzalez who is the Duke of Torasoto (ph.), the owner of Gonzalez Byass Wineries [Cadiz, Spain].  And I said, oh, "Mr. Gonzalez, how are you?"  He said, "Oh, I'm fine.  I'm escorting Don Juan, who is the father of Juan Carlos, the current king."  And then this guy walks in, and we continue to talk.  And so I've seen a king naked, you know, (laughs); don't think that would have happened on the South Side of Chicago.

Speaker 1: Let's go to University of Denver [Denver, Colorado]? Tell me something about that experience?
Speaker 2: Well, there were only thirty-three thousand Negroes in the whole state of Colorado in 1960.  So the racial atmosphere for Negroes was a lot more tolerant than if you were Mexican or Indian.  Second, the University of Denver was a private institution so that my first exposure was with racism.  It was a combination of two things, one I had been away from the United States.  So I had no high school experience.  So I felt at a lost.  I interviewed my roommates, went through their yearbooks.  You know, what do you guys do with high school.  I was just trying to--cultural knowledge.  The other was, issue was racism.  In Denver, 1960, it was, it was there, it was a little subtle.  None of the fraternities would accept Negroes.  My best friend was dating interracially, and he was called in the dean of students and said, you cease or you're out of here.  This is in 1960.  The, there was a sort of benign neglect, if you will, around issues of race on campus.  Other than that, I benefited by studying international relations.  And because of my background in Morocco and my languages, etc., I really got an excellent undergraduate education, in fact, took courses, graduate courses.  And the head of the department was Joseph Korbel, [former U.S. Secretary of State] Madeline Albright's father.  [U.S. Secretary of State] Condoleezza Rice studied under Korbel.  George [W.] Shepherd [Jr.] and a number other scholars--African scholars.  And then I was very active in, in campus politics.  And a group of us, because we were not ad--admitted to other organizations, we started our own fraternity.  Black fraternities had been banned.  So we heard of Rayford Johnson who was a very--Olympic athlete, decathlon champion for UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  And he belonged to a fraternity called Pi Lambda Phi.  So we found out about that, and it turns out it was Jewish fraternity, but liberal, not like some of the more conservative, you know.  Anyway, one thing led to another, and we created a chapter.  And in terms of admission, we said, you know, on the day that you're supposed to rush, the first nineteen people across the doorstep, you're in (laughs).  And so we collected all of the misfits.  But all of us were incredibly talented.  So within a period of four--three or four years, as a small fraternity with no money, we won the trophy for grade point average, athletics, politics.  And we threw the best parties.  So, you know, Everett Beck, from Southeast Washington [D.C.] was a fraternity brother.  He ran track.  You had other people from Montana.  So, the experience at [University of] Denver on campus was one in which you struggled academically--you wanted to do very well, but then you, you wanted to be accepted.  So, it, it wasn't as brutal as I'm sure it would have been if I'd gone to the University of Alabama or, or some other institution where the racial lines were really hard.  But clearly, we knew that we had to prove, we had to be twice as good, and without having an attitude.  And I must say that fraternity, the relationships that we had among these young men, to this day is one of the positive memories I have of what can happen when you sort of come together and try to help each other.
Speaker 1: So you've been a leader all along.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's interesting.  I've doing a lot of thinking about "leader".  And, of course, leadership is ex post facto (laughter). You're not a leader until you've actually led something.  And I think to the extent that I, I am a leader in certain areas, it's because of this notion of having to fight for the right, which goes back to the moral principles, you know, how you're supposed to judge your life.  You came in this world alone; you're out alone.  How will you be judged?  My parents [William & Ruth Foster] said, your life is like a tapestry, you know, good things you do, that's a green color; bad things you do are red.  You'd better hope that when it's all over, they look at your, at your rug and they say, well, this is a wonderful green rug with some speckles of red (laughs), okay.  And I think if you're driven from that perspective, then when you confront racial discrimination or unfairness, you stand up and--I'll put it this way.  You have to have a straight stick to know what a crooked stick is.  I know what the straight stick is.  Now, do I have the courage all the time to stand up and say, that's wrong and I have to do something about.  I'm sure there are times when I just sort of turn my head.  But more often than not, I have to say that's wrong.  And I guess that may be the leadership, just simply standing up and saying, that's wrong, and what are we gonna do about it.
Story_ID: 7230
Speaker 1: --behind me, he boarded at the Buckinghams.  I was the pioneer.  I got the Buckinghams into that business, so to speak.  They used to have the Hotel el Farhar [Tangiers, Morocco] and then Las Casitas el Farhar, which was just, about ten of these cottages, which they then turned into, you know, where you could board.  So I was the only one for two years or three years.  They had one son who was in England, Robert, who would come back for vacations.  And then he fell ill one year, and stayed for a whole year.  And he became a very good friend of mine.  So I was really adopted by the Buckingham family.  So when they would hold their dinner parties, I was automatically invited.  So that's how I got the chance to sit next to people.  And the dinner would start.  They'd have their little cocktails at 8:00 o'clock [p.m.], and then the bell would ring, and then in they would go for dinner at 8:30, quarter to nine, and then dinner is over by 10:30, and then back into the sitting room, had these discussions.  So it was being part of their family, if you will that gave me this incredible exposure to people, to languages, you know.  So that's the, how the Buckingham family came to influence me.  And my mother, years later, she said, you know, I always said prayers for the Buckinghams because really, you know, they've done so much for you.  And I didn't understand, cause I recall once coming home on a weekend, and I was now eating with, European style.  And my father said, what kind of airs are you putting on (laughs), okay, because Americans cut the food, then put the knife down, and they, they eat.  Well, so here I'm eating this way.  And, not that he was disparaging in that comment, but he was saying, you know, you're being influenced by other kinds of people, all the habits or whatever, which he didn't have.  But the basic values of the Buckinghams were congruent with my, my parents.  And so that's how, even more than my high school teachers, it was the people who came in and out of that household that shaped me enormously.  And, mind you, they, they lived outside of town.  So I lived on, this--it's called the mountain, and my bedroom overlooked the Straits of Gibraltar.  So days when you were a frustrated, depressed teenager, I'd go and sit on a rock and look out on the Straits of Gibraltar or look down at the beach, which was the Jews River.  The Jews River, that's the first settlement of Jews being expelled in 1492.  So I'm--I'd see the pillars of Hercules, you know.  And so it was, it was a very rich experience, particularly as an African American, you see because once you're exposed to that, and then you come back--and I guess it was in 1967, '68 [1968] that I realized there was no escape.  My struggle is in the United States because up to that point, I had the attitude, coming back to the United States, University of Denver [Denver, Colorado], if this situation gets so bad here, I know I can go and live some place else and not put up with, with the, the racism.  I can speak other languages, I can make a living, etc.  And that was the result of a, being a teenager growing up in that kind of environment.  Of course, you, what you, you come to understand is that, ultimately, you have to put your stake down, and you have to struggle because I couldn't struggle for justice in Morocco.  They'd throw me in jail, throw me out of the country.  So if I'm gonna struggle for justice, I come back here.  They cannot throw me out (laughs).  They might throw me in jail, they can't throw me out.  So, yeah, I guess it's the, that exposure to that family.  The Buckinghams, he came from the powerful, wealthy, white family and he went to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].  He drove an ambulance in World War I.  And so he had a, a F. Scott Fitzgerald kind of, you know, background.  And he stayed in Europe and married this woman whose parents were missionaries in Turkey, British missionaries.  And Mrs. Buckingham ran around in leotards and bracelets and make up and I mean she was something out of the movies.  And they had all kinds of people moving in and out of their household.  So I was able to, to be exposed to diversity.
Story_ID: 7231
Speaker 1: Even University of Denver [Denver, Colorado], adjusting to that.
Speaker 2: Well, coming--got on the airplane and left Casablanca [Morocco], arrived in New York, spent two days in the Y--YMCA in New York, got on the airplane and went right to Denver.  This is September 1960.  So in the space of less than five days, I moved six, seven thousand miles from one culture to the next.  On the one hand, managing the change in Denver was fairly easy because, you know, I had just--for my age, I was far more advanced in just how to handle yourself and meeting strangers.  As my mother once said, "Badi, you'd be a wealthy man if you can do two things: say hello to a stranger with warmth, and how to say good-bye to a friend with grace."  Well, the latter one I've finally figured that one out.  But when I got to Denver, oh, go out and meet people.  Once I became clear on the subtleties of racial discrimination at Denver, which as I said, it wasn't as brutal as it would have been at, say, in Chicago [Illinois], I guess I went through a period of, you know, the anger and the issue is okay.  Then what do I have to do to prove who I am.  And that's when we created our own little group, and we fought, didn't physically fight, but we worked twice as hard to prove who we were.  And also pressing why certain issues weren't being discussed in the classroom.  Now, these are the early '60's [1960s], okay.  And it really wasn't until '63 [1963], I think, that some of us got involved in support of the Civil Rights Movement in the South.  That was just beginning.  So managing Denver, on the one hand was fairly easy.  On the other hand, it was a challenge because you're now coming back into an environment where race is--not class, race is the, is the criteria, and how are you gonna, how are you gonna manage that, and people not being so open, you know.  So if you were in the South, and they simply said, no, upfront, then you know what to do about it.  You're in the North and the West, you know, they don't want to hurt your feelings and so you have to learn to read the subtle signals, and, and once you get into having to read the subtle signals, that's how you become vulnerable to the disease because now you have to become suspicious.  And suspicion left unchecked will destroy you.  It will destroy you, okay.  So how do you say to yourself, well, why did that happen, okay?  You've got somebody saying, cause they don't like black folks, okay.  And somebody else saying, well, no, they probably did for some other reason.  And so you're trying to, to sift this.  Now, I did not have the advantage of a high school experience in the United States where I would have picked up, you know, subtleties.  So my solution was Bill Cross, his family's a African American family, middle class, out of Evanston [Illinois]--Chicago, they basically adopted me.  So that really became my family, and I was very close to Bill, still am.  And I used Bill as a guide during that period of transition, coming to Denver.
Speaker 1: Were there ever times when people didn't know you were African American, and that put you in a compromising situation?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sure.  My mother told me never, never go anyplace or be with anybody that if you father showed up, you'd be embarrassed.  Okay, now, I go, why would she say that?  But if my mother said it, that's what--so I think once or twice in my life someone has used the word nigger, and I said, wait a second.  So, I think there're probably other occasions when I knew, and sometimes I played games because they look at me, and the worst thing in the world is to have the tar brush of Africa in you.  That's the worst thing.  So they'd say, "Badi Foster, oh, what nationality are you?"  I'd say," American," okay.  "Oh, are you Jamaica--are you Puerto Rican?  Are you Italian, are you this, that," and they'd go through every variation, okay, until what was left was, well, "Are you colored, Negro?"  Okay, so I was aware of, of, occasionally, in those situations, but I, for the most part, my biggest challenge, and I'm blocking on her name, but in college, a white young lady from the South, thick Southern accent.  And I'm part of the Emmett Till generation, and from Chicago, no less.  And a white person with a thick Southern accent just triggers the limbic system in me.  I am just very, very suspicious, and my prejudice, it's my problem.  And she's the one who finally forced me to admit that I had biases.  And I vowed that I would overcome those, that someone could--and eventually I did.  I met Governor [William] Winter from Mississippi.  I was on the podium with him, and he opened his mouth, and I almost fell through the floor, said, what on earth am I doing on the stage with this redneck?  And as he proceeded to, to speak about justice, about the disinvestment of education of Negroes in the South, everything I believed in, and the incongruity, how could that accent talk that truth?  Well I think, as a, as a light-skinned, blue-eyed Negro, in Colorado in the '60's [1960s], there probably were times when I may have been a little more aggressive, more of a chip on my shoulder, more aggressive, okay, towards anybody who seemed to be white, Southern, and that kind of stereotype, so that maybe in some cases, people didn't know or didn't care, but I had to tell them.
Story_ID: 7232
Speaker 1: So you finished at University of Denver [Denver, Colorado]?
Speaker 2: Finished at the Univer--University of Denver in, in international relations and did rather well.  And I won a Woodrow Wilson fellowship [to Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], which in those days was, was a competitive fellowship.  And it was a very rich fellowship.  And for the first time in my life, people were recruiting me.  I felt like, you know, these blue-chip athletes must feel like, you know, somebody really wanted you, and the Vietnam War was starting.  And I did not want to go to Vietnam.  So I got the fellowship, and I said, fine, what do I do?  And a couple of professors who had gone to Princeton influenced me heavily, and I ended up at Princeton, again, not to pursue near Eastern studies, which initially I did, but to stay out of Vietnam.  And that's a terrible thing to go to graduate school and to study classical Arabic for forty hours a week and then, you know, classic text.  And I just felt like I was a monk in doing the kind of work which didn't interest me at all.  But it kept me out of the war.  That's important to understand because I got my deferment 'cause my draft board's the South side of Chicago.  Very, very few in my neighborhood finished college.  Even fewer went to graduate school, and in 1964, to be at a place like Princeton where Woodrow Wilson was the president, one of the most racist, segregationist, you know.  And who was on the draft board on the South side of Chicago?  My aunt and my father's friends, people they had known all their lives, okay.  So I had no problem getting my deferment, but there came the price.  And the price was what do I do to make a contribution because it's the Eddie Cooper's and the Willie James Fullers who went to Vietnam.  And if they didn't get killed or injured physically, they came back and they paid a terrible price.  So I--my commitment to public service is, is motivated in large part, and particularly, my commitment to the development of social justice in black communities in, is derived in part by my sense of that's my obligation to my generation who fought.  In any case, went to Princeton and studied and taught.
Story_ID: 7233
Speaker 1: It was during that time that you met [future wife] Juanita?
Speaker 2: No, I met Juanita freshman week at the University of Denver [Denver, Colorado], right.  They said, "There's a mixer."  I said, "What's a mixer?"  A mixer is where the girls and boys go to meet each other.  I said, "fine, where is it? " And again, I'm socially five years ahead of most Americans, so you go to this mixer to dance.  And you got the, the athletes on one side of the room with the lettered jackets on, and as if it's the stockyards, and they're looking over the, the heifers or whatever.  And then you got some nerds who don't know what to do.  The field's wide open , you know.  So I met her at that, that mixer.  And then we were married in 1965.  I went to Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] for a year.  Living on campus with 800 men convinced me, no, not that kid.  No, I have to get, I have to get married (laughs).  So we got married in 1965.
Speaker 1: The dean didn't speak with you about this relationship?
Speaker 2: No, and it's a good thing because if he had I probably would have been kicked out.  That, not that I was arrogant, but who are you?  Who are you to tell me?  I think maybe that's the chip on the shoulder, which I was saying earlier.  I'm gonna do, you know, within reason.  But, no, I don't recall having anything like what happened to [Princeton University classmate] Bill Cross, and the, and that dean lasted I think another year, and then he was gone.  But, no, never any retribution.
Story_ID: 7234
Speaker 1: So you're at Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: What was your study there?
Speaker 2: Well, I started out in Near Eastern studies, and then switched to politics.  And I think about two and a half years in, it dawned on me, I wanted to be a teacher.  Education was my calling.  That's what I wanted to do.  So I switched into politics, and--very much interested in issues of social justice.  Unfortunately, the kinds of issues and concerns I had as an African American were not in the curriculum.  People just didn't talk about those things, with the exception of one or two professors, like H. H. [Harper Hubert] Wilson who became my mentor, and Manfred Halpern who was doing work on transformation and Near Eastern politics.  And those are the--Dwayne Lockhart, those are the people that I gravitated towards.  And then I met this gentleman, Elliott Liebow, and he had done a book called "Talley's Corner."  It's an anthropology--And I loved his methodology, and basically, Elliott helped me convince Princeton to accept a thesis proposal that eventually led me to get a Fulbright [Scholarship] and to go to Morocco and to do a study in the largest shantytown in Morocco.  And the name of the thesis was "The Moroccan Power Structure as Seen from Below: Political Participation in a Casablanca Shantytown."  And basically what I was trying to understand were how people managed this modernity traditional pull, the two-ness?  How did they identify themselves?  What kinds of issues got politicized?  What issues didn't?  And most importantly, how did--what were the relationships starting with an individual in a shanty town up to the district mayor's office?  Okay, and so I used the methodology of "Talley's Corner," which was, you sit there and you observe.  Then you talk, and two or three subjects and intense over a period of a year.  Now, the reason I did that was to try to understand why Woodlawn [South Side Chicago neighborhood] collapsed in Chicago [Illinois], because by the 1960s, Woodlawn had begun to lose population, etc., and, you know, William Julius Wilson documents that, you know, very, very well because deep down, my concern was how do we rebuild?  How do we rebuild?  And I can--I don't have the full answer, but I, I tell you, I now know something I didn't know then.  When you no longer have a moral vision, then--that is compelling, if not impelling, when you don't have that, it is very difficult to have any sustained effort to build something that is fair, to build relationships that care, to build relationships that share.  That is the fundamental issue.  Now, in Morocco, those Moroccans who were traditionalists, they truly believed that Islam provided a prescription for living.  But the problem was that in the nine--in the twentieth century, it wasn't working for them.  So they said, well, then, what we'll have to do is we'll have to become modern, where we become little French people.  And the more they became French people, the more chaos, incoherence it created because it was a--it was either or, you know, to the extent that you became a good modern person, i.e., French, okay, Napoleonic code of law, the more you had to refute your tradition, your religious vision, okay.  So there was this tension.  It still exists today.  I mean that's, that's what's wrong, the problem in the Middle East.  Well, similarly in the United States.  We're struggling now with recapturing a moral vision, moral vocabulary about what it means to be African American.  And we once had that.  We once had that, okay.  And somewhere along, you know, the '60s [1960s], and the early '70s [1970s], we lost something.  And so what I'm suggesting is that even back in 1967, my concern or my research was always about how do I get back to the South Side of Chicago to address those issues, okay.  So that's, that's the story of my life.  And for a long time I never told people why I went to Morocco.  I did that because if I were to go back to Chicago to do the research, my ego would get in the way.  I wouldn't question the questions.  I would presume, okay.  And what we needed was something really fresh.  And we had people like [William Julius] Bill Wilson, who, good scholarship, he's been able to, to document it.  In any case, the--now, I've forgotten how I got off on that tirade.
Speaker 1: You're talking about the shantytown, the lessons learned from the shantytown.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you were talking about your doctoral thesis.
Speaker 1: Right, the, the doctoral thesis.  Now, while I was in that shant--.
Speaker 2: Master's--master's or doctoral?
Speaker 1: It was my dissertation, doctoral dissertation.  While I was doing the research, [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was killed.  Now, here I am in the shantytown, and these people are bringing this newspaper in huge font in Arabic, "Martin Luther King killed. " And I'm sitting in the middle of a shanty town saying, "What on earth?  How sick is my society that they would kill Martin Luther King?"  And then these people said, "Would you explain to us why you're having this fight."  Well, you try to sit down and manage your feelings, and explain the bizarre, the sickness of racism in this country.  It, it really--the only way you can describe it is it's like AIDS.  It's a, it mutates, and it destroys.  But that's when I realized that my struggle was in the United States.  That as much as I saw injustice in that shanty town, and I am concerned about injustice in that shantytown. My struggle is, is in this country because the worse they can do is throw me in jail.  You know, my roots are here, and so my struggle is here.  So I came back, and I took a different fork in the road.  I said, I will now be an educator, and my job will be to build schools and colleges whose mission will be to serve society and those least well served.  And that's what I did the rest of my life.

Speaker 1: [Robert] Bobby Kennedy was killed that same year too.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did that have the same effect?
Speaker 2: Less so.  I arrived back on the eve of the Democratic National Convention [in Chicago, Illinois, 1968].  Now, I'm a political scientist.  I turned on the television.  I'd been away for a year.  And I'm from Chicago, and I see a political convention collapse.  And I'm saying to myself, whoa.  So I think actually, it was the Democratic National Convention, assassination of [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] more so than Kennedy, although I clearly--[President] John F. Kennedy left his mark on me.  I was gonna go to Washington that, you know, and I'll tell you later how that played itself out (laughter).  But it, I guess the legacy of John Kennedy and Bobby Kennedy was, had a great impact on me, but I didn't fully understand it until much later.  The most immediate impact was Martin Luther King, and the collapse of a political process.
Speaker 1: So you came back from Morocco--?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: To?
Speaker 2: Denver [Colorado].
Speaker 1: Denver.
Speaker 2: And then from Denver to New Jersey.
Speaker 1: And then when you were at Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey], you were primarily a student or were you--is that when you were at Rutgers [The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Well, where at Princeton, you have to realize, when I arrived in September 1964, there were thirteen Negro graduate students out of roughly 1,600.  And of the thirteen, only eight of us spoke to each other.  And there were about twenty Negro undergraduate students.  So the graduate students, we became the de facto faculty advisors to the undergraduates.  It was a very small community.  And their principal experience was one of the most challenging.  Now, mind you, here I was, someone that lived in different parts of the world, spoke other languages.  Princeton was a room with a view.  You want to talk about a rough, insular culture, okay.  That was tough, and, and for me and for the undergraduates, it was even tougher.  So we got involved in support groups, and we made sure that these undergraduates had host families in the black community, in the black community in Princeton.  Carl [A.] Fields, who was the first Negro administrator hired by the Ivy League, and was a mentor of mine, what people didn't realize is that Carl lived in New York, but he would stay with Juanita [Foster] and I at night in Princeton when he had late meetings.  And we'd stay up half the night, and we would talk about the politics of the university.  And that's how I learned a great deal about social change.  Well, this is all to say that in addition to being a student, I then really became a de facto faculty member for the undergraduates.  As I proceeded, I did many of the their theses.  So, for instance, Judge Henry Kennedy, here in, in Washington [D.C.] and one of my students, you know, a whole host of folks.  And then we got involved in South Africa.  So I was involved in taking over the administration building and negotiating.  Neil Rubenstein was the dean of students at the time.  We took over the administration building, left it cleaner than we found it, getting all our names in.  We were prepared to take the weight.  Now, our gamble was that, at that time I think we had about ninety percent of all black students at Princeton were in that building.  And they weren't likely to expel all of us.  So they put us on probation for the months of May and June and, and--but out of that we got African American Studies.  We got a commitment to increase, including the faculty and students.  So I really became more of an activist on university politics, and by this time, it was clear to me that my role was gonna be as an educator.  And that's when I was introduced to a group of people who were gonna start a new college at Rutgers, Livingston College.  And this college was going to be liberal arts, but it was gonna focus on urban issues and cultural diversity.  So I proceeded to join that faculty, and we had all sorts of--Sonia Sanchez and Nikki Giovanni and [Dr.] Jan [H.] Carew and Toni Cade Bambara and lots of old friends.  And we were all ideologically correct in some ways.  But, boy, were we confused.
Story_ID: 7236
Speaker 1: [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] gets assassinated and one of my mentors in, was Bill Clinton Powell, who was a African American diplomat with USIA [United States Information Agency], Bill and Lucille Powell.  If it weren't for Bill Powell, I would not have finished the thesis cause I was so furious.  I wanted to become an activist, and he sat me down, and he said, you finish that dissertation.  I had lost all my tapes.  He gave me old Voice of America tapes.  He and Lucille would invite Juanita once a month to Robat [Morocco].  We would sleep in a nice bed and have peanut butter, and I mean they adopted us as, as their kids, okay.  But he said, you must have that degree to go back.  And Bill Clinton was part of a group that Eddie Williams recruited in the early '60's [1960s] to get a number of black folks into the foreign service.  So when I heard that Martin Luther King [Jr.] was assassinated, and I went to the memorial service at the embassy, first of all, the idiot of the amb--the ambassador, [Henry J.] Tasca was his name, he didn't even attend the service.  He said he had to go out and visit an agriculture station.  And the person who spoke was this white guy who was a navy officer, and he simply said, well, you're gathered here because a man of the cloth has fallen.  And I'm saying (laughs), you know.  And then the French and Moroccans held a memorial service in Casablanca, filled the Protestant church.  I guess there must have been 500 people there.  And I was invited to speak.  And they understood more about my struggle than my, my embassy.  So for me, the question was--the, the issue of social justice in Morocco, as much as I'm concerned about it, it's not my country in the sense.  But my struggle clearly is here.  And, and so my decision to come back, my decision to get involved with education, education must now be a vehicle and an arena for increasing the will and capacity of people to transform towards justice.  That's what it's all about.  Now, whether it's a college, whether it is a public school, whether it is a corporate university or whatever, that, that's me.  And that's, that's what I've devoted the last twenty-five years of my life towards.  And that's what I'll do 'til the day I die.  In order to do that, you know, you start joining in with other people to create colleges.  So that, you know, we, we created two or three, but you learn a lot about your own arrogance.  So when we created Livingston College [Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey], I found out later from the Drug Enforcement Agency that Livingston College was the main traffic point for drugs moving up and down the East coast, and we were, you know, we were polit--ideologically correct.  Among black folks, we had retread Garveyites (laughter).  We had symbols from Imamu [Amiri] Baraka.  We had folks at the Malcolm X House, the [Dr.] Martin Luther King House, the black gay house.  We segregated ourselves, and then it was black-on-black crime (laughs).  All along, the faculty, in some cases manipulating the students, I learned that, and you shouldn't do that because we were so, if you will, engage' politically, okay, ideologically.  Again, absence of a moral vision, you know, you create chaos.  We literally started a college, and within two years, we had segregated the hell out of it (laughs), you know.  There wasn't even black unity, okay.  And we probably set back the issue and the cause.  Most importantly, there were a number of students who didn't succeed academically.  And they flunked out, and they blamed themselves when they should have blamed the faculty, you see.  And that's, that's a major lesson that I learned, but--.
Speaker 2: Now, this, this group of people that you have there.  Can describe a little bit more of the--I mean there was, you said, Nikki Giovanni, Sonia, Sonia Sanchez, and this is reminiscent of black studies sort of around the time--I mean you're really gonna do a commentary sort of on black studies, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, because I went to Livingston College, and we had recruited a constellation of African American scholars, geniuses.  We had the talent.  But we didn't have a consensus.  So when you literary giants like Toni Cade Bambara and Nikki Giovanni and Sonia Sanchez and Jan [R.] Carew, and [Dr.] Ivan Van Sertima and Cyrus Mutiso, and people who went on then to, to have just very distinguished careers.  And they weren't very well known at the time.  It was sad that--it was almost like a 'Potemkin Village', you know.  On the exterior, it looked like we had assembled this extraordinary group of scholars and activists to really critically examine the African experience in the new world.  And then from there, what kinds of visions and strategies should emerge so that we could, could achieve the goals of justice and, and, and peace.  The truth of the matter is that we were arrogant, in many part--the faculty.  We all had our axes to grind.  Academic politics can be very vicious cause the stakes are so small.  And bottom line, we ended up, in fact, creating a, a situation where the students suffered--the very people we claimed we were serving were the ones who suffered.  They're the ones who flunked out.  And when they flunked out, and when someone said, well, I'm gonna give you fifteen credits for your life experience, well, that's, you know, you may be angry about academic standards here and there. But you, you don't do that and then not give the person the kind of analytical tools or the sort of knowledge.  So Livingston College was great from the point of view that we assembled a number of people, and there were some good things that happened.  But overall, we, we, we failed there.  That one led me back to Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] where I chaired the African American Studies program because I was, and remain, firmly committed to a, the rigorous, an analysis and reflection on the experience of Africans in the diaspora, just as Near Eastern Studies or whatever.  I mean it's, this is very, very important.  Unfortunately, in those days, African American studies or black studies were being used largely as a vehicle for dealing with the anger of students and not for scholarship.  In fact, it's only twenty, thirty years later that you get people like [Henry Louis] Skip Gates who meets Neil Rudenstine, who was dean of students when we took the building over.  Neil then becomes president of Harvard.  And Neil says to Skip, "What does it take to build a first-class scholarship?"  And Skip said, "I need seven, tenured slots," that's all, and Neil did it.  Now, that discussion began for Neil at Princeton with [Princeton president, William G.] Bill Bowen back in the early '70's [1970s].  That's where we got the African American Studies program.  We got graduate fellowships when I was chair, Rockefeller fellowships.  One of the first people we selected was Cornel West.  So the, the seeds of, of scholarship and expertise on the experience of Africans in the diaspora, a part of that I was involved in, in the late '60's [1960s] and early '70's [1970s] under the struggle for black studies, African American studies, Afro American studies.
Story_ID: 7237
Speaker 1: It's during this period that you, your family started to grow?
Speaker 2: Yes, our first son, Nabil, was born in 1971.  And he was born in New Jersey.  Then in 1972 or '3 [1973], I accepted another challenge to join another fellow to start another college.  In this case, it would be the College of Public and Community Service, which would be part of the University of Massachusetts at Boston [Massachusetts].  And here, what we wanted to do was to develop a college for the adult learner, a college based on--in those days we called them competencies.  And the notion was that you would receive your degree based on your demonstration of knowledge, values and skills by, quote, demonstrating, pretty much like Boy Scout or Girl Scout merit badges.  You don't get the merit badge unless you actually demonstrate what it says in the handbook.  That's the spirit of, of a competency curriculum, only this would be done in the context of public and community service. And so the idea would be that we could take an adult student.  The typical student was female, single parent, couple of kids, high school, maybe a little community college and had gone to work, and now was in their mid-thirties and said, I need, the time is now.  So we left New Jersey and moved to Massachusetts to, to start that college literally from scratch. And, and then, I think in 1977, our second child was born, Qasim in Boston.
Speaker 1: You were doing some things with Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in that time too, during that period?
Speaker 2: Yes, in '75 [1975], David Reisman had gotten to know me through my work at Livingston College [Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey] and my work at Princeton in the African American Studies program, and David was a student of American higher education.  So we sort of became friendly.  And when I got to Boston to work with this new college, one day he called me up, took me to lunch and basically said, you know--he's very shrewd, said, "Badi, you really have not had a sabbatical, and you've been doing all this interesting, you know.  Why don't you come over to Harvard for a while?"  Well, the truth of the matter is that the Afro American Studies department was about to go into bankruptcy, huge fights between Ewart Guinier and Eileen Southern and Derrick Bok and Walter Leonard and they had a whole group of people, the students, etc.  [Andrew F.] Andy Brimmer was the head of the Visiting Committee, and I was approached because I had successfully stepped in to rescue the African American Studies program at Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] because the first chair person we hired was ill.  We didn't know he was ill.  And when he finally arrived and he was ill, the--[Robert F.] Bob Goheen who was the president of Princeton, asked me to come back to Princeton.  And so for two years, I ended up doing two jobs, Rutgers as well as, as Princeton.  But anyway, I had the experience of stabilizing and then rebuilding the program.  So Harvard was going through a similar experience, and the question was, why not bring Foster over.  And that was the beginning of my, my relationship with, with Harvard.  And the other piece is that Paul Ylvisaker was a mentor of mine, and he--in New Jersey, and he had come up, he left New Jersey to come to Harvard to run the School of Education.  So he eventually convinced me to join him.
Speaker 1: So you were doing two jobs at that point?
Speaker 2: You know, I've done two or three jobs most of my life, you know.  And I think that probably is a reflection of my father.  He always had two or three hustles or, you know, you know, side lines or whatever--legal, but, but lots of joint appointments, yeah.
Speaker 1: What would you say are some of your most memorable events that have happened over these years?
Speaker 2: What, in my life?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Well, obviously, getting married to Juanita [Foster].  Our second child, Qasim, died at the age of nine from an anaphylactic reaction to a peanut product, so that clearly was a, a defining moment in, in my life.  And I guess starting these colleges from scratch.  I went to work for Aetna Life and Casualty, and a group of us created a, one of the first corporate universities.  We literally changed the way in which corporate America thinks about the use of education and training.  And then I guess at this point in my life, bumping into students.  And they're so kind.  I guess the ones I wasn't kind to, they just don't say anything to me, but to hear from individuals who say, you know, you, you made a difference.  And I guess those would be sort of highlights.
Story_ID: 7238
Speaker 1: Talk some more about the death of your son.
Speaker 2: Well, Qasim, in many ways was very much like myself, I mean in terms of makeup and--peacemaker, socializer.  This kid within two weeks knew the names of most of the kids in the block because we had the Halloween.  He not only knew the names of the kids, he knew which houses most likely would give out good candy and which houses wouldn't.  So he was that kind of, of--of child.  And more or less a real mensch--and he was allergic to peanuts.  And there was a Halloween party at school, and someone brought some cookies that had a peanut product in it.  And even though his records showed that he was highly allergic, the nurse blew it; the docs blew it, and unfortunately, he, he died at the age of nine.  That was a--I wouldn't say a wake-up call, but it's, it's one of those decisive moments.  And I can now say that if it weren't for my faith, my family and my friends, I probably would not have accomplished much after that.  So I have a great deal of empathy for people who experience that kind of shock, and so I'm, I'm very empathic, and I reach out and, and without imposing myself on other people to know that when, when people suffer that, you can turn it to your advantage or you can turn it to your disadvantage.  So, in his case, it definitely was turned to our advantage.  We have never had an argument in the family since 1986--disagreements, you know, never an argument. No nasty words said because you just don't take certain things for granted.  And that in itself is a blessing.  And the other thing is that, you know, the material--and I remind you again, it's the moral vision.  That's what defines the quality of your life, okay.  And for that, I won't say I'm thankful,  I would not wish it on anybody, you know, to, to lose a child. But I guess if people ask me, well, gee, you're inspirational or you're a leader. Why?  It's, yeah, I have certain standards, but more importantly, it's very clear to me--and this may be a little, bordering on, may even be inappropriate, but as my dad said, "Badi, in terms of one's integrity, everybody at one point or another has turned a trick, everybody."  It's not that you're proud of it, but circumstances were such that, you know, you prostitute yourself.  He said, but no matter how often you do that, there's no excuse for pimping yourself, okay.  Now, I won't take that analogy to its extreme, but what it suggests is that we have a number of people who, in fact, have taken who they are and what they stand for and they've used that, they've put that on the street corner to turn tricks.  And that's the indictment of leadership.  And sometimes, the young people or old people, the language they use and undoubtedly we don't like, but that's what they see.  So I guess when you lose a child or there's some other major event, and you step back, and you say, wait a second.  I do have choices to make.  And so therefore, what's important to me and my willingness to speak truth to power, some people may say, well, that's, that's a leader.  I respect you for that; you have integrity.  And I guess the extent to which I do that is a combination of the way I was raised, my parents' world view, and then, quite frankly, being tested by adversity, you know.  It's I'll baptize you through fire, you know.  I mean that's wonderful rhetoric, but the reality is that it's only through adversity that you get struck.
Story_ID: 7239
Speaker 1: You spent several years at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes, spent eight or nine years at Harvard.
Speaker 1: And then?
Speaker 2: Then I was invited to go to Hartford, Connecticut to create a, a corporate university.  And that was a, that was an epiphany.  I had been a consultant to Aetna Life and Casualty and the chairman, John [H.] Filer, who was really an extraordinary corporate leader.  And one day he said, you know, "We're gonna build a new building for training, but when I ask people what we should be doing, it's like more of the same.  We're driving down the road into the future, looking in the rearview mirror."  And he said, you know, "Do you have any thoughts on that?"  And I was so cavalier, I said, "Well, John, you know, I'm teaching full time, you know, when I have a chance, I'll give some thought to it."  This conversation was in, sort of like in November.  Some time in January during reading period at Harvard, and, you know, I had finished grading the papers and pushed the misery back onto the students, I was in my office at Gutman Library on a Saturday, and I said, you know, I should sort of write some thoughts down on education in the corporate world.  And I had an epiphany, and then I started to write.  And I wrote for about two hours straight.  By the time I sort, almost came to, I was starving.  So I said, well, let me go over to the Casablanca , and I'll have my cheeseburger, and then I'll come back, and I'll wrap this over.  I get over to the Casablanca.  I ordered a cheeseburger, and it starts coming again.  And I'm writing, I'm writing, and I'm writing.  I wrote till about 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon, totally drained.  And I just put things aside.  And about two weeks later I went back and read it, and it made sense.  And I polished it, and that became a memo which I gave to the chairman of Aetna Life and Casualty, and he shared it with some of the board members.  I had no intention of leaving academia.  And I came up with the concept, which is really a reflection of my life experiences.  How do you use education and training as both a vehicle and an arena for assisting the organization in this case to manage change.  And from there I could derive notions of ethics, how competency-based education, how you link with community.  It was really an expression of work I'd done in Africa, with African universities, a whole variety of things.  And he sent me a note and said, come see me.  I went to see him.  He said, come down and make it happen.  I said, what?  No, no, no, no.  And I spoke to my dad.  And my dad said, "Badi, it's rare in the lifetime of a human being that you have an idea that someone's willing to fund.  It is even more rare for a black man to have that opportunity.  Do it."  So I left academia, moved to Connecticut.  Some of my friends in Cambridge thought I was going to Mongolia.  And others said, boy, I was going with devil cause you're going to the private sector.  This is 1982.  And here I'm talking about school, business partnerships, universities, etc.  And people are saying, no way.  Well, I went down and convinced a few other people to come, shared with them my vision, and I got out of the way.  And then let them begin to shape it.  And we created the Aetna Institute for Corporate Education, which was the standard, along with Xerox and General Electric.  We literally changed the way corporate American understood that your intellectual capital, human capital, were gonna be the decisive.  This is 1982, '83 [1983].  So it's not the bricks and mortar.  It's how do you use education as a way of instilling agreement on mission, critical success factors and how do you manage change?  How do we manage diversity, all those kinds of things.  So, I mean for that, we got lots of national recognition.  We pioneered the Saturday academies, which dealt with inner-city kids in the city of Hartford [Connecticut].  Okay, that eventually even came to D.C.  We just had a reunion last October where about two hundred people showed up.  And many of them had gone on to other jobs, but we all said that those five to seven years, the finest years most of us have ever had in terms of quality of life, work, etc.
Speaker 1: What happened then?
Speaker 2: Well, Aetna began to fall apart.  John [H.] Filer left, and new people came in.  The quality of the leadership at the top dropped, the morale--the moral vision was gone.  The business was changing, and " 'each one for himself and God for all,' said the elephant as he danced among the chickens."  And it was clear to me that it was time to go.
Story_ID: 7240
Speaker 1: It was at that time that President [William J.] Clinton got elected [1992].  And one thing led to another, and President Clinton and Secretary [Richard W.] Riley offered me a position as Assistant Secretary of Education to come down and help reinvent the Department of Education.  Well, I, as a product of the [President John F.] Kennedy world, and I, at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] I had been the assistant director of the institute of politics at the [John F. ] Kennedy School [of Government, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  So I was still very much part of this dream of going back and finishing the work of Camelot, if you will.  And so I was a supporter of Senator [Edward M.] Kennedy of Massachusetts.  So all, all of a sudden this offer comes, and I remember getting the call in my office.  And Secretary Riley says, "Badi, the President needs you."  I said, "Mr. Secretary, I'm on my way."  I told my assistant, Bill Kiley, I said, I'm gone for the day.  I'll see you tomorrow.  And I stopped by to see a friend, Gene Baten and loaned-- to return a book.  And I said, "Gene, I'm going to Washington [D.C.] at last".  He said, "I'm so happy for you."  I said, "I got to run, and I got to do some shopping, see you later."  I do the shopping, when I get home, you know, as you get older, you can walk into a situation--it's called fluid intelligence.  You know there's something not right.  I opened the door.  I said, "Hi, honey, I'm home."  Silence.  I take the groceries into the kitchen.  There is Juanita [Foster] at the sink.  Now, I know there's something wrong, okay, cause she heard me.  And I said, hi, honey.  And just quietly turned around, and she said, "I thought we had an understanding."  Now, I'm really trying to figure, what on earth have I done?  She said, "I thought our understanding was that after Qasim died, no decision would be made in this family without full consultation of everybody."  I said, "Yeah."  She said, "I just got off the phone Gene Baten, and he said, 'we're going to Washington'."  And at which point I began to violate the first principle of holes, which reads, 'when in one, stop digging'.  I started saying, "Oh, well, no, that's not exactly what I meant, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah."  To make a long story short, I thought that I could bring her around to, to see the necessity of me having to go to respond to the President's call and the [Education] Secretary's call.  And after about two and a half months, that just didn't work, so I had to, to turn that down.  But at that point, I said, if I can't do Washington, I don't want to stay at Aetna [Casualty & Life Insurance Company].  And that took me to University Hospitals at Cleveland [Ohio], where I was recruited to come in and to do for a major teaching hospital complex what I had done at Aetna, how do you use education to build a vertically integrated healthcare system that's just in the process of going through a revolution.  And that, trust me, was an experience because academic politics is one thing; academic medical politics--the only thing that's worse would be ecclesiastical politics.
Story_ID: 7241
Speaker 1: Should we talk some more about the historic implications of your black studies department experiences at, both in New Jersey and in Massachusetts?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Well, just to recap, we were fighting over South African investments at Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey].  And we wanted Princeton to divest.  And as students, and some faculty, we mobilized.  We were impolite.  We were rude, we were confrontational.  And finally that led to our decision to take over the administration building, New South Building at Princeton.  And our demands were that, divestiture, and then also to increase the number of Negro students to be recruited as undergraduate and graduate students.  But that more importantly, that the curriculum needed to reflect the issues and concerns and experiences of Africans in the diaspora.  Up to that point at Princeton, you had one or two courses in the history department that dealt with the experience of Africans.  And people, today in 2003, can't imagine, you mean Princeton, there were teaching, these great universities were teaching American history and only a small percentage would refer to--well, there was slavery, but the experience of African Americans.  Well, when we took that building over in '69 [1969], the negotiations were such that, to make a long story short, no, about touching the money.  And that's understandable.  I mean, and American capitalism, I mean we can talk about God.  We can talk about your sex life.  Don't talk about the money (laughs), okay.  We can talk the ethics of sharing everything except my money, okay.  So we had to do, they had to give us something.  So, yes, let's increase the number of African American students and curriculum.  And so that led to an African American Studies program, not a department at Princeton because the notion was, where is, where are the candidates?  How could you have a department?  And here it is 2003, and I think Princeton is about ready now to declare that there will be a department, okay.  Now, yes, early--if it wasn't for people like Sheldon Hackney, Neil Rudenstine, Carl Fields, [William G.] Bill Bowen, a number of people who slowly, but surely, within the context of Princeton, pushed, pushed to have scholarship about African Americans.  If it weren't for them, I don't think we would have succeeded through student pressure.  And these were a number faculty who said, yes, something needs to be done.  But they were graduals.  Well, I guess the proof in the case of Princeton is that we may not have made as much progress, but there wasn't any backsliding.  So you had a group of faculty, but mostly graduate students, and a few undergraduates in the late '60's [1960s] and early '70's [1970s] that really, almost created a renaissance.  These undergraduate students were unusually talented.  They're captured in Bill Bowen and Derrick Bok's book "Shape of the River", in which they take a look at these, this wave of, of Negro students who were brought into these highly-competitive institutions in the late '60's [1960s] and followed them for ten years, okay.  And guess what?  They proved that these students have made greater contributions to their careers, their communities, etc.  So affirmative action in that respect certainly benefited.  But the real debates were, is this, black studies, is this really, does it have scholarly integrity?  That was the real debate.  Or, is black studies simply a way of, of dealing with angry students, angry students of color who were brought in, and the institution didn't really prepare themselves to embrace this stranger.  Now, if you haven't done that, and you're an undergraduate, as I've said, if you can't find yourself in the curriculum, you will suffer from alienation.  And that alienation eventually will lead you to behaviors, politics, of things other than scholarship.  So the real challenge is for people to be able to find themselves or the issues or the questions of greatest importance to themselves in the curriculum.  In order to that, you have to have faculty, okay, who cannot simply say your questions are illegitimate questions.  No, no.  Say, I don't know enough about your questions, but surely, your questions are as valid as any others.  It's just that we don't have the expertise to respond to your questions.  That's a very different discussion.  African American studies forced that debate, okay.  The larger question was, what's the relationship of the university to the larger society that supports it?  Now, what you have to understand in the '50's [1950s],'60's [1960s] and '70's [1970s], slowly but surely, you get this disconnection, okay, of higher education and the larger society.  You get the professionalization of, of the curriculum knowledge.  You get people who define themselves by their discipline, or more importantly, by segments of their discipline, who no longer see that they are citizens in a community, academic community, whose job it is to prepare people to serve society.  And, oh, by the way, knowledge created in the service of what, and the service of whom?  In the service of the larger society.  That's the issue.  Now, you contrast that with the dominant professionalization, ha, ha, knowledge created in service of me.  I'm the one who's gonna get the journal articles.  I'm the one who's going to get chaired professorship.  I'm the one who's gonna get the Nobel Peace Prize, the MacArthur prize, etc.  Today, we have that tension, okay, enormous tension between what are the obligations of the faculty and staff and students to the larger society that supports it?  African American Studies at Princeton, that was the issue in the 1960s.  For example, can we acquire knowledge outside the classroom?  What topics are appropriate?  Well, some faculty would say, well, if you're gonna study, you know, the sociology of Negroes on the Witherspoon, John Street area of Princeton, that's not scholarship.  That's social activism, which is fine, but don't confuse it for scholarship, okay.  And, if, in fact, a faculty member says, I'm really interested in studying the experience of alienated, colored youth in Trenton, New Jersey, well, that's not intellectually interesting.  Okay, so in the '60's [1960s] and '70's [1970s] and '80's [1980s], you had this debate that's going on.  You have an increasing number of students of color who have been brought into these institutions, but they don't find themselves in the curriculum or if they do, they find it in a, not a very challenging way.  So that is really the debate, part of a context, the debate of, what's this thing called black studies?  What's this thing called Afro studies, African American studies?  So at Princeton, we decided to create a program.  We go out and we hire a, our first chair, who turns out to be ill.  We didn't know it at the time.  That sort of set us back.  Well, I came in to stabilize that situation and to take on students--I was threatened by black students who said, wait a minute.  We fought for African American studies.  It's gonna be our political base to mobilize, to bring resources into the community to create justice.  And I said, I'm not opposed to that, but, no, this is an academic program.  We fund and we support scholarship, the creation of a knowledge of who we are and what we do.  Well, that was a tough fight.
Story_ID: 7242
Speaker 1: When I go up to Massachusetts, and [Dr.] David Reisman, and there's a real fight at Harvard [University, Department of Afro American Studies, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or the--and they have a department, okay.  And Ewart Guinier, who was a dear friend, and he's pitted against Eileen Southern, whom I, I didn't know as well Ewart.  And how Harvard was trying to handle that situation, basically, they said, "Call Badi."  And they brought me over for a year.  I negotiated a sabbatical basically.  I said, "I'm not going to, I've taken the program out of bankruptcy once.  I'm not sure I want to do this again."  But clearly, the strategy with David Reisman, as he told me later, was, maybe he could bring you over, and maybe you would agree to become chair of the department at, at Harvard.  And I said, after a year, nope.  [Thomas C.] Tom Holt was there as a historian, a dear friend.  He's now in Chicago [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  But I did participate in, in the debate and trying to bring some peace at Harvard because I said, what you folks do, you cast an enormous shadow.  At Princeton, time and time again, we were told, well, what are they doing at Harvard?  If Harvard's doing it, you could 'quasi' get some justification.  What is interesting though, is that the debate in the '70's [1970s] at Harvard about what's the proper role, okay, of African American Studies?  And you had lots of egos involved, like in any academic institution.  So I'm blocking on his name at, in the government department.  What's his name?
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: No, no, this is the first African American, he had tenure at, at the government department.  And it'll come to me.  And then [Dr.] Orlando Patterson was over in sociology.  Orlando is a dear friend 'cause a, lots of the issues and debates that we had at Princeton, we invited Orlando down, Toni Morrison and other folks who came down to have those discussions.  So in some ways, we just moved the debate from New Jersey (laughs) to Massachusetts.  Of course, Harvard being Harvard, that's a much bigger platform.  But the conclusion was that, could you have excellence and access?  It wasn't until Neil Rudenstein became president of Harvard that he was able to sit down with Skip [Dr. Henry Louis Gates] to say, okay, we're gonna build excellence.  Now, Neil Rudenstein's notion was that the role of African American studies was shaped when he was at Princeton, okay.  In fact, Princeton has produced more subsequent college presidents who've had to--Ruth Simmons at Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island] now.  Sheldon Hackney, who went on to, to Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  It was very interesting in that period of the, who were the influential people--the Cornel West as a graduate student.  So here we are in the '70's [1970s], the mid-'70's [1970s], Harvard is being torn apart in the Afro American Studies department.  You've got faculty who are saying, what did I tell you?  You know, it--they're bringing down your standards.  [Dr.] Harvey C. Mansfield, he's saying, you know, what destroyed Harvard was when you increased the number of Negro students coming in here, and they created great inflation because the faculty didn't want to hurt their feelings.  So I'm going on--instead of giving them a B, I'll give them an A.  Okay, and then that's the current debate.  And, of course, I said, well, ghee, that's one of the greatest weapons we have.  I mean we ought to tell President [George W.] Bush, you're worried about the North Koreans?  You're worried about the Chinese?  Tell you what you do, all you got to do is take a hundred Negro, African Americans, send them to Beijing, University of Beijing.  They'll bring down the standards of the university within five years.  Now, that's a hell of a, a weapon, if you really believe that.  And that's what people were saying.  Well, African American studies and these Negro students, you bring enough of them in there, sure enough, eventually, they will lower the standards.  And that is ultimately what Larry Summers doesn't understand.  And when [Lawrence] Larry Summers confronted Cornel [West], and said, "What are you doing, and by what standards of excellence are you gonna measure your work?"  What he did not understand is that he was hitting a, a, a wound or a series of questions that were yet to be resolved.  Harvard in the service of what and in the service of whom?  Harvard, God meant for Harvard to exist (laughter), you know.  Who's to hold Harvard accountable?  African American Studies, my goodness, you know, we've bent over backwards.  We've given you--can't you be quiet and get over it?  So the issues in the debates about the role of universities in the service of the larger society remain open, and African American Studies really turned out to be the first arena for an open debate.  Now, quite frankly, that now has led to this issue of ethnic studies, of women's studies and, you know, we've lost the canons, and it's a much larger debate.  But that, I was involved in, in, in those discussions.  So, when it came time to think about to use education in the private sector, and the epiphany, what was clear to me was that corporations had a responsibility to stakeholders that went beyond their employees, went beyond their shareholders and went right to the issue of corporations in the service of what and in the service of whom, all right.  And in the twenty-first century, now with WorldCom and, and Enron, people are now saying, yeah, you know, these corporations, they have a responsibility to invest in the infrastructure, the social and economic and, and political infrastructure of the--so we have democracy, etc.  Well, the ideas that we were articulating, that we implemented at Aetna [Casualty & Life Insurance Company] were precursors of this larger discussion about how do corporations work with universities?  And now we call them public, private partnerships, okay.  Now, we're raising the questions about sharing.  Hello, hello.  The people whose work is supported in research in the universities, are they the only ones who are to benefit through patents?  If we're using taxpayers' monies to support research, isn't there an obligation that that institution, in fact, share that with the larger society?  And quite frankly, I don't want to take it to the extreme, but that raises the whole question of affirmative action and the role of universities in terms of building a more just and equitable society.  But coming back to, to what we were doing in the debates, yes, we had some personalities, and often, what happens is that we allow the personalities to cloud the issues.  Okay.  So in this case, is it Larry Summers and Cornell West, two personalities?  No, no, there're larger issues.  Was it Ewart Guinier versus Eileen Southern and Derrick Bok and Walter Leonard?  Yeah, but it was the larger issues.  Was it the Harvard Law School?  What was Derrick Bell really protesting?  Okay, what was C. Clyde Ferguson really trying to do?  Okay, and these were people who were drawn into trying to be the peacemakers, the reconcilers of this debate about what's the role of African American studies at Harvard?  What's the role of the Negro?  Well, I just finished reading [Jonathan] Jon Holloway's book, 'Confronting the Veil', which describes Howard University [Washington, D.C.]  in the 1930s.  You read that, and the experience of Abram Harrison, E. Franklin Frazier, and Ralph Bunche, and you have in a microcosm in the 1930s precisely the issues that we were dealing with in the 1960s and '70's [1970s], '80's [1980s], '90's [1990s], and now the twenty first century.  You cannot understand the reaction of Cornel West to Larry Summers in the year 2002 unless you understand what Modecai Johnson, what he had to confront at Howard in the 1930s.  So unfortunately--and this is why HistoryMakers is so important, these issues, this is not the first time we're visiting them, okay.  And, unfortunately, we suffer from historical amnesia.  You know, we don't have the stories of the people who fought and the debates and the personalities.  Well, I'm sort of tailing off here, but I think that, that the, the issues about the proper role of scholarship and what standards do you measure good scholarship of excellence, and the issue of access to education, who has the right and by what measures are scare goods like access to higher education distributed?  And then, lastly, ultimately, how is the institution itself held accountable?  Okay, what are its responsibilities to build a better, more just, democratic society?  And I think those questions are as pressing today in the twenty-first century as they were in the '50's [1950s], '60's [1960s], '70's [1970s] and '80's [1980s].  And here we are about to celebrate fifty years of Brown vs. Board of Ed [Education of Topeka, Kansas], and many of the issues and concerns that I had about the South side of Chicago [Illinois] in the 1960's--'50's [1950s], '60's [1960s], '70's [1970s] are exactly, we're right back there.  We're more segregated today than we were ever.  Isn't that interesting, in some ways.
Story_ID: 7243
Speaker 1: Then you got back to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yes, and went back to Chicago because got tired of the [President Ronald] Reagan administration saying, "Why are you people always begging, on welfare? Why don't you, free private enterprise, black enterprise?  Why don't you create wealth?"  Well, a group of us sat down, and we said, okay.  That's fair enough.  What are some issues that need to be addressed in our community?  Well, one of them is the mobility crisis.  In the, in the 1990s, mid-90's [1990s], we suffered from a mobility crisis.  If you looked at public transportation, it was not affordable and not accessible.  It didn't get you to where the jobs, the training were. If you lived on the South side of Chicago, the jobs were out there in suburbs.  So we said--maybe we what we ought to do is to create a transportation company, go out and get contracts to provide school bus and shuttle service to get people to where the health care is, where the training is, where the jobs are, etc.; put the terminals in the community, where people can walk to work, and take somebody whose drug free, with a halfway decent attitude, they can be functionally illiterate.  We will train them to get a commercial driver's license, which is a  portable credential, 'cause once you get a commercial driver's license, you can go to work for FedEx or UPS or whatever.  So why don't we, in fact, put a terminal right down near Ida B. Wells [Homes, public housing project] in Chicago, work with women and train them to become drivers or, or monitors.  And make an agreement with progressive providers of adult education so that, in fact, you could use the workplace as a learning environment, and over a period of years, a person could get a job with minimal benefits--we weren't paying great salaries.  But they, in fact, could get a job, benefits and educational training so they could move up and out.  And furthermore, we could take all the functions of running a terminal and turn them into, guess what?  Competencies, merit badges.  And so we could train you to drive a bus, repair a bus, dispatch, back-office bill it.  And, in fact, if you really wanted to learn all that and to start your own business, we would incubate your business so that, in effect, we would create our own competitors.  So the question was, could you go out and find the contracts to provide the transportation services to meet the mobility crisis, and in so doing, create a viable business that would never leave the community.  Sure, the owners of the business might want to lose--move to the suburbs, but they had to come back every morning to the community.  Well, it was a brilliant design.  Everyone loved it.  We were invited to be on so many, Congress, panels, the White House, etc.  Rodney Slater said it was a great idea.  Today there is not one transportation company owned and controlled by minorities dealing with the mobility crisis.  This is the year 2003.  Now, there are a whole bunch of reasons as to why that's not the case, basically, in part, we lack the moral vision, (b) nobody really wants to share.  The businesses will claim that they can't find employees, that nobody wants to get up off of it.  And then when I go to CTA [Chicago Transit Authority, Chicago, Illinois] (laughs), and to say to them, say look, I'll give you a piece of the action.  People have become so adverse, or averse to risk, that, well, there must be something wrong.  No, this couldn't possibly work.  We couldn't possibly create our own companies, okay.  You know, that debate's been going on, again, for many, many, many years.  So Transport America was a wonderful vision.  We poured all of our money into, and we went bankrupt.  We lost all of our money, our savings, everything.  Now, that doesn't embitter me, but what it did do is, was adversity.  I now know the strengths and the limitations of free private enterprise, okay; that I know that you can't simply say it's access to capital, and that's gonna turn things around, no.  You have a have a role for government.  There has to be a role for the private sector, has to be a role for non-profit sector.  I understand that.  I think that now allows me to speak truth to power.  I can tell President Bush (laughs), and I can tell, you know, Kofi Annan, I can whoever, that it's necessary, but not sufficient.  Don't think I would have been able to do that if we hadn't spent three, four years of our life trying to build a business, and bringing our son.  He was the guinea pig.  We had a partner.  We put him in to the outer jobs cause that's how we were gonna track the competencies.  So I have a son who has a BA in philosophy, but he also can repair a bus.  He can drive a bus.  He can relate to drivers, black drivers who play bid whist and white drivers who play pinochle, okay.  And in the city, the South side of Chicago.  He understands that, okay.  But he also understands he has an obligation, okay.  The, he has to figure out in his generation how to make a difference.  The beat goes on.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) being?
Speaker 2: For justice, for fairness, fighting racism.  How to use education, employment cause we know that education, and all alone, I can design the finest educational programs.  But if people don't have jobs, that's not gonna change.  Same thing, I couldn't, you know--Booker T. Washington and [W.E.B.] DuBois both were right, [Marcus] Garvey, together, they're all right (laughter).  You know, so this, this notion of segmenting the issues and fragmenting, no, it, it won't work.  You need to have the moral vision, the compelling vision.
Speaker 1: You went from being an entrepreneur back to academia?
Speaker 2: Back to academia because Tufts University [Medford. Massachusetts] decided--the president, that his hallmark, his legacy would be to--and these are my words, to embroider onto the intellectual and social fabric of Tufts University, the values, the knowledge, the skills of active, engaged citizenship with a lifetime commitment of service to society.  That should be the hallmark of a graduate of Tufts University.  And so I left and came back to academe to create the University College of Citizenship and Public Service [at Tufts University].
Story_ID: 7244
Speaker 1: So at Tufts [University, Medford, Massachusetts] you influenced many students for the two years that you were there?
Speaker 2: Yes, and that's because the president, John DiBiaggio had his epiphany when there was the America's Promise [Alliance for Youth. A;exandria, Virginia, a community action program].  This was a summit for all the presidents.  And John was the president of the University of Connecticut [Storrs, Connecticut] when I went to Aetna [Casualty & Life Insurance Company].  And I reached out to John and to [Stephen J.] Steve Trachtenberg, who was, at that time, was the president of the University of Hartford [Hartford, Connecticut] and Colin Campbell who was the president of West-Weslyan [University, Middletown, Connecticut].  And at Aetna, I said, let us come together.  And the Aetna Institute was the vehicle for really creating for the first time, partnerships between the institute and leaders in higher education.  That's, okay, that's back in the '80's [1980s].  Fast forward, here's John.  He's the president of, of, of Tufts, and he wants to capture the essence of service and make it a core of Tufts, of the Tufts experience, whether undergraduate or graduate.  So, now, I come and help.  Well, I know, I knew, I knew a lot about higher education, and how to create these colleges and university partnerships, etc.  And that's why I said, yes--my heart skipped a beat.  I said, "Yes, now, I'm ready for this."  And that's when I went to Tufts.  And we did it for two years, two and a half years.  We worked hard, and it was while I was there that I was quote "called" to Phelps Stokes [Fund, New York, New York.].  That's, that in itself is a whole, another story, but--.
Speaker 1: Was that a hard decision for you?
Speaker 2: It was a very hard decision.  Tufts was interesting.  I was back in Massachusetts.  But what was toughest about the new job was whether I would fail, and whether I would fail by the standards of [parents] Bill and Ruth Foster.  Now, you can understand.  Phelps Stokes was created in 1911 by a white woman who said, there are three issues that need to be addressed now, right now.  One is education, one is housing and one is racial harmony.  In education, she was right up front, the education of Negroes, American Indians, deserving whites, which meant Appalachian whites, and Africans in Africa.  That's the name of the game.  What are we going to do?  And she was a great believer in Booker T. Washington.  And so she said, "I want my money spent now making something happen on education."  The second one, housing.  Tenement housing in New York is horrible.  Do something.  And third, racial harmony.  So Phelps Stokes created the first interracial council in the United States.  It was in Atlanta, Georgia in 1911, the first institute for race relations in South Africa, 1911.  On tenement housing, Phelps Stokes was the leader in creating legislation eventually to create public housing in the state of New York.  This is why housing is no longer part of our, our focus.  And then on education, basically, Phelps Stokes did the first study on education in 1917.  It was a 1200-page report that documents at least in the South, teaching, materials, resources and a purchase, and came out with a set of standards which then were used to fund private education for black folks for the next fifty, sixty years.  This, at Phelps Stokes the decision was made that there would three institutions of graduate studies, Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] in Atlanta [ref. to Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]  It was at Phelps Stokes that any requests for a general education fund, they all have gone through Phelps Stokes.  So Fred Patterson became president of Phelps Stokes.  And that's where he incubated United Negro College Fund, created the American Indian College Fund.  The three major commissions that structured education for blacks in sub-Saharan in Africa were done at Phelps Stokes in the 1920s and '30's [1930s].  So to be offered to be the sixth president and the fifth African American, that had a really symbolic importance to me, and particularly, our work in the United States for African Americans and American Indians and folks in Africa.  Now, I'm beginning to have to measure myself against Bill and Ruth Foster.  They had virtually nothing, and yet my father trained over half the plumbers in, in the country of Liberia, on his own. He built a replica (laughs) of a, of a, of a bathroom.  And for most of the houses up country, that bathroom is the standard bathroom (laughs) because people were taught, this is exactly how we do it.  Well, when I see what they did, and now, here I am in the Phelps Stokes Fund, what--can I measure up?  Well, in essence--and then also, I had to be very honest with myself that the Fund had really faltered and had to be rebuilt.  I didn't realize the extent to which it had to be rebuilt. but coming in, I was resisting that because I'm saying well, gee, you know, I don't want to live in New York, etc., etc.  But all the reasons I had for not doing it kept being removed.  And then, so until it was clear to me, this is, quite frankly, what, what I'm supposed to be doing.  And I enjoy it.
Speaker 1: What are your immediate goals then with, with Phelps Stokes?
Speaker 2: Well, in Africa, unless you begin to address HIV/AIDS in Africa, forget everything else.  And so what I think we need to do is we need to do is we need to find ways to increase the capacity of communities, to care for those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS so that [the] locus of action must be at the community level, not at the researcher level, whatever, it needs to be done.  But it's at that community level that we need to hold people accountable cause there's lots of research that's being done, activities are being done that are not having an impact at the community level.  So the first thing is the community.  The second is how do you then increase the capacity of the community to care, by creating centers of excellence in universities?  Now, we get to knowledge in the service of what and the service of whom.  So how do we have African universities to redefine themselves in a relationship to the societies that support them?  And then third, how do you use information technology to capture the best knowledge of what works for whom, and under what circumstances, in nickel and dime language, that therefore, is, that knowledge is accessible to peo-people at the community level where the care is being delivered.  And when I use the word 'care', I don't mean help.  You help somebody when the need has already been known.  Care involves the anticipation of harm.  So when I talk about increasing the capacity of communities to care, it means not only, yeah, okay, you are sick now, and I will give you some medicine, but now, I'm thinking about, well, why are you getting sick?  What are those other conditions and how can I, in fact, anticipate that and then intervene?  And that seems to me what universities ought to be about.  And unfortunately, many African universities have now replicated the European and the American models.  And so they have somehow had a view that service learning is something that is less rigorous or less valued than, you know, pure research or whatever.  So in Africa it's, it's--that's the focus.  Increase the capacity of communities to care for those infected and affected.  And then secondly, the role of universities.  In the, in the United States, it's not that different.  Again, it's strengthening our institutions of higher learning, particularly those who are serving a majority of students of color or poor students, from poor backgrounds or schools that are serving children who have been placed at risk.  It's not their fault, they've been placed at risk. and specifically, teaching.  So we are going to be doing a lot of work in how do you attract, develop and retain the superior talented people who wish to teach children of color who have been placed at risk or children of color and people who economically have been placed at risk.  So those are the two, and then lastly, this, this question of racial harmony.  I think we are now taking on a focus of the diasper, so we are now engaged in discussions on the relationship of Afro-Latinos, indigenous populations in Central and Latin America, whereas before we focused on the American Indians.  I think we're now realizing that we need to, to at least--so that's basically, what Phelps Stokes.  And we're honest brokers, and we try to put deals together.  I guess that's the, being more catalytic.
Story_ID: 7245
Speaker 1: Now, you are versed in Arabic.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Has that been--how that affected, how has the recent events that have focused on Arabic students and so forth affected you, with your background?
Speaker 2: Well, it's good and, and it's troubling.  I don't know a lot, but I know more than the people in the Defense Department and the White House [George W. Bush administration].  If you were to take a look at their, their academic records, ask how many languages they speak, where they lived?  They haven't a clue, haven't a clue of what's in the mind of a young Baghdadi [Iraqi] student and then, then the issues that they are wrestling with. They don't have a clue.  So, therefore, what they do is they project onto the other their notions of how the world works, and because they happen to have a little more power, they think that works.  But that's a formula for disaster.  So I guess, I find it most troubling in that I'm powerless--it's like observing a play.  And I, I'm powerless to intervene, and I've been struggling to figure out, you know, what, what can be done before something horrible happens and, and that's, but I--and I have to be very careful that I don't come across as being very dogmatic and arrogant, you know, and equally offensive.  But the fact that I've lived, and I understand other points of view, that is both enlightening and frustrating.
Speaker 1: You haven't had an opportunity to be asked to be a resource in this, with this regard?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: And I'm not so sure, I, I want to, although I, obviously, I--if asked, I would serve , I mean--but otherwise, it would be a contradiction.

Speaker 1: Let me ask you a legacy question.  What message or lesson do you have for children and grandchildren of the world?
Speaker 2: A--you know, that there is a God.  And how you relate to that idea will be the the determining factor in, in the quality of your life.  That's number one.  So forget so much about your professional degrees and how much money you have in the bank.  Second, it is the, the extent to which you can be of service to other people, that will give you the opportunities to live a wonderful life.  And I didn't fully understand that as I was growing up, but I, now, I really see it.  So it's a combination of, of this notion of service, and, and as I said earlier, you know, work performed in the service of humankind is worship of God, pure and simple.  And I didn't tell you--I mean God broadcasts on AM and FM.  I'm not gonna tell you what radio station to listen to, but whatever, whatever station causes you to keep focus on the transcendent while being in the, in the real world, that's, that's the legacy.  And, and to ask yourself, you know, frequently, how am I doing.
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you'd like to add that we didn't talk about?
Speaker 2: No, my faith, my family, my friends.  Maybe I didn't talk enough about friends, but again, friends based on certain values.  They--as you get older, you realize how important they are.  So that's pretty much it.
Speaker 1: (Julieanna Richardson speaking) Just one, just ask him what he wants his legacy, his legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Okay, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 1: What do I want my legacy to be?  That's a tough, that's a tough question.  I guess that he was an educator in the best sense of that word; that he was always--his intention was to bring out the best in the other person, and to understand that education means bringing forth that which is already there, that, in fact, every human being is born with a gift.  And well, Badi, his legacy is that he, in a variety of ways, he found a way to help me identify what my gift was and, and then my obligation to share it.
