Speaker 1: Spell it for us.
Speaker 2: Howard Kenner, H-O-W-A-R-D K-E-N-N-E-R.
Videographer: Could you tilt your chin down.  Okay, thank you.
Speaker 2: And can you tell me what district you're from, what your birthdate is and what district do you represent?
Speaker 1: I represent the 24th Legislative District located on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: And your birthdate?
Speaker 1: Twelve, twenty-six, fifty-seven [12/26/1957, December 26, 1957].
Story_ID: 57710
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask a series of five questions and short responses are necessary in one word.  Which are your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Cheeseburgers (laughs).
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: It would have to be somewhere where I go frequently which would be southern Florida.
Speaker 1: All right, your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Well, the summertime.
Speaker 1: Okay, your favorite color?
Speaker 2: It would have to be blue.
Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: "I didn't do it" (laughter).  "That wasn't me, sir" (laughter).
Story_ID: 57711
Speaker 1: I see we do have a sense of humor.  I guess if you can't laugh in life then, you know.  Anyway, I want to start out-see, you-well, you're not as young as who we just talked to because you're forty-three.
Speaker 2: Forty-two.
Speaker 1: Forty-two.
Speaker 2: Now let me enjoy this year, okay.  Forty-three will be next year this time.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay, okay, so you're forty-three, sorry.  And, and so I really--because of this-we're a product that's going to be placed in all the public schools in Illinois and you know, we want--you represent sort of an earlier generation because you've been serving since, how long?
Speaker 2: 'Ninety-five [1995].
Speaker 1: 'Ninety-five [1995].
Speaker 2: There's not that much time between me and [Representative] Calvin [Giles] now.  I'm five years older than Calvin.
Speaker 1: He's thirty-two.
Speaker 2: Thirty-two?  Well, when you say one of the newest members, you mean in the General Assembly?
Speaker 1: In the General Assembly.
Speaker 2: Well I would have to say that I am one of your relatively newer members.  My seniority is about at seventy-five right now out of one hundred eighteen members.  So that would put me just above average in terms of my length of stay there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh huh (yes).
Speaker 1: But what about blacks?  That's what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: No.  Blacks have a tendency to have more seniority.  So actually I've been in the General Assembly--now this is my third term.  And for my first two terms I was the-you know, I had the least amount of seniority.  But in the last term, two other black legislators joined us.  So I've moved up from being last in seniority out of fifteen black legislators in the house to about number thirteen in seniority.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I, I wonder if I should do this interview in the opposite way.  Maybe I will.  Let's talk about the - usua -- well, no.
Speaker 2: You changed the format on me?  Okay, let me brace myself here.
Story_ID: 57712
Speaker 1: (Laughing) Okay, no, I'll go the regular way.  I want to start out by asking about your mother and father.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And your family and what you know of their background.  You were born here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, but I would like to know where they were from?  And what you know of their parents.
Speaker 2: Uh huh (yes).
Speaker 1: First you can start with your father or your mother or--
Speaker 2: Well I guess it would probably be easiest to start with my mother, Emma Kenner.  She was born in Dallas, Texas, [June 30,] 1935.  And she was -- my grandmother, her mother, I don't know much about her.  She died young and my mother was her only child.  And my mother's father was a gentleman that owned a supermarket in, in the community in Dallas.  And the -- my mother ended up growing up in a boarding home because of the racial climate at the time.  Her father was an Irish gentleman and in 1935 down in Dallas you had a Jim Crow Society.  So when my mother's mother passed, he decided that his daughter would-could not necessarily be raised in his neighborhood and so he put her in a boarding home.  And that's how my mother--she was raised in a boarding home.  And she became a model at a very early age and that's how she ended up meeting my dad.  She actually toured the country doing different work throughout the country, and particularly cities like Chicago [Illinois] and New York.  So she'd be here in Chicago quite often, and that's how she met my dad.  She was a very good friend of Ernie Banks, who at that time was a [base]ball player that had been--had just been drafted by the Chicago Cubs around that time [1953].  And so she was a very good friend of Molly Banks, who was Ernie's wife at the time, and whenever she'd come to Chicago she'd stay at his house.  And my dad [Tyrone Kenner, born July 8, 1928] was a police officer in that community at that time and he would stop there.  He had an aversion towards public washrooms, and after meeting my mother, (laughing) that heightened his aversion toward public washrooms.  So it seems that whenever she was in town, he'd have his need to go to their house for--to take care of his, you know, whatever--nature would call, and whenever she'd be in town (laughs) nature would call pretty often.  So that's how they met.  And so they met and got married and I was born [1957], you know, within a year.  And my mother subsequently moved to Chicago [Illinois].  And my dad is a product-he's a Chicago native, although he was raised in Blue Island - Robbins [Illinois], right outside of Blue Island.  He went to Eisenhower High School and graduated from there.  Went into the service and was stationed in Germany.  And his first wife was French and when they moved back to Chicago they divorced within about a year.  And he was a bachelor for a couple of years before he met my mother.  So my mother was his second wife.  And he was on the police force at the time.  He was a detective on the, on the West Side [of Chicago], subsequently.  At first he was just a street cop on the near South Side of Chicago.  And so that was his background.
Story_ID: 57713
Speaker 1: Now, what are some of your memories of growing up?  I mean where, where were you?  What was the first house you lived in?  But what were some of your memories?
Speaker 2: No, when I was born my parents lived in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois].  And my earliest memories are of my mother taking me to the A&P at 51st [Street] and Lake Park [Lake Shore Drive] -- now it's Village Foods but at that time it was A&P.  And I guess I probably had to be three or four and my mother would take me down there, and the park right there at 51st and Lake Shore Drive.  I remember playing in that retaining pool there where they have the fountain in the park there.  So those was my -- were my earliest memories growing up in Hyde Park.  About the time in which I started school-which I probably was about five, kindergarten -- my parents ended up moving further south.  They bought a home at 92nd [Street] and Wallace [Street, Chicago, Illinois] and I'm going to Ryder Elementary School until I was about in third grade, at which time my parents separated and my mother decided that it would probably be better if she moved back to Texas.  By that time she had four kids and myself being the oldest.  And she moved back to Dallas [Texas] because she had relatives there and she just thought it would be a safer place, this being the early sixties [1950s], early to mid-sixties [1960s].  And at that time it was -- Chicago was developing a significant gang problem at that time, and she felt that being a single parent it probably would be better to raise us down South.  And in retrospect I think she made a very good decision.
Speaker 1: So how w-how was it being raised down South at that time?  How old were you?
Speaker 2: When we moved there I was eight years old.
Story_ID: 57714
Speaker 1: Okay, so you weren't necessarily a conscious person at that time.  I mean, did it seem different from Chicago [Illinois], the South?
Speaker 2: Dallas [Texas] at that time was a very changing community.  We moved there in 1965.  And, of course, up until the late fifties [1950s], early sixties [1960s], it was Jim Crow society down there as it was through most of the South.  But it was a time in which things were opening up for blacks in Dallas.  Housing was opening up-as a matter of fact, when we moved to Dallas we moved to a changing neighborhood on the outskirts of the city.  Up until that time, most blacks were bottle necked in South Dallas, certain portions of North Dallas, and in a small area in Oak Cliff.  And so within the early sixties [1960s], mid-sixties [1960s], after the Voting Rights Act [1965] and that subsequent legislation that came with that, the housing opportunities started to open up around the city.  So my mother moved back just in time to benefit from that.  So we kind of lived in a more suburban type of community down in Dallas.  It was interesting.  I remember -- my, my -- one of my first memories of moving to Dallas was that I learned to play football.  I never played football before.  The school right out on 87th Street [Chicago, Illinois] that I went to before we moved, they had no grass around the school.  It was just concrete.  And it was a school that was probably built in the late eighteenth -- in the late nineteenth Century, and it was a big and very imposing -- I thought, ugly -- structure.  And so we moved to Dallas [Texas], you know.  I went to one of these rather suburban looking schools that sat on a hill with a lot of land around it and football fields and baseball diamonds.  And one of the first things I learned to do was play football and it was something that has stuck with me throughout my life.  It's one of my favorite sports now.  And so it was a rather -- it was a rather -- it opened up a lot of things.  Because we lived close to the outskirts of the city, there was a lot of open area and we lived next-rather close to horse ranches and things like that.  So I had the type of upbringing there that I never would have been exposed to in Chicago.  I learned to ride horses very early.  We lived a half block away from a horse ranch where we could ride horses.  And one Christmas my mother got me a pony for Christmas and I kept it stabled at the horse ranch.  We could go hunting.  We lived within a mile of the city limits.  And unlike Chicago [Illinois] where when you leave the city you go from-you can't tell the difference between the city and the suburbs, there you had miles of vacant land between your urban city area and your nearest suburb.  So, you know, was a lot of open land down there-and we had BB guns and pellet guns-where we would go hunting and fishing and things like that, very close to my house, within five or ten minute walk of my house.  So it was a very interesting and I thought a very-you know, I had a rather enjoyable childhood in that respect.  So I thought that it was a very wise choice on my mother's part to move us down to Dallas [Texas].  But it's not the type of city that I would-I always knew that I would be an adult back here in Chicago [Illinois].  We would come-go back and forth between Chicago and Dallas.  We would spend the summers in Chicago with my dad, and we would be down there with my mom for eight or nine months out the year during the school semesters.  So, you know, so I was raised in both Chicago and Dallas.  But I always knew that I would be back here as an adult.
Speaker 1: And-
Videographer: Give me a second just to adjust the mike.
Speaker 1: (TAPE EDIT)
Speaker 2: ... School from Kenwood High School [Chicago, Illinois].  I went to school in Dallas [Texas] from the middle of my third grade year up until the end of my junior year and we moved back the summer right before my senior year.  So I went to-I graduated from Kenwood High School here in Chicago.
Speaker 1: What was the reason for moving back?
Speaker 2: My mother met an untimely death and we moved back to live with my dad at that time.
Story_ID: 57715
Speaker 1: So-what-you're the oldest.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so what is-who are your other siblings?  What are their names?
Speaker 2: Well, Brian Kenner is next to me in age.  He's about a year and a half younger than me and he's a supervisor with the Department of Sewers here in Chicago [Illinois].  And Renee Kenner is the oldest girl and she's a counselor actually with the Department of Corrections here in, for the county, for the sheriff's department.  Kimberley Kenner is next in line, she's number four and she's-at this time she's an entrepreneur, she owns a restaurant downtown [Chicago, Illinois], Snaps Creole Restaurant at Randolph [Street] and Halsted [Street] in fine dining.  They have wonderful food down there.  And then I have twin sisters, Sonia and Tanya and they're both housewives.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  So did you feel anything being the oldest in any way?  I mean was there more expected of you or (unclear).  It was all -- two boys and the girls.
Speaker 2: Four girls.  And me being the oldest -- oh, absolutely.  From, from the earliest moments of my mother's break up with my dad, I felt -- I guess I felt the sense of responsibility, the sense of, of -- that I was in a responsible position within the family.  My mother would always refer to me as her "little man."  And so yes, from a very early age I felt very responsible to contribute to the family.  And I started working very early; probably at -- by the age of eleven or twelve I was out looking for employment, working in a series of odd jobs: paper routes, I established a little lawn mower service in the community and built up a little book of business there, and I started working-my first real job was, I was a bus boy at the Old Baker Hotel down in Dallas, which was subsequently torn down.  But I probably started working there-oh, I must have been thirteen or fourteen. I worked there for about a year or so.  I took a typing class in my -- in the eighth grade.  I was the only boy in the typing class.  I got a lot of ridicule from my friends about that, but I was subsequently able, at the end of the year, to type about fifty-five words a minute with about three or four mistakes.  And at that time -- that was 1973 -- the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] was looking for blacks to get involved in the aviation field, specifically to become air traffic controllers.  So I was just graduating from elementary school in the eighth grade, and they were looking for a black youngster graduating from high school to work as an intern at Rayburn Airport down in Dallas but the only requirement was that you had to type thirty-five words a minute.  So I went in there and kind of fudged my application a little bit and told them I had just graduated from high school and got the job.  So, my fondest memory of that was that I had to wear a suit every day to work and I had one suit.  It was more of a winter suit.  It was like a tweed wool suit.  And if you know anything about Texas in the summer time it was -- you know, those first couple of weeks, it was rather steamy waiting on that bus, then go to work (laughs).  But after I was-collected a check or two, I was able to get me a few more shirts and ties, so.  They gave me a little certificate at the end of the summer that I'm still proud of.  So.
Speaker 1: How did you find out about this?
Speaker 2: I went to an employment agency.
Speaker 1: At what age?
Speaker 2: I think I was fourteen.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughing).
Speaker 2: I just finished eighth grade.  So I was-if you can imagine, I was a huge joke around the airport because (laughs) I think it was rather obvious that I didn't graduate from high school.  But I could type and so that -- I was the only child, young man that they could find that had any type of typing abilities.  And I could actually type fifty words a minute, like I said, with about two errors, so they took me.  And you know, so that was my second job, but it was my first and, and I was very -- the one I remember.  I was so proud because I would be on the bus with a tie on, and all the older ladies that would be on the bus going to work -- and many of them going to more domestic type jobs and things -- made such a fuss over me on the bus, every day, you know, because I was wearing this shirt and tie going to work and obviously, probably it looked like I was all of about twelve years old.  So it did a lot to help my self-esteem at that time.  So I would say that that was a big moment for me, working at Rayburn Airport as a summer intern that particular summer.
Story_ID: 57716
Speaker 1: That is so -- now, now, what was-what was the young Howard Kenner like?  I mean what were your sort of dreams?  Everyone has sort of dreams that they have and what were yours?
Speaker 2: Well my mother, I think, instilled in me at a very early age that I would certainly -- that I was in her eyes unusual and that I had to do something rather outstanding.  That it was something out in the world that I had to do to stand out.  She -- I don't think she would accept that her oldest son was just a regular child so she always instilled in me this sense that there was some kind -- that I --there was some type of mission out there for me.  Aside from my mother, you know how they kind of track you in schools and things like that.  I think that, you know, fortunately or some -- maybe sometimes looking back maybe it was (laughs) unfortunate but I think that I was tested very early.  I think that I did okay.  So the next thing I -- next thing I knew, the public schools down there were tracking me very early.  I can remember, probably as far back as the fifth grade, being pulled aside from my peers.  And all of a sudden I was looked at by the school and most of my teachers as being a child that needed more special attention in the sense that I probably was able to move a little bit faster than most of the other kids.  And so they were -- they wanted to provide that type of learning opportunity for me.  So there again, I had -- I can remember specific teachers at that time that instilled in me that, you know, that I was not a lot like -- there was something a little bit different within me than most of my friends and that it would behoove me to take advantage of that and use that and, and that there were certain resources within the educational system that would be there for me if I chose that route.  So I -- but at the same time I always saw myself as just being -- I never saw myself as a nerd and most of my friends I don't think saw me as a nerd.  So I, I, I was pretty much a regular young child in the neighborhood that wanted to play and learn and hang out with the other kids.  But for six hours out the day I was pulled away from them and, you know, and although we attended the same schools I was on a different path.  And so that's one of the overwhelming, compelling memories that I have -- particularly of being a teenager, of my teen years, and in elementary school, my late elementary school years, and certainly my secondary education -- was the fact that I, I was a normal kid in most respects except for the type of education that I was receiving, although I went to the same schools as my buddies.
Story_ID: 57717
Speaker 1: Now you-okay, I unders -- you, and you moved here, your mother passed away about-
Speaker 2: 'Seventy-five [1975].
Speaker 1: And so you were about, what, sixteen?
Speaker 2: Seventeen.  I was, I was-yes, I was seventeen and going into my senior year and I would turn eighteen later that year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I have one question I haven't asked many people, but being raised by a single mother what impact do you think that had on you?
Speaker 2: (Laughing) Well, okay this is off the record.  No.  Well, I would have to say that -- I would say that my mother [Emma Kenner], as I stated earlier, was a very -- probably a very precocious child growing up.  She was certainly a very beautiful woman.  But she was -- she grew up at a particular time in our society where people tried to judge her.  And I think that one of the biggest problems that she had was the fact that she loved her father dearly but because of the society we lived in she was not able to enjoy her father the way she would have probably liked to have enjoyed him as she was growing up as a youngster.  I think that that had a profound impact on my mother.  I think that my mother found herself being rebellious very early.  My mother was what some folks would term now, very loosely, as being probably a fast woman.  She knew her way around the block.  She was certainly not naive.  She knew men and loved men and enjoyed men and certainly benefited probably mentally from men.  These are memories that I have of my mother growing up.  And I've never married. I've been single my entire life.  And I've probably -- I always said that I'd probably always be a bachelor.  And so although I love women and enjoy women for some reason I find that it's -- I go to a certain point and don't cross that line.  And I think it has something to do with my relationship with my mother and her relationships that she had that I found myself observing at a very early age.
Story_ID: 57718
Speaker 1: Okay, I appreciate the honesty.  I -- so your mother passed away sort of unexpectedly and, and it's hard some -- a lot of times to lose a parent.  But you were used to coming up to Chicago [Illinois] and so when you-so how was that whole experience, 'cause that represented a different change, you know.  At the time especially, you know, you were in your junior year?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you formed friendships and things.
Speaker 2: I think that I've always sort of seen myself living -- and even to this day, I, I feel very at ease living in different worlds, you might say.  And I felt very comfortable at that time commuting back and forth between Dallas [Texas] and Chicago [Illinois].  It was a big difference, Dallas being a lot slower at the time.  We enjoyed more of a suburban type of being in Dallas and then for three or four months out the year, we'd come to Chicago.  My dad at the time was in politics.  He was an alderman on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] in the 3rd Ward.  He lived at 45th [Street] and Michigan [Avenue], and so 45th and Michigan is about as urban as urban can get.  Right in the heart of the city.  Right in the heart of the 'hood.  And it was very exciting to come up in the summer times.  And we would come up and work jobs, you know.  We would-because of his position, there were very nice summer jobs available to us.  So we would come up and work.  But at the same time it was just such an experience to come up and be a part of this whole urban thing at that age.  So it was very exciting.  And I always knew that, al-although I never anticipated that I would lose my mother and that's how I ended up in Chicago, I, I figured that I would end up back by coming North to go to college.  And I ended up coming back, I ended up going to college in the North but as it turned out I was already living up here.  But I had already planned to apply to northern universities and come back.  It was always my intent to be an adult here in Chicago and not in Dallas, but we ended up here a few years earlier.
Speaker 1: Tell me some of the people that-
Speaker 2: Off-camera voice:  Time to change tape.
Story_ID: 57719
Speaker 1: I'm sure.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  We're ready.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, go on.
Speaker 2: Your question again?
Speaker 1: You, you were saying--I was saying it must have been experience.  I'd like to know, you know, what that was because you were exposed to a lot of people then.   Your father--I mean, you were saying, "Well my father was--" I mean, 'cause he was an alderman.
Speaker 2: My father was an alderman at the time.  He became an alderman in 1971.  I--that would have put me at about thirteen at the time.  So, as I stated earlier, I started working down in Dallas [Texas] at about thirteen and we started coming to Chicago [Illinois] in the summers to work in 1974.   In 1973, I worked for the FAA down in Dallas and the summers after that I would come to Chicago and work and I found it to be a riveting experience, particularly politically.  I would works jobs, I think my first couple summers I worked for the Department of Development and Planning down in City Hall.  A lot of time on my hands at the time, so what I would do is spend a lot of time at City Council Meetings.  I would just show up to the meetings, sit in the back, watch the proceedings.  And I would hang out in the back and watch my dad, observe that and, you know, you had a very interesting cast of characters that were involved in Chicago politics at the time.  People like Alderman Burnett out of the Second Ward.  Alderman Timothy Evans out of the Fourth [Ward].  Sawyer was downtown, William Cousins was an alderman at the time.  You had gentlemen like [Isaac] Carothers off the West Side.  Old Man Daley, Mayor [Richard J.] Daley, the father, was mayor at the time.  Then you had very colorful aldermen that I was exposed to at a very early age--[Bill] Lipinski, Alderman Lipinski, Alderman [Edward M.] Burke, gentlemen like that.  So, you know, it was just a very interesting experience and it was an early education in politics at the time when I first starting coming to Chicago.  So.
Speaker 1: What do you feel you learned by those things?  I mean did some of those people seem larger than life in any way?
Speaker 2: I, I don't think so. I think to me, at that time, everybody that was over twenty-one seemed larger than life (laughs).  I had not--I don't think that it occurred to me at that time.  I don't remember saying that--you know, I don't think I was old enough at that time to differentiate it.  It never occurred to me that that there was a huge difference between people that were out moving and shaking and people that were probably standing around on the corner.  I probably just--I think in my own mind--just felt like hey, you know, somebody was just spending their time a little bit wiser than somebody else.  So I, I don't recall being in awe or anything like that.  I was just around people that were doing some very interesting things and, of course, I think that it subsequently had a rather positive impact on me.
Story_ID: 57720
Speaker 1: And so you went to Kenwood [High School, Chicago, Illinois].  Were there people that--were you in awe of your father at that point?
Speaker 2: My father [Tyrone Kenner] was my hero at the time and he still is.  I, I can't necessarily say that I was in awe of him.  He was just my dad.  We've always been good friends.  And I probably--if I have a problem, particularly politically, if I have the slightest doubt about a decision, then I won't hesitate to call my dad. I see him as being a master political strategist.  I've always felt that and throughout my life I've always leaned on him for advice in particular.  So I've always had a great respect for my dad's political acumen and he's still around and still out there and I still will pick up the telephone and say, "Hey dad, what do you think about this situation?"  And many times he will give me some advice and then I'll go back and do or use or say whatever he gave me and look like, you know, look like the big hero.  But, but it's really dad back in the background saying, "Hey, maybe you should say this or maybe you should do that.  This is what I would do if I were in your situation or if I was in the same situation this is what I would do."  And I've learned an awful lot from my dad, so.
Speaker 1: And tell--tell me some of the things you've learned.  Because I think, you know, the thing about that I didn't realize about politics 'til I worked at City Hall, there's a game.  You know, when I first got there and I heard people splitting verbs, I thought, "Oh, these people don't know what they're doing."  Then I realized it was a whole method to the madness.  And I was wondering, you know, some of the things you've learned.
Speaker 2: You know, I think that the most important lesson that I've learned from my dad, my dad--and I've learned lessons from other people, but I think the most important lesson that I've learned from my dad was at one point in my life I was trying to reach a goal and I reached out to most of the people I knew and asked for their support and what I found was that the support was not there and it was something that really struck me in my core.
Videographer: You're hitting the mike when you put your hands up here.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Go back.  You were saying, "One of the lessons I learned from my dad--"
Speaker 2: You know, the--one of the biggest lessons I learned from my dad was in the--and, and I'll give you a quick story of how I learned this lesson.  I had a goal that I was trying to reach in my life at one time and I, you know, came up with a long list of friends and relatives and people, acquaintances, people I went to school with and worked with throughout my life.  And I spent a tremendous amount of time putting this list together.  And I contacted these individuals at this time, trying to get them to help me on this project and I was not very successful with getting people to agree to give me a hand.  And many of the people that did agree to help me, you know, they subsequently didn't come through with the help.  So I sat down with my dad very shaken about this and I shared my experience with him.  And he said, "Howard, it's very simple.  You've never done anything for anybody.  Nobody owes you anything.  You know, nobody's quick to help you because you never helped them."  And I think that that's something that's always stuck with me.  And I think that if it's one thing that I think that I'm becoming known for in politics and within my community and just in general, is a guy that, you know, if you go and ask him to help you out in a--with a certain problem or situation, it doesn't take a whole lot of nudging to get him to help you out with that.  And I think that that is the reason, because that was such a traumatic experience for--and when my dad shared that bit of insight with me, I think that I promised myself that if I was ever in a position to help people, that it would be something that I would certainly relish because (laughs) I don't ever want to be in a position of trying to obtain a goal and not being able to reach out and find the assistance that I may need only because I've never helped other people.  So that's probably the biggest lesson that I've learned from my dad.

Speaker 1: Now what--when you graduated--
Speaker 2: --University of Illinois down in Champaign.
Speaker 1: And what--you majored in--
Speaker 2: I went down there as a political science major and I--and I subsequently, after my first semester, changed to accounting.  And I always had, I guess, a talent or proficiency for mathematics and science and logic and things like that but that's not really what I enjoyed.  I've always enjoyed reading--reading fiction and great novels, 'Moby Dick' [Herman Melville, 1851], the 'Invisible Man' [Ralph Ellison, 1952].  But I didn't do quite as well, although I probably did above average, in those particular areas.  I was very good in mathematics and logic and things.  But like I said, when I first went away to university, I was political science major.  And during my first semester I was asked to do a paper, a term paper in two classes down at the University of Illinois.  Now at that time you had to take a Rhet[oric] 105 class and anybody that's gone to the university and knows the University of Illinois, knows about Rhetoric 105 because that's one of the few classes that all of the students have to take.  And also had a Political Science 150 class, which was general political science.  And I had to do a term paper.  And so I decided that instead of doing two term papers, I would just do one term paper, turn it in to both classes.  I've always tried to be very efficient with my time and, and one of the ways I wanted to use my time was hang out at the fraternity parties and things, so if I did one paper I could have more time to do those types of things. So I did one paper.  It was on a political subject but I was able to turn it in to both classes.  And I got an 'A' on the paper in my rhetoric class, and the young teaching assistant pulled me over and he said, "Man, this is a pretty nice paper.  What do you--what would you like to do?"  And I said, "Well, I'm thinking about maybe one day going to law school."  He said, "Well, you know, if you'd like to come in and get a recommendation to law school I certainly will give you that because this is a good paper and you know, you've done some other decent things during the semester.  And I certainly would be willing to give you that letter of recommendation."  On the other hand, my political science professor gave me a, I believe, a 'D+' on the exact same paper (laughs).  So I went and talked to her about the paper.  And she said, "It's a great paper, but I think you plagiarized the whole thing."  I said, "Why do you think that?"  She says, "I don't know, but I don't think anybody coming from your community could write a paper like this."  And so the paper stood.  I ended up getting an 'A' in Rhetoric and a 'C' in political science.  And I went home and thought about it and--a lot--during my Christmas vacation.  And I was talking to someone that was an accountant at the time and I was so disturbed about that whole process.  I thought that, you know, the whole grading thing really disturbed me.  And I realized at the time that with the subjective nature of grading papers and things like that, you know, that I could really be at the whim of college professors and teaching assistants my entire academic career.  So as I stated earlier, I always had a proficiency in mathematics and things like that and I decided to--at that time, when I went back to the university [of Illinois] in January --to switch my major to accounting because I felt like either you get the right answer or you don't; it's no arguing about it.  One and one is two.  One teacher can't give you an A and another one give you a D.  If the answer is two, then the answer is two.  And so that's how I ended up and that's the reason why I ended up changing my major in my second semester of my freshman year.
Story_ID: 57722
Speaker 1: And then--so you finished college and then what, what--what is your--you, you worked as a CPA [certified public accountant], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I still work as a CPA.  I graduated from the University of Illinois in 1980.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) That's a five year program right?
Speaker 2: No, that's a four year program.  Became a CPA [certified public accountant].  I graduated--worked for a firm, Ernst and Whinney, at the time.   And Ernst and Whinney at that time was a "big eight" CPA firm.  So that's where I began my, my working career, as an accountant at Ernst and Whinney.  So, you know, I started off as a staff accountant at the time and at the same time I was involved with my dad's [Tyrone Kenner] political organization.  He was still at that time alderman of the 3rd Ward [Chicago, Illinois].  So when I got out of school, I got involved with that at the same time I was working for the firm, but I would spend my evenings and nights and weekends being involved in politics.  So what I did was, within a few months of--well, I graduated in 1980 and if you go back you realize that that was a presidential election year, 1980.  So I got out of school in June and we were just getting ready for the general election in January.  And so what I did was--it was a very good time for me to get involved in politics.  There was a woman by the name of Wynetta Frazier.  She's Dr. Frazier at this time but at that time she was just Wynetta Frazier, and she was running for state representative.  And so her campaign manager--I've just gotten out of school and wasn't involved at the time, and her (laughs) campaign manager was a very attractive lady that I found to be very attractive.  So I ended up being the campaign treasurer, so I could get to know her campaign manager.  And during the process, you know--and many times it will lead you to something very interesting (laughing) way but I ended up learning a lot about elections and campaigns.  But it was because, I think at the time, I had much more interest in the campaign manager than I did in the campaign itself.  So, that was my introduction into politics when I graduated from, from college.  And I subsequently, after the election, got more involved in my dad's organization.  I ended up establishing a 3rd Ward Young Democratic Organization of which I became the president of the organization.  And we started doing outreach, so we were able to get a lot of young people in the community, particularly Robert Taylor Homes [Housing projects, Chicago, Illinois], involved in politics and government through the young democratic process.  So that was my initiation into politics.  I became an assistant precinct captain.  So this is my introduction into politics at that time.
Story_ID: 57723
Speaker 1: And what did you like about politics?  What attracted you to it?
Speaker 2: (Laughing) You know my answers.  You want the real stuff.  I'll give you the book answer.  (Laughter) No, I thought that--I thought that--first of all, I enjoyed being involved in politics because I enjoyed the people.  There's always a very diverse group of people that have been involved and attracted to--not just politics, but government in general.  And so I was attracted to that.  I think that I'm--although I've always seen myself as being a rather shy, reserved person, I've always enjoyed being around a lot of interesting people.  I've always enjoyed being in the mix of things, although I'm usually that guy in the background--the, the, the wallflower--but I enjoy just being in the room.  But--so that's probably the initial attraction that I had, was the people, the diversity of people, was just an interesting group of people.  Whereas at the firm [Ernst and Whinney]--the firm seemed to hire a group of people that were very similar and if they weren't similar they tried to mold you into being like the group.  So, you know, everybody kind of enjoyed the same type of movies, enjoyed going to the same type of restaurants, enjoyed wearing the same color suits.  It was just--it was a lot different in the evenings when I was involved in politics.  The group of people was a lot more diverse.  If you've ever been in a room full of aspiring politicians or politicians you, you know--you would think that you were in the [U.S.] Navy or something just by the way a lot of people would talk, you know.  People have a tendency to just kind of share a part of themselves, a real part of themselves.  Whereas in the corporate environment it seemed as though a lot of people kind of held back and it was not the proper thing to do to be yourself.  The proper thing to do was to be more like the group.  So I think that was my initial attraction within politics.  I guess it gave me a way to be around real people after being around a group of people that I made my living around, but at the same time I didn't find it to be a whole lot of fun.  I found politics--although I was a volunteer, I found it to be a lot of fun at the time.  So that was my initial attraction.
Story_ID: 57724
Speaker 1: So when do you think you start having, yourself, political aspirations?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't recall ever reaching that point as much as just being a son of an elected official.  And I guess I had gotten out of college [University of Illinois, 1980], I was a professional man and all that.  People around just kind of assumed that there was something in the air, there was a future that I had in elected politics.  It was nothing that I really aspired for at the time as much as I was just kind of told by everybody around me that that was something--that that was just going to happen.  So, and I think that that just kinda--just being in the environment and being on the set kind of put that bug in my head.  And, you know, the next thing I knew I was believing it and thinking it and figuring that, hey, you know, I guess one day, I guess I will be down in Springfield [Illinois] and Washington [D.C.] or down in City Hall or someplace.
Story_ID: 57725
Speaker 1: Now when your father [Tyrone Kenner], your father got into--your father actually was convicted [1983], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was that whole period like for you?  I mean, has he ever been proved--he had been a star, right, in the, in the City Council?
Speaker 2: He was seen as being somewhat of a rising star within the City Council.  And it came as--it was very devastating, not just for my dad, but for my entire family and many people within the organization.  My dad actually was indicted in 1982 and convicted--his trial came up in 1983.  But it's ironic that the first time I became aware of the investigation was when my dad came down to my graduation, my college graduation.  He was very preoccupied at the time and the federal investigators had been calling around and talking to different people within the organization and, and his acquaintances at the time, asking questions and things, trying to dig up information.  And so they've been doing that for a few months.  And when he came down to my graduation he was very preoccupied with that and that's when it became clear to me what the problem was.  So from the--from the moment of my graduation from college, from there on out, there was a cloud over my dad's career as a public official.  So I kind of came out of school, and that was my initiation to politics, was the cloud over my dad and his career with this federal investigation.
Story_ID: 57726
Speaker 1: Did you find people turned away from you and your family or what was that whole process?   A lot of times when families go through crises like that--
Speaker 2: There was--people did not act differently initially.  But the minute my dad was convicted, I would have to say clearly ninety percent of people I knew--all of a sudden, I had a different relationship with them.  I, I'll never forget: a couple months after my dad's conviction--there was a gentleman within the [3rd Ward Young Democratic] organization, that I could not refer to him without calling him uncle at the time. And I won't reveal his name, but, you know, it was not just for conversation.  It wasn't "Mr. Smith," it was "Uncle Ted," for example, you know.  And he would be so insulted if I didn't refer to him like that.  Couple months after my dad was convicted, I was involved in, in an accident in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois].  And I'm driving--come pulling out of my apartment building and heading to an event that I had gotten fifty dollar tickets for back in 1983 and that's like two hundred dollar tickets now.  (Laughs) You know, I had my suit on and going to pick my date up.  And as soon as I pull out, there's a gentleman driving down Cornell [Avenue] in the middle of the street where there was plenty of room for two cars to get by, but not if one is driving down the middle of the street.  I pull over as far as I can, and he rams right into the front of my car, hits the front of my car.  Well, to make a long story short, the police officers show up.  And I had--although it was clear that this gentleman was intoxicated and he clearly had created this situation, they took one look at my driver's license, and I had failed to renew my driver's license and it had expired.  So they threw me in the back of their squad car and they were getting ready to take me down to the lock up.  And all of a sudden, Uncle Ted pulls up in his car and he knew the police officers.  Well, I told the officers, "That's Uncle Ted, he knows me; he can vouch for me.  Talk to him."  The officers go over to talk to Uncle Ted, and Uncle Ted says, "Who?  I don't know him."  And so that really kind of summed it all up for me.  And, and it's a lesson that has stayed with me most of my life, that I take my current job very seriously but when many people say or act a certain way with me, I just kind of do my little smile and shake my head and keep going because somewhere in the back of my head, I know that if anything came up, then all of a sudden Uncle Ted doesn't know you anymore.  So it's a lesson that I learned very early in life.  And it's just--you know, I think that it's some--it's something that has served me well.  And certainly, at the time I was a little bitter, but I think that it's made me much more effective at my job.  I think that I just, you know, have a--it's, it's a sense about my work that I have and why I'm there and what I should be doing.  And I don't think that I'm distracted by the ways and the things people will say and do to distract you from doing your work or, or the ways in which people try to influence you and try to make you, maybe in some way, feel that you're more important than you really are.  It doesn't affect me in that sense.  And I think that that early lesson has kept me very grounded to the people that I represent.  And although I'm able to move in many--on, on many levels in our society, I think because of that lesson that I learned at that time, I think that I have remained an avid advocate for the people that I represent because of that.  I'm, I'm not seen, I don't think, as one walking around with the big head, because I know "Uncle Ted" is just shucking and jiving me up to begin with.  So--
Story_ID: 57727
Speaker 1: Now just--what I--so were you ever--did you ever ask your father why he did what he did and was there ever--
Speaker 2: Well, there was nothing to really ask my dad about.  He was convicted on some very technical grounds.  The whole thing was blown up to appear that he was out selling jobs to poor people, but that wasn't, in fact, at all what the deal was.  It, it was an investigation that went down in the department of--in the sheriff's department.  And that's where the investigation started, and that's where it ended.  The FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] got some information that the aldermen were using weekend badges as a way to raise money for their organizations.  And the way it worked was this--the sheriff's department has always had what they call "holiday court."  And they've always had sheriffs that were not regular sheriffs to administer "holiday court".  And every--particularly every businessman in the 'hood wanted to be a holiday court sheriff because of it allowed you to do two things.  It allowed you, one, to carry a badge around, and number two, to carry a gun around.  You, you were, in essence, the police.  But all you had to do was just go down to court half a day, one day out the month and the rest of the time you were just the police.  So it wasn't about the money, it wasn't about the job, it was the ability to be the po--police.  And if you had a liquor store on 63rd Street or 47th Street or West Madison [Chicago, Illinois] or something, a lot of businessmen seen it as an advantage to--well, you know, it's one thing to hire a policeman at your door, but if I'm actually the police myself, this would be a great thing for security.  So, so what they would do at the sheriff's department was they would dole out a certain number of these positions to the committeemen depending on how much they liked you. You might not have gotten any.  And if they really liked you, maybe you got ten a year or something.  And so the FBI felt like it was something shady going on.  They felt like the committeemen were using this as a way to raise money.  They felt like people were out cutting deals.  In other words, if I was a committeeman and gave you a position as a sheriff's deputy, then the deal was you would contribute--let's say you would buy two thousand dollar tables every year at my fund raiser.  And the FBI felt like that was illegal.  We can't have elected officials out cutting those kind of deals.  That's selling a job.  And so they did an, an investigation and they investigated a number of aldermen.  And my dad was, unfortunately, the only one that they felt like they had witnesses saying what the witnesses needed to be saying.  And so they built the case around my dad.  And that's what they were able to show and prove to twelve people sitting on a jury--that that's, in fact, what my dad was doing--was cutting a deal to raise money for his organization.  So he never was convicted of--and he never did pocket any of that money for personal gain--but the FBI just felt like, hey, "We just can't have this going on".  You cannot take a government position and raise money with it.  So can--and, and certainly being an elected official right now, I can certainly see the logic behind that.  It would be like me taking a scholarship or something to a state university, saying, "Okay, I'll give this to a kid, but the parents have to buy two tickets a year to my fund raiser every year."  Maybe that's not quite the way it was, but it was certainly a similar situation.  So that's what my dad was convicted of.  I never held him at fault for that.  I never felt any negative feelings towards him one way or the other about it.  I was certainly bitter about it.  I was bitter about the whole thing in general, not towards my dad but the fact that I felt like, hey, this was something that was taken away from me.  I felt like I had a future in politics, but by my dad being convicted and, and before I had an actual opportunity to get, establish myself in politics, I felt like something--my future had been stolen from me at the time.  So I was very upset and anguished about that.
Speaker 1: So your father, he never--
Videographer:  Change tapes.
Story_ID: 57728
Speaker 1: -it hasn't certainly impacted any of us, but he was never able to get back into elective office again.
Speaker 2: Do you think he wanted that?
Speaker 1: Oh, he ran for alderman twice after that.  So he certainly wanted to get his old job back.  Yeah, but it wasn't to be and he's since given up on that.
Speaker 2: So now at what point then -- okay, so that happened.   How long -- that was 1982 -- he got out in when?
Speaker 1: 1983, he lost his position in 1983.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously, unclear)
Speaker 1: No, he actually went to jail in about 1984 and he, he was given a five year sentence.  He served about eighteen months.
Speaker 2: Okay, and then -- so you -- okay, so during that time, you were still working -- were you still working?
Speaker 1: At the time in which my dad was convicted, I was working, I had-actually, I worked for Ernst and Whinney for two years and I got a lot more involved in politics and wanted to be closer to the action.  So in 1982, a new department opened up in the City of Chicago.  They, they - Mayor [Jane] Byrne at that time initiated a new sales tax, that one percent sales tax that they initiated, and created a whole collection department in the department of revenue to collect that one percent.  And so I actually was hired by the City of Chicago as an auditor for to help collect that money.  So I helped write audit programs and I became an auditor myself and that's what I was doing at the time my dad was convicted.  Shortly after my dad was convicted, there was a movement afoot to try and install me as, as the alderman after my dad.  There had always been, up until that time, an unwritten agreement between aldermen and the mayor and the city council that in situations like that, the outgoing alderman could name his predecessor.  And I think that up until that time, that in fact had occurred one hundred percent of the time.  Well, my dad was convicted in April of 1983.  [Mayor] Harold Washington had just won his election in February of 1983.  So in the preceding months of June and July, my dad made it, made it known that he wanted his son -- I was twenty-five at the time, you know, had -- a lot of people believed had been groomed for the position over the last few years.  My dad recommended me for the job.  [Mayor] Harold [Washington] didn't seem to believe that he should continue business as usual since he campaigned that, you know, "We're going to throw these bums out and there will be no more business as usual."  So it was not to be.  And so me and my dad -- it was agreed at the time that, well, you know, we can't make your dad alderman.  And you probably remember the Vrdolyak Twenty-Nine [twenty-nine alderman led by Edward Vroldyak, leader of the opposition] during the time.  Well, when the mayor makes the recommendation for who they want to be alderman, than the majority of the city council have to vote on it and approve it; usually no problem.  One hundred percent of the time, I believe, before that time the mayor had always gotten his approval.  The mayor wanted someone else.  In the aldermanic election that had just occurred at the same time that [Mayor] Harold [Washington] ran for mayor, a woman by the name of Dorothy Tillman had run against my dad.  And although my dad had a trial coming up and he won handily without even being in the run off.  And then his trial was a couple of months later.  So my dad had just won his election.  Harold seemed to believe that it would probably be the wish of the community, since she had run for alderman, for her -- for him to recommend her.  There were activists across the city, folks like Slim Coleman and folks like that that were out there lobbying for Dorothy Tillman.  So he, Harold, at the time believed that that's who he had to recommend.  He subsequently did that, but the Vrdolyak Twenty-Nine held up the recommendation because they felt like, you know, my dad had recommended me.  I had gone out at the time and gotten six or seven thousand signatures in the 3rd Ward from people saying that they wanted me, and so they held it up.  So -- and it was held up for a few months.  And me and my dad had meetings with the new mayor at the time and he expressed to my dad that he couldn't.  He, you know -- and I knew [Mayor] Harold [Washington], and Harold [Washington] was out of the 3rd Ward, I might say.  He had been a precinct captain for years in the 3rd Ward under Ralph Metcalfe and then under my dad.  He served as a state representative.
Story_ID: 57729
Speaker 1: I was actually -- I lived two blocks from where [Mayor] Harold [Washington] lived at the time I represent his old district now.  Harold had supported me.  He had known me since I was a young man.  A matter of fact, he had provided scholarships, legislative scholarships for me to go the University of Illinois the entire time I was in school.  And I would come home in the summer and I would go and and visit with [Mayor] Harold [Washington], talk about how-he would look at my grades.  And it's-and it's a practice that I still do with, with youngsters now that I give scholarships to, and it's because I learned this from [Mayor] Harold [Washington].  But I would have to show up at his office with my with my transcripts and explain why I might have gotten a "C" in a course that he felt I should have gotten a "B" in or, you know, those type of things.  So I'd have to talk to him about my experience on campus and all that.  And then after that he'd say, "I think you're doing okay.  Okay, I'll give you a scholarship for another year.  But hey, come back next year with some better grades or else I might not be there for you."  So [Mayor] Harold [Washington] knew me.  And he knew me well because of this process that we had gone through during my college years, and the fact that he was in the organization, I was in the organization.  So at the time in which this banter was going back and forth between my dad and Harold basically about who he should recommend for the City Council position, he expressed to me and my dad that he just couldn't do it.  That, "Kenner, you guys know how I campaigned, you know.  You know I, I ran against the woman and said that, you know, 'we have to throw the slime balls of the world out.'  There's no way that I can put the youngster in there."  And he was quoting a newspaper at the time as saying things like, calling me "blue chip stock" and all those type of quotes at the time in the defending of the papers.  But he just couldn't support me because that would appear to be business as usual.  So the deal was that he talked to [Alderman Edward] Burke and [Edward] Vrdolyak and those guys and get them to go ahead and approve my recommendation of your son and, you know, your son -- he has great credentials.  He went to a great university [of Illinois].  He worked for Ernst and Whinney.  He's been down there auditing the department.  They're saying great things about him. There may be an assistant comptroller's job available or something for him, you know, down the road.  And then maybe he might, after a couple of years, he might be able to become city comptroller, something like that.  He's still kind of young.  He's just twenty-five now.  But within the next couple of years, I think we can make this thing happen.  He certainly has the credentials and whatever else he needs to do this.  So me and my dad agreed to that.  The following week the city council okayed Dorothy [Tillman]'s ascendance to the city council, and within days I got a pink slip in the mail saying that my position was eliminated.  So I, I don't know if it had anything (laughs) to do with politics or the relationship between [Mayor] Harold [Washington]and my dad, but my career at the City of Chicago was effectively ended about a week after Dorothy [Tillman] was approved for her city council position.
Story_ID: 57730
Speaker 1: So I went out at that time and started a small accounting firm with a Jewish gentleman that I knew at the time.  And we tried to start up a CPA [certified public accountant] firm.  And, you know, I called around to different individuals that I had known and had worked with as an auditor when I was with Ernst and Whinney.  But it seemed as though most of these businessmen had been watching television and had seen the troubles and the problems that my dad had and I think that it was just too much -- too little time that had elapsed there and I don't think anybody really wanted to be involved with me at the time.  So I really wasn't able to get my accounting business going at the time.  So after about six months, my partner decided that he had to go out and get him another real job.  And so I heard about some opportunities out in Los Angeles [California] in the entertainment field, so I left Chicago [Illinois] for a few years and got involved in entertainment field out in Los Angeles, managing and getting involved with acts and things like that. So I literally left town for about seven, eight years.
Story_ID: 57731
Speaker 1: --she was the lead rapper in a group called HWA and so--and I was their manager and--
Speaker 2: So can you give us any of the rappers?
Speaker 1: Pardon me?  (Laughter) Well let's see I used to work with Too Short, Ice Cube, EZE, all those folks, you know, yeah.  Kim [Kenner], you know, she knows them all a lot better than I do.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Right, I have (unclear).  I don't even know how--I just know is that they're rappers.  (Laughter) (Unclear)--Okay, I--so you come back and you decide, I would think, you still have this political thing.
Story_ID: 57732
Speaker 1: I came back to Chicago [Illinois] because I felt like I was a little fish in a big pond out there in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  I'd been knocking my head up against the wall for a few years out in L.A. and just couldn't seem to get it going.  I was on the peripheral of the entertainment business out there.  I was working with small, unknown acts and I just couldn't get my foot--I just felt like I couldn't get my foot in the door because I didn't have the resources.  What was very apparent to me was that I made very good connections out there and I had done a reasonable job of learning the business.  And I knew that most of the talent in the entertainment business is not indigenous to Los Angeles. You've got a lot of folks out there that were from Chicago: the Jacksons, Quincy Jones, Natalie Cole, just to name a few.  The list goes on and on.  So I felt like, well, let me--maybe I can go back to Chicago and mine for some real talent and make some discoveries there where I won't have all this competition with all these folks that have bigger names and bigger pockets than I do.  And then I can come back out here and be a big guy.   So let me go home and, and find this talent and then come back.  So that's what I came back to do.  I actually came back to, you know--and I got involved in the entertainment, on the local entertainment scene.  And it was during that time in which, like I said, that was about '91 [1991] when I came back.  Well you know that this was after the remap thing.  We had just done a remap.  [Representative] Paul Williams, at that time, was the current state representative that was representing that district.  And after the remap, a gentleman--another incumbent by the name of Phelan, James Phelan--they end up running for the same seat.  [Representative] Paul Williams lost the seat.  And he ended up, James Phelan ended up winning a sixty-five percent majority black district, okay.  At that time there was a movement afoot by a gentleman by the name of David Reed and some other folks that had been pretty much involved in this as black republicans.  There was a move afoot on their part to create a new independent political party in Chicago called the Harold Washington Party.  People by the, like Judge [Eugene] Pincham ran for mayor under the Harold Washington Party.  Well at this time, the Harold Washington Party had been very instrumental in helping getting this map drawn that was drawn.  And they felt like by being, I think at the time, six or seven white legislators that were representing majority black districts, the Harold Washington Party felt like this was an opportunity for them.  So they went out and they canvassed for candidates to run for public office in these particular areas.  Well, in my particular area they had approached my dad.  They approached my dad and, and people like Chris Kelly and, and James Taylor, who had been--who had been an alderman but was not currently in office.  They approached these people about running for public office under the Harold Washington Party.  My dad had been back from jail for about five or six years and he had previously just run for alderman at the time.  I believe he just had an aldermanic election at that time.  What my dad did in the primary, the same election that, that Paul Williams lost--my dad had actually put his name on the ballot to run for state representative against Luvana Jones.  But he subsequently withdrew his name, but he had still placed his name on the ballot.  So during that summer after Paul lost the primary, the Harold Washington Party approached my dad about running for the Harold Washington Party in the general election.  Well, there was a law that was created years--a few years before that called the 'sore loser law.'  And the law essentially stated that if you submitted petitions when it came down to run for office in the primary that you couldn't subsequently present more petitions, if you lost, to run for office in the general election.  James Taylor--was called the James Taylor Sore Loser Act because James Taylor had done this.  He had run for state rep in the primary, lost, and started up an independent party and tried to run under another party in the general election.  So they created this whole law around that to keep individuals from doing that.  So my dad was precluded from running under the Harold Washington Party because he had submitted petitions earlier to run.  And so he thought about it long and hard and decided, "Hey, my son's running around here talking about entertainment or something, maybe he might be interested in running for this thing."  So I got a call one day and my dad said, "How would you like to be in the Harold Washington Party and run for state rep?"  Well I had given up political aspirations ten years earlier and I thought that it was a joke.  He said, "Well no, it's not a joke.  Come to this meeting."  So I went to the meeting and I was told by the Harold Washington Party officials what type of resource--they had all this money and all this resources that they were willing to put behind their chosen candidate.  And if I was, would become their candidate, that they would certainly put those resources behind me.  And so, like I said, I was out there, an aspiring big manager in the entertainment field looking for an angle, a leg up.  And in my mind, the first thing I thought was, well, boy.  If I become an elected official, you know, that would be impressive with some of these young folks that are looking for managers out there (laughs).  So that was initially my thought when I first ran.  And I subsequently lost that election.  But in out being--in being out there campaigning and stuff, it re-ignited that fire and it re-ignited those old feelings and old emotions and things.  And I realized--I made connections in the community and put together networks out there, and I realized that although I lost--and I lost by a significant margin--I realized that if I came back and ran in the next election as a Democrat, I might have a chance.  And so I spent the next year organizing and I stayed out there in the community and that old feeling of wanting to contribute something in the way of public service started coming back.  And so that's how I initially--that's how I got back involved in politics.

Speaker 1: Now why do you think the work you do is important to the black community?
Speaker 2: Well I, I, I don't think that--I don't just think that what I do in terms of my legislative job is important just in the black community.  I think it's important in our society period.  Any type of arena, gain, any--any type of environment where you have people, you need rules, you know, to go by.  And basically what our legislatures do is establish a framework, rules for our society: you know, how fast you can go down the street; you know, just laws; you know, what it is you can and cannot do; you know, the minimum amount that you should pay people, you know.  Just these critical questions that, you know--we have to have these guidelines in society.  And I think, particularly for minority communities, the legislative process has been very important.  At one time we were in a state of bondage, servitude and, you know, it's a--the legislative act that ended that.  Then there was this whole Jim Crow thing going on for years and it was legislative acts that put an end to that.  And we're still fighting those type of battles right now, you know, in all fronts.  Black legislators are very important in terms of, of trying to insure that blacks have access to education and good schools and, and money is provided for that and, and health care and, and trying to help economically and empower our communities and try to get loan money for businesses in our communities and make sure that trying to bring down redlining and, and, and access to jobs and things like that.  You know, we're right there on the front lines in those type of battles.  So, it's very important.
Speaker 1: Now what--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  We need to change tapes.
Story_ID: 57734
Speaker 1: Is the tape on?
Videographer:  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, blacks in the legislature in Illinois and Congress, and state legislatures across this country, have made a tremendous impact.  There's a rich tradition there.  In many ways, we've opened up many doors in the state legislature.  Like I said, in terms of, of making health care, jobs accessible and loans and education and things like that.  But, but in a -- in another way we've created personalities that have gone on in the state legislatures to do great and wonderful things.  People like Cecil Partee, who became the president, the first-one of your first black four tops down in Springfield [Illinois].  Emil Jones [President of Illinois senate] is a, is a great leader now in his own right but, but Cecil Partee opened up that door for, for "Leader" Jones as the president of the senate.  [Mayor] Harold Washington served, served a vast majority of his elective office-his years in elective office down there in Springfield as a state representative.  [Representative, later U.S. Senator] Carol Mosley Braun served ten years down in Springfield.  [Secretary] Jesse White served a vast majority of his career and he's secretary of state now.  So you've had people -- and then you've had other individuals that've had very illustrious careers down in Springfield and, and learned a lot of things, networked, made connections.  And it came back to the City of Chicago and ran non-profit organizations.  People like [Representative] Jesse Madison and people like that that are making great contributions right now, you know.  So in my -- in my mind, our community wouldn't be where it's at now without the push and pull of black lawmakers -- and that's not just here in Illinois, that's nationwide.  It's the nature of our society.  Government -- you're, you're in the forefront of government in a legislative body like that whether or not if it's just on the state level, local level or the federal level.  And, and legislatures are just on the cutting edge of, of our society and opening and closing doors in some cases.  Look at Microsoft right now, you know, they're trying to take over the computer industry and the government is saying, "Hey, you've gone too far."  So they've, they know how to close doors when they have to, to make it, to keep those prices stable and to make it fair for the businesses and things.  So absolutely black legislators and since 1877 have been right on the cutting edge right here in Chicago and in Illinois.

Speaker 1: You think you'll be a politician for the rest of your life?
Speaker 2: Oh, nobody's promised tomorrow, that's number one.  And, and for me, elective service -- I'm, I'm -- I mean I'm just tickled pink and so proud and just so honored that my community has said, "Kenner, you know, we'd like for you to represent us down in Springfield [Illinois]."  But I certainly don't feel like it's their obligation to keep sending me down to Springfield.  And I don't think it's -- it's not a right that I have.  It's a -- I feel as though it's a privilege to serve.  And, you know, I was instilled by my dad that public service is still a very noble profession and a very noble way to help people and I honestly believe that in my core.  And so I just take it one election at a time.  And when I was out there campaigning, I told folks, I just said that, "I don't know what to tell you.  The only thing I can say is that I like people and I would love to try to go down to Springfield."
Speaker 1: You know-I'm sorry.  (To videographer:) I can't-I just don't understand why (unclear) shoot.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: That's okay.  When I was campaigning for elective office, I was asked many questions.  But I thought that the most important criteria in electing me or anyone else is, what do you-what do you-how do you actually feel about people?  And I think that aside from education and experience and whatever else people try to look at and evaluate you by, I think that the one thing that's most important, and I believed this before I was elected and I certainly believe it now, is that I think that you just have to like people.  You have to love people.  And if you love people, I think that you'll find some way to do the right thing.  And I just said "Hey, you know, I think I do have this love for my community within me. And I think that that will always put me in a position to do the right thing.  And if I don't, don't vote for me, don't send me back.  But every two years I'll come back and ask for your support and lay down on the table exactly the things that I've done and what I've tried to do.  And if you appreciate it, certainly send me back; but if not, then send me packing and doing something else.  You have to do that to keep me on the right track."  So.
Story_ID: 57736
Speaker 1: I have one more question.  We're running out of time.  But this is the thing, what, what-why do you think for young people-why would you encourage them, African American young people, to pursue a career in politics?
Speaker 2: I think that up until the last few years, politics and employment in government has gotten short shrift in our community.  I think that too many people believe those old cliches about politicians talking with forked tongue.  And you hear people that believe that people that are going to elective office are not very smart people and they're just out for themselves, and those type of things.  (Buzzing noise) Well you have those type of people in all fields, in all walks of life.  And politicians, no one -- elected officials, only difference between them and other people is that they've got one more vote than somebody else to get their job.  And so, you know, that we should strive to always try to put our best foot forward in terms of who we send to represent us in government because it's so, so important, that government has such a vast impact on our lives, and we certainly can't short change ourselves by just sending any old person down in a legislative body to represent us.  We have to take our time, evaluate candidates.  And, you know, if you -- if we have young people out there that are applying themselves, that have certain gifts and talents, that maybe it might be within them to share that with the rest of the community.  And one great way to do that is certainly a career in public service.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's it.  Thank you.
Speaker 2: Well, thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
