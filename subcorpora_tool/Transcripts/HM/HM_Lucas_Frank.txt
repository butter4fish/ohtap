Story_ID: 86117
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I want to ask you about your family history in the sense of how far can you trace your family back?  How far can you go?
Speaker 2: Well certainly my parents [Millicent Alleyne Lucas and Kenneth Lucas], I go back that far with them.  Both of them were born in the 1896.  We have done some research on the--their parents and I know we go back into the 1840s with both sides of the family.  We know a little more about my mother's mother [Molly Alleyne] and father [Thomas Alleyne].  He was a tailor and mother, a housekeeper.  My father, we don't know too much about my father's parent.  He, from what we know he was an engineer who died building, helping to build the Panama Canal.  And his mother Rose [Lucas] I believe was a homemaker.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And both of your parents are from Barbados?
Speaker 2: Barbados.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Story_ID: 86118
Speaker 1: All right, did they pass down any stories about what life was like in Barbados?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the reason for them coming here was of course was to build a better life for themselves.  My mother [Millicent Alleyne Lucas] met my father [Kenneth Lucas] here.  They weren't--they didn't come over together.  She was probably about seventeen or eighteen years old when she left her parents [Molly Alleyne and Thomas Alleyne] and I think my father, from his passport, was probably about twenty when he came here.  I think things were tough.  What they tell me about Barbados is that all the kids under the British system were allowed to at least go as far as the seventh grade.  You had to have special permission or maybe pass some sort of test to go on to college but everyone was given a chance to be an apprentice to someone.  But again money being what it was and this was the land of good fortune and so forth, I think many people in that generation came to this country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they just basically--did they know people already here in the United States when they came?
Speaker 2: You really couldn't arrive here unless you knew someone.  First of all I can remember looking at how much my father paid to get here, it was fifty dollars.  I'm not sure who his benefactor was here but we do know that my mother had a sister who was here and working to bring her over and so that's the way it was done.  It was, you had to know somebody or at least have the monies to come into the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did they come right to Cambridge [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: I believe from what I--my understanding is that they came to Boston first but spent very little time in Boston and spent their entire lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Story_ID: 86119
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, tell us about your father.  Could you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His full name, Kenneth Lucas, L-U-C-A-S, interesting man, very much on discipline, very much on education.  He was perhaps one of the most generous people that I've ever met, willing to share for his family and a very, very hard worker.  I think he had two jobs while he was in this country, one was working in I guess were a place where they smelt iron and then he went on later to the Lever Brothers Company which is a soap manufacturer and he got a job there simply because he was from Barbados.  I believe that Lever Brothers was a British company and so just about all the blacks and there were only eight men who I knew that worked there were all from the West Indies, Barbados in particular.
Story_ID: 86120
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what was he--oh, there's a story that you told me when we were off camera about this wooden truncheon that he [Lucas's father, Kenneth Lucas] used to carry with him.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the--my father certainly was not what I refer to as a rabbel rouser but he did make sure that my mother [Millicent Alleyne Lucas] and my brother [Roy Allen] were secure to the best of his ability.  My dad worked nights for a long time.  He was a laborer.  He didn't really have any professional job there at all.  But to get to work he had to walk through some pretty tough neighborhoods and from time to time would get beat up.  I can recall when he came in from work in the morning he would--my mother would be there tending to a certain amount of bruises and abrasions and so forth.  He would--he was always funny because she would ask him, "Ken what happened?"  And he would say "Mill, I caught hell today."  And so from that time on he fashioned himself a small club that he carried in his pocket and I think about that from time to time because it was his way of making sure--he didn't give up.  He was making sure that we survived and for us to survive he had to work.  And this is the way that he got to work every evening.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he carried this little wooden club in his pocket (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you still got it?
Speaker 2: I still have it.  I use that club from time to time when I talk to young black men and women about how my father survived.  And you know it wasn't just who you know at that time, it was just how you could defend yourself to make a living.  And I would enter the lecture hall or wherever I was making my presentation, I would have this instrument in my brief case and I would let it fall to the floor with a loud bang and I got everybody's attention.  And I would talk about this man who fought for his family but never gave up.  It was very important to him.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Those little clubs got lead in it too right?
Speaker 2: And it, yeah he fashioned it--I am not just sure just what it was fashioned out of but the tip was hollowed out and he poured lead in it and he corked it back with some kind of wooden plug.  But this has remained in my family.  I hope someday that I can give it to one of my children and they can give it to their children because it's a way of showing how one man survived in this country.
Speaker 1: It kind of shows that it wasn't easy too.
Speaker 2: It was not easy.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It was not easy.  I think that he never talked about it much and that was the interesting thing about my dad.  My father never spoke to either my brother or myself about the problems that he was having.  And even--he was a man who knew a lot about where he worked but he was never given an opportunity to fulfill those dreams.  He trained other people to become foremen and become managers but he never became one himself.  And in doing so, he never talked to us about the trials and tribulations that we might encounter.  He felt that in doing so--I, I don't know.  We didn't speak about it but I felt that he didn't say anything simply because he didn't want to polarize us into thinking that there was somebody out there to get us.  He left the door wide open for us to dream the dreams that we thought we should have.
Story_ID: 86121
Speaker 1: Okay. Now could you tell us something about your mother?  Can you give us her full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Her full name is Millicent, again Lucas.  Millicent is spelled M-I-L-L-I-C-E-N-T.
Speaker 1: What was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Millicent Alleyne, A-L-L-E-Y-N-E.  She came here as a very young girl.  Both of these parents of mine they could read and write.  They--the British were very good at that.  They made sure that the people of Barbados were educated so that was not a problem.  She came here to be with her sister.  I know that she had no professional skills at all so her work would be as a domestic and that's what she did for many years.  I don't remember her as a domestic but certainly in those years when she first came, that was her job.  She talked about her first job in a place that she didn't--she couldn't remember where but it was in New Hampshire.  And you can imagine this young woman from Barbados where there's a lot of warmth and there's a lot of things going on living in this foreign place, New Hampshire, and it's cold and it's dreary and she says that the only time that she did not work was on Thursday.  They gave her Thursday off but it was so far, she couldn't come to Boston [Massachusetts] and she couldn't visit her sister.  So she would make a little cucumber sandwich or whatever and she would just kind of walk through the woods and I guess talk to herself.  But one day she was walking and she came upon a woman who was going in the same--opposite direction, a white Irish girl and for many weeks they passed each other but didn't speak.  And then I guess they smiled and then other things and kind of--and before you know it, they were sitting on the same log eating their sandwiches together.  And that was her only--the only person that she would see during the week.  From time to time she got into Boston to be with her sister on Sundays and they would go to church and so forth.  Her sister was a--was very established because she worked for a doctor in Boston as his domestic and majordomo and name it, she was it.  That's what they had to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Sounds like a very lonely life for your mother in the early days?
Speaker 2: I believe it was a very lonely life for her but we learned a lot my brother [Roy Allen] and myself from those two people.  And what we learned from them is how to make it work, how to be generous, how to do with what we have and so forth.
Story_ID: 86122
Speaker 1: We [Lucas and his brother, Roy Allen] weren't sheltered in any way.  My parents [Millicent Alleyne Lucas and Kenneth Lucas] didn't shelter us in any way.  We were left to our own means.  The most important thing for them because they knew what was key was education and I couldn't fool my parents.  I--every so often I would get a D on a report card and my father [Kenneth Lucas] knew that an A was a pretty good mark and a B was a pretty good mark.  Well what is this D?  And he would be very upset and sometimes he would go into the bathroom, that's where he kept the razor strap and I would get a couple of licks across the legs and, you know, there was no hard feelings but you know let's do better the next time.  I guess today they would call it abuse but, you know I loved my father dearly and--but this was his way of showing that you know there was something out there that you have to get and that was the educational part of it.
Story_ID: 86123
Speaker 1: Okay, now did your--now your mother [Millicent Alleyne Lucas] when she was working in New Hampshire, I mean did she--well I just wondered how she and your father [Kenneth Lucas] met, you know?
Speaker 2: I'm not quite sure.  You know it's unfortunate that some of these stories and especially among West Indians and especially among that group of people at that time and I've spoken to many of my friends who, whose parents came out of that generation and so forth, they were very quiet about their backgrounds.  They didn't really talk a lot and I think that maybe if we had asked we would have learned but we never seemed like we wanted to intrude on their--the things that they saw and went through and so forth.  They gave us certain things when they thought it was good to hear certain things but I never really knew just how my father and mother met.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when were they married?
Speaker 2: Oh, see that's a question you asked.  I found their wedding certificate.  I think they go back to the 1923, '24 [1924] in that timeframe, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So they were both, I guess late Twenties, I guess (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Twenties, Thirties somewhere in their early Thirties.  Yeah.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 86124
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now can you kind of reflect back on childhood and give us a sense of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I talk about that and the few of us that are still friends today. We talk a lot about that and it was great.  It was absolutely great.  I lived in a community in Cambridge, Massachusetts where there was a lot of diversity, a lot of diversity.  We lived among Italian people, we ate there food and they were our friends.  And we lived among the Irish and they were our friends and we ate their food and we fought and we did all those things that children growing up would do.  But it was a great time.  Yeah, there were people there that--it was hard, no question about it and so forth, but I was--I had only another brother [Roy Allen] who was eleven years older than myself so I was kind of like an only child.  So I got doted on quite a bit.  In fact the kids, not realizing that my father [Kenneth Lucas] only made maybe $11.00 or $12.00 dollars a week, thought of me as the rich kid because he would give me just about everything that he could give me, you know.  On Thursday evening we would meet him in Central Square, the shopping area and he would give me--he would give my mother [Millicent Alleyne Lucas] the money cause he got paid in cash.  It can't be much more than $15.00, $16.00 dollars a week.  And he would give me a dime out of that.  He took nothing for himself but he would give me a dime and I would go into the local five and ten cent store and I could buy anything that I wanted.  He would give me money to go to a movie on Saturday which was almost unheard of, kids going to a movie.  I went to a movie in the summertime especially I went to a movie every day, every day except Sunday.  In fact Saturday I went to a movie twice a day and it was a place where you saw "cool inside, air condition" and so forth and it was a way of getting me off the street and so forth.  He would take us to the ball game.  In Cambridge we lived very close to Braves Field and so in the summer time my mother, father, brother we would walk along the Charles River over to Braves Field to watch Jackie Robinson and Roy Campanella and so forth.
Speaker 1: Negro League games?
Speaker 2: Well, no it was just when these men were first entering into the big leagues so to speak, the American-- well, it was for the--Braves Field was National, National League but that's what--their first debut so to speak in the, into the games.
Speaker 1: The Boston Braves?
Speaker 2: Boston Braves.
Speaker 1: You're talking about the Boston Braves?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I, I'm sorry.  I didn't--when you said Braves--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I didn't get it.  I didn't get it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But these are--this is--they're now in Atlanta.  They went to Milwaukee, now there in Atlanta.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but they were in Boston.
Speaker 1: Boston Braves.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right (unclear) okay.
Speaker 2: And we did see some of the Negro Leagues would come in from time to time to play at Fenway Park and so forth.  But I had an opportunity as I said when most kids--and we're dealing now with the Thirties [1930s], late Thirties when there wasn't a lot of money around.  But my father would make sure that I got to the, as I said the movies.  He would make sure that I got to the rodeos and the ice capades and the circuses.  I was very privileged.  And every night there was an ice cream cone for me.  And I don't know if my dad was really doting on me in that sense of the words but he as I mentioned earlier, he was a man who wanted to do everything for his family.  We never owned a home to speak of.  We always rented.  We never had a car but he always paid his bills, everything was cash, no credit so forth.  You know, having an older brother of course he was almost like the surrogate father to me.  I mean he got to take me every place because when I born I believe my parents at that time were pretty much resting on their Forties.  I was kind of like a late baby so to speak.  I did have a sister that I never knew, Eileen, and she died tragically in a fall.  And so when I came along as I said, my father was very I would say, he really looked after me.  It wasn't his fault that she fell but he just didn't want anything happening to me.  And so I was maybe dressed too warmly.  I was given too many medicines and so forth but there was a very sheltering thing that he did with us.
Story_ID: 86125
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your mother [Millicent Alleyne Lucas] continue to work when you were (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No my mother and my father [Kenneth Lucas] insisted that my mother stay home.  It was very important for her--we, you know with $17.00 a week, the woman was a magician, $17.00, $18.00, she was a magician.  How she made things go together, I don't know.  I know someplace in this house I have a picture of her hanging out sheets.  She used to wash her own sheets.  And we're not talking about like a washing machine.  We had no washing machine.  She used a scrub board.  Everybody would say in the neighborhood, gee, Mrs. Lucas has the cleanest sheets in the world, okay.  We always had money to buy food.  She--there was a couple of Italian meat markets in our neighborhood and even though she could go in there and buy something anytime without having to pay for it at that time they trusted her because they knew at the end of the week they always were paid.  The one thing about my parents is that both of them, they--something when it comes to bills they never wanted bills and they--if they--if we had to do without something, they made sure that the bill was paid and so forth.  So again, with all that going she never really worked.  There was one time though when I was probably about eight or nine years old, maybe a little bit older, she decided that she wanted to do a little bit more for the family.  And she found a job as a domestic I would say quite a few miles away from home.  I mean this was like I don't know, two or three cities away and somehow she found a way of getting on a street car and a bus and everything else and she made me swear that I would never tell my father.  He would be very upset.  He felt that it was very, very important that the mother be at home to take care of the child and not so much the cooking, cleaning and the--and so forth but to have your mother around and so forth.  But she made me swear and the poor man went to his grave and never knew that my mother was adding a little bit more to the funds in the house.
Story_ID: 86126
Speaker 1: Well tell me about school.  Now where did you go to grade school and how did you like school?
Speaker 2: I liked school.  I--grade school [Houghton Elementary School] was great for me because everybody went to the same grade school just about, not throughout Cambridge [Massachusetts] but in the neighborhood that you lived in.  It was a neighborhood school and I could walk to the school in three or four minutes and in fact you could come home for lunch back then.  There was the penny candy store on the way that you would stop and visit, all your friends went there.  Everybody knew each other.  And I didn't mind grade school at all.  I had problems in grade school.  I had measles that lasted, they tell me they went and they came back and went for maybe a course of a year and I lost a year out of school.  I loved history, still love history.  I loved to read about what happened in our past and so whether it's Black History or European History to me it's just fascinating stuff and so I like that.  What I find myself doing a lot back then I used to like to draw.  And I was copying everything out of the Sunday papers, the--you know, Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse and so forth and I was the kid in the classroom who made the best poster.  I was the kid in the classroom who made the best map.  In fact I had a couple of kids who paid me ten cents to make a map for them.  So again I was thinking about--I was very entrepreneurial at that time, thinking about those things.  But I liked grade school a lot.
Story_ID: 86127
Speaker 1: When I went to high school, the high school that I went to Rindge Technical School [now Cambridge Rindge and Latin School] was an all boys' school at that time, all male teachers.  There was no females in there except a nurse and she was the only female.  I think there might have been some secretaries.  I never encountered many of those people.  But it was an all boys' school and these boys came from all over Cambridge to go to that school.  It was a great school.  It had--I mentioned the people--it had actual locomotives that's how big it was, locomotives in the school, had kids were interested in that kind of stuff. It had chemistry.  I took a college course in high school because that would have directed me towards college.  My parents [Millicent Alleyne Lucas and Kenneth Lucas] expected me to go to college.  My dad without saying so, he didn't say that I want you to be a this, I want you to be a that, but he used to talk about me becoming a dentist and I went along with that for a long time.  And my grades were very, very good in high school.  I don't think I'm a straight A student but I was up there and the thing that I talk to my kids about, I went to school for four years, never missed a day, never was absent, never was tardy.  There was some interest there.  It was only when I get into my senior year I started to think more about this whole art thing and so forth and [un]beknownst to my parents, I changed my course from an art, from a college course to an art course without telling them.  My father was very much interested in Parent Teachers Association [PTA].  How's your children doing?  He would go.  I mean most men just didn't bother.  Mother's went maybe, but he would go.  And this particular night we went to the high school in my senior year and we ended up--I took him up to the art department and he asked me, he says "What are we doing here?"  So I go into this room and all of the pictures are on the wall.  I had a few of my pictures and the teacher came over and he says, "Oh Mr. Lucas he says your son, we should get your son into art school."  And my father knew at that time that I wasn't going to become this dentist.  He was a pretty talkative guy on the way home because we walked every place but there was no conversation coming home that night.  And when I got home he asked me to go to my room.  He wanted to talk to my mother and of course we lived in an apartment (unclear) that was really small so you couldn't whisper without someone hearing.  And he said to my mother, "I think Frank wants to become an artist" and I heard my mother say something like "Oh my god."
Story_ID: 85998
Speaker 1: Now we're- your parents [Millicent Alleyne Lucas and Kenneth Lucas] having this conversation about you being in art school is where we left off.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I--so you know in there I can hear my mother saying you know "oh my God," you know like that.  Well I think the reason for that simply was that my oldest brother Roy, Roy Allen, he went to New York [New York City, New York] to seek his fame and fortune as an actor and he joined the American Negro Theater [Harlem, New York] at that time and so forth.  So here comes this next guy and he's talking about art.  What the heck is that?  Nobody knew what that was and I for the best of me, I didn't even know what I was talking about, okay?  So they were a little bit apprehensive.  Now at no time did they say no, you can't do that, okay.  They left it up to us.  As I said my parents even at that age you know gave us a lot of freedom.  The thing that they worried most about my brother and myself is, do not get into any trouble, and we certainly did not do that okay.  We were pretty loyal.  We were hell raisers like everybody else but we stayed out of trouble.  So they were a little bit nervous but then came the time that I was looking around for a school.  The teacher in the high school [Rindge Technical School, now Cambridge Rindge Technical and Latin School], the people that are responsible for making sure that you get into the right school they weren't interested in me okay, not at all.  They--the guidance counselor, he said to me, "Oh you want to become an artist?  Yeah go ahead."  That was it, okay.  Well art today as we know it, people are still starving and not doing well by this thing.  And there are some very talented people out there so it wasn't anything to him.  He didn't say "Frank you know, you really got the stats to become an engineer" or "you really have the stats to become a doctor" or something else.  But he says, "No go ahead."  So I started looking around for a school and I was very naive as was the school.  And my first attempt--again no help because my parents didn't know.  I had no one to really talk to about this at all and I can remember my first attempt at going to school.  I couldn't get into that school and I was demoralized.  Here it is, school is supposed to begin in September.  I haven't even gotten a school to go to.  And so on my own I started going to the various schools in Boston [Massachusetts] talking to people and so forth and showing them a little portfolio that I had put together for my work and what have you.  And sure enough one school accepted me and that was the Vesper George School of Art [Boston, Massachusetts], quite a famous school during the Twenties [1920s], Thirties [1930s], Forties [1940s] maybe Fifties [1950s].
Story_ID: 85999
Speaker 1: I got in there [the Vesper George School of Art]. So now, how do you get into these schools?  There are no scholarships, okay.  I can remember when I came out of the high school [Rindge Technical School, now Cambridge Rindge Technical and Latin School] there weren't that many scholarships given away.  There were three black boys who were tops in their class, couldn't get a scholarship, couldn't get anything.  They gave all the scholarships to one kid.  Now he can't use them all, one white child, okay, but he can't use them all, so all the--us just kind of like disappeared.  So there's no money at all and I went to my parents [Millicent Alleyne Lucas and Kenneth Lucas] and I said that I found a school to go to and they says, okay, how much?  And tuition for that first year was nine hundred dollars.  And my father says okay, we'll see what we can do.  Now I know my parents didn't have a bank of any kind but what happened was that there was an insurance policy that was due on me and they cashed it in and they got nine hundred dollars.  And I always remember--and this was like a lot of money.  This was a lot of money.  So the day that I'm supposed to register into the school, my mother goes with me and I was mortified because here's all these boys and girls from all over the country, their mothers are not there.  They got the checks in their hand and what have you, but there's my mother.  And my mother was only like I don't know 5'5", 5'6", something like that and she was standing there with her little white gloves on and her little white hat on and she had her purse up by her bosom and the nine hundred dollars was in there.  And the man says okay, and she gave him cash, nine hundred dollars and that's how I got into my first year of school.  When I came home and I lived at home during that period, school was just Boston--my father said to me "I don't know how you're gonna get the next year's tuition."  We have no more money.  That was it.  That was it.  So during the summer and I did it all, often all through high school and so forth, I was the guy that painted the signs on the windows for the beauty parlors and the tailor shops and I made the posters for the dances and so forth.  So I was picking up some monies and so forth with that, but that's mainly my entry into school.  But again as I say my parents never said to my brother, what are you doing that for?  Or to me, what are you doing that for?  Try it.  That's it.
Story_ID: 86000
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you finish out at any, were you--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --were you able to do a second year?
Speaker 2: I--well no.  What happened to me was that after the first year and partially into the second semester, because no one called for money at that time and as you went into the second semester.  I think it was maybe some months later that they was asked to pay the bill.  The North Koreans got mad at the South Koreans and decided to invade that country and I was drafted in the [United States] Army.  Certainly didn't want to go and so forth, but I did go.  I went into a infantry group, spent four, four and half months in infantry training and so forth.  And everybody at that time because the war was going on after they finished their training they maybe went for additional training what have you, but they ended up in the Far East, in Korea.  And that was dangerous times because a lot of my friends from high school were already dead.  They were killed from going in the army right after high school.  They went in the service and a lot of them lost their lives there, some of these guys only eighteen, nineteen years old.  And so, I went into the service, spent my time there.  The army at that time was really just coming down off a whole segregation thing and we did have a mixed company of men and so forth.  So every night after basic training they would bring us out on the parade field and they would call out your name and they would tell you where you're going and so forth.  But for some reason out of the three hundred plus men in that company, no blacks were being called.  I--what is this?  So many of the blacks, we didn't know each other cause we were in different platoons and so forth but after a while we started getting together because the barracks were kind of like missing people so we would stand around and talk, like what's in store for us because I mean I could fire any weapon that you wanted.  I mean I knew a lot about that stuff.  And people started, the rumors started coming that we're going to be parachuted into North Korea.  China is gonna--we're going to be in China in a submarine.  I mean all of that nonsense was going on.  So one day when there's probably about ten or eleven of us left with nobody else in that barracks, we were sitting there and we were waiting to get a pass to go to New York.  I saw the company clerk running across the field with papers in his hand and what he said to the men in the barracks, he says that people would become physical instructors, people would become instructors in this and that and so forth and you Frank Lucas will become an artist illustrator with the Ninth Division, and that's going to be your job and you'll report to Sergeant Huddy at eight o'clock on Monday morning, and that's what happened to me.  So my job as an army illustrator was pretty nice and I spent the rest of my army career--I went between different posts from time to time doing work.  I did you know training aides.  We were just getting information back at that time when some of the A-bomb testing that was going on in Nevada you know, and so forth.  I was in planes that flew taking pictures of maps and so forth, and this is all within the states and nothing overseas at all and then slowly started to get stripes.  I ended up a Corporal in the service but I did a, an awful lot of work in the Army.
Story_ID: 86001
Speaker 1: That's where I begin to--there were other young men there and myself in the service and these guys some of them were out of college.  They were older than I was cause I was probably about Twenty, Twenty-One, and they were already working in New York [New York City, New York] advertising agencies and so forth.  And they would ask me from time to time, "Hey Frank what are you going to do when you get out?"  That's always the question, "What are you going to do when you get out?"  I said, "I'm going to go back to school."  "Well what are you going to do after you get out of school?"  "I'm going to become a teacher," because I had made arrangements with my art teacher in high school that after I finished school I was going to come back and take his place and oh, he loved that okay. "But Frank, an art teacher doesn't really make any kind of money.  A painter doesn't really make any kind of money.  Why don't you think about advertising?"  "What's advertising?"  I had no idea.  So it came the time when I got out of the Army and I went right back to school to finish up.  I had another year and half to do and of course at that time it was the GI Bill that was supporting me and that was great because they paid for everything.  I--there were a few things that I had to buy but that was minor.  I was still living at home.  My parents were glad to have me and so forth so I didn't have to worry about apartments or any of those types of things.  And that's when I started to think about design and advertising and those types of, you know things.  And one day I graduated from the school [Vesper George School of Art in Boston, Massachusetts].  It was only then that at the commencement--my father [Kenneth Lucas] couldn't come, he had to work.  He had to work because if you lose a day, you lost a day.  So my mother [Millicent Alleyne Lucas] came and she was standing there and I think she was proud of me and the director of the school, one of the directors came over and then she started talking to my mother and she say's (unclear) you have a pretty talented son there and he's going to do very well.  I would think that he was going to make ten thousand dollars a year before he does--first year out.  Ten thousand dollars, you might as well say five million.  Ten thousand dollars was a lot of, lot of money in 1954, and I was going to make that kind of money.  But then he said to my mother, but you know he's going to have some problems.  Like what is he talking about?  He already said to my mother that I was great and all of this other stuff but what kind of problems?  And she murmured something like yes, she knows.  Because at no time during growing up as a boy, my father ever pointed a finger at anybody and says, you're not this or that because of that person.  That never entered in the equation at all because he just felt that was--you can destroy yourself thinking that way so it never came up.  So I didn't know what the blazes this guy was talking about.  And of course living in Boston, Massachusetts where you could go to any movie you want, you could sit in the first row, you could eat in any restaurant, you can go into any store, you didn't have to try to clothes on the outside and bring them back and so forth.  I was pretty innocent to what was in front of me.
Story_ID: 86002
Speaker 1: But I soon learned fast when I started to go out there and started to look for my first job.  And it was interesting because you know I would--the school had a great placement and they would send off letters saying that they have this guy Frank Lucas who was good at photography, he could--was good at calligraphy, design, illustration.  He knew a lot about you know specification of type and all that sort of stuff that makes a designer.  Everybody was wanting to see me.  But when you got there they usually say "Well the job is taken" or "You're too good for us," you know all those types of things.  So I would go home and I would--my father [Kenneth Lucas] would ask me, "Well how did it go today?"  And I would tell him that I didn't get the job.  I didn't--because I was innocent to the whole thing.  And he would simply say to me "You didn't get it because you weren't good enough."  "You just didn't have what it took, okay."  He didn't brow beat me but he just said, you need to know more.  And so I would take additional classes wherever I could find them at Northeastern University [Boston, Massachusetts].  I tried some courses at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I tried other things sharpening up my skills so that when I went in there again they would know.  I think one of the things that proved to them that--because I'm sure they were apprehensive about whether or not I could make a living from this thing was that there was store, a department in Cambridge [Massachusetts], they had two stores, big stores and we would shop there from time to time, Cochran's Department Store.  And I went in there one day and I would just walk into a store and says, you want any artwork done?  That's how naive I was.  And the business manager came over to me, says, "Yeah."  He says, "you know I could use some signs for my window.  We're about to celebrate our Seventy Fifth Anniversary of the store.  How would you like to do the signs for the window?"  I mean these are huge department store windows and I was pretty good at lettering.  And he told me what he wanted and he told me the type of, the type that wanted, old--kind of an old fashioned Bonham [ph.] type I believe it was called.  And I had no car so I had to buy the supplies.  I went over to the big store in Boston that sold art supplies and I got rolls of paper.  I mean these rolls were like eight feet long because these windows are huge.  I bought buckets of paint.  I had to get these things back home on the street car, if you can imagine and I got them home and my father--I told him that night that I got a job from Cochran's Department Store and he's, oh wow that was great.  That's where we bought our clothes.  That's where we did our shopping.  How big can you get?  And what was great about our house is that our bathroom was like a railroad car.  It was long and it had walls that you couldn't believe and so I stretched the paper.  The thing that I remembered about my father because it was so important to him that I succeed and even though he was going to work the next day at seven o'clock in the morning, this man stayed up with me all night long and he watched me work and he'd talk to me about all kinds of stuff.  And he got me coffee or cocoa, or whatever it was to keep me awake because it was many times during that night I wanted to say to heck with it, throw my hands up and walk away.  He kept talking to me.  And I finished the job and I took it down to the store and the guy looked at me and says kid, he says I didn't think I was going to see you today.  But there was the stuff, spelled right, looked good huge amount of stuff.  And he says, how much do you want for it?  I had no idea, no idea at all.  And I whispered, a hundred and fifty dollars okay?  Well, the job was probably worth fifteen hundred dollars but a hundred and fifty, I thought of all the money in the world.  And he called after the secretary and she came in and she wrote me a check for a hundred and fifty dollars and I came home.  I don't even think I walked I must have ran all the way home.  And I showed my mother [Millicent Alleyne Lucas] and she gasped cause it was more money than--I made in one night than my father would make in maybe three weeks or maybe a month.  And she says don't cash the check.  Wait until your father comes home.  And I waited and he came home and I showed him the check and he says to me--he didn't even say it to me.  He looked at my mother and he says, I guess he's going to be okay.  That was it.  So they knew that I could make it with the skills that I had.
Story_ID: 86003
Speaker 1: That's something though.  Now yeah so, how long was it before you really caught on to your major (unclear)?
Speaker 2: It was a while.  It was a while.  I mean, you know, as I said I could letter good and the tailor in the block would use me and the woman's club down the street could use me for posters and all that kind of stuff.  But it was just very, very hard getting into the Boston [Massachusetts] arena so to speak.  As I said I didn't know anything really about this okay.  I had the skills, I had the skills that I could go into any shop but it was just that Boston was a very, very segregated place when it came time for people doing what I did or people doing other things that were very professional, they did--they just weren't use to it, okay.  Now I got work in Boston from some of the big department stores at that time, museums and so forth.  They didn't mind if I did the work, took it home.  It was almost like take the clothes homes, try it on.  I could get the work but they didn't want me around, okay.  I- they didn't want me in their office so to speak.  I worked for a while with a man called Theodore Pitman and Theodore Pitman was--he made miniature models for the museum and some of his models are all over this country, beautiful things, dioramas so to speak and I worked with him for a while.  And he was very good simply because anytime an interview came up he would say, "Frank go for the interview.  Take the interview."
Story_ID: 86004
Speaker 1: Well an interview did come up for a Boston advertising agency and a company called Parsons, Friedman and Central [Advertising].  And I went in there on a Saturday, the two owners were in there, two Jewish men and they were very open, very welcoming and so forth.  And they said we want you to do such and such a thing for--it was called a mechanical at that time.  And this is actually creating a finished piece that could be photographed and used to print from and so forth.  I had no idea what that was because I was trained in how to letter you know, the Greek alphabet, how to do a lot of things that was all theory related.  But what's going to give you that real job, some of those nuts and bolts.  So there were two other fellows in there that same Saturday and they were putting things down and they were gluing paper down and stuff like that.  I didn't know what's going on.  I was trying to catch out the corner of my eye what they were doing.  I went in there about nine thirty.  Ten o'clock I'm still messing with this stuff.  First guy gets up and leaves.  He's finished.  Second guy gets up and leaves.  He's done.  I stood there working this thing until maybe six o'clock that night.  And about six o'clock the two owners came in.  I think this was a day that they worked on their books and so forth and they says, "Well Frank you didn't get the job."  The first guy got the job.  And one of the owners said to me, "Why do you want to do this anyhow?"  And I said to him, "I can't even drive a truck.  I don't know anything about that.  I--this is all I know.  What little I know, this is all I know."  And they thanked me very much and they says you know stay in touch.  Well you know all of the niceties that a person will say.  So I would say about a week later I got a call from them and they says, "Would you like to be trained by us?"  And I says "yeah."  No money involved you know but we'll show you what we know and what you think--and what we think you should know.  And every day for a month I would leave the museum model building company that I was working with and go to Boston and they had a fellow who was in my class.  He was a senior in my class but he was working at the company and he would train me in all the things that I should know like specification of type and how to work with this and that and the supplies and so forth.  And, well if you can handle that we'll give you a job.  And so that's what I did.  And at the end of that they came to me and they said you're going to work with us.  I said, "wow."  And I became at that time one of the first blacks in this, in a design shop or an advertising agency working in design in the city of Boston [Massachusetts].  There was nobody else.  And your salary is going to be forty dollars a week.  Man that was like all the money in the world.  But I was so naive I didn't realize the government took taxes out of that and social security and all of those good things so I was about to argue when on Friday when my check came that it was missing several dollars, like what happened here?  So that's the beginning of it.  I stayed with that company for eight and half years working with them and slowly you know learning the whole thing and started to go through it but there was nobody else out there that I could talk to, nobody.  There was no clubs or organizations or black folks or what have you doing this type of thing.  I was just in there doing my thing.
Story_ID: 86005
Speaker 1: And even during that and at that time when I met my wife Ann [Patricia Ann Lucas], I had just started, I think I was--yeah, I had started working with this company and we decided maybe eight or nine months later that we're going to get engaged.  And forty dollars a week, man that's like a lot of money.  Of course she was at Mass General [Massachusetts General Hospital] making sixty dollars a week so we could make it.  Great, it was a hundred dollars altogether, okay.  And so we did it.  There was still a lot of animosity out there but I also freelanced a lot so a lot of the people that didn't hire me full time I would go back to them and I would say would you like any work done on a weekend or whatever have you so I worked constantly.  There was always a place either in our apartment in the basement or in the first house that we bought for me to work from and make extra money for whatever we were planning on.
Story_ID: 86006
Speaker 1: But I--the thing that I learned from both my father [Kenneth Lucas] and my brother [Roy Allen] who I would consider the best people I know was their tenacity and a willingness to work hard, never complain, stick with your values and so forth.  They were my role models and I speak highly of my brother because in his search for artistic endeavor as an actor, he did it on his own.
Speaker 2: So he was in New York [New York City, New York] with the American Negro Theatre?
Speaker 1: The American Negro Theater.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --job.
Speaker 1: And he worked in the shows.  He was an actor in shows like Anna Lucasta, so forth for many years and what have you.  And then as his family started to grow he left there and started to think about this new medium called television.  My brother was different.  He was the guy that wasn't talking about the good job with the post office or the good job with the railroad.  My brother was talking when he was Nineteen, Twenty years old, he was talking about working on radio.  Who could he talk to about that?  Nobody else was doing that type of stuff.  And he would spend hours with a mic that went nowhere in our house, talking into it, learning how--his allocutions and stuff. He did get to Emerson College [Boston, Massachusetts] and he did study at Boston Conservatory [Boston, Massachusetts] and so forth but I think about him often and I think about he did it on his own.  My father was, and mother [Millicent Alleyne Lucas] were just there to support us but we had to go for it on our own, in search for it on our own.
Story_ID: 86007
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right now so you were--you get married I guess and you work this job eight years at this--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, agency [Parsons, Friedman and Central Advertising].
Speaker 1: --agency, right.  And then what happens?
Speaker 2: Well I worked there, I learned a lot in those days.  I was able to--after we had two children [Frank Lucas, Jr. and Michael Lucas] I was going to move.  I thought the apartment was too small for us.  We got to buy our own house.  I was going to do a little bit more than my father [Kenneth Lucas] did.  As I said, generous man did a lot for us and so forth, but he was not a risk taker in that sense.  And--but I was going to buy this house wherever and you know houses for black people in the city of Boston [Massachusetts] was very, very tough.  I mean you just couldn't move any place you wanted.  You had to go through organizations and fair housing and there was a group of people that might put their house up for sale just for black folks and so forth.  It was not easy at all okay, but we stuck with it and we never talked about you know we didn't get it because we were who we were, we knew that by that time and so forth but we just weren't going to deny ourselves this or put ourselves or polarize ourselves into thinking that it wasn't working.  So we left Boston and we moved to a little town south of here in Sharon, Massachusetts and so forth to raise our family.  All the time working with the agency I was freelancing but after I reached like a hundred and fifty dollars a week, I felt I needed more.  And that was one hundred fifty dollars a week, plus what I could pick up doing what I was--but I was working seven days a week actually.  And so I left there and I went with a studio and this is where I met you know, people like Jerry Pinkney and so forth, Barker-Black Studios, and I worked with them for about three, three and half years.
Speaker 1: What's the name of it again?
Speaker 2: Barker and Black.
Speaker 1: Barker and Black.
Speaker 2: And we did a lot of--we had a lot of accounts were national accounts and so forth, Gillette, and the major accounts were the publishing companies.  And this is where I started to know about publishers because we did a lot of book covers and we did a lot of illustrations for math books and social science books and what have you.
Speaker 1: Okay. Change tapes.
Story_ID: 86128
Speaker 1: Well, the Barker-Black [Studio], you know I worked with them for three, three and a half years.  And during that period of time I had the opportunity to work on many, many projects you know as I say major projects, New York [New York City, New York], Chicago [Illinois], certainly a lot of Boston [Massachusetts] industry and so forth.  I did a lot of the design work.  I was the office manager.  The studio contained I would say about ten people, illustrators, designers and so forth and it was really a crazy time.  And you know working with designers is kind of fascinating and so forth, they can really get crazy.  But you know the thing is that I understand them and I think that was what was important so I knew that--ways of handling people that would get the best out of them and so forth.  So working there for those many years you know things started to change, industry started to change, conversations started to change, competition started to change and what you have is business started to change.  And one day I got to the door and put my key in the door and I couldn't open it.  And the door was locked and I stood there for a long time trying to--maybe I got the wrong key, maybe the door is broken what have you.  Another person came up and he says let me use my key.  And he tried doing it and it just didn't open and when we looked carefully there was a big tag over the door saying "closed for non-payment of taxes."  So they went out of business.  And--but the owner of the company he was very good to me.  He gave me a month's salary.  Jerry Pinkney who had left earlier had a studio in Boston so he says why don't you come and take a space with me and no money involved, just come and work with me.  And I went over there and I did a lot of work for hotels and other places, National Fire Protection Association, they were--learned not to burn people--they were one of my customers and so forth.  That was nice.
Story_ID: 86129
Speaker 1: And it's something that I've thought about often, and it's many times people would say, "Well you know so many people Frank.  Why didn't you go into that business on your own?"  And the answer to that, I was scared, honestly scared.  You know yeah, maybe there was opportunities there and so forth but when it comes to a family and so forth, I'm not a risk taker in that sense.  Maybe I'm like my dad [Kenneth Lucas] in many ways, maybe that's where that gene is, not taking a risk.  And so I just hung out with him [Jerry Pinkney] for a while and then I started looking around because you know money was coming in, you know, not always the same amount every week.  It was fifty dollars one week, one hundred, two hundred next week and then nothing.  So I looked around and I interviewed for maybe five different jobs and The Boston Globe and I think one of the television channels and everybody was willing to give me a job because of the background and so forth.  I think things had lightened up a little bit where people in Boston were becoming a little bit more educated that, hey it's not the blackness of your skin that does the job, it's what--the talent that you bring to the job.  But one of those companies was Ginn, Ginn and Company.  They're a company that's been around for over a hundred years plus.  They were very, very good.  They were very big in the reading area, children's reading.  And so I had many interviews with them and I can remember the last interview was we were walking back to their office and had a nice meal, with a nice drink and everything else.  The--one of my--the boss that I would report to said to me, you know he asked me about my church affiliation and I told him.  And then he asked me, "If you don't get this job do you think it's because of the color of your skin?"  And it was kind of a strange question but still it was a question I think I was ready for.  And I says, yes.  It had to be that, nothing else but that.  And I was hired.
Story_ID: 86130
Speaker 1: I was hired and I became the first black actually to work in their [Ginn and Company] editorial division.  I was a supervisor in charge of the high school division and I had about nineteen people working for me and our job was to buy--when the manuscript determined that a piece of artwork went there or a map went there and so forth, we were to develop the specifications and find the right artist to do the job.  And so I was in charge at that time of learning about budgets and how to budget.  I mean they would give me X of thousands of dollars and my job was now to relegate that money to various artists and photographers and so forth and that, that's what I did.  It was kind of challenging in a way.  There were many people because I came there with a--an advertising background was a--where there was a lot of finger snapping and people making funny sayings and running up the flag pole to see who salutes and so forth.  But now I'm going into a publishing company where it's kind of laid back and the department was really all women and so forth.  So I was huffing and puffing and doing all my managerial things and so forth.  I did that one day until they pulled a job action on me.  And one day I looked around the department and it was like four people there.  Everybody had a cold that day and it didn't take long for me to understand that, be cool.  Be cool.  Treat people in a certain way.  And I remember my experiences from the [United States] Army.  And all these experiences, the army and everybody else because at one time I became, as a Corporal, I became in charge of a barrack and the men in that barrack were all older men, Thirty, Thirty-Five and so forth, regular army but these guys were foul ups and so forth.  And every one of them could break me like a twig.  I mean these guys had spent jail time and everything else.  And I had to treat them in a certain way so that they start to know me and that I was supportive of things but I would take no nonsense from them.  And when I learned that and they learned to respect me, then everything went okay.  That's the same thing I applied to the women who worked for me back then. And so I did that for a while.
Story_ID: 86131
Speaker 1: Soon after that they [Ginn and Company] asked me if I would be interested in becoming a designer for them.  I didn't think I wanted to do that.  I didn't tell them that but they gave me a weekend to think about it and I think my answer would have been no.  I don't think they would have fired me but I think they would have offered me something else.  But in the--when I got back that, before I could even say no they said, we want you to become the manager of our cover department and that meant that I was responsible for every cover that they put on a book, from teachers' editions, to pupils' editions to every--all the disciplines that they had from math to social sciences, civics, everything.  They--I did maybe a hundred and forty to a hundred and fifty covers a year and I did that by, with an assistant and so forth.  I would design, come up with the ideas and so forth, then we would solicit and get a person who would do the photography and the illustration and so forth and there was couple of times that I handled the illustration myself.  I didn't feel like I wanted to spend the money.  But I did that, and through the years I started to go up in rank.  And there were times when I did have problems.  I'm not going to say that thirty one years were smooth because there were a lot of people there, not maybe a great number of people but they're on the outside, sales people who'd try to get around me when I didn't think that they were going to do the right job and I picked someone else.  They would go to my boss and says, well Frank, you know thinking and so forth.  So there was a lot of that behind the back type of stuff.  But my main focus as the focus of my dad [Kenneth Lucas] was, you got to provide for your family.  You got to work hard for your family and so forth.  Try not to take it personal.  He was a man that would say to us, if they call you names, you know, walk away.  But he says if they put their hands on you, then that's what you got to do.  And I don't think anyone was going to put their hands on me there.  But I had an opportunity to travel for them, go to the various printers throughout the country to watch the work run and it was just very, very nice working.  And then you know I started to climb again, so to speak.  There was a time when I was kind of like in a lateral situation.  And I have to say that having a good home environment, a wife [Patricia Ann Lucas] that's always there for you, not that I would come home and talk about the lousy day I had you know.  I would never say to her as my father did to mother [Millicent Alleyne Lucas] that he saw hell.  I just wouldn't talk about it and she wouldn't ask any questions but she knew in her certain ways how to, you know get around things and so forth.  But we went through that and slowly as the company went from Ginn to Xerox, they apparently saw that I was worth something, they started to elevate me higher, give me an opportunity to go to Xerox schools and so forth to learn more about management, which I did.  And then after fifteen years with Xerox they decided that they didn't want the publishing business anymore and so they went out.  They sold us to Gulf and Western [Industries].  Gulf and Western, I figure a new team they're going to say, well we got our own people, but again I kind of got through that okay.  And I worked with them for a while and then they were sold to--I believe that's--well they were all part of Simon and Schuster at that time so I had a chance to meet with those people and they were very supportive of one of the new things that I was trying to bring to the company.  They, then they sold to Viacom, another big company.  So along the way because I had the tenacity to hang in there, I went from one place to another place, always moving and focusing and so forth.  And when I finally left the company I was working for Viacom.
Story_ID: 86132
Speaker 1: Well tell us, just back track a little bit, tell us what it was like and there was a--it was some--there was a dramatic way in which you were presented as the first black employee (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh that.  Again, it always funny because I, again you know being the only black actually at Ginn [and Company], and I would say in the entire--there was only one other black man that worked for Houghton and Mifflin in the industry in the entire city of Boston, and I would say in Massachusetts.  There were no others.  But the day that I went to the job my boss came and he said "We're going to go to see the president."  And I can remember the two of us cause you know I guess I wore leather heels at that time so we made this clickety-clack sound as we went down the hallway.  And as we were going down the hallway he went into another person's office, another vice president.  He picked him up and says we're going to the president's office.  And then before you know it, there was another person who joined us and so there was this, a lot of clickety-clops going down the hallway and so forth.  And I'm saying to myself, you know, what is this all about, you know?  Who is--if he--all the other people who come into this company are not visiting the president of the company.  And so I think there were maybe five of us and we walked into the president's office and he looked up from his big mahogany desk and he says, oh welcome aboard and I hope that you know, you're going to be happy with us and so forth but that was the thing that they did.
Speaker 1: That's dramatic.  That's like the magnificent seven.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, you're just waiting for the gun fight at the end--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: --and so forth.

Speaker 1: I know that there was a friend of mine and he was a long time, he left the company [Ginn and Company], but he was the first black salesman and so forth.  The Ginn always had, and other publishing companies always have black salesmen.  These are the people that can go into the black neighborhoods and these are the people that can go into certain areas that maybe a lot of white people might not want to go into and so forth so they were always there.  The--there's a little story there too.  Many years ago, working for a company, we got a call from Detroit [Michigan] and Detroit was reading the riot act to every publisher in the entire country.  And what they were saying was that we just don't like how books are presenting our life and so forth.  I mean there was still--because there was no one else there to say you're wrong.  I mean there were people there that had jobs but they didn't know what our culture was like or what things that we liked.  They only saw that from maybe the shows that they saw on television, so there was a lot of bad stuff going out there.  But Ginn made it a point since I was there to use me as best they could to fill in those gaps, to train them so to speak.  And I can recall going into, flying out one night to Detroit.  I mean it was a last minute thing, rush, rush, rush.  Get on, you know get out of here.  So I got there and there's this meeting of all--our salesmen now are coming in.  This is serious.  I mean we, we're spend--I mean revenue's coming out of Michigan was several hundred thousand dollars and now Detroit's saying we don't want you anymore to everybody.  So the next day we went to the Superintendent's office, a big building in Detroit and the school board, cause I was there once before, but the school board was never that many blacks.  I think the--on the dais then it was probably about, out of the ten or twelve people there, there was probably about nine blacks and so forth.  And one fellow who I can't recall his name now but he stood up and he says "I know who you all are out there" because there was a sea of black people there.  Where did they, all these people come from?  He says, "I know who you are."  He says "you're all the salesmen they can find to send out here."  I mean we're talking about three or four hundred people in this audience.  He says, "Is there anyone here that represents the editorial side of things, anyone here that call the shots?"  So I was sitting in this row of people and I can remember one of the VPs of sales, he kind of leaned over and looked down past seven or eight people to where I was sitting, I caught his eye and it was like telling me, get up, get up.  And so, not a public speaker, I got up and they wanted to know who I was.  And I told them that I was the person who put the right things in the books for our children and I believe that Ginn and Company does a great job.  I can't speak for the other companies here.  I was going to put in as much as I could but this is what we're doing and so forth.  And he says well thank you very, very much. Is there anyone else?  There was nobody else.  And even today, there's nobody else really out there that did what I did, okay.  So I can feel you know somewhat comfortable but I get very upset, myself, when I look around me and I see that some of our boys and girls are not really doing the things that they should be doing.  Again my parents without--with a seventh grade education knew that education was key to the whole thing.
Story_ID: 86134
Speaker 1: Now, tell me now at Ginn and Company, what was their primary reader?  Didn't they produce a reader that was--
Speaker 2: Well the--
Speaker 1: --distributed around the country?
Speaker 2: Oh, the reader was distributed everywhere.  I mean we had offices in the Philippines.  We had offices in London [England].  We had offices in Canada.  We were national.  We were everywhere.  If you didn't have a Ginn reader--and the readers in those days were called the Dick and Jane readers.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that was everywhere.
Speaker 2: That was everywhere.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And when you look at Dick and Jane, Dick and Jane didn't have any blacks folks in there, okay.
Speaker 1: Dick and Jane, Sally, Spot and--
Speaker 2: Yeah okay, didn't even have a black dog, okay.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they were everywhere.  A lot of the books when I first went there I could change because if--I think I might have a couple of books around here, I'm not sure. But I have some books that I started to show black people in them.  And a lot of those pictures were taken of family members.  I would have pictures of--if it required a picture of a family sitting around a table eating that was my family.  My daughter would be in a high chair, my two sons.  I'd put the camera on self-timer and run into the shot.  I mean that's how they started to get more blacks into some of the books and so forth, neighborhood kids I would find and where I would put them into situations and so forth, you know.
Story_ID: 86135
Speaker 1: Yeah, now was Dick and Jane ever illustrated-integrated, I mean?
Speaker 2: Dick and Jane wasn't integrated.  Dick and Jane--the only books that were, that you find integrated back then was we did a Catholic series and I think the Catholic were trying to add to their flock so you saw a lot more of those books, books on Catholicism or whatever using blacks and so forth or people of color whether Hispanics or Asian or whatever have you, they were more integrated and so forth.  I can remember there was a lot of companies produce and our company did at that time what they call a book that never went into, below the Mason-Dixon Line because they wouldn't have sold them there.  And they used to have certain codes on them.  It was something called a two star edition or three star edition and those we printed two sets of books sometimes.  One set would go below in the South and some that would stay up North.
Speaker 1: Now about what year are we talking about?
Speaker 2: Oh, we're talking about the Sixties [1960s]. I mean you know, that was the days when the, you know things were beginning to become unraveled somewhat in the country.  But now it's a lot, lot different.  Interesting enough though having said all of that, the last designs that I did, book cover designs was perhaps in 1995 and Ginn and Company was known for their reading.  I think, they're not around anymore in that sense but they were known for the reading.  We put out the best reading project--product in the world.  And the idea that I had was to illustrate the cover of each book with a image, a full color image of a kid, Asian, Hispanic, Black, White what have you.  And that was going to be the main feature of that cover.  It was going to be in black and white and the illustrations which were on the inside of some of the characters and the stories and so forth, they were going to be in color.  And I thought I had a real fantastic idea and so forth.  It was never done before because any time you saw on anybody's publication a black kid on a cover of any book, you always saw Hispanic kids, you always saw a Chinese kid or you saw some--you saw the mix of all the races but never an inter-racial illustration in black and white.  And I can remember, very proud of that, went through a series of markups and thousands of dollars and I can remember making my presentation to some of the people who I had to make presentations to.  They had a real problem with that.  My reason for running it in because a lot of our books are sold in various states, Florida, North Carolina, places that you know seemingly have changed in their ways but there's still a lot of backlash out there.  And my reason for having them in black and white is that I thought it was a great image but I think that, people didn't really--they don't really pay much attention to a black and white image.  They would say it, it would be a kid but they really would--what it, what they're not looking at is all of color imagery that was around that black and white photograph.  And I can remember making a presentation to one of the presidents and all of the honchos and so forth and they really, really had a problem with this thing.  And what happened was that they says "Why can't we make it all color?"  And so you know after a while you figure, you know you just can't fight city hall and I made it all color and I think it was less successful.  Nowadays when you look at a lot of things in advertising and so forth you see that mixture of black and white and color.  It's kind of punchy, it's  kind of interesting, kind of nice but I'm still dealing with a lot of people who just don't know.  They really don't know me, I mean like I'm a fluke.  What am I doing here, you know?  It's, it was always that.  I never let it bother me too--that I was uncomfortable with it but I know that they were never sure about what my capabilities were even though I've won awards.  I've won all kinds of prizes for them and I think there was one project that we worked on where we took sixty to seventy percent of the market share throughout the country because of the new covers that were created using some of my techniques, but that's the way it is.  But as I say to my children today, focus on what you have to do.  If you get locked into focusing on every, what everyone else thinks you should be doing then you go nowhere.
Story_ID: 86136
Speaker 1: Okay. Now you retired [from Ginn and Company] in '95 [1995]?
Speaker 2: I retired in 1997.  I retired at sixty-seven and--because the company at that time had no real retirement age.  Their feeling was if you can work and you can produce, so you work and you produce, and that was great.  The other thing too where I kept, stayed in there is because I knew that if they closed my division down which they did, they would have to buy out my, they would have to pay me.  So that's what they did, they closed my division down so what they had to do if pay me full salary for a year.  And so in that time I collect my pension, I collect my social security so you know I was kind of like bathing in money at that time but this is all I've ever done.  You can--from the beginning of my story I can--I'm not interested in anything else.  I've never had to work any other job.  I've never worked at a meat market.  I've never worked for an under taker.  I've never worked for anything else but graphics.  Now graphics surely back as a highschooler was making signs and posters and so forth but I've never had to do anything else but that.  So I've done something that I love.  [United States] Army the same way, when people were going getting shot and killed and blown up, I was doing signs and paper and diagrams and so forth, never had to do anything else.  When I came home finally at sixty-seven people started calling me on the phone, can you do this for us and I've had a few jobs but I just don't feel like I want to run after those things.  I just don't like running after people to pay me for things.  So I got a call from a good friend, she was my boss, editor and chief many years ago and she was retired and she asked me if I would like to work for--do some consulting work.  And I says, well I'm not so sure.  Well do you somebody that wants to do some work?  And I says--well I started calling around.  Nobody wanted to do anything.  Everybody wanted to play golf.  I wouldn't have been able to play golf.  Okay, I don't know what that is.  So I went up and I took a look at what they wanted.  They wanted me to train some of their young people in this whole graphics thing because there's a lot of young people that says they know but they really don't.  And then they wanted me to help them with a new client that they had and buying artwork for them and selecting illustrators and so forth.  And so we worked with companies like Berlitz.  We worked with people like Sesame Street so it was interesting for me to be flying again making meetings and talking to people.  One of our biggest customers right now is a company called Leap Frog.  They're out of California and they've been written up in Fortune Magazine and Forbes and so forth.  They do a lot of E-L-L books.  This is English as a Second language, English Language Learners so to speak.  And our company Course Crafters, that's who I'm with now, they do a lot of that material.  And so I was only planning on staying a few months but now it's gone into the fourth year.  I'll be seventy-three in August.  I have no intention of quitting.  I'm sure that at seventy-four I'll probably be doing signs for some store again but this is what I do.
Story_ID: 84145
Speaker 1: Now what about the Reunion Newspaper?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said I've always had you know a full time job.  I've only had three jobs in my career that--and so forth.  I've never you know went from one thing to another, only if I saw opportunities and those have been three.  But what I've gone throughout the years is that I told you I freelance a lot.  People who were willing, the National Fire Protection Association which is very big internationally, I did a lot of work for them on their covers and so forth.  It was always a way of making money to support tuitions for my kids, trips for the family, a little extra something for the house or maybe just something to put in a savings.  But it was--always had it.  And what I have done, I--when I speak to my two boys and a girl, I talk to them about that entrepreneurship that we should have and so forth.  The paper got started in kind of a strange way.  My older son who is a designer, Frank [Lucas], Jr., he was a cyclist, loved to cycle and was into all kinds of races and so forth.  That's what he did, you know, for fun.  But he was getting very, very good at it.  And one day he came to me and he says, dad I want to start, I want to make some much--I want to make some money dad.  And I said to him well, what are you going to do?  He says, I'm going to write a--I'm going to have a newspaper on politics.  I thought that was pretty funny cause I don't even know if my son knows where the polling booth is, okay.  I says, you know Frank (unclear) I mean, I don't even think you vote do you?  And I says, why don't you do something other--what you know and that is cycling.  And it was a long pause and so forth.  He says, gee dad, that sounds good.  So him and a pal, they got together and me and the mother [Patricia Ann Lucas] put up a couple of bucks and they started a little newspaper called "Race New England."  And my daughter [Diahanne Lucas] who is a pretty good photographer shot a lot of the photographs and so forth and they put out this tabloid thing every month.  In the meantime, my daughter is thinking about it also.  And she says dad, you know there are really no newspapers in New England.  When you look into the Boston area you have the [Bay State] Banner.  They've been around since the days of desegregation back in the 60s [1960s] and what have you doing the same old, same old.  Good paper, but let's do something that would be all of New England.  And I says, yeah it sounds like a good--and we're not going to talk about who got high on Saturday night and who's robbing who and who's smoking dope, none--nothing that's negative.  We're going to do everything that's very, very positive.  So we came up with the word Reunion and it's the news that celebrates our history and you know of achievements and all the good things in life and New England has a lot going for it.  We had mentioned in passing Lucy Terry, [Lucy Terry Prince, composed a ballad called "Bars Fight"], we did a little story on her.  And when you read the accounts of her life back then in the 1700s, what a life that she had and the things that she brought to--and how she fought for her children to go to school and so forth.  And we talk about Amos Fortune and--but we also talk about the people who are doing something all through New England now.  We would look into the newspapers, we would look into the internet.  We would find little things that says that that some young lady has now gotten a job at John Hancock [Financial] or one of the insurance companies or they've gotten a job at this place or that place.  And we would find out more about them because the regular newspaper would only give them five or six lines but we would go into it and we would find out who--where they went to school, you know, how did they get this far?  And we found that was human interest.  So we would get permission from--sometimes we didn't get the permission or did we need it, but we would get information from their schools, we would call them, we would do interviews.  You know we have people here, we talked to one fellow who was the, one of the six black veterinarians in New England in history and how he got his education at Tuskegee [University in Tuskegee, Alabama] and so forth.  But these are things that other people didn't know.  So we give them those kinds--we had cartoons in it.  A friend of mine would draw the cartoons about different issues and so forth but nothing that was political.
Story_ID: 84146
Speaker 1: It was just--and we would--we did this on our own, okay?  My daughter [Diahanne Lucas] would do all the typesetting while using the computer and so forth.  She would write stories.  We'd get other people to write for us.  We were putting out--we ran--it came out monthly, 24 to 36 pages most of the time.  And we gave away a lot and we had subscriptions but as you know newspapers, magazines, is really the advertising.  And for a while when I think businesses were more philanthropic we were getting advertising but slowly that went.  I was spending out, money out of my pocket, okay.  I would print the thing.  We would pay for it cash.  We would print maybe seven or eight thousand a month, drive them sixty-five miles to the printer.  He would deliver them here and then that weekend, my daughter and myself, we would get into our cars and we would drive all over New England giving them to the churches free and shut-ins and, and so forth.  It was a labor of love and we were both working.  We both had full time jobs so she would leave from her job, come over here, we'll work until twelve o'clock at night, sometimes longer putting this out and so forth, stories about historical people living in Civil War.  We wrote about Rhode Island and we visited just about--we visited all the states and so forth.  And one day while we were both working together and feeling very tired.  She looked at me and I don't think either one of us wanted to say--and she says "You know dad, I really don't want to do this anymore."  And I was wondering why I couldn't buy a new suit or a new tie.  Because every--all the money that I made that certainly you know paid for the things here in the house, but all the money that I made went into this paper and so we had to give it up.  But then later on she said to me, I'm thinking about a website and we can get the news out that way and so forth.  So she created blacknewengland.net, which is out there and is very good but it deals with the same type of thing, historical.  And now we're linked to many other sites throughout the country meaning that you don't really have to--if you get onto newengland.net, you can look in, at a lot of information all over about blacks in this country.  We don't make any money from this.  She makes a couple of dollars for some flags that she has out from a couple of businesses and so forth.  But again this is just really--I'm not sure of who's teaching who, but she has that entrepreneurial spirit that I had, the fact that you never give up and so forth.  You know she has a full time job, she does this in the evening at her apartment.  Anything that I can help financially I'm willing to do so but I didn't say to my daughter or any of my children, I want you to become a dentist.  I said to them, I really don't want you in trouble with anybody and respect everybody, your family and so forth.  And I'm--my wife [Patricia Ann Lucas] and myself we're very, very fortunate that we have these types of children that are very hard working and self-sufficient.
Story_ID: 84147
Speaker 1: And you have one son [Michael Lucas] that's a police officer here in town.
Speaker 2: He's right here in town, great guy.  He--if you run into him, you'll know him.  Well, he's the only black police officer in town so you'll recognize him right away and so forth, very good with kids and so forth.  He's looking to get another degree in law enforcement.  My oldest guy [Frank Lucas, Jr.], the cyclist, he's still looking for a good woman but he is a designer with Verizon [Communications Inc.] and he's been through all their changes, very similar to what I went through with various companies coming in, buy us out east, started with New England Telephone and Atlantic, Bell or I don't know the names anymore but he's with them as a designer.  And my daughter is with WGBH in Boston [Massachusetts], very hard worker and so forth.  And she's working on another degree from--that, we're hoping that she gets this coming year.
Story_ID: 84148
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you often make presentations in the public school.
Speaker 2: I've made a number of presentations.  I think kids are interested in how I did and I think sometimes they know because one of my--some of my presentations might go like this and I--and I've made presentations at Rhode Island School of Design [Providence, Rhode Island] and so forth, one of the premier art schools in the country.  And I tell them about what I went through and I don't get into anything that says I went through all this because I was a black person.  I says, I don't have to tell you what I went through.  They all know whether it's from the things that they've read, what their families might have said to them about what has happened to us in this--in the country.  So they went--they're very interested in how did I do it?  And one of it is never ever giving up, know much about your craft that you possibly could know and so forth and be willing to ask for help.  Every job that I ever went to and I was turned down, I never slammed the door behind me.  I walked out of there and before I walked out I would say to whoever the interviewer was, "Thank you for the opportunity.  By the way, do you know anyone else that you can refer me to?"  And sometimes just to get me out of the office they would say somebody and I would go to them and they would turn me down also.  But it was a matter of just continue to do that and do that and do that and that's what I talk about.  I talk about being good at what you do, you know because I interview--when I was in the position that I held, I interviewed hundreds of people a year and there was some talented people, but there were people who came there with a story or there were people who were given a diploma or a certificate or whatever, a degree because their dad knows someone or the school was willing to take their money.  I still have till this day people who have heard about me and called me on the phone because their children want to go to art school and they might have said, oh my god.  But I tell them, I says, that if this child has talent they have to go because this is a business.  This isn't people drawing pretty pictures.  It might look that way but this is a business where millions of dollars are at stake, I mean businesses that are at stake.  When working for the publishing company, if I didn't produce quality product for them and they'd lost an adoption in a certain state after spending maybe two million dollars--not two million, we're talking about maybe twenty million dollars to get the product ready for marketplace and they--and I didn't do my job, there was something wrong, okay.  So kids, and that's the mainly--the main thing, you know, kids want to know how much do you make?  Well I don't get into that because the--it is--the importance here isn't really money, but it's really what you like to do.  I like this stuff.
Story_ID: 84149
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now tell me about the scholarship fund that you (unclear).
Speaker 1: A number of years ago a lot of us that lived in the community of Cambridge, Massachusetts and as I said it was a great community, they--we would get together and I would call people up that I haven't seen for a long time on the phone and sometimes there'd be a gathering here at the house of maybe thirty people or more.  And we would just laugh and kid because everybody knew everybody's mother and father and we all went to the same store, the same schools, and so forth.  But then we started thinking gee, where we can make this work for us.  And so a good friend of mine that I went to grade school with, our parents knew each other, Eugene Grant--and he's a story in himself because he became one of the first buyers of clothing for a major department store.  Nobody really knows about this guy.  And we put together an organization called the Cambridge Reunion Group, and the idea behind that was to have functions where we would invite anybody but certainly renew acquaintances with Cambridge people and we did that a number of years ago.  The first one was four years ago [1999] and we got somewhere in the vicinity of 250 people, each spending $45.00 to come.  And with that money we went to the old high school that we went to which is now Accord [phonetic] School and we had the people in charge of scholarships start to look into kids who need scholarships.  Now we are not looking for the kid who gets the A's all the time or the B's, but we're looking for that kid who really wants it but he's not going to get a scholarship to--he's good or she's good but they're never going to get a scholarship.  And like in my case you know they give away more scholarships now but certainly there's the ones that will be left in the cracks.  We give each kid when he or she enters into college $500.00 and that's enough to really start them buying their books and so forth.  So we've been able to over the course of the last four years give roughly twelve scholarships out to kids going to various schools throughout the country.  And with any function that you have, you never make enough money because you got to pay the band, you got to pay the hall, you got to pay the food so we dig in our pockets because we've committed to a certain amount and we pay the balance.  It's not that I have a lot of money or anything else, far from it.  I just feel that we have to spark an interest there and we can't let books or some small thing prevent kids that are yearning for an education not have the opportunity to go.
Story_ID: 84150
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you're a collector too.  You got you know, one cannot help but notice all the items you're surrounded with when you go in this house.  So--and a lot of old items and a lot of them with African American themes or even colored themes and, from way back when.
Speaker 2: Well I find that--I think I mentioned that history was a subject that I love dearly and so forth.  And to me, the love of finding out what was used back then, the collection that I have of black subject matter is interesting because it shows--and some of my black brothers and sisters really don't like what I have.  Some of it is very derogatory but I don't think that we can forget you know our beginnings.  You can't forget.  You can't put that under the rug and you know where we might be now you know.  You know we talk about the Madam Walkers [Sarah Breedlove, known as Madam C. J. Walker] and you know the first million that she made, but who was before her and so forth and the fact that somebody didn't give up on her.  And the Oprah Winfreys and all of these other people who have made changes, I got to keep that history in mind.  I showed you a poster called the Gold Dust Twins and it was a soap powder made by the company [Lever Brothers] that my father [Kenneth Lucas] worked for, for a number of years.  And he would never bring home that product.  He just--he was incensed by that image of those two twin black images on their posters and all their packaging and so forth.  But I don't think that we can forget that time and so forth.  And so I have a number of things I'm very interested in certainly African culture, in the whole way the interpretation of mask and other items that they used.  I'm very interested in Asian art and I have a nice collection of Asian pieces simply because I'm interested in the patience and the time and the focus again in people developing these things and carving these things and leaving something behind.  So my children are into it.  Then I, if I find things I give it to, especially my married son for him to hold onto and so forth.  They know that they're not going to put it into a garage sale.  And some day when we're gone might just sell it all and go to Barbados I'm not sure.  But my life you know at this stage is--has been good.  It has--it isn't like I made all the money in the world, I really didn't.  I really didn't.  But I think that I stayed with it.
Story_ID: 84151
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now let--we always ask people this question, what are your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: I worry.  I really worry about the black community.  You know I worry about families that didn't have the entire family involved, the father is missing.  I think of Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] and I know Roxbury before Roxbury--I think Roxbury is probably changing to some degree but I can remember when Roxbury was inhabited by the blacks who worked for the post office or the blacks who worked for the railroad and so forth and the things that they were doing.  And I can remember the [HM] Elma [Ina] Lewises and her dance schools and all the things that we were trying.  I never heard of shootings in Roxbury when I was a kid and so forth.  What happened there?  Something's happening and I think that sometimes we--people have polarized themselves into thinking that maybe we can only do it the easy way.  There's a little story about a group of men who were incarcerated and they--and the prison that they were in were showing them different things on how to make a livelihood as they came out of prison and so forth.  And one of the people who came to visit the prison was a symphony conductor and he turned on the phonograph and they're playing some serious bit of music.  And he's waving his arms as conductors do and many of the men says, that's what I want to be, the guy who waves his arms, not realizing that it's more than wave--raising, you know waving his arms back and forth but it's really what he had to go through, the time you know studying those dumb cords and those scales and all that sort of stuff and the hardships that he went through to learn his craft.  I'm not sure if we have time and so that, that's what worries me.  I, you know--it's just that I don't see really--when you look into the City of Boston or Cambridge [Massachusetts] for that matter, I mean we don't have a mayor.  I mean we have people that have run for city office and their counselor and it's, and that's great and so forth.  But when it comes to you know, we're still asking for a program to help us through.  You talked recently when we first met about organizations in New York [New York City, New York] that were West Indian organizations and how--what they did.  I can only think of the group that we had in Cambridge and how they put together things and so forth.  I think those are all important things but education, without it, there's nothing.  And everybody just can't become a hip hop singer or something that doesn't take a lot of focus and a lot of opportunity.
Story_ID: 84152
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: It's kind of--what I--you know sometimes I stop and I think I--about my own mortality and I says "Gee, where did seventy-three years go to?"  And I don't know.  But I had something that was in my yearbook that I wrote back then and it said "I came, I saw and I almost conquered."  I'm not sure if I conquered everything.  I think that if we feel that we have then there's nothing to look forward to.  So I'm still waiting and maybe I don't know what my legacy at that time.  I think that my legacy is what my wife might think of me, what my children might think of me and maybe half a dozen other people.
Story_ID: 84153
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Just a good guy, person who worked hard, nothing more than that.  I think, did a pretty good job raising a family.  I'm not sure if I--somebody's going to look at me and says, well he was a great art director.  I--that was just a time in my life, a period in my life. But being a good guy is all of my life.  That's how I'd like to be remembered, just as a good guy.
Speaker 1: Okay, well I think you will be.  Thank you sir.
Speaker 2: Well, my pleasure.
Story_ID: 84154
Speaker 1: And tell us what the circumstances are and the year if you can.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well the first picture that we're looking at is myself, that's at my first job and that was at Parsons, Friedmann, and Central.  I was, oh I would say about twenty-four at that time and this was an advertising agency that I worked at for pretty close to nine years [1956 until 1964] or so and all for $40.00 a week.
Speaker 1: (BRIEF INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Yeah, that one there is a good one.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: The picture here is of myself again.  I'm on the left, my mother's [Millicent Alleyne Lucas] in the middle and my brother Roy [Allen] is on the right and this was taken I believe, when I was, just before I went in the [U.S.] Army [1952] on the rooftop of his apartment in Brooklyn, New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A picture of my mother and father, Kenneth and Millicent Lucas and this was taken in front of the house that I lived in, apartment.  I was there from the time I was ten years old until the time I went in the Army.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, whenever you're ready.
Speaker 2: Oh, what a sweet little kid here.  This is Frank.  I was probably about easily maybe a year, year and a half old.  And my mother took me to one of those little coin machines where you put the coin in and took this picture.  I'm looking a little bit apprehensive.  Looks like I'm going to fall over.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my brother Roy and myself.  This was taken a few years ago.  He--my brother was a member of the American Negro Theater and was the first black hired at CBS as a manager and did a number of shows just recently.  A lot of the shows that he worked on was put into the archives in Washington, D.C.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.
Speaker 2: What are some of the shows?
Speaker 1: He did a lot of things for--one of--well he did like the forerunner to 60 Minutes.  That's the CBS report.  He did a number of soap operas.  He worked for many years on the Garry Moore Show, As the World Turns and so forth.  Then he went to--that one is my oldest kid, Frank [Lucas], Jr.  That was taking--with the, you know the school photographs that you get and so forth.  And this is a shot that I took of the three kids together, Frank, Michael and Diahanne.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Well, here I am again.  This was taken about--I was about six years old at that time, very nicely dressed up with everything.  As I said my father believed in putting the best on us.  You'll notice there's a little pin attached to my coat and it was from the Sunday school.  I still have those pins.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Wow.
Speaker 1: And it was because of good attendance in Sunday school for a year.  Interesting enough, Sunday school was really as long as both grade school and high school, twelve years.  And I did not miss a Sunday in all those years as well as not missing a day or absent a day in high school.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay (unclear).
Speaker 1: My high school picture and as you can see I have a very little mustache over my lip.  You can just about hardly see it cause I didn't really want my father to see it.  But I thought I would have this mustache because I was very interested in becoming a magician and everyone needs a mustache when you're a magician.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Right.
Speaker 1: This was a picture of my mother taken some years ago and I'm not quite sure, I got a feeling that this was the picture that was on her passport.  I think that's where it came from, her passport picture.
Story_ID: 83724
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is my dad Kenneth Lucas and this picture was taken from his passport picture.  You can see the little stamp in the corner.  We still have a lot of his documents and I think the charge for him to come to this country [from Barbados] was $50.00.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was the price, the same price that--
Speaker 2: This is Ann and myself.  She's really called Patricia Ann [Lucas], but she doesn't like the word Pat so it became Ann.  And this is our marriage photograph which was taken forty-six years ago on April 28th, and weren't we good looking people?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd say so.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Very good, next.
Speaker 1: This is my mom [Millicent Alleyne Lucas] and quite a lady.  Did all of her laundry herself or anything herself, cooked for us, you know kept us clean.  And as I remember my mother she never hit us.  She would always wait till my father came home.
Speaker 2: And let (laughter).
VIDEOGRAPHER:  When do you suppose this was taken if you can hazard a guess?
Speaker 2: That was taken I would venture to guess about 1963.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  All right, next.
Speaker 2: My dad, Kenneth Lucas.  This was taken when he retired from Lever Brothers, the soap manufacturer.  This was in the Lever standard which was their house organ.  I can always recall the little caption that was under that.  Keep in mind my father was a laborer and what they said in the caption was that he is to be congratulated for the career that he chose at Lever Brothers.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Hmm.
Speaker 2: Career.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Wow.  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is the--a family picture.  This is when, I can't recall exactly when that was taken but I would say over 35, 36 years ago, maybe longer than that, maybe closer to 30 years ago.  This is when I was working in studio work.  I was a studio manager for one of the top studios in Boston, Barker-Black.
Speaker 1: (BRIEF INTERRUPTION)
VIDEOGRAPHER:  All right, next.
Speaker 1: This is me right here.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  And let's go to your classroom--
Speaker 1: And it was 1946.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Nineteen Forty-Six, okay.
Speaker 1: And which one are you?  Right there?
Speaker 2: I--in the picture I'm the third black kid from the right.  I'm the, I'm standing--okay, that's me right here.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my grandmother, Adriana, and this is my mother's mother.  This was taken in Barbados.  The story behind this picture was that they were preparing her to leave Barbados to come to join her other daughters in this country but at the last minute she refused and that was the last time they saw her alive.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Wow, that's an amazing photo.  It's really good.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: She doesn't look happy either.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) very sad.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.
Speaker 1: I can't remember when this was taken but this was a--taken by an illustrator by the name of Gerston (phonetic) many years ago.  They use this in promotional materials and what have you.  But I enjoy it and through the years I've used this for greeting cards and Christmas cards.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Right there, second row down, fourth in.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  And a quick description for this.
Speaker 1: This is the first picture taken in Fort Devens, Massachusetts, the beginning of my training, twenty years old.  Oh, that's one of my--I didn't know where that came from.  That's when they were talking about my brother I think somebody did a cartoon.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).  This--I've never seen this particular--
VIDEOGRAPHER:  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: This is a picture probably taken around 1952, in training exercises at Fort Dix, New Jersey.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: This is reminiscent of the style of [Joel Augustus] J. A. Rogers your history--
Speaker 1: Oh right, okay.
Speaker 2: It's like it's our history.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We had another artist that used to do J. A. Rogers who was from Chicago [Illinois] --
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --and he started one of his own and I got a book of his--
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: --columns like this too at home.
Speaker 1: This is a little cartoon put out by the Amsterdam News in 1956.  Actually it's April 21st, 1956 of my brother Roy Allen who was just hired by CBS as a stage manager.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Great, next.  Are we going to interview your brother?
Speaker 1: He's dead now.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Oh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I had asked actually the people either to do my brother or--not my brother but certainly his wife.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Oh good.
Speaker 1: And then his--
VIDEOGRAPHER:  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my daughter [Diahanna Lucas] and myself and this was taken recently, just--
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Saturday, (unclear).
Speaker 1: --Twenty-Fourth, 2001, and it's the introduction of her website, New England--blacknewengland.net.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: This was taken in New York City [New York] at the end of a photo shoot, one week's worth of work and it was for some new covers for the Ginn Series [Ginn and Company], Silver Burdett Ginn Series that I developed using photography and actually illustration.  See those photographs that you see they were supposed to be, the one underneath is supposed to be the kid.  It's supposed to be black and white and then they changed them.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  And next.
Speaker 1: Okay, I see (unclear).
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, that's good.  We're good.  All right, go ahead sir.
Speaker 1: This was a series of eight covers I did for Ginn back in 1989 and what they're known for is a complete change in cover design using aluminum printing to make these covers move and shake.  I guess it was responsible for creating sixty percent of the market share.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Next.
Speaker 1: Again, this was the last set of covers that I did back about 1995.  I try to use different techniques so that if you were to rub your hand over the alligator's face you would find that there is a little--it's lumpy.  It's almost tactile.  And it's a feeling that it's real skin.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: And if you want to--they're pretty much, all the balance is the same almost but--
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Just let us know which ones you think are representative.
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's take a look at those that's on the--
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.
Speaker 1: Again this is using different treatments and so forth.  I was given an award, a national award for these covers because they were completely different than anything that was ever developed before using new techniques of printing.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  And one moment please.  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: And lastly, I've used a lot of techniques in cover design that really was for a different market, maybe a consumer market rather than an educational market trying to get something new that kids now-a-days are looking at rather than the traditional type of look.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, good.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Go ahead sir.
Speaker 1: Reunion, a newspaper that my daughter and I started oh, a number of years ago.  Our idea was to work with the different organizations in New England.  As we say in the front page it's "news that celebrates people, heritage, and achievement."  And this was something that we did on our own at night after our jobs were over and we printed 8,000 copies a month and they were distributed throughout New England and many places throughout the country.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Again, you know we would work with people that we've heard about.  Certainly the front cover photograph is of Barbara Ward and talked about her soft sculptures and so forth.  We were--we talked a lot about, in this particular paper about the New England Patriots and the fact that some of the things that they were doing in the community.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Again as I said we tried to cover all different events, all of these positive events that go on.  In this particular issue I think we had a guide to college scholarships and so forth.  But the front cover depicts a reenactment or reenacted people that represented the 54 Infantry Regiment in Boston.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's--
Speaker 1: That should do it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's it.
