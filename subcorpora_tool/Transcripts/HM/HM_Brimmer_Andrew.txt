Story_ID: 16753
Speaker 1: Tell me about your family history.  You know, you, you've been able to trace your family back quite a ways I, from what I understand.
Speaker 2: Yes, I can trace my family on my father's [Andrew Brimmer] side back to the 1820s in Louisiana.  I say that because that is on the black side.  I had some Indian ancestry which can go back beyond that.  The Indian ancestry was from the Tensas Indians.  I was born in a parish called Tensas Parish.  That is one of the parishes named for the Indian tribes that used to live there.  With respect to the black side of my family, I can go back through a relative who was alive when I was a boy.  This man was, his name was Frederick Waters, and he lived across the street from us.  I remember in 1935 when I was 9 years old, I used to sit on the porch during the summers and listen to 'Uncle Feddic' describe how it was in the old days.  He lived--he knew my grandfather. Feddic, in 1935, celebrated his 100th birthday, which meant he was born in 1835.  My mother [Vellar Davis Brimmer], when I ran home and told her that Feddic was a hundred years old today, she said, "Oh, Feddic is not a hundred years old.  He's no more than 90 years old."  Well, even if he were born in 1845, that would have meant it was a very long time ago.  My ancestors were slaves on a plantation called Winter Quarters.  Winter Quarters was located just south of Newellton [Louisiana].  In fact, the border of, of Newellton, the southern border of Newellton was the northern border of the Winter Quarters Plantation.  Winter Quarters was used by General [Ulysses S.] Grant when he came down on the Louisiana side, crossed the Mississippi River and attacked Vicksburg [Mississippi] from the south.  That was in July 1863 during the [U.S.] Civil War.  And Feddic, Uncle Feddic told me that he remembered those days because he and a number of the other slaves--men--were conscripted by General Grant in order to build the so-called corduroy roads over which the Union troops moved through the swamps.  And so he, he could describe--but he also described what life was like on the plantations before the Civil War.  And he said that, that he knew my grandfather and maybe even my great grandfather in the early days.  They, they worked in the fields.  They, they, they were field slaves.  He said that one of my--ancestors was the, the mule skinner, which meant he handled the mules and also during the--when it was not plowing and planting time, he, he was the stable boy.  In fact, Feddic said that he had an experience because one of General Grant's orderlies, the orderly sergeant who looked after the livestock, the horses and so on, used the, the stables on the plantation when they were camped there for a while.  And said, one day, the orderly sergeant said, bring the General's horse and the other commanders' horses because they were going out some place.  And so said, the, the stable boy, the stable man, the mule skinner wasn't there.  So he brought the horse.  And they started to say, "Where's the boy who would, would look after the horses?".  And he said, well, I'm not a boy, but I brought the horses (laughter). And so the guy said, "Thank you, thank you."  And so it is through those kinds of experiences and accounts that I can get back to the 1820s.  My father told me that he was told that his ancestors and therefore my ancestors were brought from Virginia to Louisiana.  And they had been on, on rice plantations in Virginia and, and--then the, they were sold as they would say, we were sold down the river which meant really they were sold to the west.  But that's how we got into Louisiana.  Now, on my mother's side, I, I have less detail.  But my mother was born in 1900 in the County [Madison Parish] just North of Tensas County [sic, Tensas Parish].  She was born on a plantation.  But her father and--well, my mother's mother, my grandmother on my mother's side was the second or third wife of my grandfather.  But in any case, when my mother was born in 1900, her father was 50 years old, which meant he would have been born in 1850.  And, and he said that he was born in Louisiana, but he said his parents had also been sold into Louisiana from Virginia.  But exactly when that was I don't know.  But it sounds as though my mother's family arrived in Louisiana after my father's family.  So that, that--those were the early days
Story_ID: 16754
Speaker 1: My own--father was born--
Speaker 2: Would you give us his full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 1: My father's name was Andrew Brimmer, A-N-D-R-E-W, Brimmer.  No middle name.
Speaker 2: Okay, and what--
Speaker 1: My mother's name was--
Speaker 2: I'll ask about her, but I wanted his date of birth and place of birth.
Speaker 1: Yeah, my father was born in 1893 in Newellton, Louisiana on one--on one of the plantations, another plantation close by, but the address was Newellton, Louisiana.
Speaker 2: Okay, and, you know, how did he grow up and what was he like and, you know, what did he do for a living?
Speaker 1: Oh, my father grew up on the plantation.  He picked cotton, but then later became a cotton farmer.  He worked as a farmhand, but then became a sharecropper.  And he became a sharecropper in around 1922, '23 [1923]  But he had been a farmhand and farm laborer up to that time and saw an opportunity to sharecrop and thus, be on his own as a cotton farmer.  But he was wiped out by the boll weevil, the boll weevil, which destroyed the cotton crop.  He was also hit very hard, and this was when he was--the final blow came, by the floods of 1927, which devastated the Louisiana side.  And after that he did not return to sharecropping, not on a permanent basis.  He tried--it must have been, from his account, 1920--that was 1927, '28 [1928], but then the great collapse came in '29.
Speaker 2: Now, just go back a minute.  That flood of 1927 has been written about quite a bit recently.  In fact, a public television special was made about it.
Speaker 1: I see.  I didn't see it.
Speaker 2: Devastation in Mississippi and Louisiana and other places.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I just wanted to point that out for--
Speaker 1: Yes, and that was an occasion for one of the memorable event, I learned.  As I said, the Louisiana side was the low side [of the Mississippi River] and eventually, people were being moved from the Louisiana side over the levee which--and then some to the levee, for a while, but then to the Mississippi side of the river.  And my father said that there was a, a, a captain of the boat, because these boats, all kinds of boats were put into, pressed into service to evacuate people from the low-lying over to the Mississippi side, the high ground.  And my father said that, and there were about, oh, 15, 16 people, our family plus some others, were down by the levee then the point to get onto the boat.  And this captain who was white and he had a deckhand, a black man who was his deckhand, just two of them.  And so the captain said, "Oh, we have to wait."  My father said, "But look, we have the people here.  The, the high water is worse so we're here now and maybe we should go."  And so the Captain said, "No, I'm to wait." He had to wait for this, this group of whites who were not even there, supposed to be there, but they were not in sight.  So after some argument back and forth, my father, who was much bigger than I am--I'm about 5 feet 10.  He, he was over 6 feet.  And he just broke the barrier down, and told the people to get on the boat, and then, and says, "Now, look, we're not going to get off so you may as well take us across."  The deckhand said to the Captain, Brimmer moves-- "Brimmer means what he says."  So, you ought to do it.  So that was done.  And so the Captain said, all right, but we'll take care of you later.  Of course, nothing's ever happened.  So the, that flood is what really put an end to my father's career as a, as a sharecropper because the, the owner of the land, really just gave it up and started renting it and so on because there was no way he was going to make money tr-, farming it.  Well, after that my father worked for something called Newellton Elevator Company.  This was a, a smaller plantation carved out of Winter Quarters [Plantation].  And that was called the Franklin Plantation, but it was owned by two men, a man named Ed McDonald and a man named W. W. Burnside.  I remember that because it was--they owned the cotton gin.  They raised cotton.  They owned cotton gins.  And they were just beginning to raise soybeans and oats.  And so my father worked during the planting season, cultivating and harvesting season, cotton picking season on the plantation. During the late fall and winter months, he worked for the Newellton Elevator Company, working on the grain elevator and in the--the lumberyard.  And so partly because of longevity and long-term association, he had became what is known as a straw boss, which in other settings would have been a, a foreman.
Story_ID: 16755
Speaker 1: Tell us about your mother.  Can, can you give us her full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother's name was Vellar, V-E-L-L-A-R, Dellar Davis, D-A-V-I-S.  Vellar Davis.  And, of course, she became Vellar Brimmer when she married my father [Andrew Brimmer].  And they were married in 1921.
Speaker 1: Now, what was her birth date and birth place?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) She was born January 1, 1900.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm going to ask you about her background too,  then if you can remember, if, if there's a story about how they met, you know, you can tell me.
Speaker 2: All right.  Okay, my mother was born on a plantation in Madison Parish [Louisiana], the parish just North of Tensas Parish.  And she was married when she was 17, but to her first husband, who was 17, and they had one son.  I didn't know anything at all about her first husband.  But they [Brimmer's parents] met, met around 1920 or thereabouts, which meant my mother was 20 years old and my father was 27.  How they met?  Visiting back and forth across, as they said, across the line, the county line.  They had not grown up together, but somehow along the way, they, they met and, and, got married in 1921.  I do not know of--much about my mother's life in, in Madison Parish.  So her life comes into focus when she married my father. And that's the story that I learned from them.  And she, she--well, I, I should say when they got married, it, it looks as though my mother's family was somewhat better off than my father's family because when they got married, my mother brought two cows, one of which had a calf, a dozen chickens--and my father brought to the marriage--6 hogs.  So they started off, when they--so they had--remember they'd--my mother had already been married.  My father had not been married, but he was now 27 years old so he had been working and accumulating.  And, and by the way, my father had very little formal education.  He went to, through the second grade.  My mother went through the 5th grade.  But it's very interesting because my father continued to read and educate himself much more than my mother did.  But, but they were both committed to education and continued to, to read.  My father--and this, I became aware of this because I had--I was--there were 6 of us, 6 of us.  The, my older brother who was the, the side of the first marriage, my brother.  But my father and my mother had 5 of us together.  There was--I had two sisters ahead of me.  I was in the middle and I had a sister and a brother behind me.  And I remember very early that my father would read the school books of my older sisters and brothers.  And, frankly, that's how I learned to read before--I could read and write before I went to school.  And I learned because my father was reading, any my--and talking about the subject matter, the text books and so on, with my older sisters and brothers.  So, those are some of the highlights of, of growing up.
Story_ID: 16756
Speaker 1: And give us maybe a description of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  Newellton was a very small town.  And, in, in fact, I remember distinctly--and see, I was growing up--I left Louisiana when I was seventeen years old.  But--just--the, the--it said, "City Limits".  It wasn't a City.  It was eight hundred people.  There was a pop--it said, Welcome to Newellton, Louisiana, Population 800.  And that was the population for 1940, 1940.
Speaker 1: Eight hundred.
Speaker 2: Eight hundred people.  Newellton was located, in terms of the, the fixing the geography on U.S. 65.  That was the highway that went north-south on the west side of the Mississippi River, through St. Louis [Missouri] on down toward New Orleans [Louisiana].  The road west, we passed--we lived on, it was called West Street, but it really was a gravel road, coming down.  Oh, it must have been 1939, '40 [1940] before that was paved.  But it was a gravel road.  And so that road west went on to Winnsboro [Louisiana] and on west.  So--and the railroad ran between the highway, which ran right through the town, and about half a mile west was, a little less than a half a mile, was the railroad parallel to the highway.  And then we lived on the west side of the railroad, about--because there was the railroad, there was Newellton Elevator Company with its, its cotton gins and the ele--grain elevator, and then the houses along the way.  The house we lived in was owned by the Newellton Elevator Company.  And--and--they
Speaker 1: Did they own a lot of property around there? I mean did they own most of the houses that their employees lived in?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes.
Speaker 1: You said it was (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Well, well, but let's talk about the town of Newellton because that had a lot of, about sounds and smells and so on.  The town of Newellton was right on the lake, the small lake I mentioned.  And the highway ran just along there, and the town was sort of a T, T-shaped.  The highway running west was like the long end of the "T" and the top of the "T" was along the rail--the highway.  And there you had, I remember it precisely at that first, at that intersection, in the southwest corner was a drugstore.  I remember that.  Opposite the drugstore was the dry goods store owned by a man named Solomon (ph.).  I remember that.  The drugstore was owned by a man named McGruder (ph).  And you had a few doors south of the drugstore was the, the bank, Tensas State Bank, I remember that.  And on the east side of the, of the street, almost exactly opposite the drugstore, but across the street was the--grocery store.  And it was, at one time it was an independent store, and then it became a Piggley Wiggly store.
Speaker 1: So as a little, as a--when you were a small child, did you see, I mean what kind of sights did you see in the streets or anywhere?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, this--Newellton--Newellton was a market town, which meant it was dead during the week.  And the farmers and farm laborers and others came into town on Saturday.  And there you--the theater was there on that side of the street. And I remember it was a segregated theater as everything was segregated.  The--
Speaker 1: Could black people go?
Speaker 2: The black people go, but they sat in the balcony, in the balcony.  And the--there was a Saturday matinee and that's when the kids could go.  And so I remember that one of the first questions I had, because we all paid, I think it was something like .10 cents for a matinee' admission.  The white kids paid .10 cents; we paid 10 cents.  And so I wanted to why is it if--we paid 10 cents, same as everybody else, why couldn't we sit where we wished.  Then it was explained to me that, that couldn't be done.  Saturday nights were the, the active time for the people to come in.
Story_ID: 16757
Speaker 1: Now, you were talking about Saturday night.  What happens on Saturday night?
Speaker 2: Well, let me, let me pin down the geography a little bit more because then the activity will become clear.  As you left the quote "downtown area"--when I say downtown, you're talking about just a distance of a block or two.  And from there to, almost to the railroad, that's where the white people lived.  That, from downtown to the railroad, that was called Front Street, F-R-O-N-T, Front Street.  The equivalent of two blocks or a long block with an alley down the way, and South of Front street, paralleling Front Street was Back Street.  It was Back Street.  Whites lived on Front Street.  blacks lived on Back Street.  And the, the AME [African Methodist Episcopal]  Church was on Back Street.  The Methodist, the AME Methodist Church was on Back Street.  On Front Street, almost halfway down was the, the Baptist Church, but these were Southern Baptists.  They, they were white Baptists.  And about a block before you got to the railroad was another area and blacks lived on Front Street there.  And about halfway from downtown to the railroad was another area, black area, called East Quarters, East Quarters.  But historically, it was called Colored Quarters, Colored Quarters.  That's where the, the school was for blacks.  The white school was in that area--where whites lived.  And they had a high--they had through high school, through high school.  And I--the black school was through 7th grade, only 7th grade.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: Newellton Elementary School, Newellton Elementary School.  And it went first through seventh grades.  And it was, it had about 5 or 6 rooms.  And all of the teachers, initially all of the teachers, including the principal lived somewhere else.  And virtually all of them had gone to Southern University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  And they, but they--during the school year, they lived in Newellton.  And later partly because the, one of the teachers married a local man, and she stayed and so on.  And now, one other thing I want to say about the, the town and where people lived and so on.  There were pock marks here and there.  For example, one of our--the person who--well, ['Uncle' Frederick] 'Feddic's, the Waters lived immediately across from us, next door was a black family--but next to them was a white family.  And that person worked on the highway.  So when I said the Newellton Elevator Company owned most of the houses--not all of them, because they didn't own the house the Waters lived in.  And so on.  Now, Saturday night.  There was--
Speaker 1: You had said, Saturday was market day.  So--
Speaker 2: --Was market day and--But I don't remember whether alcohol was legal or illegal.  I think it was, you could buy it in bottles and, because I remember a number of people, and both blacks and whites would--there were, there were no drinking places, let's put it that way.  And I remember the blacks would congregate in an area, a little bit removed from downtown, but not all the way to the railroad and there would drink and so on.  Toward the railroad was a little sh-, well, I--you can't say a shopping area because there was the barbershop, a food store, the gasoline station was there.  And so blacks used to congregate around there.  And a relative of ours who's named Quigleys owned the food store in the black neighborhood.  And I remember he used to always have a problem because people would come and drink--the black men would come and drink around his place and throw their bottles and get into fights.  So again, Saturday was the busy day.
Speaker 1: Were there any activities that occurred on Saturday that were special to you as a little boy, growing up?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  Oh, I would go to the, to the matinee, the theater.  But we consciously, we were kept out of town on Saturday nights.
Speaker 1: I mean you would, I mean--the white people would keep you out--?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no, no.  I meant my family, my family, my family kept--
Speaker 1: Your family kept you away from town.
Speaker 2: That's right.  First, they were not involved and so those were rowdy types.
Speaker 1: Those Saturday night times with crowds of guys drinking and--
Speaker 2: That's right and so, and occasionally, gambling and so on.
Story_ID: 16758
Speaker 1: Now, your family was very much involved with the church?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Was that the AME Church?
Speaker 2: My father [Andrew Brimmer, Sr.], my--initially the AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Church, but my--there was a, a, a Baptist church, a Baptist church.  Well, first--remember I said there was the Winter Quarters [Plantation] and St. Joseph down the road, 13 miles away.  About 3 or 4 miles south of Newellton [Louisiana] was another church called Shiloh Baptist Church, Shiloh, and that's where my mother [Vellar Davis Brimmer] was very active.  My father started, was active there for a while, but that was my mother's church.  We were sent to Sunday School in that church.  I went until I was 12 years old.  And then I dropped out.  The school teacher complained to my mother--I was called Bud in those days, B-U-D.  And she says, 'Bud, that Bud is--won't behave."  So my mother said, what?  Said, "He disrupts the Sunday school class."  And my mother said "Well,--"
Speaker 1: Did you?
Speaker 2: From her point of view, yes.  I asked questions.  I asked questions.  And the teacher found it difficult to answer those questions.  (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: For instance, what kind of questions did you ask her?
Speaker 2: Well, the--remember this is a Baptist and so the--really, the thing that broke the, that really upset her, well, I said--remember, this is a farming area.  So I knew about life, births, death and I even knew how kids came from and so on by that time. By the time  I was 12, it was common knowledge, in rural areas and so on.  Kids pick up that.  So I said, "What, what do you mean by this immaculate conception?"  And she couldn't answer that, that question.  That was one.  There was one about Christmas, and I wanted to know why Santa Claus was always white.  And well, a number of things, so I got--.  But my father, then there was--remember I told you the Shiloh Baptist Church was about, oh, 2-1/2, 3 miles away, but in Newellton--in fact, about a quarter of a mile beyond where we lived, a group of blacks got together and formed another Baptist church, but a much smaller Baptist church.  And my father was one of the leaders in that.  And he was, in fact, a deacon.  And the, the, the pastor was a traveling Pastor.  He came from Winnsboro [Louisiana] or some place west of us.  But he, he pastured a number of these smaller churches.  So, and that was Sunday activity for the most part.  At one time, they tried to do a, a Wednesday prayer meeting.  That, I remember that because an effort was made to carry out a literacy campaign.  And the church took a great deal of interest, and some of the church members volunteered to teach the illiterate because in the 19 - as late as the 1930s there were still people who couldn't read or write.
Speaker 1: So this is in your father's church, the new church?
Speaker 2: That's right.  Yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so would you say that I guess the church was basically initiated out of a sense of activism (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't--It was never formulated in those--First, it was closer.  That's the first thing.  It was closer.  Also it wasn't the AME Church.  That's where the school teachers went.
Speaker 1: Okay, that was considered a little stuffy or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, something.
Speaker 1: And that's often the case with Methodist (unclear)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous).And also, you see, my father wouldn't have been a deacon in the AME church, you see.
Speaker 1: So it was an opportunity--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to gain some leadership experience.
Speaker 2: And, and also a chance to do good, to be helpful.
Story_ID: 16759
Speaker 1: Now,--let me mention a couple of things.  Remember, I told you about the segregation pattern, residential that some were pock mark here and there.  I mentioned the dry goods store for you (unclear).  And I mentioned Colored Quarters.  Well, the dry goods merchant was a man named Solomon, Solomon.
Speaker 2: Was he Jewish?
Speaker 1: He was Jewish.  He lived in the white area on Front Street.  He had a housekeeper who lived over in the Colored Quarters.  But she was really his common law wife, and she was a mulatto.  They had five kids and they had his name.
Speaker 2: So they all were named Solomon (ph).
Speaker 1: They were named Solomon.  And Louis Solomon (ph)--the, the oldest child was a girl named Missy Solomon (ph.) who had almost blonde hair and green eyes.  The oldest boy was named Louis Solomon.  And him there was another daughter named Thelma. (?)  Well, Louis Solomon married my sister, Josie (sp).  And she was just ahead of me.  And my older brother, whose name is George Hamilton, remember he was by my mother's [Vellar Davis Brimmer] first husband.  George Hamilton, my brother, married Thelma Solomon.  You see, so there were two marriages, of course, in that.  Everybody knew that--who they were, what their names were.  But she would go home at night to her house, but not only did--I've forgotten, I think his name is Isaiah or something like that, Solomon.  But he provided for them.
Speaker 2: But he had to live in a separate place?
Speaker 1: He--he lived--but that's where--she really was the one.  She went to work in his house and clearly stayed there from time to time, but--I mentioned that because while that was the most, I wouldn't say blatant, but most clearly public case, there were other cases.  And some are very, very hard to explain.  I mentioned a man named Quigleys (ph.) who owned a grocery store, John Quigley.  Quigley was always--we would--they were always cousins.  My older brother worked in the store as a boy.  I worked in the store as a boy.  My younger brother, James, who was behind me by two, worked in the store.  And the Quigleys always said, we look--and especially, his wife, Ruby Quigleys.  Ruby always made certain we would in, that we always shopped there and so on.  Everybody knew that Ruby Quigleys, who was also a mulatto, that her, her father was John Cammack.  John Commack was a white man from over near Port Gibson on the Mississippi side of the river, not too distant from us.  My father [Andrew Brimmer Sr.] had an older sister, and his, his oldest brother was, was named Charlie Brimmer.  He was a farmer down near that church, Shiloh Church.  And he owned his land.  But after him there was an older sister.  My father had an older sister called Tootie  (ph).  We always--her, her real name was Liza Ann (ph.), Liza Ann.  She was quite light, quite light.  My father was lighter than I am, not quite as light as you, but, but lighter.  And we always said, "That's the Indian in him." My mother was very dark.  So Aunt Tootie was even lighter than my father.  And they always said, "Oh, the Indian shows up in Aunt Tootie even more."  And (unclear) my younger sister, who's two years younger than I am, was also quite light.  And they said, "That's the Indian showing up"  Do you know that it was only in 1996 that I learned that Aunt Tootie was Ruby Quigley's sister, that they both had the same [white] father. That--.  And remember now, she was born after my oldest uncle and before my father.  So there was clearly some extramarital things.  So there were, there was, I should--won't say intermarriage, although--
Speaker 2: But relationships.
Speaker 1: Relationships.
Speaker 2: Things that were complicated (unclear).
Speaker 1: Well, then they were complicated.
Speaker 2: They didn't strict--stick to the line.
Speaker 1: They did not.  That's right, they didn't.
Story_ID: 16760
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about school, now--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --now, you were, you went to Newellton--
Speaker 2: Newellton Elementary School.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Right, and were you a pretty good student?
Speaker 2: Oh, my, yes, yes.  Remember, I had a head start because in my family, the older children taught the younger children.  And above all, the father, our father [Andrew Brimmer, Sr.] was very helpful in guiding us.  So I learned to read and write and, they'd say, reading, writing and figuring.  There was no kindergarten.  You went to school in first grade.  And the school year was 8 months rather than 9 months--8-1/2 months rather than 9-1/2 or 10.  So the white kids started school in September, shortly after Labor Day.  The black kids started school in late September, early October.  Why?  So they could pick the cotton.  That was the explanation given.  The--as I said, the school went from first grade through 7th grade.  The--and all my sisters and brothers went there ahead of me and so on.  So we--by the time we got there--I got there, the teachers knew that I was, the teachers knew that I could read before I got there because, from time to time, when there were school events like the--and there were school plays and, and so on--and May Day ceremonies, picnics and so, and we would go because--What kind of--?
Speaker 1: Well, I just wanted to ask you what your favorite subjects were in school?
Speaker 2: Well, arithmetic and geography.  And I was good in both from the, in, from the very beginning.  A couple of things stand out which I remember and taught me some lessons.  I would always get 100 percent or, being small classes, but I was always at the top of the class.  And I was always teased by the other kids, you know, "teacher's pet" and so on.  So one day, I decided, the geography class.  And I was in the fifth grade.  And so I decided I'm going to get 19--95 [per cent], 19 questions.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) You weren't gonna get a hundred this time.
Speaker 2: Because I knew no one else was going to even come close.  And so the teacher brought back the papers.  And she said, "Bud, you must pay more attention to, to your work and answer"--she said, "You missed a question.  And it was just carelessness because you missed Question Number 14 and you couldn't have--you had to know the answer because you, you answered it basically in Question 5.  So just pay more attention." And so I decided never again would I concede anything to anybody.  Arithmetic, I learned to figure very early.  I learned my multiplication tables, must have been by the 3rd grade and so on.  So I--those are my favorite subjects.
Speaker 1: That's what I would figure actually.  But, you know, you never know, but you would kind of guess those might be your favorite subjects.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 16761
Speaker 1: Did you have--were there any teachers that were particularly helpful to you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.  The geography teacher (laughter).  She taught me to be careful and the principal taught mathematics and arithmetic.  So he was very, very, very helpful.
Speaker 1: You said your teachers were from Southern University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana]. They went to school at Southern?
Speaker 2: They, they--I believe there were five or six teachers in that school.  I know four of them went to Southern because my--I had several relatives who went to Southern and knew them.  I know one went to Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] and I also remember that one of them, Mrs. Chatman (ph.), she's the one who married the local barber.  She was working on a master's degree.  And so she would take courses at Southern during the summer.  So--that was the school, now, the other thing about that is that students were bused in from the area, rural areas--
Speaker 1: Surrounding countryside.
Speaker 2: Surrounding country--whites and blacks were bussed in, to the schools.
Speaker 1: But only the blacks went to Newellton?
Speaker 2: Newellton Elementary School.  The white kids, you remember the white school was a integr--that went from first grade through twelfth.  And so the white students all went there.  Now, the high school was--for blacks--
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of that?
Speaker 2: That was Tensas Parish Training School.  Tensas, T-E-N-S-A-S, Tensas Parish Training School.  TPTS.  It was in St. Joseph, Louisiana.  St. Joseph was the county seat, thirteen miles away.  And so we rode the school bus.  And that went through 11 grades, eight through eleven.  It had--and I started there in 1940, at which time it had--I remember the principal was E.V. Jones, E. V. Jones, who had a Master's Degree from the Southern University.  His field of interest and concentration was history.  So we had--and, of course, history was a big subject.  He taught history and handled administration, and he was the substitute teacher for mathematics.
Story_ID: 16762
Speaker 1: Yeah, what did you really, what activities did you engage in, in high school.
Speaker 2: Well, let, let me say what, this, this was--. Notice the name of this high school.  It was Tensas Parish Training School [St. Joseph, Louisiana].  So it was not a pure academic high school.  It was not a pure vocational high school.  It was a mixture of the two.  And the, and that was the curriculum in Louisiana at the time for blacks.  So, the--in addition to fulfilling you know, so many credit hours to graduating from high school in subjects like history, English, mathematics.  When I started there they had biology.  They didn't have chemistry, but they had biology.  And that was probably because of the availability of teachers to teach.  The--by the time I graduated, and, in fact, by 1942 thereabouts, the--when I was there, they had--I think they probably had 9 or 10 teachers in that high school.  And about half of them were men when I was there, when I went there.  By the time I graduated in June 1944, they had about five or six teachers and--only two of which were men.  And so they had dropped biology.  The--when I was there, when I went, they had geometry and--algebra and geometry.  They didn't have calculus, but by the time I graduated, they had only Algebra I, not Algebra II and no geolo--no, no geometry.
Speaker 1: Now, did you take all the higher math you could?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, yes, everything I, I could.  Took all the English I could.  And that teacher, that was a favorite teacher, I want to mention her.  Her name was Anderson.  And, in fact, I heard her name just a couple of weeks ago, two weeks ago today, last night, yeah, today is Thursday, because I was down at Southern University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana] recently and, and some--a couple of people came from Newellton [Louisiana] down to Southern while I was there to--brought me greetings.  And someone mentioned Mrs. Anderson.  She, she is the teacher who really taught me English.  And I'd learned something, but I mean real grammar and composition and--metrics for poetry and so on.  She was the--she introduced me and mind the others to the English classics, Shakespeare and, and so on.  No Greek or Roman class-, classics.  And we had no foreign language, none, none.  None. No foreign language.  Now, you asked me what were my favorites.  History, English, mathematics.
Speaker 1: And I also want to know what kind of--
Speaker 2: And one other thing, the vocational training.  We had an opportunity for carpentry, electricity.  The girls had to take Home Economics, including what was then called "mess assignments."  They had to actually learn to cook in a can and so on.  That was the, the, the school and the curriculum and the transportation, which I missed.  And that was something because you paid--the students had to pay.  I think it was something like, I think it was fifty cents a week to ride the school bus five days.  By the time I graduated it was up to a dollar.  And so with two or three kids--and so my father had to struggle to do all of that.  That's high school.
Speaker 1: Did you--were you involved with sports or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Oh, again, when I went there, they had a basketball team.  And they even played other schools, other high schools around.  But by the time I graduated, that had been dropped because the boys were all gone.  I was the only boy in my class.  When I graduated, there were 12 of us, 11 girls and 1 boy.  They either, either been drafted or dropped out or what not.  So we had no organized athletic program.  I wouldn't have been eligible the first year or so anyway.  But by the time I was--I was looking forward to participating at, at least not the quote varsity team , but the, the scrub team when I was in the 9th grade.  By the time I got into the 9th grade, it was gone.  And so I had no, no sports activity.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when, when you graduated, did you graduate with honors or it seemed like you were a good student?
Speaker 2: We had no honors program.  I graduated at the top of the class.
Story_ID: 16763
Speaker 1: What were your thoughts then when you graduated?  Did you think--I know you probably wanted to go to college, but did you--
Speaker 2: Oh, I was planning to, planning to, planning to.  I had relatives who had gone--the trek was to Southern University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  Some went, went to Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana].  But, you see, it was--by the time I was halfway through high school, the lay of the land had changed completely.  The war was--World War II had started--the U.S. had gotten into it.  So it was a question--
Speaker 1: This was 1944, right?
Speaker 2: I graduated in June 1944.  But it was, it was never a question of whether one would stay in Newellton, stay in Louisiana in Newellton after high school.  It was a question where would you go, when would you go and where would you go.  I had anticipated that I would go to Southern University.  That was the path.  That was where people were going, my teachers had gone there, and that's what we were looking forward to. That was the path.  But something happened.  First, as early as 1933, '34 [1934], some of my relatives had started moving west. The boll weevil killed off the crops.  So some of my relatives had--well, early as World War I, some had gone to Chicago [Illinois].  Som had gone--I remember one uncle went to Sandusky, Ohio.  That's the first time I'd heard of that--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) -Right near Cleveland--
Speaker 2: --and--to work in the factories.  Others had gone to Chicago to work in the factories.  I had a number of relatives went to Chicago.  And some went to, as I said, I was always struck, Sandusky, Ohio.  And that always seemed like a--but one cousin, his name was Snowden (ph), the Snowdens and lived, lived right next door to us to the left, had gone to Nevada.  He was a heavy equipment operator, Caterpillar, the bulldozer.  He ended up working for a contractor who spent of his, did most of his work on the highways and so on, roads.  And for a black man to have an opportunity to be a heavy equipment operator in those days was rare.  This contractor got a job on what was then called the Boulder dam and he took his crew with him.  And so that cousin went to Nevada.  Of course, he, the, the headquarters for the dam was Henderson on the Nevada side.  But he couldn't live in Henderson because Henderson was not only segregated but prohibited, was closed to blacks.  So he, Steve, Steve Snowden, once he got his family there, they had to live in Las Vegas [Nevada].  So he lived in Las Vegas and drove to work down at the damn.  In Las Vegas, blacks lived in a segregated neighborhood, but they could live in the city.  That was the first of the Brimmer clan, Brimmer, Stevenson, Solomon clan, to move west.
Story_ID: 16764
Speaker 1: Now, what happened in 1942?  Louis Solomon [Brimmer's brother-in-law, the son of a white Jewish man and a mulatto woman], remember I told you that--that the, that his father [Isaac Solomon] owned the store?  Louis Solomon was a student at Southern University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  Louis Solomon was classified 4F so he was not drafted.  He, he was studying engineering at Southern.  But in March 1942--remember the attack on Pearl Harbor was December 7, 1941--a Navy recruiter looking, came looking for civilian workers to go to Bremerton, Washington across from Seattle [Washington].  Bremerton, Washington was the site of the Puget Sound Naval Ship Yard.  A number of the ships damaged at Pearl Harbor were brought to Bremerton, Washington, Puget Sound Naval Ship Yard for repairs.  And this Navy recruiter was looking for employees to work in the Bremerton Navy Yard.  Louis Solomon who had reddish blonde hair, green eyes went down for the interview--and, because the notices were that they were recruiting. Louis is absolutely certain that they assumed he was white. Louis dropped out of Southern, went to work in the Bremerton Navy Yard, Puget Sound Naval Ship Yard as an electrician--in March of 1942.  In May 1942, my sister [Josie] and their two kids joined him.  So now, the Solomons are anchored in Bremerton, Washington.  I had a sister who had gone west to San Francisco.  So when I approached graduation, now it's this, the late winter in 1944.  My sister invited me to come to San Francisco and join her.  Of course, I'm going to be drafted in September. I'm at-- I will turn 18 in September 1944.  And--so Louis Solomon wrote me and said, "Look, why don't you join us?  And I'll send you a ticket."  He said, "I've already spoken to the supervisor, head of electrical shop about you."  And now at Tensas Parish Training School [Saint Joseph, Louisiana], I had taken the electricity option.  In fact, I took both.  I took the carpentry one year and electricity the next year.  So I had some exposure.  So he said, "Why don't you come and stay with us and you'll register here and you'll eventually be drafted, but the meantime, you could have a job with us."  That's what happened.  I opted to go to--Bremerton, Washington.  And I arrived there in July.  I graduated from high school June, 1944.  And I was in Washington state in July, probably July 10 or thereabout, I arrived in Washington, you see.  Louis had told me, Louis Solomon told me, "If you arrive on Tuesday, you can have a job on a Thursday."  That's exactly what happened.  I arrived on a Tuesday, and he told me, "I've already set up--you have an appointment on Thursday with the supervisor."  That's what I did.  I was told to show up around 9:30, 10:00 o'clock, which I did; went and--went to the--I had--they had arranged for me to have a pass to go directly to the electrical shop supervisor's office.  He said, "Look, Louis has told me about you and I'm delighted to meet you.  You can have a job.  We'll give you a job as an electrician's helper."  And I'm 17 years old.  So he said, "Look, here is a, a chit, take it to the personnel office.  They will put you on the payroll.  They'll give you a meal ticket,"  he said, "so you could have lunch."  And said, "I suggest you show up tomorrow at 8:00 o'clock."  That's exactly what happened.
Story_ID: 16765
Speaker 1: But in September [1944] I registered [for the draft], but I just assumed that I wouldn't be drafted the very next day, so I enrolled in what was called Bremerton Evening School.  It later became Olympic Community College.  So I took two courses each term, it was a semester system.  So in the, the fall semester, I took English.  I was going to be a journalist.  Let me, let me say that.  I decided, partly because of [teacher] Mrs. Anderson's influence, and she'd encouraged me because I could read and write, already I could write better than most people around.  So I took a course in English, and I took a course in sovereign government, an "Introduction to Government" or something like that.  Really, political science, government and so.  And what would happen is, rather than showing up [at work] at 8:00 o'clock, I would show up at 7:30 and rather than 45 minutes for lunch, I had a half an hour.  And rather than waiting till 5:00 o'clock, I would leave at 4:30 and go to school.  In the spring term, I took another course, the second course in English, which is now main---more composition and literature, and a course called "International Relations."
Speaker 2: Okay, now, I don't want you to give us every detail.  But some of these details are good and--but you, basically, you majored in English in College?
Speaker 1: No, no, no--
Speaker 2: So you changed?
Speaker 1: I started.
Speaker 2: You started with English.
Speaker 1: In, in English.  I started, I started with Journalism.
Story_ID: 16766
Speaker 1: I got drafted May 3, 1945 at Fort Lewis, Washington.  The war ended [in Europe] May 8, 1945.
Speaker 2: You had 5 days of--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: (unclear) before the War ended.
Speaker 1: That's right.  I had volunteered--
Speaker 2: You (unclear) stayed in.  You stayed in for a--
Speaker 1: Well, no, I was drafted, you know.  You couldn't just walk out (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, right.  So you had--you were drafted for a period of time, about 2 years.
Speaker 1: Well, I served for 18 months.  But, but it was indefinite service during World War II.  No, no, terms.  It was indefinite service.  It was called "the duration." (laughter)  I had--I tried to join the Air Force.  Everybody, we'd all learned, knew about the Tuskegee Airmen.  Remember it was a segregated Army in (unclear) so I tried to join.  I was going to volunteer.  I was going to enlist before I was drafted.  But the recruitment officer said, "Look, there's no chance.  If you volunteer now, there's no chance for you to get through, get into the Air Force,"--the Army Air Corps, it was called.  "The Tuskegee enlistments of the Tuskegee Airmen, that's all closed now."  So I said, okay, so when I was drafted, I volunteered for--to be a paratrooper.  And the, the procedures then were that you would go for Basic Infantry Training. And then you would go for advanced infantry training, and then you would go to jump school.  [Army] "Airborne" it was called.  But a memorable event happened on the way.  I was at Fort Lewis, Washington, having been drafted, inducted May 3, 1945.  Oh, maybe a week later, there was a shape up, we were all told that we would be sent to Camp Roberts, California for infantry training.  And we were all loaded up on trucks and we were down at the train station.  And then this jeep came speeding down the roadway and out jumped a, a second lieutenant and a sergeant.  "Private Brimmer, Private Brimmer!"  "Yes."  "Get your, get your stuff.  You're coming with us."  They pulled me out.  What happened?  Blacks were not being sent--and I was the only black in my group--to Camp Roberts.  I was taken back to the barracks and the sergeant explained to me what happened.  The clerks in the induction center--remember this is Fort Lewis, Washington--filled out the induction forms ahead of time.  And for race, they just wrote, checked white, checked white.  They had not known, they had not consciously, in terms of the process, of induction--So I was taken--
Speaker 2: They didn't think anybody from Washington was going to be black, right?
Speaker 1: Right.  They assumed everybody being inducted through Fort Lewis, Washington was, was white, and even Japanese were not classified in that--by that late, the Japanese, you know, they had been take, taken in.  But basically, 99 percent of the troopers coming in, being inducted at Fort Lewis were white. And so a lazy sergeant, you know, a lazy clerk,--it's understandable.  But I was taken off, given separate orders and I was sent to Fort McClellan, Alabama where I had basic infantry training, but by the time I finished that, it was late August.  So the war was over.  Japan surrendered on September 2nd.  The Army cancelled all its schedules for paratrooper training, even for advanced infantry training, which I would have gone from Fort McClellan, Alabama to Fort Benning, Georgia.  Instead, I was put back on the train and sent back to, to the West.  I ended up in Fort Ord, California--
Speaker 2: For Ord, Calif--
Speaker 1: --where I was in a infantry training unit but we were being trained as military policemen.  We were trained in subduing riots, pacifying villages and put on a ship, heading for Japan.
Story_ID: 16767
Speaker 1: But we were diverted to Hawaii [having been originally scheduled to go to Japan as occupation forces].  So I arrived in Hawaii on December 7, 1945, four years to the day [from the start of the war for the U.S.].  Years later, I learned why I didn't go to Japan.  I learned from President [Harry] Truman's memoirs about the decision he made.  He said, in November 1945, he was having a, an argument with General [Douglas] MacArthur about how Japan would be garrisoned.  He said MacArthur wanted to have had seasoned troops, veterans, to serve as--in the occupation in Japan.  Truman said, he wanted to bring the veterans home.  Many of them had been out 2 and 3 years and more in the Pacific.  So he said, MacArthur finally persuaded in November, late November to--so that MacArthur could keep the veterans and would not send green troops.  I was a green trooper.  And so I was--I spent 8--I spent 10 months in, in Hawaii.  But I was shifted from the infantry to the ordinance corps (unclear), but it was the Army's ammunition corps.  Blacks didn't handle the guns.  They handled the ammunition.  So we, we were really laborers.  Our task was to sort out--Hawaii was a huge ammunition dump, storage bin.  So we would take the ammunition out and we would--of artillery shells, not the artillery, artillery shells, mortars, and so on, no bombs--that was for the Air Force.  We would take the ammunition out, sort it--that was fit, could be still used we put back into the, in the, in the bunker.  The unfit we piled up with the (unclear) and once a week the Army transportation, Quartermaster with, with the trucks.  And we would pile the unfit ammunition on these trucks, like a flatbed trailer trucks.  They would take them down to Barber's Point, just west of Honolulu and put it on barges.  And they'd take them out to sea and dump it.  Now, during World War II, you--soldiers were discharged depending upon the number of points they had.  They got one point a month for service in the U.S.  Two points a month for service overseas.  Hawaii was classified as overseas.  So for each of my months of service in Hawaii, I got 2 points.  So as of November 30, 1946, I had 30 points, and I was eligible to be discharged.  So I sailed from Honolulu in very early October because I landed in Oakland Army Base October 6, 1946, but with leave and furlough, I was out of the Army at November 30.
Story_ID: 16768
Speaker 1: I enrolled in the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] around the 3rd or 4th of January, 1947.  The University of Washington in those days had a quarter system.  And so I entered in winter quarter.  My intent was to major in journalism.  But I had deficiencies.  Remember, I had not had any foreign language.  The University of Washington had a foreign language requirement.  But I--so I took Spanish the, the first quarter to make up. I had not had any mathematics beyond algebra so I took geom-, geometry.  So while enrolling for the classes as a freshman, I had to make up some deficiencies from high school.  But I accelerated.  I did get credit--remember I had gone to Bremerton Evening School.  So I got credit for--I had only needed three quarters of English for the program I was in.  But I took only one quarter of English because I did so well and given--and I was able to do well because of the, the enrollment I'd had in Bremerton Evening School in English, so I was exempt from that.  I accelerated, and I did my four years in three years.  And, but journalism, pre-journalism required students to take survey courses.  English, history and so on.  One of the required courses I took was Introduction to Economics.  I found it fascinating.  I had a teacher who made it come alive--.  But at the University of Washington at the time, if you were going to school under the GI Bill, before you could switch majors, you had to go through counseling and guid-, guidance.  And so I was--I went to the Counseling Guidance Center, digression-- I learned later that many of the counselors were people doing their PhD's in psychology and such.  But they laid out--they said, "Look, you say you want to switch to Economics,' said, "But you ought to look broadly."  Said,--and they gave me a battery of exams, and said "You can do well in, in anything you want to do."
Speaker 2: What was it about economics, you know?  I've talked to people that, very few, but there are some people who get excited about economics (unclear)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Well, I--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) [Thorstein] Veblen and the people like that
Speaker 1: Well, no, it didn't start with Veblen for me.  It started with Hank Betchel, the teacher and the subject matter.
Speaker 2: How do you spell his last name?
Speaker 1: B-E-T-C-H-E-L, Betchel, Henry Betchel, B-E-T-C-H-E-L, Henry Betchel.  Hank, at the time, as an associate professor of economics.  But the key thing is that economics at the time, when I started, was in the College of Economics and Business.  I want to stress that, but effective July 1, 1948, the economics department withdrew from the College of Business and joined the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at the University of Washington.  The new Department of Economics had 17 faculty members.  Seventeen faculty members, about 40, 45 graduate students and 75 to 80 undergraduates.  So that meant that I had almost individual tutorials. They were glad to see us.  Again, why did Hank make it so interesting?  Remember, this is 1948, '47, '48.  And Hank had been caught up in the left-wing politics of the 1930s.  Hank had been a Communist.  And Hank had come from east of the mountains from Seattle--he had gone, been a high school teacher.  He had taught in a, in a four-year teachers' college.  He'd gone to a four-year teachers' college.  But during the war, well, what happened was, Hank was a genuine card-carrying, Communist and active; believed in all of the, the doctrine.  And he saw the New Deal as the first stages of socialism.  And Hank told me that he had a, got a real shock when the Hitler-Stalin pact was formed [1939], and that he was completely disillusioned.  And he said he, he'd already started questioning Marxism (unclear) because of the Stalin purges in '37 [1937], '38 [1938].  Well, Hank then became a proselytizer for New Deal policies.  The Great Depression devastated Hank, and he said that this is the worst scourge to ever--that economics is the way to help prevent that.  And also at, at about that time, the great Keynesian system was coming right--John Maynard Keynes' work had come out in 1935 and was just filtering into the schools in the--after the war.  So I--switched to economics, despite the fact that the lawyers wanted me to major in Law, geology wanted me to--I chose economics.  And so when I decided to switch, I goo-, had good counseling.  I was told, look that--since I'm switching into economics and I switched just as a junior, the beginning of my junior year equivalent; that I should stay at the University of Washington to do an MA as well--after I do my BA.  And then go to get a Ph.D. at Berkeley.  So I knew the day I switched to Economics that ultimately, I was going to go to Berkeley , University of California at Berkeley, to get a Ph.D.  I did well by the--I switched in July of 1948.  And January of 1949, I became an Undergraduate Reader, this--an Undergraduate Assistant, which meant I read the blue books for the freshman economics courses.  I got my BA in March 1950, but already, late '49, late '49 [1949], I was auditing graduate courses.  I already had a fellowship.  So I was on that path.
Story_ID: 16769
Speaker 1: My first break came in 1949.  Remember, I'm still an undergraduate [at the University of Washington, Seattle], but I'm being treated like a graduate student.  I'm a research assistant.  So there was a university speaker named Robert C. Weaver.  Bob Weaver came to the University--
Speaker 2: Now, Robert C. Weaver would later become the Secretary--
Speaker 1: Secretary of [Department of] HUD [Housing and Urban Development].  Yes.
Speaker 2: HUD, right, later on (unclear).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous). And so by that time, I was working closer with a man named Ben Gillingham.  And Ben, again, was just the opposite of Hank.  Ben was a liberal, but never a Communist, but interested in questions of equality and so on.  So he invited me to the lecture which Bob Weaver gave.  At the time, Weaver was with the Housing Authority Anti-Discrimination Commission or something in New York, and had just become director, an opportunity of fellowships for the John Hay Whitney Foundation.  And that was a program designed to encourage black professionals, people to go into, to--the applied sci, sciences, no law school  but--. So at the--after the lecture, I went to the reception.  And I was introduced to Bob Weaver and told him what I was interested in, and told him I was going to do a, a master's thesis.  You know, I'm, I'm going to finish my B.A. in March.  And I was going to later work on, on--economic development.  But I was also intrigued by the questions of, of economic equality.  So Bob encouraged me to apply for a John Hay Whitney Fellowship, which I did in the late winter, early spring of 1950.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But--and I got it.  And--But--I'd also applied for--for an internship in the federal government.  And that came through the National Inter, Intercollegiate Council [National Intercollegiate Council].  That was the National, YM-YWCA [Young Men's Christian Association/Young Women's Christian Association].  And I got that fellowship.  So I came to Washington the summer of 1950 and worked in the foreign aid agency.  Then it was called the Economic Cooperation Administration [set up to administer the Marshall Plan].  That's what I--where I worked during the day.  I participated in the Students In Government seminar, 4 nights a week.  And there I met, for the first time I, that's where I met Hubert Humphrey, John [Jackson] Sparkman from Alabama, Senator [Robert A.] Taft, Paul Douglas, Dean Rusk-- because the program--Jo Abrams (ph) ran the program.  And she invited all these people to come.  So we had a seminar Monday through Thursday.  But during my--during the day, I worked as a research assistant for an economist named Phillip S. Brown.  Phil Brown had gone to Harvard College.  And he had st-, done the Ph.D. in Applied Economics, which was a joint program with the economics part of the [Harvard] Business School.  So one day at lunch, Phil said to me--because I said, you know, "I'm going to finish my master's degree, which I'd just started, which I'd get in June 1951.  And then I'll go to [University of California at] Berkeley for a Ph.D."  So Phil said, "Did you ever think of going to Harvard?"  And I said, "No, no one has ever mentioned that to me."  I mentioned the programs at the University of Washington tied into Berkeley and so on.  And so he said, "I think you would enjoy Harvard, and I think you would do well.  And I know they'll be glad to see you."  So he said, "Look, I, I'll--" I said, "Well that's interesting."  He said, "I'll write Ed [Edward S.] Mason."  Ed Mason was then a professor of economics, chairman of the Economics Department at Harvard and Dean of the Littauer School [for Public Administration], grad--which, of course, later became the Kennedy School [of Government].  So Phil Brown wrote to Ed Mason and told him about me.  And Ed Mason wrote Phil back saying, that, that I was quite promising.  I, that I should apply, which I did.

Speaker 1: I had also applied for a Fulbright Grant because I mentioned to you that I was interested in economic development and trade Well, I was particularly interested in the income generation side of economic development.  And I wanted to apply for a Fulbright Grant for two years.  The first year I wanted to go to Cambridge [University]--in England.  A man named [Sir] Richard Stone was the leading expert on the estimation of national income from the statistic side.  He was a statistician.  So I wanted to go to England to study for a year on national income theory and estimation.  And then I wanted to go to India to apply it.  The, the leading expert on the national income of developing countries was a man named  V.K.R.V. Rau.  He had done his Ph.D. at Cambridge there with [John Maynard] Keynes, but he at that point was director of the Delhi School of Economics.  So--accident? Fort--good fortune?  One day in the Spring of 1951, I was visiting with Professor Hughes, a professor of History.  He was the University's Coordinator for Foreign Studies, for foreign study.  And so I was talking with--went over to see Professor Hughes to see if he had any feeling about the prospects for when they'd get decisions on.  And he said, "Well, let--we ought to hear something soon.  In fact, today there is someone coming to see me today."  He said, "Might be here by now."  We left and went from his office.  I went to his, his waiting room.  And there was a man from Washington, D.C.  He was introduced to me.  He was the Director of the Division of Exchange of Persons in the State Department.  And he, he said, "Oh, Brimmer, I recognize your name.  In fact, you are one of three people, three applicants who want to go to England to work on and study national income.  Now," he said, "There is a professor, and he was one of the midwest universities, oh, somewhere in Ohio, Indiana or some place.  He said, he did his Ph.D. in 1938 and he was one of Keynes' students.  And he now wants to--and his book was published in, in 1940, and he wants to go to England to, to update and refresh.  So he's clearly a strong candidate.  He wants a faculty Fulbright Grant.  He said "There is another student and he was from one of the New England colleges, who had done his Ph.D. all except the dissertation."  And he said, "He wants to go to England and he wants to go to the London School of Economics, said, but he's clearly ahead of you.  He's right at the dissertation stage."  And he said, "And there's you."  And he said, and, and you, you want England to be your first stop and you want India to be the second stop.  He said, It'll be very hard for the three of you to, to win grants to go to England so why don't you go directly to India?  Well, I'm a country boy from Seattle, but I'm not that dumb.  So I quickly switched my application and I got the Fulbright Grant.  And that's how I got to India.
Story_ID: 16771
Speaker 1: And so I spent 19--from July 1951 to April 1952 as a Fulbright student in India. I was there for an academic year, split my time between the Delhi School of Economics and the University of Bombay.  And in the meantime, I'd gotten admitted to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] with a fellowship.  I'd gotten admitted to [University of California at] Berkeley with a fellowship.  So I wrote to Harvard in the spring of 1951, saying, "Look, I'm glad to be admitted.  I got a chance to go to India on a Fulbright.  Will you save my fellowship?  I did the same thing at Berkley.  I got an immediate answer back from both of them, almost identical.  "We do not save fellowships, apply next year."  That's what I did.  In the spring of 1952, I was readmitted to both with fellowships, and I went to Harvard.  End of that phase.
Speaker 2: Now, in India when you went to India, [Jawaharlal] Nehru was a leader--
Speaker 1: Was Prime Minister.
Speaker 2: Nehru, he was the Prime Minister, and India was--
Speaker 1: An independent, had gotten its independence in August 1947.
Speaker 2: Right, so it was newly independent nation basically--
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: --trying to basically--with a threatening neighbor of China--
Speaker 1: Well, not in those days.  Not in those days.  Remember this is 1951, '52.  Remember the Chinese were just consolidating, the, the Chinese Communists were just consolidating--
Speaker 2: That's right, okay.
Speaker 1: --and they, they had chased the Nationalists over to Taiwan.  And, in fact, that India-China relationship is one of the factors that led to my switching from Delhi to Bombay, the University of--Bombay.  In those days, in India, for Fulbrighters, you had to have a supervisor.  And my supervisor was V.K. R.V. Rau who had written a booklet on British, National Income of British India at the Delhi School of Economics.  So when I showed up, I went to see him.  He said, "Oh, I'm glad you're here.  I have--" He had gotten me a cubicle, which is, you know, a rare thing for a student, a graduate to have that little cubicle in, in the school.  And he got me a room in the dorms.  He said, "Now, I've worked out a reading list for you--I'm going to--" and then he introduced K.N. Raj, Assistant Director of the School who had done his Ph.D. in England at Oxford [University].  And he said, now, Raj will work with you.  I'm going to have to go to Paris [France].  He--Rau was advisor to Nehru, economic advisor to Nehru, although they had the academic appointment--but he, he said, the prime minister asked me to represent India at some economic conference or something in Paris, and I'll be gone for a week.  And work on the reading list and I will, when I get back, we can have another tutorial.  He was gone, not for a week, but for almost two and a half weeks.  When he got back, it took me almost a week to see him.  And he said, "Oh, Raj tells me you're doing fine.  I've seen the--a couple of papers you wrote."  And I said, "Thank you very much."  And he said, "Now, I'm going to have to go to China.  The Prime Minister is asking me to go to China."  So he was gone, this time, he was gone for almost 3 weeks.  And the same story when I got--, you know, so I decided this isn't going to work.  So my fallback, because I had--I decided to work on industrial organization and financing.  And I had met an economist who was doing his Ph.D. at Berkeley on the flight over to India, a man named Emmet Rice.  And, in fact, Emmet and I met accidentally--not accidentally, I should say by design of Pan American [Airlines].  (Laughter).  We flew--in those days, you couldn't go non-stop to England.  So you took the Pan American flight and you had to stop in either Goose Bay, Labrador or--anyway, you had to stop in Canada.  And we were almost halfway, but developed engine trouble.  So we had to turn around and go back to New York.  And it just so happened that Emmet and I ended up rooming together.  And so I said, "Emmet, are we seeing the old pattern here or--?" Because Emmet was traveling with his friend and colleague from Berkeley named Dale Riepe, who was white.  Emmet was black.  Emmet said, "Oh, Andy, they knew we were economists.  That's why they put us together (laughter)."  Well, Emmet had gone on to Bombay.  He was doing his dissertation at Berkeley on power and economic development, (unclear) when you're working on dams and so on and using the Indian case as a case study.  So I wrote to Emmet and said, "Would, would you ask Professor [C.N.] Vakil who is head of the School of Economic Sociology at the University of Bombay whether I can come and study with him?"  It came back and said, yes.  That's how I shifted to, to Bombay in the, in my subject matter.  But after that was over, I came back and went to Harvard.
Story_ID: 16772
Speaker 1: Now, you're at Harvard now?
Speaker 2: Now--I left for Harvard the day after my birthday.  My birthday is September 20--September 13th.  And so September 14th [1952], I left by train from Seattle headed for Boston [Massachusetts].  And traveling with me was one of my friends and former classmates at the University of Washington when I went to India.  In, in fact, when I went back to the University of Washington to start my M.A., he went to Stanford [University].  So he had been at Stanford two years.  And so he was going to Harvard [University] to spend a year at, at Harvard--
Speaker 1: (Videographer:) Hold on one second.  That jet's a little loud.  We should start that sentence all over again.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Two of us were traveling from Seattle to Boston, going to Harvard.  On the train, we had--Paul Wells was my friend's name.  He had a copy of a journal published at Harvard called The Review of Economics and Statistics.  In that journal was the first post-war input-output table, which Wassily Leontief had developed.  He later got a Nobel Prize and that was one of the contributions.  So we worked.  We read the tables, a mixture of economic theory, of mathematics and statistics.  And so we spent--we had 4 or 5 days on the train, 4-1/2 days or something so we really had time to work at it.  And were discussing and teaching each other and so on.  But at Harvard, just before the classes started, the Economics Department had a reception for incoming graduate students at the top of Littauer [School for Public Administration].  And at the time, there were about 40 incoming Ph.D. students at Harvard.  At the reception were all the greats, Leontief, [Alvin H.] Hansen, [John Kenneth] Galbraith, [Edward H.] Chamberlin. They, they were all there.  So I found myself standing next to Leontief.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: Lea-, L--Leontief L-E-O-N-T-I-E-F, Wassily Leontief, a Russian who trained in Germany and had been in the U.S. since the early '30s [1930s] by that time.  And I'll give you his exact name and (unclear).  So I said, "Professor Leontief, on the train coming east we read your latest article."  He said, "Yes."  I said, but, I said, "but there was one or two steps I didn't get."  And he said, "What are they?"  And I described, I couldn't move from the--in the matrix I got over to the right, the final "bill of goods" it's called.  And I said, and I could invert the matrix and get the coefficient, but I just couldn't get that final step.  He said, that's because you read the short form.  He said, I published the short form in the article to save space.  I didn't fill in all of the blanks, the columns and the cells, he said, but let me show you.  So he got a piece of paper, and sat on the floor and did all the mathematics, did the estimated statistics, inverted and he say, "So, so you read the short form.  This is the expanded form."  He said, "You're interested in this?"  I said, "Well, yes."  And he said, "Want to come and work for me?"  I said, "Of course."  He had underway the Harvard Research Project in which he was further amplifying his input-output system, and above all, he was now producing, trying to produce a regional input-output system.  So that meant for the whole country, he was working on four major regions.  He said,--I said, yes.  He said, you can come.  I, you can be a research assistant.  Come and be a research assistant on the project.  He called over one of the other professors, Jim [James S.] Duesenberry.  Jim was then an associate professor in economics, but with tenure, and working on the project.  So he said, "Jim, come over.  Andy Brimmer is going to come and work for us, work with us on the project." And he said, "You report to Jim." Three or--two or three days later, I showed up and reported to Jim.  And I said, "Jim, I'm here, ready to start work."  He said, "Fine.  That's your desk."  I said, I was delighted.  "What are those boxes?"  He said, "That's your work."  Those boxes were reams and reams of bills of lading, shipping documents showing commodity, origin, destination.  So I was working on the transportation and commodity flow component of the model.  So I learned more about origin and destination for cotton, soy beans, wheat of various kinds and so on.  And I worked there for 3 months.  So that was how I got--and Leontief became a major sponsor of Andy Brimmer.  And it was Leontief who made a major shift.  It was Leontief who ended up arranging the appointment at Harvard when I left the Federal Reserve.  That was Leontief.
Story_ID: 16773
Speaker 1: In India I had worked on economic development.  So at Harvard I was going to enroll in the Ken Galbraith [John Kenneth Galbraith] seminar on economic development.  So I went down to see him, and, and I wanted to talk about that.  And we were talking about the--there were two graduate theory courses at Harvard.  The first one, most incoming students would take.  That was taught by a man by Ed [Edward H.] Chamberlin, Chamberlin.  And there was a second year course taught by [Wassily] Leontief.  And so now, in this setting now, Chamberlin was sitting here.  Galbraith is sitting there.  Leantief is sitting there, and all of us were standing around and sitting down and, and kneeling talking about getting guidance on which theory course we should take, you know.  So Ken Galbraith said to me, "You don't want to take Ed Chamberlin's course."  He said, "You want to take Leantief's course."  He said, "You--Ed Chamberlin made--did his major work and his major contribution a decade ago."  Now, this is 1952.  He said, "Ed Chamberlin wrote his book--" and I knew this, 'The Theory of Monopolistic Competition', a theory about the difference between, between monopoly and pure competition.  He said, "Ed Chamberlin worked in the same area as the British economist, Joan Robinson, who was [John Maynard] Keynes' student.  And she wrote on the economics--her book is 'The Economics of Imperfect Competition.'  Now, they were both trying to solve some puzzles and real problems left behind by Alfred Marshall.  Alfred Marshall was a great British economist who created modern economics, neo-classical economics.  And, but Marshall was an engineer before he became an economist.  And he would deal with the general issues in the text.  Then in footnotes and in an appendix, he would put the mathematics and, and the more difficult analytical issues.  And so they struggled between monopoly and competition and Marshall is in most of those footnotes.  So then Ken Galbraith said, "Look, Chamberlin, unlike Joan Robinson, has been living in Marshall's footnotes (laughter) ever since.  You don't want to go.  Go to Leontief's course."  But then Ken and I talked further.  And I enrolled in his seminar.  And--I did a paper on--not on national income, but industrial organization and management and financing.
Story_ID: 16774
Speaker 1: I'd come back from India with a footlocker full of notes.  I had profiles on some 1,900 joint stock companies, Indian joint stock.  Those were like the, the Indian counterpart of corporations here, which I'd collected de novo.  What I did is I had a Fulbright grant, and my Fulbright grant paid me the equivalent of $165.00 a month--in dollars.  And I didn't need that to, to live.  And so I used it to travel and to hire some undergraduates to collect data for me.  So I had a huge collection, the richest collection for industrial organization and financing than, than anybody.  I used, drew on that in Ken's [John Kenneth Galbraith] seminar.So, and I gave my paper in early December [1952] in the seminar.  And Ken said, "Look, this is fascinating.  This is a breakthrough."  He said, "I think you ought to--"  Oh, another journal at Harvard was anxious to publish the paper.  Henry Rosovsky's 'The Exploration History.'  So Ken said, "Oh, you don't need to--Henry can do without your paper.  You should send your paper to Ed [Edward H.] Chamberlin," who then edited the Quarterly Journal of Economics.  And he said, "I'll tell Ed to, I'm certain Ed will want to publish it," and he said, "By the way, would you like to join the Center for International Studies?"  That was housed at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], but it was a joint venture of Harvard and MIT.  So he recommended and I was eagerly in- join-, invited in.  So I became a research assistant in January--beginning January 1953 at the Center for International Studies at MIT.  And there I finished my paper and--may I get up and show you something?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, we can't get up.  We're not quite--
Speaker 1: Oh.
(Videographer):  Later.
Speaker 1: Yeah, later.  We can get it later.
Speaker 2: All right.  Thanks for stopping me (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, you can't get up and show us now.
Speaker 2: Well,--
Speaker 1: You can tell us about it.
Speaker 2: But there I did the paper on the Managing Agency System in India because what I demonstrated was, well, what I saw as I looked at these company accounts and the boards of directors and so on.  Now, remember this is India.  And my data were running through, from the handbooks, 1948.  It was the last benchmark for (unclear).  I would see Board of Directors--Chairman, Maharaja somebody.  And that's in the cement industry.  Then other, managing directors, "John Smith," "Captain Henry Jones," --all Britishers.  And you look further on, "Oscar Samuelson, Engineer"and so on.  The same pattern. I shifted to steel industries,  to textiles.  As I migrated from industry to industry, I saw the same pattern.  Who are these people?  And what it was, to cut it short, what it was, the Maharajahs and the others were flag carriers.  They were confidence-- builders.  But the real authorities, the real decision-makers were those managing directors.
Speaker 1: The British.
Speaker 2: The British.
Speaker 1: There was still colonialism.
Speaker 2: And, and what had happened was, British investors financed the development of modern industry in India, but they were not entrusting their money to Indians.  They were entrusting their money to the transplanted Britishers.  And, and this runs exactly counter and, and opposite to what has happened in this country or in Western Europe.  And so that was the contribution I made.  And that, that got republished and it's cited a number of times.  At Harvard I did my--work--I did my dissertation, not in economic development, although I'd done a lot of work in the, the seminar paper, I think was, Ken Galbraith urged me to turn that in as my dissertation.
Story_ID: 16775
Speaker 1: But I had, I went back to my Hank [Henry] Betchel days at the University of Washington and became much more interested in monetary policy and public policy and I ended up working with Alvin Hansen and John Williams on the Federal Reserve system.  And so I, I ended up concentrating in what was then, in macro-economics from, with an emphasis on finance.  And I ended up writing my dissertation on 'Monetary Policy, Interest Rates and the Investment Behavior of Life Insurance Companies'.  And that focused on the Federal Reserve.  I ended up being a teaching fellow at Harvard working for John Henry Williams and Alvin Hansen.  John Henry Williams was a professor of economics at Harvard with an emphasis on international economics.  He was simultaneously a vice president and subsequent economic advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York.  And so John Henry Williams was responsible for identifying and channeling some of the best students at Harvard in economics into the Federal Reserve.  And, in fact, I was offered a job as--late in December of 1953.  I was going to take my general exams as l've--in March of 1954.  But in December 1953, I got a call from a man from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Charlie [Charles A.] Coombs, who was the, the assistant vice president in charge of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  He offered me a job, starting in June 1954.  And, and I mentioned it to John Henry Williams and Hansen, and John Henry Williams says, "Oh--Charlie Coombs talked to me about you.  But I told Charlie that I was hoping you would stay with me for another year.".  So John Henry Williams and Hansen selected me to be their teaching fellow for economics, for the money and banking course, macro-economics.  And said,"You can always go to New York Fed." which I did.  So I stayed at Harvard '54, '55 and then in June 1955, I joined the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  I had almost finished my dissertation, but not quite.  And that brings us to the next story.  I started as a, as an economist in the research department and worked on my dissertation--I started in June.  And I was far along with my dissertation, but I still had a couple of chapters to do and much of the statistics, because I had to generate separate interest rate series for various bonds, yields on stocks and so on.  There were no computers.  So this had to be done by hand.  So--and my wife, Doris Brimmer, did much of the statistics in my--she had been a math major at Barnard.  And she was at Harvard also and so she was very good at--in fact, she was head of the statistics unit at the--in New York, for the foreign student exchange program in New York.  And I was working on my dissertation and now it's June, and working on the research side during the day, working on my dissertation at nights and weekends.  And I got a call from the same Charlie Coombs.  And it is now July, 1956.  I'm aiming to finish my dissertation by my 30th birthday which is September, 1956, I would be 30.  So Charlie Coombs called me and said, "Look, Bob Rosen and I would like very much if you would agree to serve on a three-person mission to the Sudan.  We have been to send--the bank has been asked to send somebody out to Khartoum to help them set up their central bank."  And he said that it's going to be headed, the mission is going to be headed by a Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and Alan Holmes from the New York Fed.  Alan had been on a couple of missions before.  He was senior to me.  I'm, I'm a beginning economist.  I'm a Class C economist.  Alan was already a senior economist and he had been on a couple of missions before.  So I said, look, I'm almost finished with my dissertation, and if you'll give me full time, a chance to work on this full time, I'm certain I can do it.  The, the aim was that we would go in October.  And I said--and we'd have to start preparation in, in September.  So he said, "What do you mean?"  I said, "Well, look, assign my daytime work to somebody, and let me work full time on the dissertation."  So he said, "Well, let me talk to Bob Rosen on this," and they agreed.  So I worked full time, July, and I finished my dissertation in September.
Story_ID: 16776
Speaker 1: We did not go to Khartoum [Sudan] in October [1956] because the second Arab-Israeli war started.  So we had to postpone until December.  And so I didn't arrive in Khartoum until early December.  And we stayed there until the middle of March.  And we did help them set up the bank and they eventually adopted our plan and they did establish the bank.  But--and so I was learning a lot and I had, because of my work in India I'd learned about British colonial banking and so on.  So I knew a lot--but, we were supposed to take our wives with us, but the State Department advised, because of the unsettled conditions, the war and so on, it was not advisable.  So I left Doris Brimmer behind in New York.  Well, as I said, she was working at the Institute of International Education.  But I wrote Doris Brimmer a letter every day.  If I missed a day, the next day I wrote two.  And a couple--a year or more later after I came back, I decided to edit those letters.  And so I took out all the household details, and I had a journal, about 150, 160 page journal.  The working title is "A Black American in Neo-Colonial Africa" because I was able to observe from a fairly advantageous level and position, the evolution of a neo-colonial, a post-colonial government in an environment where the tentacles of colonialism were still evident.  For example, we were invited by the Ministry of Finance in the, in the Sudan.  The Minister of Finance, well, the Sudanese Prime Minister was at the Umma party.  The Minister of Finance was a man named Hamsa, Magada Hamsa (ph.).  He sat in the front office, ministerial office.  Next door to him was Sir John Carmichael.  Who was Sir John Carmichael?  He had been Director of--he had been the Financial Secretary in the old Colonial regime.  And that colonial regime was the, the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.  Under that arrangement the--but it was really a condominium, but the British--the Governor General was always a British General.  The--and the way things were arranged, the, the British had the Governor Generalship which was responsible for the Army and interior, meaning national police.  The British had Finance.  They had Transportation and they had Agriculture, all critical parts of the economy; transportation, including shipping.
Speaker 2: Those are (unclear)
Speaker 1: (Smultaneously)--The Egypt--the Egyptians had the soft ministries: Health--Labor, Health, Welfare, Education.  The Sudanese had nothing under the British, under the last days of the colonial.  So now with independence, you now had the Sudanese thrown into an environment where they had the responsibility with little training and preparation.  And that's why they had to have these foreign advisors.  But, so those were the formal things, but the, the, the Colonial arrangements were still evident in other ways.  For example, Khartoum was the British city.  It's the new city.  That's the juncture of the two Niles, White and Blue Nile.  The Arab city is Omdurman on the west of the, of the White Nile.  The two, the twain did not meet socially, politically, they were quite separate.
Story_ID: 16777
Speaker 1: Once we were in the Sudan, we worked through the Ministry of Finance to set up the central banks.  And we worked on the economics and finances side as well.  And, but our mission cut across the traditional relation because the Bank of England normally would have been asked to help the Sudanese set up their central banking arrangement.  But the Bank of England advisor had said you don't need a central bank (laughter).  What you need is a currency board--a colonial arrangement.  The Sudanese rejected that, and they wanted a central bank more like our Federal Reserve or like the Bank of England itself.  And the U.S. was just reaching out.  This is during the Eisenhower administration.  And the U.S. was trying to make some headway in the Middle East or in North Africa and so on.  So the U.S. Ambassador to Sudan suggested they ask the Federal Reserve and that's how we got there.  But once we were there, among the Sudanese and others, we were the Americans.  And so a variety of issues came to our desks, not because we were familiar with the, the issues, but because we were there--and one, and I mentioned this in my journal--
Speaker 2: (Videographer:) Pause. Jet. Okay.
Speaker 1: I was saying because we were Americans, we ended up with all kinds of issues being brought to our desk.  And one that came to me, and I mentioned it in my journal at some length.  Into my office, the secretary came in and said, and "There is a gentleman here to see you.  He is from the Khartoum Zoo."  I said, "Oh?"  He said, "Yes."  And he was the Commissioner, and he came in with his proper neo-colonial uniform on, with his high socks and his short trousers and his topee [helmet].  And he said, "I have a real problem."  And I said, "Yes?"  And he said, "We have an exchange program with the National Zoo in Washington [D.C.]".  And he said, "And we had been assembling a collection to exchange.  And I understand that the U.S. has an aid program in which the commodities--"--actually it was a wheat program--"and is shipped in.  And, but I was wondering could we get the Air Force to cargo to lift our animals to Washington?"  And I said, "Sir, I have no idea about this.  This is news to me.  I said that my hunch is that you'll have to go through a lot of quarantine (laughter).  Those animals have to be in quarantine."  He said, "What do you mean?"  I said "Because live animals can't be brought into the U.S. back and forth."  I said, "and this is a question that the, that the Agriculture Department would have to advise you."  And he said, "Really?"  (laughter)  So, it, it was an interesting experience, interesting experience.  The Sudanese did eventually--they adopted our reports and so on.  That is how and why I was in the Sudan.

Speaker 1: I taught economics at Michigan State from 1958 until 1961.  And from Michigan State, I moved to the University of Pennsylvania in July of 1961.  And I taught finance, economics and finance, macro-economics and finance at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania for two years, '61 through '63 [1963], at which point I went on leave and came to Washington, D.C. in the [President John F.] Kennedy administration.  I was on the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania for 3--for 5 years, but I was physically present only two years.  And my coming to Washington [D.C.] got started in December 1960.  It happened this way.  The economist--annual economist meetings were in St. Louis that year.  And I was walking down the hall and Ken [John Kenneth] Galbraith was crossing in front me and he came and said, "Andy!"  I said, "Yes, Ken."  He said, "Glad that I saw you.  I wanted to let you know that [President-elect] Senator [John F.] Kennedy has asked me and Paul Samuelson, who was the other one, to help him set up, to staff the government for the economic policy team, and I want you to know, I put your name in." I said, "Fine."  He said, "You'll be getting a call."  True to his word, I got a call.  In March, 1961, I got a call from Robert C. Weaver.  Bob Weaver was then head of the Housing and Home Finance Agency.  And HUD [Department of Housing and Urban Development] grew out of that later.  Bob told me, and I'm still at Michigan State, but this is March '61.  I didn't leave, leave, y'know, to Pennsylvania until--June.  So Bob invited me to join him on this senior staff, but I said, look, Bob--he said, "I got your name from the White House Personnel Office, and I'd like very much for you to come to Washington and help me."  So I said, look, Bob, I've, I've agreed to go to the University of Pennsylvania, and I couldn't cut short.  That, that's--so I would have to say thank you.  Actually, the Kennedy Administration tried every few months in one way or another to put something in front of me.  And I did accept an appointment as a, a consultant on the, at the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission].  There was a special study of securities markets and the--Irwin Friend, one of my senior colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania had a big piece of that.  So--I did work on the survey of mutual funds.  So that was some government service, but I just didn't come, but in the summer--in the spring of 1962, the White House made a real push to get me to come to Washington.  And they arranged, the White House Personnel Office arranged several interviews, one with the Commerce Department.  Another was the--two, two offices in the State department.  One was the Bureau of Intelligence and Research and the other one was the Bureau of Economic Affairs.  And AID [Agency for International Development].  And in AID there were two slots.  They were--they asked me to consider.  One was in the, the Assistant Administrator for Economic Affairs and the other one was the, the Africa Bureau.  In each case, Commerce, all of them, I'm being offered positions at the super-grade level, equivalent of 16th 17th, 18th were the sub-cabinet posts then.  In Commerce, it was the equivalent of a Deputy Assistant Secretary, the same as in State.  At AID, the personnel people in AID in the Africa Bureau took, my 9-month, not my 10 month, but my 9 month salary at the Wharton School, academic salary, annualized it.  And that was the salary level of a GS-13.  I, well, I wasn't coming anyway, but I just laughed about that.  Forgot all about it.  Then in 1963, I did come to Washington as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs, one of the jobs they had tried to persuade me to take back in 1962.  So there was in Washington a man named Chuck Stone.  Chuck Stone was Editor of the Washington Afro-American.
Speaker 2: Right, I know Chuck Stone.
Speaker 1: You know, Chuck?  Okay.  So Chuck wrote a story when I came to Washington and the Secretary of Commerce was Luther Hodges, former governor of North Carolina.  So Chuck wrote a story in which he said the Kennedy administration has finally persuaded Andy Brimmer to come to Washington.  He said, and it took an old segregationist governor from North Carolina to recognize Andy Brimmer's worth and to bring him, and to persuade him to come.  He said, "Unlike what happened in AID."  And then he told the story about how, how AID completely missed the cue and insulted me by offering me a GS-13.  That story, Chuck's story from the Afro-American was picked up in the White House news clippings.  And President Kennedy saw it and called up the Administrator at AID and said, "What the hell is going on?  You're undercutting my policies."  Of course, this poor guy didn't know what the hell (laughter) absolute, no notion what happened.
Story_ID: 16779
Speaker 1: But that story has legs because years later, and that, that was in the Spring of 1963. When [Secretary of Commerce] Luther Hodges was leaving to go back to North Carolina, he had told [President John F.] Kennedy--and he told [President Lyndon Baines] Johnson, he would serve out the 4 years he had committed to Kennedy.  And he was leaving.  So in December 1964, Hodges recommended to Johnson that I be promoted to Assistant Secretary of Economic Affairs.  The Assistant Secretary was going back to the University of California.  Okay.  Johnson said it sounded good to him because I had gotten to know Johnson during this period.  And he knew about my work.  He said, but we'll let the new Secretary of Commerce pass on it because Andy Brimmer will be working for him.  John T. Connor came in, he came in from Merck to be Secretary of Commerce in January 15th, I remember, 1965.  And his first meeting of his officers on the 16th of January, he took me aside at the end of the meeting and said, he had--President, that President Johnson had told him about my being promoted, and, and he assumed--because Secretary Hodges left him notes.  He said, this sounds fine to me, but I'd want to talk with you about it very soon.  That very next day, he and I had a brief talk, 15 minutes.  Two days later, he told me--he called me into his office and said, I told the President that I would be delighted.  And he said, Johnson said, fine, let us proceed.  So Hodges--rather Connor said to me, the White House will be announcing your appointment very soon.  I said, thank you.  I look forward to working with you.  Now, there was a deadline.  Dick [Richard] Holton had to leave--he had to be back in California for February 1 for his--because he was going to start teaching.  Johnson did not want--well, he wanted my appointment to be announced before Dick left.  This is the Secretary of Commerce wanted that because he didn't want to be plagued--this was a post a number of other politicians wanted.  So we were down to January 28, 29 and nothing had happened.  So Jack Connor was in the White House and he saw Johnson.  And already Jack Connor knew about Johnson's temperament.  So he tentatively asked, gingerly asked the President, did you--we thought you were going to, I thought you were going to launch Andy Brimmer's appointment.  But we've, we--what happened?  Johnson said, What!  I approved that!  Jack, Jack Valenti was the Press Secretary at the time.  So he called in Jack and said, Jack, what, what about Andy Brimmer's appointment.  I thought we cleared that some time ago.  And Jack, Jack said, we wrote the release and I, I thought it had gone out.  But let me see.  Well, what happened, Jack had sent it down to the print shop in the White House.  It had come back, but on the bottom of a stack of other releases.  And there it'd been stuck for a week.  So it was finally put out.  And that's when I became Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs.  And that's when I really started working more closely with Johnson though I had done a couple of projects for Johnson earlier.
Story_ID: 16780
Speaker 1: I arrived in March, 1963.  One of the first assignments I got was to prepare the testimony for the Public Accommodations Section of the Civil Rights Act of 1963 [sic, 1964].  Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] had decided that the constitutional frame for federal legislation for the public accommodation had to be the Interstate Commerce Clause.  So Bobby's and his lawyers concluded that segregation and discrimination posed a burden on interstate commerce.  Remember the, in the headlines where the city and the, the travel restrictions and so on.  So Mike [Myer] Feldman who was Assistant  [Special Counsel] to Kennedy had the liaison with the Commerce Department.  So he called up Secretary of Commerce, Luther Hodges.  This is July, June, July--late June, early July, 1963 and said, the President would like very much for the Commerce Department to prepare the testimony for the, supporting this Public Accommodation section.  So Hodges called a meeting of his staff and Franklin Roosevelt, Jr. who was Undersecretary of Commerce at that time, the Number 2 guy.  So Hodges turned to Frank and said, "Frank, I want you to take responsibility for getting the testimony done." So Frank said, "Yes, sir."  And we adjourned to Frank's office.  And Frank turned to Dick [Richard] Holton, the Assistant Secretary, and said, "Dick--can your shop take responsibility?"  And Dick said, "Yes, we will do it.  Andy, you do it."  (Laughter).  So I ended up doing the testimony on--demonstrating the burden of segregation on interstate commerce.  And I accompanied Frank Roosevelt in giving the testimony before the Senate on that.  And what I did was to, the key--and this is the part that got cited substantially in the Supreme Court decision, upholding the constitutionality of the Act, that part of the Act, I plotted a road trip from Washington, D.C. via Miami--via Atlanta to Miami; another trip from Washington, D.C. to Chicago.
Speaker 2: Now, this would be a trip by--
Speaker 1: Automobile.
Speaker 2: Automobile, okay.
Speaker 1: And I plotted a trip from Washington, D.C. via Nashville, Tennessee to New Orleans.  And I asked the National Safety Council what is the safe limit for driving by a passenger veh--by a driver traveling without stopping for overnight accommodation.  And I got their recommendation, then I got the Triple A guidebook, hotels and stuff.  And I got the handbook, I remember it was called "Go", G-O, published by a black woman, which identified and appraised accommodations along various routes where blacks could stay.  And the analysis showed exactly what one would expect, that a white traveler could, could stop at the recommended places and--after driving distance by the National Safety Council.  Blacks couldn't.  They couldn't find accommodations along the, the Miami route and the New Orleans routes, where they could along Chicago.  And the difference was substantial.  I mean they, they, they--at least 50 to 60 percent longer driving time.  And that testimony struck sparks.  As Frank Roosevelt was summarizing before the Commerce Committee in the Senate, Senator Strom Thurmond pounded the table, "Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, let me interrupt.  That is not true. I know that intersection in, in South Carolina where they're saying that colored people can't get accommodations. There's a fine hotel right there off the highway, and I've seen colored people in there!"  So I passed a note to my staff person sitting behind me, saying, please call the Commerce Department's field office in South Carolina, have the director interview that hotel, managers and tell me what the situation is.  About 40 minutes later the word came back.  The manager had called the hotel manager--the head of our field office called the hotel manager and said, "Oh, the Senator is right.  He's seen colored people in here, but they work here. (laughter).  Under the South Carolina law, we cannot serve colored clients."  So Frank read the note, Frank Roosevelt read the note.  And he said, "You, you read this into the record." So he gave it to me (laughter) to read it.  And I said, "Mr. Chairman, I want to go back to and answer the questions Senator Thurman had asked."  And I read it word, verbatim, saying, blacks cannot be served there.  The hotel manager said by law he cannot serve them.  They saw those who, black people there, but they worked there.  And if he were to serve people, he'd be breaking the law. That was the punch.  Justice [William] Brennan told me that he, in writing the major--the unanimous opinion--he wrote the opinion which was voted unanimously upholding it because soon after the law became effective in 1964, the Government, there was a suit brought by the Heart of Atlanta.  That was a motel in Atlanta, challenging the constitutionality, arguing that public accommodations in Georgia were covered by Georgia law, and not by Federal law.
Story_ID: 16781
Speaker 1: When [President Lyndon Baines] Johnson appointed me Assistant Secretary of the, of, of Commerce for Economic Affairs, the first real job, big challenge was working on the balance of payments.  The U.S. was running a big deficit in balance of payments, and so we created a, a system of voluntary controls.  The Federal Reserve put together a control so the banks, U.S. banks, would limit the amount of loans they made to, to U.S. borrowers that would be, finance activity abroad.  In the Commerce Department, we asked U.S. businesses, especially industrial firms, to finance their foreign-direct investment abroad rather than finance it from the United States.  That is the--and I ran that program.  That is the program and that activity, what introduced me to the, the, the corporate community because their, each of the major corporations named a liaison to work on the program, and they worked with me.  So it was that program which, since that was a program Johnson put a great deal of weight on it, that gave me more exposure to Johnson because he established the Cabinet Committee on, on the balance of payments, the Secretary of Commerce [John T. Connor] was a member.  I was the alternate, and that's where I had my first real clash with Johnson.  It was August, 1965.  Johnson had called a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on the balance of payments.  The 'Wall Street Journal' ran a story on that very day saying Johnson has called a committee and this is what the committee will recommend to the president.  We arrived at the meeting.  The Secretary of the Treasury [Henry H. Fowler] chaired the cabinet committee.  The Secretary of Commerce was co-chair.  So the President came and sat in his seat--this was in the Cabinet room, in his traditional seat.  The Secretary of the Treasury  sat to his right because he was chairing the committee.  Secretary of State sat to his left, except it was George Ball, the Undersecretary.  The Secretary of Commerce chair was to the right of the Secretary of the Treasury.  I was sitting in that seat.  So Johnson came in.  Fowler, the Secretary Treasurer said, introduced--said "Mr. President, we're delighted to be here.  Is there anything you want to say to the Committee before we give you our report?" And he said, "No.  And then he said, "Oh, wait a minute."  And he reached in his pocket, put on his glasses, leaned over Joe [Henry] Fowler and said, "Andy, where's Jack Connor?"  He was Secretary of Commerce.  And I said, "Mr. President, Secretary Connor is in Chi-, in Chicago.  He's speaking to the, had a commitment to speak to the Illinois Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  It's a major meeting, supporting our program.  It's longstanding.  And so he thought he had to keep it,"  I said,  "but he did write his memo and has a report, and I have a copy of his memo, which he asked me to present.  And here's a copy." (laughter).  He looked at it, threw it down on the table and said, "Now, let--Andy, let me tell you something.  And I want you to tell this to Jack Connor, that he should be here working for me and tending to my business.  And I want to tell all the rest of you that you tell my business to me before you tell it to the 'Wall Street Journal.'" (chuckle)  And he got up and left.  That was my--and, of course, during that tirade I was caught, I was looking right at him.  He was looking right at me, and, but I glanced around the table, the Cabinet table, everybody was looking down like (laughter, bows his head down).  That was my first--but that is what really, that program, that experience is really what identified me fully with Johnson.
Story_ID: 16782
Speaker 1: So Johnson decided to appoint me to the Federal Reserve.  And, and that is a story about the Federal Reserve as well as about the, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and about me.  I'm Number 3.  The real problem was that the Federal Reserve had raised the discount rate in early December of 1965.  And this is during the Vietnam War.  The inflation was building.  The President was under a great deal of tension to raise taxes to finance the war, to stop inflation.  But it was resisted.  The Federal Reserve under Bill [William M.] Martin raised the discount rates that tightened money.  Johnson hit the ceiling.  He was outraged.  And he ended up calling Bill Martin down to the ranch.  Well, I learned about it on a Saturday.  The, because Hobart Rowan of the 'Washington Post' told me ahead of time.  He said, we've got the story and it's going to appear in Sunday's paper and about 10:30 he had, had a copy of the Post sent over and I saw it.  What had happened was that the, somebody in the Treasury leaked the thing to Johnson and the White House leaks, leaked the story.  Well, that set up real friction between Johnson and the Federal Reserve.  Bill Martin wanted to appoint, wanted Johnson to appoint a businessman to replace Canby Balderston who was the Vice Chair, but whose term was expiring the end of January, 1966.  Johnson decided to appointment me or rather let me put it, he was considering me.  Evans and Novak wrote a story in the Washington Post.  I remember it was February 22nd.  That is an important date because that's Washington's birthday and the Government was closed.  But Johnson ordered the Secretary of the Treasury--he read, Johnson read the [Rowland] Evans and [Robert] Novak story, and he asked the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors to interview me.  I'd already been interviewed by Walter Heller on Johnson's behalf.  So I went down to Treasury, and we talked and Joe Fowler, Secretary Treasurer and Acting Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors said, we, we're strongly supporting you.  We told the President that he ought to go ahead with you.  That was a Tuesday, on Thursday, I got a call in my office from Marvin Watson who was Johnson's appointment secretary  [White House Chief of Staff] .  He said, the boss wants to see you.  I went over to the White House, and this is where the drama was.  I expected to go to Marvin's office to be taken to the Oval Office.  I got there.  Marvin said, the boss went over to the Mansion.  He wants us to come over.  So I expected to see Johnson in his study in the White House.  We went there, went up and up; the door opened.  And there was this Secret Service guy standing there, and he said, "The President is not available."  So Marvin said, "He expects us."  The guy said, "He's not available!"  So Marvin said, "You'd better go ask him."  The agent came back and said, "Please, come."  I walked into Johnson's bedroom.  So I was interviewed by the President about going to the Federal Reserve in his bedroom.  Marvin had told us we had 10 minutes.  I stayed for 45 minutes.  We talked about the Federal Reserve for about 5 to 7 minutes and the rest we talked about Johnson and, and how he was--he believed in actually integrating blacks into the government.
Story_ID: 16783
Speaker 1: He [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] told me two fascinating stories.  One is how he got--Bob [Robert C.] Weaver appointed Secretary [of Housing and Urban Development, in 1966].  He said [President John F.] Kennedy sent up a bill to appoint Weaver, to create a Department of Housing and Urban Affairs, and, but when asked about--by a reporter, "Mr. President, will you appoint Dr. Weaver to be secretary of the new department?"  Kennedy said, "Of course, he's absolutely qualified.  I would, he will be my appointment."  Of course, that meant that the bill was stillborn when it got to the Hill.  The--[Senator] Richard Russell killed it.  Johnson told me that he decided he was going to create the department, and he was going to appoint Bob Weaver.  And so he said--But he had a problem.  So he wrote and he saw Russell and told him he would like to create this department for Urban Development.  "And do what, for these urban areas, what we've done for the cities."  And Russell said, Lyndon, are you going to appoint that colored man secretary?"  And he said, "What colored--you mean Dr. Weaver?  He is highly qualified, but I, but Senator, I haven't devoted one moment to who will be the secretary."  And he said, Russell leaned over to him and said, "Lyndon, are you lying to me?"  And he said, "Senator, would I lie to you?" That was it.  Russell agreed not to sponsor it, but not to fight it.  He told me that he had decided he was going to appoint Thurgood Marshall to be the, to the Supreme Court.  He said, but he couldn't--although Thurgood at the time was now a member of the Circuit Court in New York, everybody still saw him as NAACP's [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] lawyer.  So he said, he decided to make him his lawyer, the lawyer for the president.  He said--but he had a problem.  Archie [Archibald] Cox was Solicitor General and so, and he wanted to appoint Thurgood Marshall Solicitor General and from that post to be a member of the Court, of the Supreme Court.  So he said, he called up Archie Cox one Saturday and said, "Archie, I suppose you and Louise are just missing Cambridge in Massachusetts this time of the year."  And said, Archie, being a good Harvard lawyer, said, "Mr. President, Louise and I were just thinking about we miss Cambridge this time of the year." (laughter)  That's when he got Thurgood appointed to the Solicitor General.  There's a cartoon on my wall from the Pittsburgh Courier describing those episodes, including my appointment.  That's what I wanted to say about that because Johnson appointed me to the Federal Reserve, despite [Federal Reserve Chairman] Bill [William M.] Martin's objection because as Johnson told me, he said, "The time had come."  He said, "The only we're going to make progress in this country is for qualified people to be recognized and appointed to do jobs for which they are qualified."  And so he made the announcement.  He never told me, by the way, he was going to appoint me to the Fed.  He made the announcement.  And remember I saw him on a Sat, on a Thursday.  He sent me to see Bill Martin on that night or that afternoon.  Bill read to me the parts of the letter he had written to Johnson about me, he had--did not read me the part of the letter that dealt with the businessman, who Johnson had identified for me.  It was, it was Atherton Bean from Minneapolis.  Bill Martin said, "Look, if you, if the President appoints you, I will welcome you and put out a statement." The President announced my appointment on a Saturday, just two days afterwards.  He had told me to, to keep in touch with Marvin Watson [Johnson's Chief of Staff], if I leave town, says he had to make a decision in the next week or ten days.  And what happened was this, he had a, a briefing for the press, a closed briefing for the press on Saturday, and there he announced my appointment.  And Frank Porter, Economics Reporter for the Washington Post, was there, called Hobert Rowan, and he told me.  So I learned from Hobart Rowan, not from Johnson, that I had--Johnson had appointed me.  There are two photos on my wall.  One is the front page story of the New York Times, that Johnson announced my appointment.  The other one is my being sworn in, in the White House, a posture which Johnson decided to do.  And so that's how I ended up at the Federal Reserve on, on being appointed March, sworn in March 9, 1966.  That's my story of how I got to the Federal Reserve.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I did all the things Federal Reserve Governors do, nothing extraordinary there, except in terms of central banking, technical questions.  I, I was responsible for a number innovations, but we don't need to get into those now.  That was the Federal Reserve.  And so I served there 8-1/2 years.
Story_ID: 16784
Speaker 1: I left to go back to Harvard.  And that happened because a friend of mine and former colleague at the Federal Reserve was back at the University of California with a joint appointment at Stanford [University].  He called me one day and said, look, several of my colleagues here were talking about exploring whether you would want to be considered to fill a Chair in the, the Money and Banking Chair at Stanford.  And said, would you want to be--talk to them.  So I talked to them in December at their annual meeting.  This is now 1973, early '74.  And so I got a call from Sharon Mazell (sp), saying the Stanford people are serious, but they--it's going to be a split vote because one group wants to promote, give the Chair to a professor whose already at Stanford.  Another group wants to bring you in.  Said, but before they make a fight, they want to know would you come, would you really be inclined to, to come.  So I said, "That's flattering, let me think about it."  So [Wassily] Leontief was in town.  Remember the input-output guy who had gotten me started at Harvard?  So I went to the seminar with him and I mentioned it to him.  I said, "Wassily, I have this inquiry from Stanford.  But I've been out of the academic community now almost 11 years.  Tell me, what's it like at Stanford, what that position is like?"  He said, "Splendid job, splendid position, but Andy, if you're going to leave the Federal Reserve, and I think it's time you do, then you ought to come back to Harvard."  I said, "Wassily, the difference is, Stanford is talking to me; Harvard is not."  So he said, "I can fix that.  I'm going back to Cambridge [Massachusetts] tonight, and I'm going to start working on this the very first thing tomorrow morning." The short of it is, that's what happened.  By the close of business the next day, I had an invitation to come back to Harvard.  And he looked at it and it turned out that the Economics Department had a quarter slot and a quarter money.  The Kennedy School [of Government] had a full slot, but no money.  The Business School had a slot and lots of money and so--
Speaker 2: (Videographer:) Hold on.  (Plane noise)  Just rephrase that sentence.
Speaker 1: So, now, the Economics Department had a quarter slot and quarter money.  The Kennedy School had a full slot, but no money, and the Business School, the Harvard Business School had a full position and lots of money.  So by the end of the day, the very next day, I had an invitation to become the Thomas Henry Carroll Visiting Professor in the Business School--with a three-year commitment if I wanted it for the Chair.  The position as a Professor I had regularly.  But I decided to go to Harvard, and that's when I resigned from the Federal Reserve.  And that's how I got from the Federal Reserve to the Harvard Business School.  And as I mentioned, simultaneously, I became a Director at Dupont--an economic advisor.  And so I started really consulting part time, while I was at the Harvard Business School and decided that I really did not want to teach as much as I thought I did.  And so that's when I decided to set up my company here in Washington.
Speaker 2: And that's Brimmer and Company.
Speaker 1: Brimmer and Company, Inc., Economic and Financial Consultants.  And I started it July of 1976.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, what--
Speaker 1: And, and over the years I became a director and consultant advisor to a number of other corporations.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 16785
Speaker 1: Now, let me say a little bit about the Control Board, Financial Control Board, unless you want to ask me something.
Speaker 2: No, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In 1974--in 1994, Marion Barry, who had been mayor [of Washington, D.C.] from 1978 to 1990.  And you know he was convicted for cocaine use and went to jail--
Speaker 2: There was--he had a video (unclear)--
Speaker 1: And the video and so on.
Speaker 2: --a conviction of him using crack.
Speaker 1: And Sharon Pratt Kelly ran for mayor in 1990 and, and during her first year or so, she made a great deal of effort and progress to reduce the budget deficit in Washington.  But by 1974--1994, the District was in deficit.  It was insolvent for all practical purposes, did not have enough money to pay the bills.  Marion had been re-elected--elected again in November and with his election--and remember in, in January 1995, the [Representative] Newt Gingrich revolution took over.  Newt had won the House for the Republicans.  Republicans were now in control of the, of the Committees.  And the District [of Columbia] Committee first was headed by Walsh, James Walsh of Syracuse.  He headed the Appropriations Committee for the District, Oversight Committee.  And a newly elected Congressman named [Tom] Davis from Virginia, chaired the Oversight Committee.  The, the Senate committees in this didn't matter because it was really the House where the action was.  The Republicans on the Appropriations Committee decided that they were going to make--an example of Marion Barry and the District and this wasteful spending.  The upshot is Congress passed a law establishing the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority.  Aim? This is why it became so complicated, they had different motives.  One group of Republicans, led by Walsh wanted to work on the Budget and Financial Responsibility, cut government spending, cut government spending, balance the budget.  Another group of Demo--the Democrats and some Republicans, Republicans headed by Tom Davis, who chaired the Oversight Committee, wanted to put the emphasis on management assistance and proven management and efficient programs.  They passed the, the bill creating the board of five people with some restriction--it had to be either District residents or had businesses in the District.  No partisanship was required and it didn't require Senate approval.  So there was a bit of controversy because the Office of Management and Budget was designated by--and Alice [M.] Rivlin was the one who was the Director of OMB at the time.  In any case, my name came up at the top of the list.  And there were substantial attacks by the Republicans on me.  They wanted a businessman.  First, they had wanted to declare the city bankrupt.  And Congress refused to do that.  And that was because Newt, Newt Gingrich stepped in and said, "No, that's not the proper thing.  Let's declare it insolvent."  And so, but Clinton ended up appointing me chair of the, of the board.  But there was some confusion and we ended up with a five member Board.  Three of us were Democrats, two of us--two were Republicans.  But we agreed from the day one we would not operate, recognize any partisanship.  And I took the initiative and, and proposed that we create a vice chair's position and Steve [Stephen D.] Holland, who was a Republican should be vice chair.  He had headed the, the regional account--he was the region chairman of KPMG, the Accounting firm.  And Connie [Constance Berry] Newman was the other Republican.  She was at that point Deputy Secretary of the Smithsonian.  But she had headed the Office of Management and Budget during the previous Bush administration.  And Joyce Ladner was a, had been the interim president of Howard University.  And Ed [Edward A.] Singletary was a revi- retired vice president of the Bell Telephone companies.  But I was the, the chair and CEO.  And there was some confusion about our responsibility, and who did respond to what, until Newt Gingrich called me one day and said, "Dr. Brimmer, would you come down and visit with me?"  And I did, and he's the one who explained to me the dispute among the Republicans and so on.  And he said, "Now, look, when I endorsed the bill, I did it on the assumption that you were going to be, that the chair would be responsible.  When your name surfaced, I was delighted.  So I was all in favor of it.  So you're the chairman."  And, and as you know, we did a lot to improve the District's financial position.  But, but when I was chair of the Financial Control Board, I kept my company [Brimmer and Company, Inc., Economic and Financial Consultants] going.  I scaled back on the scale of activities, the volume of activity, but I did not close down the company.
Speaker 2: Okay.  How did you, I mean how did you feel about the, about Congress stepping in when they did?
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely necessary.  I'd done a lot of work on the District.  Back in 1982, we did a study for Marion Barry on retention of business in the District on the pa-, as a part, as a part of the Program for Economic Development.  In 1986, '87 [1987], we did a study on the, the--future prospects, financial prospects for the State of New Columbia because Washington was pressing to become a state.
Speaker 2: Right, I know Jesse Jackson was pressing for--
Speaker 1: And the question was, was it financially viable?
Story_ID: 16786
Speaker 1: There're a couple of things we [the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority] did.  We persuaded the federal government to take over the state-like functions, some of the state-like functions which the city was carrying.  For example, prison system.  In states, the--big cities don't carry state prison system.  In Washington, D.C., D.C. does.  The Medicaid is paid substantially by the city rather than the federal government.  And [President Bill] Clinton was able to get that done, and that made a big difference.  The thing where we had the, the--for me, since I had the principal responsibility for the financial side, the, our failure to get a repeal of the Congressionally imposed prohibition on the city's income tax.  The city cannot tax the income of Maryland and Virginia residents although they live--they work in the City, earn their income here and--but pay taxes in the suburbs.  And the, the share of income that is earned by the non-residents has been growing over time.  And so--and the income tax is the one tax that's flexible, that rises with prosperity and so on.  And economic growth generates more income taxes, but the city cannot collect those taxes from the residents in Maryland and Virginia.  That was my biggest failure as I was chair of the Control Board.  But the other big failure was the--I never got a real grip on the city council's decision-making and their responsibility.  The city council was really the obstacle to getting anything done here.  There're eight wards with a member and five at large member, including the chair--thirteen members.  Each one speaks for his own local constituency and there was no real leadership to, for the council.  Because we had veto power, we were able to corral them.  And we, we--they had responsibility for drawing up the budget, but eventually we had to substitute and impose our budget.  When the Control Board went out of business, and I left before it went out of bus--they, I left after 3 years and 3 months.  Alice Rivlin succeeded me for a year, almost a year and a half after I left.  But now that the Control Board is no longer in existence, the city council is back to its bad old ways, and I was told by a person close to the deliberations, just two weeks ago, that they are in the process of undoing much of what we did and it's gotten out into the press, and one strong advocate of home rule, which was not our--my supporter when I was there, was quoted as saying, oh, my God, they wish I would come back and try to impose some discipline.  But that was my, some of my experience at the Control Board.

Speaker 1: Did you want to say anything about, about your consulting work?
Speaker 2: Yes, we [Brimmer and Company, Inc.] are Economic and Financial consultants.  We work only on, for business institutions or some state and local government.  We do not do consulting with individuals.  Now, my first consulting work was with AT&T.  They had--and this has a lot to do with attitudes and regulation.  In the telephone business and before the A and TT break--AT&T break-up, the telephone companies had 2--3 types of businesses.  They had residential service, business service and yellow pages.  Word got out, some consumer representatives, which said that consumers were subsidizing business.  AT&T did a, a residential household survey of 3 million customers and they priced a single residential telephone--a dial tone, you know, rotary dial, the one ext--no extension.  The average monthly cost was, of delivering that service, was $16.00.  The average monthly revenue was $9.00.  So there was a shortfall of $7.00, made up by business, long distance and yellow pages.  Based on the kind of theory I'd been describing of full-cost pricing, that would require utility commissioners to, not to allow the telephone companies to offset or to subsidize high-cost areas. The most striking example was an Indian reservation in the southwest, Arizona, New Mexico or some place.  80 miles from the central exchange out to the reservation, 80 miles.  At the end of that line were a hundred and twenty telephones.  Along that 80-mile strip was 175 telephones.  So if each subscriber had to pay the marginal, the average cost of service, the, the, the $16.00 per telephone customer at the end of that 80 miles would have been $160.00, ten times.  So this--we demonstrated that.  And we were able to--AT&T was able to present our findings and the commission that was considering that dropped it.  We did a number of studies and testimony for the Bell systems dealing with rate making.  And I did--that was a good source of our revenue, telephone companies, public utilities and so on until the--1984 when I joined the Bell South board, and I thought it was not appropriate to do more work for other telephone companies.  The other area where we have done a lot of work is in the area of international trade and ginancing.  And we have done studies and prepared testimony.  Another area where we have done a lot of work is in minority business, on the set-asides and so on.  And we have been able to develop a model which showed that black-owned businesses, that there's a huge disparity between the availability of black-owned business services and their share of revenue and sales.  And there we have not been very persuasive in a number of cases because the typical court--and these go directly into the federal courts now, really under the sway of reverse discrim--they scream "reverse discrimination" and so set-asides and reservations of shares are not in favor.  And, but the bulk of our work is in interest rate finance--interest rate forecasting and assessment of capital market developments.  That is mainly what we do.

Speaker 1: Now, sir, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, let, let me tell you what worries me most, and I'm still struggling with trying to come up with some solutions.  First, blacks have made substantial progress in, in taking advantage of economic opportunity.  Discrimination is not the principal obstacle to black employment today.  It's qualification and preparation.  In the technical professional areas, blacks who are prepared get the jobs and in many cases, end up getting a premium for doing so.  But this--it's huge.  It's a case of those who had, have gotten.  Those who have--didn't have, have not.  And the biggest drawback, the, the biggest progress has been made by black women.  The least progress has been made by black men.  The--and black men between the ages of 18 and 45, a substantial number are AWOL in the labor market because they have, they suffer from--they're either in jail or under court restraint or otherwise under duress.  The high birth rate for one-parent families in the black community, black women who have either never been, who were not married or who have been abandoned by the fathers of their children.  And there's no way, despite the efforts to impose, you know, under the welfare deal, there's no way to impose on these men the responsibility to support these families.  And that means that the, the--
Speaker 1: (air plane noise). (Videographer:) Hold on for a second.  Okay.
Speaker 2: --to impose penalties and to persuade these young, these men to take care of their families to give their kids, their own kids an opportunity to acquire the education and to make the progress.  That is the biggest problem that I face.  When you said, hope for the black community, I'm no longer worried about blacks who have the capacity to go to college or above all, if they're out of college.  They can take care of themselves.  It is the, those who are left behind.  And there I'm, my own proposal, and this is one I made years ago, what we see here is a need for a huge investment in human capital.  And especially to save the future generations, and that means government subsidies.  Subsidies not only--the GI Bill is my model.  What did the GI Bill do?  It provided for veterans an opportunity to go to school, not only to pay tuition and fees, but subsistence because there was a stipend.  So the, the student, the veteran student could concentrate on learning and improving.  And it wasn't just college.  A, a lot of the GI Bill beneficiaries used it to acquire vocational training and technical skills and so on.  And it wasn't caught up in this business of state versus church and so on.  And in a place like the University of Washington where I went and when I told you about the need for a veteran to go to the guidance center--there was, there was discipline involved.  So I want to see a huge investment in human capital, starting with medical services.  And we've got 41 million people in this country who are uninsured.  Over 5 million of them are blacks.  And, and--well over 5 million.  So we need some public investment for health, for education and training.  So that's what I'm concerned about, and that's what I want to work on.
Story_ID: 16789
Speaker 1: Sir, looking back on what you have done so far--and I know you're still busy, what would you see as your legacy at this point?
Speaker 2: Let me divide it into--
Speaker 1: Three (chuckle)?
Speaker 2: Into levels.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The, the one area that I made the absolutely biggest difference is I saved the nation's capital from bankruptcy.  That's what I did at the Control Board [District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority].  And so if, if someone were writing up, I won't say my obituary, (chuckle) but if someone were writing up an appreciation of me, and I would want them to say he saved the City from bankruptcy, the nation's capital from bankruptcy.  Next, I'd want them to say that he provided the evidence that upheld the abolition of discrimination in public accommodation.  That would be number two.  And the next one I would say, and this is much more technical than professional, but I did the analytical work and theoretical foundation for something called "Controlling Systemic Risks in Capital Markets".  In the colloquial terms, it's called "too big to fail".  But the Federal Reserve was doing it, was coming to the rescue, but it was on an ad hoc basis.  But my work helped to provide the theoretical, analytical foundations.  And we did it because--and I said, it's highly technical, but it got started back in 1970 when we knew Penn Central [Railroad] was going to go bankrupt.  The [Richard M.] Nixon administration, for political reasons, since Penn Central was a big contributor, wanted the Federal Reserve to step in and rescue Penn Central by providing more liquidity.  And they wanted to do it under the Defense Production Act which was left over from World War II, used a little bit in the Korean War, whereby the, if a business can't get money from a bank or any other lenders, if they make a case for national defense dependence, they can borrow from the Federal Reserve.  We were ask to let--to approve the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia lending money to Penn Central.  We had our bank examiners and appraisers look at it, and they said--one of the conditions of the law is that they have to have bankable securities or something to back the loan.  And they could have mortgaged the properties, for example.  But they must be viable.  Our examiners told us they are not bankable, they don't have good assets and the activities in which they're engaged are not defense related.  And they said they were hauling stuff for the Navy.  That was nonsense.  It was a huge real estate operation that, that, operated down in Florida that pushed them into bankruptcy.  So we said, no.  So we knew on Thursday that Penn Central will fail on Monday because it had, what was then a huge amount of commercial paper outstanding, $50 million, that was coming due and they wouldn't be able to roll it over.  And so we put in place a, a scheme whereby the--we, we urged the commercial banks--and by the way, we knew that if, when Penn Central failed, this is going to be a shock to the commercial paper market.  Other companies would not be able--who also had paper rolling over, coming due, and they couldn't roll it over or pay huge jump in interest rates and other conditions.  So we told the banks in New York particularly--and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was the, was our messenger and to work it out, that the banks could, should lend to the corporations to replace their commercial paper.  They should take the credit risks, but the Federal Reserve would provide the liquidity.  We did it not to save any particular business, but to save the commercial paper market.  We didn't save Penn Cen-, Penn, Penn Central went bankrupt.  But we did save the market.  And that's one, and that was the first example and I provided the framework on the--George Mitchell joined with me in that, but I took the lead in putting that together.  We had another example in 1974 when we had a, the failure of a big finance company in New York, which also owned a bank, which also owned a--had a branch in London.  There the question was the availability of Euro-dollars.  We knew that when the company--and we, we turned down the application for the finance company.  We said that the finance company, which was a holding company and whose bank was Franklin National Bank out of Long Island, which had ballooned--two years before, Franklin had total assets of a billion dollars.  By 1974, Franklin had total assets of $5 billion of which a billion dollars was matched by liability, but the billion dollars was in London in paper.  So we knew that when Franklin failed in the U.S., the corporate deposits would run off out of the bank and the Euro-Dollars would run off in London, a drain.  So we approved--we recognized that as an exposure to the system, that aspect of the banking system.  The counterpart of the run off of commercial paper in the U.S. was the run off of Euro-Dollars in the Euro-Dollar market in Europe.  So we applied the theory and practice I described which helped shape, and again, Franklin went down, but we allowed the Euro-Dollar market to continue to exist.  And frankly, you saw--that was one of Allan Greenspan's first tasks when he became Chairman of the Federal Reserve in 1987.  There was a huge drop in the, in the stock market, price in the stock.  And the, and the Dow Jones Industrial [Average] dropped 500 points in one day.  But Allan stepped in, following the procedure we'd worked out years earlier, and said, "The Federal Reserve will provide whatever liquidity is needed to, to safeguard the system."  We saw it again at 9-11 where Roger Ferguson, the Vice Chairman, put out a one-line statement that afternoon, saying, "The Federal Reserve is open.  We will provide whatever liquidity that is needed."  By that time, of course, it was routine, the public understood, but back in 1970, that was not a, a posture.  So that's the main thing I did in my Federal Reserve experience.  So I would hope they would mention that series of actions as, as Number three.
Speaker 1: This is slightly different, but how, sir, would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That--if someone should say, "Andy Brimmer had a soft heart, but a harder head." (chuckle)
