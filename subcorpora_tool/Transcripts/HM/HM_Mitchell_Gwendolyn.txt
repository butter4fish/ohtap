Story_ID: 110011
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, now I'm gonna ask you about your family history to start off, and I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side of the family.  I'm gonna start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Franzelle Costella Mitchell, Franzelle, F-R-A-N-Z-E-L-L-E, Costella, C-O-S-T-E-L-L-A, Mitchell, M-I-T-C-H-E-L-L.
Speaker 1: Is Costella her maiden name?
Speaker 2: My mother is a double Mitchell.  So she was a Mitchell before she married, and retained her name when she married my father [Herman M. Mitchell, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  What is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in Cass County, Texas on January 24th, 1929.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about her side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: My mother's family has been able to trace its family tree, or our roots, about seven generations.  From her father's grandmother I believe.
Speaker 1: So her great-grandmother, grandmother.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yes, her great-grandmother, which was her, her name was Frances.  She is the--is the ancestor that we trace my mother's family to.
Speaker 1: Okay, where did they live?
Speaker 2: My mother is--her family is from Texas, and she is one of--she was one of nine children born to Walter S. Mitchell and Lugenie Frances Turner Mitchell.
Speaker 1: Okay, now was the ancestor Frances from Texas too?
Speaker 2: The family history says that they--my--that--my--our ancestor Frances was from Georgia.  There was a Mitchell plantation in Georgia that they found records of, of that can accurately be said this was our family.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: So she was a slave on a plantation in Georgia near Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Is, is there a story about how the family moved to Texas or why?
Speaker 2: I'm not quite sure when, but I guess I need to read--my, my cousin, my great-cousin N. G. Nelson [ph.], has--also he's, he's been our family historian and has documented a lot of the movement of our family.  And what is said is that Ella, who was my grandfather--my mother's father, her--Walter's mother, moved to Georgia with my--from Georgia to Texas.  There were like three siblings that moved.  So it was Ella and Andrew and I think they say George stayed behind, but he was one of the brothers.  Ella, Andrew and--
Speaker 1: So that's like after the Civil War I guess that they--or--
Speaker 2: Right, around the--after, right.  Late 1800s.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there--so there's not--you don't know the reason why they moved to Texas rather than stay in Georgia.  Do you or do you--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Where's my book?
Speaker 1: You don't have to read it out of the book--just--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So we're just trying to get the stories from the family that passes down.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And you know, that black folks moved all over the United States.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: For different re--re--reasons, so this--
Speaker 2: It was, I think, opportunity.  You know I mean they--but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you know the thing--in Texas where my grandparents, where, where my mother's family settled, you know and they still have a, a lot of land that's there in Cass County and Bivins, Texas, which is the far east Texas, closer to Louisiana.  The, the family--most of them stayed, you know a lot of them stayed like in that region.  But then we had relatives that then relocated to Louisiana, and then went up to Indiana.  And then from there we had relatives like that moved from Texas to California.  Just like it, it's--you know it was farming and you know, just the hard--so they, you know, were able to get better opportunities away from that area.
Story_ID: 110012
Speaker 1: Now are there any stories that your, your mother [Franzelle C. Mitchell] told you, your grandparents told you about, about life that, that they passed down through the family about struggles or triumphs, or--
Speaker 2: Well my mother's father [Walter S. Mitchell, Sr.] was an educator, he was a teacher, he was a principal in fact.  And so he I guess ran the, the colored school in, in that area.  A couple of his cousins were also teachers, like Serea [ph.].  There were two older cousins that were teachers in that area.  And so the, the one thing that they always tell us that you know, we have a family of educators, particularly on my mother's father's side.  And my grandmother, my mother's mother Lugenie [Turner Mitchell], her sister Viola, was also a teacher.  So that, that's one thing that--with that generation they found it was very important to, to--if they could be educated, that they were and that their children were all going to be educated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my grandmother's family, the Turners, were basically farmers.  And you know in that area.  So they found--you know like that that was--you had to feed your family so you needed to know what to do with a plot of land.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now well tell us about your--so your mother grew up on a farm bas--basically.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In a rural.
Speaker 2: In a rural area.
Speaker 1: Rural Texas and Cass County, Texas, okay.  Did they own their own land, or were they--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Re--renting? Okay.
Speaker 2: No, they owned their own property.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 110013
Speaker 1: Now tell us about your father's side of the family.  If you can give us his full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: My father's name is Herman Melvin Mitchell.  And Herman, H-E-R-M-A-N, Melvin, M-E-L-V-I-N, Mitchell, M-I-T-C-H-E-L-L.  I guess he's a junior.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what's his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, January 24th--27th--my father was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on January 27th, 1931.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right now, now what do you know about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: My father's family, his father [Herman M. Mitchell, Sr.] was brought to Pittsburgh when he was a boy.  His grandfather moved to the Pittsburgh area from Virginia and let's see, who worked for Heinz?  I know one of--I need to put my family--my father's family in perspective.  So they moved, both of them, I guess, okay, let's see.  I believe that both of my grand--who worked for Heinz?  John Poe, okay.  I've got--should I start again?
Speaker 1: No, we, we don't, we don't cut anything, it goes straight through anyway.  We don't edit and--
Speaker 2: Really, okay.
Speaker 1: So one of your relatives worked for Heinz, we know this, right.
Speaker 2: Yes, well it was my, my, my father's mother's father and mother worked for Heinz.  John Poe and Lucy--Elizabeth Poe.
Speaker 1: So your great-grandparents--
Speaker 2: My great-grandparents--
Speaker 1: Moved to
Speaker 2: Moved to Pittsburgh from Virginia.
Speaker 1: Pittsburgh from Virginia, and worked for Heinz.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And the father worked for Heinz I guess, the mother too or just the father?
Speaker 2: I've got to now find out.  You know, I thought I knew.
Speaker 1: Probably the father, yes you know.  In those days.
Speaker 2: But when my grandmother was--she was like working the house and you know like with Sarah Jane, in the Sarah Jane House [Sarah Heinz House], which was I guess the house where the Heinz had lived, and this house was relocated from wherever it originally was and it moved up the river, like as part of a historical--
Speaker 1: --wait a minute now.  You're saying something fast, I think we need to slow down.  One of your ancestors worked directly for the Heinzes.
Speaker 2: For the Heinzes.
Speaker 1: Not for the company, not, not the soup company, but for the Heinzes themselves.
Speaker 2: Right, for the Heinzes.
Speaker 1: The Heinz family.  All right that the soup, the same soup Heinz, right?
Speaker 2: Right, the same.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they're rich and--
Speaker 2: And we're not.  And it is said that--my grandfather, and I really need to find this out.  Was that my, my father's grand--mother's father actually was a chef for the Heinz Company.  And that, that he had to pick--that he created the pickle recipe, and that--money, there was an exchange.  I mean they say there was an exchange of money.  That my, my grandfather was actually you know, got--gave, gave the rights to this recipe to Heinz.  And you know was paid a substant--you know a, a substantial amount of money for his, his work and services.  And--
Speaker 1: So he contributed to the legacy of Heinz Foods by creating some foods.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right some pickles or something, okay, all right.  That's a good story.
Speaker 2: It's a great story and I--that's--it's been very--it's been--I, I've had--I had--I've had a desire to really kind of look at this.  Not just to trace my family's history, but you know just to look at the accurate records of what happened to, you know, African Americans who, you know kind of made the migration with the family.  'Cause Heinz themselves, they were from Virginia.  So I believe that when their family relocated, you know they had folks that came that were working with them, that also moved.  And so maybe that was what brought my parent--my father's family to the Pennsylvania.  I mean because they moved actually to work for Heinz is my understanding.
Speaker 1: So these would be your father's grandparents?
Speaker 2: My father's grandparents.
Speaker 1: So these your great-grandparents.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So and you say--you're saying that they actually lived in the Heinz home?  Or, or lived--
Speaker 2: Right.  My grandmother, my father's mother Eva Elizabeth Poe, was born in the Sarah Jane Heinz House.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Sarah Jane Heinz House is the ancestral home of the Heinz family.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: I guess, okay, all right.
Story_ID: 110014
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is that [Sarah Heinz House] some kind of a landmark now in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: There are a number of the historical houses that like, that Heinz--that they have kept and have relocated close to--you know maybe in (unclear) but you know not far from where they originally were.  The plant itself is right in Pittsburgh, but the home is not located right there at the plant.  So it was a--but they said they moved the house to a area with other homes that they were preserving.
Speaker 1: Okay, sort of like a Greenfield Village-type situation where you move all the things to one--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Historical homes in one spot, okay.  All right well that's interesting.  Now what, what else do you know about 'em?
Speaker 2: Well I do know that after my [great] grandfather--this is John Poe, my father's mother's father, had started his business.  He was--and this was like in the early '30s [1930s], in the 1930s, you know.  Because my father [Herman M. Mitchell, Jr.] remembers his grandfather.  That he was--I'm not--I, I really wanna find the dates, but it may, may have been later than that.  It might have been in the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: This your father's grandfather?
Speaker 2: This is my father's grandfather.  He had then started his own like cart and horse.  You know like that he had, had a, a business that he sold products on the street, you know I guess a vendor, he was a vendor.  You know.
Speaker 1: Okay on the street and he had a cart and a horse?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This was in the '40s [1940s]?
Speaker 2: I guess--my, my parents re--you didn't have--it wasn't a car.  I think he said it 'cause they still did this in the '30s [1930s] and whatnot.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah they had carts and horses, yeah.
Speaker 2: And I remember some, you know like just in general like as, as a child.  But you know I mean that was like--but you know going up the street selling, but--
Speaker 1: What, what did he peddle, or what, what did he sell?
Speaker 2: Household goods is what I believe they said.  But he was killed.
Speaker 1: How, how, how?
Speaker 2: By a streetcar that--something happened that, that alarmed his horse and he was--and, and it could have been just a trolley came that alarmed the horse and my fath--grandfather somehow had fallen and you know had--was cut in half by the streetcar.  And he was taken to the Pittsburgh Hospital which is--that's what it was called, the Pittsburgh Hospital in East Liberty section.  And what they say is that like he was not treated, you know because he was an African American.  And they--you know like they say he died out in the hall, you know like in that hospital.  And he died on Christmas day whatever year this was.  You know they, they tell that story of my, my father's grandfather. You know it's unfortunate that you know, but you know but the thing is you know like how my [great] grandmother, you know like mourned that whole time.  Like she wouldn't let--I guess the celebration of Christmas.  You know she wasn't going to--
Speaker 1: This is your grandmother or your--
Speaker 2: My great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Great-grandmother.
Speaker 2: My great-grandmother Poe.  That for years that she, you know kind of like kept in mourning on Christmas because of that.  And so they would, you know, kind of be solemn and then like kind of later in the day would allow, you know, the presents and gifts.  Just out of respect for my grandfather's memory.  But you know the thing I--you know I, I really--I, I, I, I'm regret that I have bits and pieces and I--my father's family, he's one of seven children, he was.  And he's a good historian for his family.  I mean he, he knows a lot.  So I really need to just kind of you know gather some more information, you know, from him.  And then his--one of his siblings was able to do that.  But so that I can actually, you know it's good to tell and know the story.  So I can, you know, really be able to share this accurately, you know with, with my family and you know, children.  So--but that--I guess that's why now you know we, we have this thing that we can write things down, you know.  We need to really document.
Speaker 1: Just for the record, you all have, you have a family tree that's been developed and a couple of publications for the family.  I mean, so the history, a lot of your history is written, is written down.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes it is.
Story_ID: 110015
Speaker 1: We don't expect you to read it in this interview or anything, but just give us a couple highlights or something, you know.  That's, that's about it.  We don't, we don't want you to--it doesn't have to be, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it's fascinating to really know and you know, to be able to articulate it.  But one thing that they say about my [great] grandfather John [Poe], he was a good looking man.  I, you know we had his picture was always in, in our house.  Just a, a--just a tall, dark man with this big, full moustache and he would go to Canada in summers, you know to work.  Because he was able to make money, you know working in--as a chef with people would travel and maybe migrant workers.  I'm not, you know, sure.  But like you know, we do have pictures, you know of him like going back to Canada and--
Speaker 1: What was his name, John--
Speaker 2: John Poe.
Speaker 1: John Poe, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And then my father's father who was Herman Mitchell, Sr., was a postman in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], so he was--this is on the other side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay that was a, a big job in those days for black folks, you could be a postman.  I mean so many people with degrees ended up in the post office.
Speaker 2: In fact he did have a degree from Carnegie Institute, which is now Carnegie Mellon [University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], that he, you know and they--that was what he could do, unfortunately.  He could not--
Speaker 1: Couldn't find a job doing anything else.  What was his degree in, do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, but he was a post--a postman in Pittsburgh.
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 110016
Speaker 1: Now, well tell us something about your--I'm gonna ask you about your mother's personality and your father's.  But how did they meet?  How did they, how did they meet, is there a story?
Speaker 2: My father [Herman M. Mitchell, Jr.] and my mother [Franzella C. Mitchell] met in Texas.  My father was in the [U.S.] Army and was stationed near El Paso [Texas].  And he says he went to this barbershop to get his hair cut.  And he asked the barber--he wanted to number one, you know, find a church in the area to go to.  And he also wanted to know where he can get a good meal.  And so the barber said well there's this restaurant you should go over, you're not far from here.  And the barber happened to be my mother's oldest brother Harold Mitchell.  And my mother just happened to be a waitress in this restaurant that my father went to have a meal.  So he seemed to frequent that restaurant--
Story_ID: 110017
Speaker 1: You were telling us about your parents meeting in El Paso, Texas.
Speaker 2: In El--my parents met in El Paso, Texas when my father [Herman M. Mitchell, Jr.] was stationed there.  He was in the [U.S.] Army.  And my mother [Franzelle C. Mitchell] was working at a restaurant.  And he loved her cooking and kept coming back.  So that, that's the story their--that, that--of their meeting.
Speaker 1: Now what year is this?  Is this--
Speaker 2: This is in I guess 1950, '51 [1951], '50 [1950], '50 [1950].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my father graduated from Allegheny High School in Pittsburgh in 1950, I guess, the early class.  And then went on to, to the Army after that.  In fact he talks about a trip that he took with a couple of his friends coming to Chicago [Illinois].  And they--I think one of them had this car, and this may have been like my dad, his friends were all like my uncles.  So there was Uncle, you know now I can't remember any of my Uncles' names.  Uncle Turk [ph.], Uncle Turk, and there was, there was Red.  He relocated here in, in Chicago.  And then Uncle Morris who was like my dad's best friend.  They all lived--my dad and Uncle Morris, they lived across the street from each other in Pittsburgh on Pier Street.  And he says that they had a car accident.  And maybe they might have been drinking or doing something they shouldn't have been, but the car was totaled.  And they all came away without a scratch.  And I think that changed--I know that was something very significant in my father's life that changed, you know like just the way he thought about things and his thinking.  He says that was like a turning point look at that.  He would never drink.  If, if he, if he had to that point I think that was something that helped to let him know that alcohol was not something he wanted as a part of his life.  So it was always--
Speaker 1: Now that is miraculous for those days because the cars had no seatbelts and had metal dashboards and steering wheels that would impale you, you know and they were--you know it was a lot of--yeah, the glass wasn't even safety glass I don't think in those days.
Speaker 2: I'm sure it wasn't.  Yeah, so it was like a miracle somewhat that, that they all survived and you know were basically unharmed.  And, and then from there he joined the Army and started the rest of his life.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he met your mother in El Paso, Texas.  Did they--were they together a long time be-before they got married, or--
Speaker 2: They were--I guess they--I don't think, not that long, you know.  I don't know what kind of courtship if they--what they had.
Speaker 1: Did they get married in Texas?
Speaker 2: And they got married in Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my older sister was born in Texas.
Story_ID: 110018
Speaker 1: Now tell us about your mother's personality.  What, you know, how did your mother grow up and did she have a chance to go to school and what kind of person was your mother, or, or is your mother and what did she do?
Speaker 2: Well my mother, Franzelle Mitchell is a--she's a re--she was a teacher.  And she was a home economics teacher.
Speaker 1: How did she grow up?  Did she, she, she grew up in a rural area.
Speaker 2: In a rural area.  She, like if--I guess if you look at the division of what, you know like the roles that the family--naturally would assume or maybe not so naturally.  You know she was always identified as the, the cook or you know like someone who would--as opposed to her sister who was a year older than her, my Aunt Eleanor was the bookworm.  So like she wasn't gone be caught in the kitchen, but she would be caught with her nose in a book.  But my mom had no problems of doing whatever she needed, you know in--to--prepare a meal, you know.  And, and she's always--has had quite a comfort and ease around that.  I guess that's one reason why it was easy for her to go into home economics and in fact she was a food service coordinator before--what do--let's see what is it.  A nutritionist, she was a nutritionist for the county when she first moved to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] with my dad.  So she worked for the county as a nutritionist.
Speaker 1: Where did she go to school.
Speaker 2: She graduate--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: My mother went to Bivins.  She went to Bishop, my mother went to Bishop College and when Bishop College was located in Marshall, Texas.  She's a graduate of Bishop College.  My father [Herman M. Mitchell, Jr.] went to--he, he had a few years at Pitt [University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] when he came back, but he didn't graduate from college.  But my mother, she's, she's a easygoing, you know, kind of person.  We always thought she was very strict, though.  You know you--my father may have been the one that would, would make us laugh or, or people would come to the house, you know, he would kind of have the humor.  And my mother was kind of like the stern face to kind of give you the once over before she say okay, you're all right, you can come on in.  But once you came in, she was gonna sit you down at her dining room table and be sure that you, you had a, an ample meal.
Story_ID: 111192
Speaker 1: Well you were telling us about your mother [Franzelle C. Mitchell].  And well is--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother, she was basically a homebody.  I, you know she has a, a little scar over her lip and she tells the story how like her brothers were playing ball, you know with sticks and balls in the, in the yard or whatever.  And she was out there and you know when--I think her brother, I'm not gonna say a name 'cause I might have the wrong one, but one of her brothers hit the ball and then threw the bat or the thing, the stick and you know, cut her lip.  So I think that might have deterred the rest of her athletic career 'cause she said I'm not gonna get hurt anymore.  So she was, you know, you know, you know never one to be real athletic.  But she, she still has those strong country roots.
Story_ID: 111193
Speaker 1: Okay, now tell us about your father [Herman M. Mitchell, Jr.].  What was his personality like and did he have a--you said he went to University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] for a while, for a minute?
Speaker 2: Right.  My father--
Speaker 1: Did he grow up in Pittsburgh?
Speaker 2: Grew up in Pittsburgh.  He grew up in the East Liberty section, which is on the east side of the city.  And then the family relocated on the north side and he graduated from Allegheny High School.  He was always a--loved to sing.  I mean he was a musician all his life as far as he, he sang, he directed the choir when he was in high school was an, you know, actor, and just did, you know, kind of things that put him in the spotlight.  And he was very outgoing and always had a--still does, just a, just a wonderful, outgoing personality.  So my parents complement each other very well.  My mother [Franzelle C. Mitchell] now I think she will challenge my father a bit more, you know.  She's not gonna be the person on the sidelines like she was, you know.  But they, they were both very active in church and community.  My father was a police officer.  He worked for the City of Pittsburgh for thirty years I believe, he retired after thirty years.  He, he started in '57 [1957], '58 [1958], '57 [1957].  I think he joined the force in '57 [1957]--
Story_ID: 111194
Speaker 1: Did he [Herman M. Mitchell, Jr.] have any stories about trying to get on the force?  I mean when he joined the force, were there a lot of black people on the police force?
Speaker 2: When my father joined the force, there were not a lot of African Americans.  There may have been a handful.  I mean there were a couple that he talks about that were there, you know that were--forerunners.  And when he joined, it wasn't as--it was unusual because there was prejudice and, and there still, you know, obstacles.  But you know he was able to get--join the force.  He started out as a patr--a motorcycle cop.  And, and he was al--after that he was, you know, beat cop, he had a good beat downtown.  Worked the arena, the Civic Arena.  And when we were kids, he would do security at the arena sometimes and we'd get free tickets to concerts.  So there were a few perks that might, may have came with the job.  But one thing that my father was instrumental, he was one of the original--one of the founding members of the Guardians of Greater Pittsburgh, which was a, a organization of African American police officers that really wanted to help improve the conditions of, of, of police officers who were African Americans, and for women too.  I mean they, you know, helping with issues with African Americans also looked at the limitations that they had for women as well 'cause women were not part of the force.  Short people, you know, you were saying, weren't part of the force.  So if you weren't, you know, a particular type of person, you know you could not be el--you were not eligible to join.  But the Guardians were a organization that really were formed in the late '60s [1960s] just to look at the issues in our community. Number one, that police officers were not welcome, generally in the community.  So like they wanted to look at the African American presence that you know we are here to support our community, but we're also here to make a difference with--within the ranks to be sure that advancement took place.  And 1968 I believe, my father became sergeant.  And like he was one of four African Americans that, you know were, that became--that you know took the exam and you know actually were promoted at that time, which was a real milestone in, in the life of, you know, the Pittsburgh Police Department [Pittsburgh Bureau of Police].  There were like maybe four or six, you know four to--between four and six officers that were promoted with him at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, and he eventually became a commander, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He was a commander of--when he retired.  And also he was over community policing.  He was head of the community policing department before he retired.  In fact, he--I think the--what they developed in Pittsburgh became a model for some of the community policing throughout the country to look at what that meant and just a different way that police interacted with, with the community and with people.
Speaker 1: How did they--do you know very much about how they set that up in, in Pittsburgh?  That's kind of an important aspect of crime prevention, you don't hear a lot about it.  Black police officers have been really instrumental in developing co--community policing.  Lee P. Brown is one of the authorities and I think Leroy O'Shield here in the city and then we know about.  What, what did they do in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]?  How did they set it up, do you know?  Did they have community meetings with the officers, or did they--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I really don't know the infrastructure.  But I mean I, I think they had a board, you know that they would work with--within the districts.  But I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Of citizens?
Speaker 2: Of--yeah.  Well that was a whole separate thing.  'Cause then they would have the citizens' review board, but the community policing itself really was a--designed to, you know put programs, you know as well within the communities that would help with the social issues, you know with the non--
Speaker 1: Right, right.  It has a crime prevention--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Rather than just arresting people and they deal with crime pre--prevention, which is what most people want.  They want crime to stop rather--I mean you know, you know before it starts, actually.  It's better than--to have folks arrested afterwards.  So, okay.
Story_ID: 111195
Speaker 1: All right, well tell me about growing up, now.  We--now we're on the real story, this is your story now.  What was growing up like?  I mean you grew up in the--what did you call your neighborhood?  The--
Speaker 2: Well I grew up in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and we were in East Liberty when we first--when I was a child.
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well there was a--well you--in Pittsburgh it was the mills, so you always--there was smoke, you know, smoke stacks all around you.  The thing--wherever we had to go, you had to cross a river, and you still do.  And go past two or three steel mills to--so like they, they mark their territory.  We--when I was a young girl, we lived with my great-grandmother Poe on Butler Street, which was right across from the Allegheny River.  So I always enjoyed looking out the, the front window just watching the, the boats and the barges go up and down the river.  Now we never really kind of, you know we would, you know, sometimes would take, take a, a walk over there, but, you know, seemed like the river was still like far away.  You know, it wasn't--even though we could see it outside our window, it wasn't, you know, we couldn't just go down to the bank and, you know, put our, put our pole in.  We--you know the river was still kind of off limits.  I don't know in a city like--in a city you know like there's so much industry and you know like things that kind of prevented you from really having access to the water.  But it was still nice to, to see it.  And the funny thing, like we lived across the street, you know like across the river from like the north side.  And whenever you would travel in Pittsburgh, you know, see like my dad [Herman M. Mitchell, Jr.]--he would take us on trips and we thought we were really going somewhere.  We really just went across town.  But I guess the way he took us, you know just seemed like it--we were going on this, this little excursion.  But we probably went across the bridge that was like out our door, may not have been as long.  So that was always fun you know, kind of thing we went--he would take us on adventures and you know we're just going across town to visit, you know, one of our relatives.  But I grew up--I'm one of eight children.  And I'm number three, I was the third oldest daughter.  My parents had five girls before they had any boys.  So my sisters and I, the five before we had the rest of 'em, you know we would do whatever was needed.  My dad was always building something on the house.  So if he need somebody to clear wood and carry bricks, you know he had us.  So that, that was fun, it was always fun to be a helper, either with my dad or my mom [Franzelle C. Mitchell].  We have always been a close family and so we still get together, you know as often as we can for holidays and both my family--my parents' families have reunions that we gather, you know there when we can.  Growing up, we would have Thanksgivings with my mother's family.  My mother had nine siblings, there were nine of them in their family.  And so everybody outside of Texas would get together.  So we had uncles in Chicago [Illinois], my aunt, my mother's sister was in Cleveland [Ohio], and then for a while we had one of her bro--uncles, one of my uncles was in New York.  So they would either come to our house in Pittsburgh, or we'd go to Cleveland or we'd come to Chicago.  So that was a nice routine growing up, that you know we still kind of treasure that.  So I got to get--have a good association with my cousins here in Chicago and you know kind of looked forward to travel for that.  I have two brothers and my, my brother Herman who's the middle boy or whatever, his--he was the first boy after all these girls.  We just adored him.  We adore both our brothers.  But we got to, you know like just play big sister to our brothers.  So I kind of always enjoyed that.  'Cause he was the one I could walk to school when I was the big sister and I could walk him and his little friends to school.
Story_ID: 111196
Speaker 1: But, you know, we had a normal childhood, you know.  We'd go to church on Sundays.
Speaker 2: What denomination were you?
Speaker 1: We went to Rodman Street [Missionary] Baptist Church [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], which is still my family, my--you know the, the church that I'll go to when I go home to visit my parents.  And the church that I am expected to be seen in when I come back on Sundays, which is fine.  'Cause there's still elders and folks that, you know just some of my contemporaries that I grew up with that, you know we'll get together.  But you know religion and you know church and--has been very important in our family's life.  And my mother's [Franzelle C. Mitchell] family, they, they--you know like they're--(unclear) where they were able to even found a few church congregations as they would travel to be sure that they would also if there was not a church there, that they would establish it.  To be sure that that was a, a sort of like background.  Now my dad [Herman M. Mitchell, Jr.]--it's interesting 'cause he grew up in--he's, he's a member of Rodman Street Baptist Church; that's where he brought my mother when they moved to Pittsburgh.  But his father [Herman M. Mitchell, Sr.] was a Presbyterian and he was even a founding member of--now whatever--I can't think of the name.  But the church in Homewood [Pennsylvania].  There was a, a Presbyterian church that's still there.  And my mother--my grandmother--his--Eva [Poe Mitchell], his mom, was a member of a United Methodist church on the hill.  So like here they are two different sides of town, and I guess my father chose to go to school--to church with his best friend.  Where all the young ladies were.  And so it was a nice fit.  And so like he kind of was the balance between my, my grandparents who, you know, like kept their, you know even though like in their union, they, they still honored the fact that they each had a, a different general denomination that they, they would subscribe to, I guess.
Story_ID: 111197
Speaker 1: Okay, now what did like to do when you were coming up and what kind of a little girl were you?
Speaker 2: I think I was a--I was pretty quiet growing up.  I mean I, I was like whatever my sister--I had my, my sister Frances who was a year older than me, I think I was just like I'd follow her around and do whatever she wanted to do.  We had a good friend that lived across the street from us, Christine.  And so I was just like glad that they'd let me be part of their little circle, you know so I would--I really, you know do things with my sister Frances.  But we went to the Y [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)] every summer.  Summers, we were members of the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association(YWCA)].  So we would go to the local Y and then a couple days a week we'd go take the bus downtown or you know like to the, the Big Y downtown.  They had swimming and things.  That was one thing that I always enjoyed.  And summers, you know I loved to go to the library, you know, we were always encouraged to read and so the, the best place for us to go was you know like take your--take, take a walk to the library, which was a nice little trek.  It wasn't like up the street, but it sent us on an adventure.  So that was one thing I always enjoyed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were your favorite books?  What kind of books did you like to read?
Speaker 2: Well I liked to read--I used to read those nurse books.  There were stories about the nurse--I can't even think what they are now.  My cousin had a series of books I would, you know, read her books.  When I was in eight--like eighth grade, I know I read my, my older sister's literature, whatever she was reading.  I remember when I was in eighth grade I read like "The Fire Next Time."  Let's see no, not that, not that one.
Speaker 1: James Baldwin.
Speaker 2: I think I read that like when I was in high school, but "Manchild in the Promised Land," Claude Brown.  I remember reading something I probably wasn't supposed to read at that age but it, you know it was entertaining her, so--but, but just in general.  I mean I--I don't know.  I'm, I, I still love fairy tales you know.  I think I would read those you know, when I have grandchildren and whatnot, just you know, just because it's just fun, fun reading.  I always like happy ending kind of stories.
Story_ID: 111198
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's see.  So now where did you go to grade school?
Speaker 2: My elementary school, I went to Lemington Elementary School [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And that--I went from like my, my kindergarten year we lived on Butler Street, so I went to Morningside.  And then we moved to Lincoln Avenue and then I went to Lemington Elementary School.  And from Lemington I went to a program like instead of graduating in eighth grade, I was--started a program I guess they call it the Scholars Program, with maybe ten of my classmates there.  And we kind of were just moved into the high school.  So we started junior high in the eighth, in eighth grade in this program at high school.  So I always felt like a little cheated 'cause I never graduated from eighth grade and had my picture with the rest of the class in front of Lemington Elementary School.
Speaker 1: So, so you had to start all over again as an eighth grader in high school.  And so at the bottom of the rung instead of reaching the top rung, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  So that, that was--
Speaker 1: That is a rite of passage to get to the eighth grade and then you look back.
Speaker 2: And graduate.
Speaker 1: On all the little kids that--but you--they took you out before you got a chance to do it.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So but it was a privilege.  I mean it's a program that, you know they--I think this was the first year they started the program, so--and I guess it's something that has--is part of the school system now.  But we were like the first group of scholars that they identified.
Speaker 1: So you were a good student.
Speaker 2: I tried to be.  Not the--I was--I wasn't always the best student, but I, I did work at it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well you got the honors, you know so you must have been pretty good.  So are there any teachers that you remember at, at Lemington that were significant?
Speaker 2: There were a few. My fifth grade teacher was--her name was Mrs. McCrumb [ph.].  And I would--she would read stories to us every week.  So I remember her and then like we would follow along.  You know like we'd get the books, but reading like "The Secret Garden" [by Frances Hodgson Burnett] was like our--for me it was like the treat of the week when she would say okay it's time to open the book.  So I think maybe that--might have been on Fridays of the week that she would, you know open that and read to us.  I remember her reading that.  I think we read "The Hobbit" [by J. R. R. Tolkien].  So she made me--I think books exciting for me.  Just to, you know that act of sharing a story was always nice.  We had the librarian at Lemington, this--Bitner [ph.] I believe her name was.  And she lived just beyond us up on our street, on Lincoln Avenue.  So it would be fun sometimes if you ever see a teacher that they'd actually walk home with you.  But I remember being a library helper sometimes with Ms. Bitner.  My mother [Franzelle C. Mitchell] was a teacher, so teachers knew who we were as children.  So we always kind of had to be on our Ps and Qs 'cause you know they know your people, so--but that wasn't, that wasn't a hard thing for me to do.  I tried to do that anyway.  And the other--a couple, couple teachers that, you know, had impact on me was--one was Mr. Nicholas [ph.] who was the seventh grade teacher and the spelling teacher.  He was an encourager, you know I just always felt that you know like if you got--not necessarily approval, but you know 'cause they, they all--all--they always made you work hard.  But they--he was gonna challenge you to do what you had to do.  And the other one was Ms. Barry was our reading teacher.  And she was the heart of Lemington, Ms. Barry.
Story_ID: 111199
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, now what about high school?  You went to, I think, Westinghouse [High School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] first?
Speaker 2: I went to Westinghouse for a few years and then my family moved away from East Liberty to a place called New Homestead [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and took us on the other side of town.  But I went to Westinghouse for three years through tenth grade.  And there I guess one of my teachers, Ms. Carpenter [ph.] who was also a English teacher, was just, you know I, I just enjoyed going to her classes and doing things.  Now I think the most challenging teacher was my Algebra teacher, Ms. Peeler [ph.] who like when in eighth grade I know I didn't do as well as I should have 'cause I had to go to summer school that year.  But I realized you know after the fact that you know, even though we talked--I talked about her.  My sister, my older sister said Ms. Peeler, you know she's just a hard teacher.  You know, I ended up you know kind of liking her and just respecting her for being a hard teacher because I, you know I probably learned a few things despite my, you know whatever, you know my performance in her class.  So--but I've all--I've always enjoyed school.  I had--loved art and, and music and--
Story_ID: 111200
Speaker 1: Did you play an instrument?
Speaker 2: No, I sang.  I tried--I had a couple of years of piano class and guess I just didn't have the diligence.  You know I'm thinking I, I you know, my--I can't blame my parents, but I'm thinking if y'all just stayed on me and you know made me do that, maybe I'd learned how to play, I'd know how to play the piano today.  My oldest sister was the piano player, so she was a musician.  Now we sang and my father [Herman M. Mitchell, Jr.] was a, you know, a musician.  And he sang and he even directed the choir at church.  But growing up my sisters and I specifically, and then a little later my brothers would join us.  But my sisters and I would sing.  We were like--sang at teas and Sunday socials.
Speaker 1: So you had a little group, you had four-part--
Speaker 2: We had a little group.
Speaker 1: You, you had some harm--harmony going.
Speaker 2: Harmony and--so and that, that was, that was I guess one of the things we'll be remembered as, the, the Mitchell, the Mitchell Singers or whatever we were.  But--and that, that helped I think just being in an environment where you were expected and maybe kind of put in front of people made it a little easier just growing up that I don't think any of us are, are really shy or afraid to stand in front of a crowd.  And I don't think it really just started with my dad.  It may have--I know it started with my, my grandmother [Eva Poe Mitchell], his mother.  I think she was an elocutionist, and she would go around and, and, and do recitations and when I decided to go to college, back to college, my dad--I, I was liv--I lived in Texas for a number of years and I moved back to Pennsylvania.  And my dad had a tape in the car.  And he said let me let you--let me let you listen to something.  And he put this in and it was my grandmother--and she had been dead a couple of years already--reciting Paul Laurence Dunbar.  And it was just--I said she's speaking to me.  You know there she was, it's like Gwendolyn, you know go on this journey.  But we--my grandmother always would recite and you know we--that would be like just the treat to go over to her house or wherever she was and, and listen to her, you know, recite her poetry.
Speaker 1: What was her name, which one?
Speaker 2: This was Eva, Eva Elizabeth Poe Mitchell, my father's mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And because of that I think she is, you know, my, my dad you know has a love for, for language and you know he would recite Edgar Allen Poe to us and "The Raven" and things.  And then I know his sister Meryl [ph.], kind of now has found a gift and, and the same thing that her mother does.  She has a beautiful voice and you know same mannerisms as her mom and so that, that, that's nice.  But I just said my grandmother Eva maybe had something to do with my love of words and, and poetry.
Story_ID: 111201
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you say your family moved to a place called New Homestead [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: New Homestead.
Speaker 1: Now what's the significance of New Homestead because I think a lot of people around the country, black folks have heard of homestead, the Homestead neighborhood in Pittsburgh.  They had the baseball team.
Speaker 2: Right, the Homestead Grays.
Speaker 1: The Homestead Grays.  It was the traditional neighborhood that August Wilson writes about now, you know, homestead.
Speaker 2: No, August Wilson writes about Homewood and The Hill [District], he'll write about The Hill.
Speaker 1: Okay, but not, not Homestead.
Speaker 2: He may ,in some references made to Home--but you know like his, his neighborhood was The Hill, which was--that, that was--overlooked the city.  And the [Pittsburgh] Crawfords were like the Pittsburgh team.  There was the Homestead Grays and the Pittsburgh Crawfords.
Speaker 1: Pittsburgh Crawfords, right.
Speaker 2: But New Homestead was interesting.  You know we--it, it was a--it's a community above Homestead, which is its own city.  You know Homestead is, is, is the city right across the river from Pittsburgh.  But New Homestead is like a, a mountain above Homestead, but it's part of Pittsburgh.  So it was a community that was kind of annexed a little, little community that is part of Pittsburgh.  And the unique thing about this, it was an--basically an African American community over here that was self-sustaining.  They had little, you know like stores and just you know it was really more so like tucked away in the, in the hills.
Speaker 1: Would it be called a sub--a suburb or something?
Speaker 2: Not really, it wasn't, it was just--I'm not sure what the classification 'cause it is part of Pittsburgh, they make it--
Speaker 1: Was it an old community or new?
Speaker 2: An old, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And more--I guess people that worked in the mills you know were able to buy their homes in that area or start their homes.  So black folks that worked in the mill that were in the city of Pittsburgh, founded this community.  A little church up there and, and we were--we moved there like when I was in going into--you know in the middle of tenth grade.  And so when I--we were the new kids, and we probably still are referred to as the new family that moved on The Hill because most of the families there had been, you know, there for a couple of generations and you know like the cousins and the--they're all related up there.  So we, we could as the new family of girls that came, you know we could date some of the guys 'cause we weren't related to any of 'em.  So that was a nice (unclear).  But it was a, a kind of a shock to us because we had to take three buses away from you know real civilization in order to, to get to this place.  And so my father [Herman M. Mitchell, Jr.], he said well I needed more land, we needed more space and I needed to protect my family, you know, like to keep the girls safe.  And he, he really, I think, achieved that goal 'cause anybody who wanted to come out there really had to work hard.
Story_ID: 111543
Speaker 1: Well you're, you're halfway through high school 'cause you're going to Allen--
Speaker 2: It's Allderdice.
Speaker 1: Allderdice High School [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], yeah.
Speaker 2: Now the interesting thing.  Like Westinghouse [High School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], the high school I started out was a predominantly black high school in Homewood section, and that's the, the section of town that John Edgar Wideman talks about with the Homewood [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] stories, he was from Homewood.  But so you know I was in an environment in high school where it was okay, but I don't really think I--you know I, you know I think there--like just black girls are intimidating.  You know like if you're not like the prettiest girl or, you know, just the best dancer and I could never dance, so that was one thing.  I had my--my oldest--my sister Frannie who was next to me, she, she was popular and could dance and I think I was just a little shyer and I couldn't do those things.  So like maybe I didn't fit in as well.
Speaker 1: You didn't think you were pretty in high school?  We saw the picture, you had nice, nice afro, you looked, you know--
Speaker 2: That's when I kind of like let myself out a little bit when I changed high schools and went to Allderdice.  And you know 'cause you--I, I had a chance to I think recreate who I was.  Nobody knew me.  It was a predominantly white school at that point, but you know we had, you know all the black kids that brought--that rode the buses, you know were bused in the school.  But that was--would have been our--that was our natural feeder school.  So we had the, the kids that were bused.
Speaker 1: New Homestead was a very small black community.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) in an area that was mostly all white, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause right around--all--right; the whole surrounding area around that was all white.  In fact it's interesting that there's a, a suburb, Whitaker and the Village and then West Homestead, you know in the Village there are still no black folks, you know.  And, and this is like three minutes, you know, from our house.  So you cross this little line and you're, you know it's in segregation again.  So I'll say there's stuff that happens that you just question.
Story_ID: 111544
Speaker 1: Is Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] a--town that's--I know it's got a rich tradition of black education and teachers and activism, you know, going all the way back to Bishop [Benjamin Tucker] Tanner through Lewis Woodson and Martin [R.] Delany, all the way back to the 18--early 1800s, but is it a, is it a tough, a toughly divided town in term--terms of race, or is it--how was it grow--growing up there?
Speaker 2: Well I guess most of the--I guess if you're looking at racial--it--Pittsburgh was a very divided--territorial.  So--and, and the African--black folks lived in you know, in the black pockets, you know.  So we were in the East Liberty and, and Homestead, which is on the east side.  And then you know on The Hill [District], and then on the north side in like kind of three, distinct areas of, of--strong pockets of, of African Americans.  And then during the '60s [1960s], like in, you know '68 [1968] when they had the riots, that really had a major devastating effect on, on, on the city where most of the business areas in the black communities were destroyed.  So now you had--and I think we're still fighting to kind of put these communities back together, whereas the infrastructure was already leaving, you know the black communities.  And they said all right, well if this is what you wanna do, then do it, you know like we don't have to support it.  That's just my sense, you know because now, like I lived in Pittsburgh just right before I came to Chicago [Illinois] about seven years ago.  And there was a major revitalization movement in the city.  And a lot--and part of this had to do with mill closings, so they were looking at what can--else can the city do that was dying be--you know where the major infrastructure was around steel.  And so this was gone.  You know what other things can we do to you know keep jobs and businesses in Pittsburgh and in the, in the valley.  So they made a major turn to look at business centers at--as Pittsburgh as a hub for you know industries coming in.  You know like you could, you know have your headquarters here and you know like it's not gonna be expensive for you to do this.  And then also developing the river as a--now as a business district.  So like now that--instead of the mills you see business developments.  And then also you're gonna see like in Homestead whole--like you know--it's, it's like the place to be.  People actually wanna come across the river from Pittsburgh to Homestead to, to shop, to eat, to, to go to the movies, do whatever you wanna do.  You know like it's, it's a, a place that you know when we were kids, was like just kind of dark and undesirable.  You know we wanted to go over across the bridge to Pittsburgh.  But Homestead has now kind of had a resurgent and a revitalization in the city--
Story_ID: 111545
Speaker 1: But back to, I guess, high school.
Speaker 2: High school and Allderdice [High School, Pennsylvania].  So you were concerned about being, you were concerned about your image, I guess, in high school.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I just, you know, so I, I think I, I was able to--I, I don't know what--since people didn't know me, then you know I didn't have to have any expectations of who I was or whatever.  And I was always interested in, in reading and writing and, and I was--and the Red Cross, Red Cross Club when I was in Westinghouse [High School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And so that was one of the things I joined when I was at Allderdice.  So once I developed a comfort level there, I had a English teacher who gave us, you know, interesting assignments.  You know he said just, just started journaling at that time, you know, to say you know, you know write just your thoughts.  And he gave us a project to put a magazine together.  And our group did a magazine and I remember writing some things and the kids say we like this poetry, Gwendolyn.  Said, that's poetry?  I said what is the--you know I, I--you know we'll put it in; we like this, we're gonna put it in the magazine.  And so that's first time I kind of looked at poetry in a different light than poetry that had to rhyme.  Because these weren't--these were just kind of thoughts and you know little vignettes I had put on paper and to look at that maybe, you know just a freer kind of writing might allow me to express you know, some of my thoughts in different ways.  And then next semester a friend of mine, a girl that was--you know we decided to do our own magazine the next semester.  We're gonna do a independent project, so we published a poetry journal, a little poetry magazine.  And we developed--we, we got submissions from kids in high school from, you know, a couple, you know around the city and put it together.  And so I think--and I had to put some things in there too, so I wrote some more poetry then.  And so the next year then I was actually on the literary magazine club and you know just was able to you know keep that interest going.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  Now who were some of the teachers at Allderdice [High School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] that inspired you or, or were there any--or, or how did it--how did you--did you have I guess anyone that--around you that you admired in terms of their writing or their, their--
Speaker 1: Allderdice, well, well my English teacher.  You know the one--Mr. Kleger [ph.] was my eleventh grade.  I can't think of the--my senior teacher, his name will come to me.  And I was, you know my, my senior year we started to you know like I think to look more at the basics and the disciplines of, of language and, and writing.  And we also read Shakespeare.  So I think we did--we started with "[A] Midsummer Night['s] Dream".  And he said, we're gonna do this in class.  So you know actually to, to read Shakespeare and to, to access his language and access this writing and, and that was fun.  I mean he made things that like I, you know, hadn't really explored before.  Something that, you know, maybe I, I would have a little more ease and, and looking at and, and reading.  We also had a drama club.  So I was in my senior class play.  We did The Prince--it wasn't "The Princess and the Pea."  It was like a takeoff of that, whatever--
Speaker 2: Right, the one that Carol Burnett--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Used to do way back, yeah.
Speaker 1: "Once Upon a Mattress."
Speaker 2: Right, that's it.
Speaker 1: "Once Upon a Mattress."  I was a lady-in-waiting, so I didn't have a big part, but I was on stage in this funny looking costume.  But it, it was fun.  That, that just kind of--it was a very special part of high school to really be part of theatensemble.  You know, you got to bond with you know, classmates and friends and I was, you know, glad to have that opportunity.
Story_ID: 111546
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now would, would you all still--still sing--singing then, your sisters and yourself?
Speaker 2: Whatever we were required to sing.  At that point we would, yeah we sang through high school.
Speaker 1: Did you sing religious songs or, or popular songs?
Speaker 2: Mostly religious.  It was all, yeah church songs.
Speaker 1: Now were--did you have a household where you played a lot of popular music on the radio?
Speaker 2: Always.  We had WAMO on the--
Speaker 1: That was the station.
Speaker 2: The, the radio station.  So we'd listen to that.
Speaker 1: WAMO Radio.
Speaker 2: W-A-M-O, was our, that's our kitchen music for sure.
Speaker 1: Played it in the kitchen.  Now this is a--this is a--now this is a--the kind of thing that really brings stuff home.  So you're playing WAMO in the kitchen.
Speaker 2: That's right, so we had, you know we knew all the songs or whatever.
Speaker 1: Who was popular when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: I graduated--I'd say well the Temptations of course, they were the group of--[HM] Smokey Robinson.  I was in love with Smokey Robinson.  We got to meet the--Smokey Robinson and the Miracles one summer, I guess maybe it was in eight or ninth grade.  He came to the state fair, Allegheny [Pennsylvania].  He was in--at the fair and I believe the--Merv Griffin--one of those guys, they did their show at the county fair.  So we got to sit in the audience and see Smokey Robinson and the Miracles.
Story_ID: 111547
Speaker 1: That's good. Now, okay, so when you were on the verge of graduating from high school [Allderdice High School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], what had you chosen as your career?  Or had you thought that--through that far yet?
Speaker 2: I always liked--I really wasn't sure what I wanted to do.  I mean I started out as a journalism major when I chose to go to college and--
Speaker 1: Now, now where did you choose to go to college?
Speaker 2: And I went to Penn[sylvania] State University [Beaver Campus, Monaca, Pennsylvania].  I initially went--Penn State has--
Speaker 1: Right out of high school?  Right, right--
Speaker 2: Right out of high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I graduated in 1973.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: From Allderdice and then I went to Penn State University.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I applied late, so I couldn't get into University Park [State College, Pennsylvania], but I did, you know I went to one of the, the branch campuses, which was Beaver Campus.  Like the, the system has twenty, thirty smaller campuses all around the city--all around the state.  And most of the students would start out at a branch campus and then move to University Park their junior and senior year.
Speaker 1: Okay now University Park is a, a--is that the local Pittsburgh.
Speaker 2: State College.
Speaker 1: You mean State College--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: Where Penn State, you know the--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) Lions.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: Joe Paterno.
Speaker 1: That's right in the, in the hills or the mountains of--
Speaker 2: That's right; in the middle of nowhere up there, you know.
Speaker 1: State College, Pennsylvania.  We were there last year at this time interviewing people.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: State College, yeah, so yeah so, so you--did you eventually get to State College?
Speaker 2: Yes I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I ended up a political science major after--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now who were--did you, so did you go straight through college?
Speaker 2: Well you know I, I did my four years and then I was short--I had one class, it was a--that I had needed to take over again to graduate.  And I just didn't take it.  And so my mother--like I went to--on vacation that summer.  I said okay, I was gonna do an independent study over the summer and finish up.  And you know I just--I don't know, other things got in my way or you know, just not knowing what my priorities were.  So I, I was short like this you know credit from graduation.  And you know not many people know this story.  So now the whole world knows, you know.
Speaker 1: Right, 'cause that was missing from the information I read about you.  So what was she doing between '73 [1973] and '77 [1977]?  Okay so you were at Penn State and you, you were close to grad--graduating but you decided first--what is it--why didn't you--I mean why did you leave?
Speaker 2: Well because like you're finished.  I mean I was at--my four years were up, so--and then I was trying to do indepen--to finish this one class that I never completed.  So I just kind of like said I'll go back or I'll do whatever I'm supposed to do, but I moved to Texas.
Story_ID: 111548
Speaker 1: Now why did you move to Tex--Texas?
Speaker 2: My mother's [Franzelle C. Mitchell] from Texas, that's where her family was from and we went--really I went on vacation that summer with--and never came back.  I said I can find a job and do what I wanna do.  So we would--I went on vacation and my grandmother [Lugenie Turner Mitchell] had been--she was not doing well.  And I wanted to spend some time with my--with her.  And, and you know I didn't even--my dad didn't even know I wasn't coming back, I didn't know I wasn't coming back until I didn't, you know.  So let me just stay here.  So I stayed for the next ten years in Texas.
Speaker 1: Ten years.  Now where did you stay in Texas?
Speaker 2: I lived in Dallas.
Speaker 1: In Dallas, okay.  All right now that's when you worked for Neiman Marcus.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So you started out just in sales and you--
Speaker 2: I, I started in, in sales.  And, and went into working in one of the buying office for a while.  And then Neiman Marcus expanded to open a store in Prestonwood, which was far north.  And so I was fortunate to op--to, to you know, to be--to move to that store to open the store.  And I was assistant manager and then I became a manager of one of the departments.  So I lived--I was in retail for a number of--and I enjoyed it.  I mean I really loved sales.  I--if I know a product, you know I'm--you might be able to walk away with it after I talk to you about it.  So it's, it's fun.  I enjoyed the interaction with people.  I enjoyed just being in that kind of environment.  And at the same time, even though I mean that, that's what I did, I also was very active in the arts community in Texas.  And worked with a couple organizations that, you know, did community, community service.  So I mean that was where my--I think my real heart, you know, was working with, with the arts.  And I worked with a organization, Afro-American Artists Alliance, which was a theater group and did some--
Speaker 1: Right, that's Thomas Malaukin [ph.], right?  Was that, was that, was that his group?
Speaker 2: No, let's see--
Speaker 1: That wasn't him, okay.  He's in Houston [Texas], I guess.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: That's Houston, right, right, right, Dallas, okay.  So who--
Speaker 2: In Dallas, you know there is like in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, there's JBA, Junior Black Academy and then I worked with the Afro-American Artists Alliance, which Vicki Wash, let's see Vicki Washington-Nance was one of the coordinators for that.  And also, you know, helped work with poetry groups.  And so we kind of had our own little, little writing groups.  I, I was still very active in just keeping my poetry going and would find opp--you know always find opportunities to read and, and perform and share my work with, with the community of other writers.  And one thing I worked on--for most of the time I was there we had a organization that organized the Harambee Festival, which was a community festival held around--at the end of October, around Halloween, which was really created as an alternative celebration to keep kids, you know, off the streets, you know so that they don't have to go door-to-door or do whatever crazy stuff that happens, you know, in our communities around that time.  So that was one of--'cause I really enjoyed working with the coordination of the Harambee Festival.
Story_ID: 111549
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now this sounds like black cultural activity and stuff.  How did you--I mean did you--were you involved in black cultural activities at, at, at Penn--Penn State [University, State College, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: I was.  And in fact in, in high school, because of the turmoil that happened in the, in the city [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], a group of students, black and white, you know decid--you know we, we were looking at healing possibilities and so we had a organization called the Human Relations Club, you know which allowed black students and white students and whoever to come together and you know, talk about issues and look at you know, what can we do to be sure that these kind of things don't take over our communities.  That you know we, we can you know find ways to get along and do what we have to do.  And in college, I was in the black student organizations.  Especially at a place like Penn State, you know when there are so few African Americans.  I mean it was important that, you know we would--that I would find some community there and found that working with the Black Student Union at both the branch campus [Pennsylvania State University Beaver Campus, Monaca, Pennsylvania] and then when I came to the University Park [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania] to also be active in that organization, was very necessary for me.  I was also--I, I pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha, AKA while I was in college.  But the one thing you know, you just wanted to be sure that I, I didn't wanna lose my--you know, I didn't wanna become a Greek, per se.  You know like they--you know Greeks, you know identify only with Greeks and I said, well I can still be a, a woman of, of the movement or you know like looking at the importance that still had to happen on, on a campus to unite African Americans to be sure that if there's issues and things that we found necessary, that we would, you know, work toward getting those closed.
Speaker 1: You know this is kind of an alternative paradigm to what had existed before and the, the black Greek organizations were formed at a time in--had been useful, you know, on a level.  But the people started forming new things you know, in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s].  The black student organizations and especially on the white campuses, you know and I guess they had a use that the fraternities and sororities did not have on most campuses, I guess.  And they addressed other cultural issues.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So, yeah.  So y'all, you--y'all hear people say they don't wanna forget--you know to--be the old time Greek I guess.  Not without any--without the cultural connections.
Speaker 2: Right.  So we, we were I think very conscious of the fact that even if we were gonna join sororities and fraternities that, that our, our main contribution you know, was going to be what are we gonna give back to our community.
Story_ID: 111550
Speaker 1: Okay. So now you're in Dallas [Texas], you're working for Neiman Marcus and you're involved in community activity--activities in Dallas for ten years.  All right what, what made you live--leave Dallas, you know, after, after being so--
Speaker 2: I think I finally woke up.  And I enjoyed my work at Neiman's, but I really did not feel that the--my personal growth was being recognized, or the things I needed to do in order to look at writing, particularly.  You know like that was something I, I, I wanted to, to pay more attention to.  You know just my poetry and looking at options on what, what it--what opportunities I might have if I just decided to go on and go back to school and so I just decided I was, you know I wanted--I, I quit my job in the middle of the winter.  Moved back to Pennsylvania.  I think my transitions happen in the middle of winter.  I was born in the middle of winter.  That, that means something.  I moved to Pennsylvania.  My son [Sankara Mitchell Harouna] was born in the middle of the winter.  So I think those are good times of, of reflection and cleansing and renewal to do that.  But it was a good move.  I mean I came back and finished my degree.  And then I decide--you know to--was accepted into a master of fine arts program the next, the next semester.  So I did my master of fine arts, M.F.A. in, in poetry.
Story_ID: 111551
Speaker 1: Who was there?  Who was teaching at, at Penn State [University, State College, Pennsylvania] when you were there?  Was it--was there anyone there that really understood what you were doing or, or you found to be inspirational or, or helpful?
Speaker 2: Well I thought that my--I guess my advisor is a gentleman, Bruce Weigl, who I think just had a nice sensitivity to looking at different kinds of writing.  I mean he was a Vietnam vet [veteran], which I don't know if that makes any difference, but I think he came looking at a cultural view of language as opposed to like this one, you know he's a white male but you know he wasn't limiting himself to that white male culture, you know.  That, that I felt that the things I would say in a class or you know whatever contributions I could bring as a African American woman were validated and valued.  So I, I thought that that helped.  Even still in a place like Penn State, you know it's a very--it's a community that even though, you know that don't, that, that maybe does not have as many black folks.  But you--we were still able to find connections and community.  So he was good.  I had a professor John Balaban who just was able to kind of look at a little different aspect of, you know, the kind of things I was writing.  And we had visiting professors come in, like someone like Carolyn Forche who really opened my eyes on looking at language and playing with what you do on a page that, you know, you just don't have to go from the beginning to the end.  You know like, you know play with it, cut it up, you know, look--you know really look closely at, at, at how you use your language and you know what--how you can turn a subject.  So you know I thought I knew a little bit about writing, and I did.  You know but one thing I needed to do as a student was to come back and study it.  You know study [Robert] Frost, study [T. S.] Eliot and, and you know just the classics so I could have a more firm footing in the use of language and, and just, just to be sure like if whatever my voice, that I, I--my voice was mine.  But also that there was a, a method behind, you know, what I put on the paper.  And just a, you know so I had--maybe more purpose in writing and I think I found, you know part of my purpose in trying to help tell other's stories and to be able to tell those stories through poetry.
Story_ID: 111552
Speaker 1: So you finished your M.F.A. in eighty--
Speaker 2: Ninety-one [1991].
Speaker 1: Ninety-one [1991], okay.  Then you--so what, what did you do after, after that?
Speaker 2: I worked as a--just in, in State College [Pennsylvania] for a number--in fact I got married, I had a son [Sankara Mitchell Harouna] and that I think changed a little bit of my perspective, you know becoming a mother on what, what I needed to.  And my husband [Abdoulaye Harouna] is from Niger in West Africa.  And he was in the United States as a Fulbright Scholar.  And so when my son was like two or three, he had finished his degree and was required to go back to his country.  At that time we--you know we didn't go.  In fact I've never been.  We're planning to go this summer to go to, to Niger.  But when he left, I stayed in State College for a while and continued to lecture and I taught in the English Department, in the Women's Studies Department.  And I guess in '87 [1987].  Let's see.  Is it time again?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's running out.
Story_ID: 109084
Speaker 1: Well, we left off, you were, you were married and, and you had a baby.
Speaker 2: Sankara [Harouna Mitchell].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Sankara, right.  And you were at, at State College [Pennsylvania] still at the University of Penn--at Penn State University and you're teaching in the Women's Studies Department and in the English Department, I believe.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This is like 1992 or so, '91 [1991], '92 [1992]?
Speaker 2: Right.  I stayed there--
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Slate date.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah he just gave me a hint here.  We need to re-slate.  So just could, could you state your name for us and spell it?
Speaker 1: Right, my name is Gwendolyn Mitchell, I'm Gwendolyn Ann, in fact, Mitchell.  G-W-E-N-D-O-L-Y-N, Ann, A-N-N, Mitchell, M-I-T-C-H-E-L-L.  I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the year 1955, December 27th of that year.  And--
Speaker 2: And what is today's date?
Speaker 1: Today is April 1st, 2004.
Speaker 2: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 1: And I'm honored to be sitting in the headquarters for The HistoryMakers.  And I'm talking--
Speaker 2: You don't have to identify--I'm, I'm Larry Crowe.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm talking with Larry Crowe.
Speaker 2: Our videographer is Scott Stearns, and we need to pause for one second, Scott.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Story_ID: 109085
Speaker 1: Okay now, now your, your husband [Abdoulaye Harouna] went back to Niger, right, at this point in time, or what happened?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He had been in the states on a Fulbright scholarship, and that's about 1992 he needed to return to his country to fulfill his obligations.  And so I stayed for another year at Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania] just to, to work as a teaching assistant and to work in--as a lecturer in the Women's Studies Department and English Department.  And an opportunity came up I guess in 1994, the beginning or end of '93 [1993] for me to work--I forget the years now.  Maybe it was a little later, '95 [1995] I guess.
Speaker 1: Yeah, our, our information says '94 [1994].  Is that right?
Speaker 2: Ninety-four [1994].
Speaker 1: Yeah, when you worked for, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay that's--for Harris in '94 [1994].  So that I could move back to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], my home city.  And to work for the United States Senator Harris Wofford.  And it was a great opportunity to really look at what--number one, to be back in my home base.  And number two, to work in a capacity that I had not worked in prior to that, and to really understand the work of the people.  To realize how important our government officials are, particularly what, what a senator's office does was eye opening for me in a number of ways.  So I was just pleased to be able to make a small contribution, you know in that respect.
Speaker 1: Now had you worked in politics before at all, or were you, or were you involved in politics before you received the offer from Harris Wofford?
Speaker 2: Not really.  My major involvement more so is you know I would work during election times if I had friends or associates, I would always support their campaigns.  But I was never one to really consider myself a political junkie.  I did have a political, political science degree, so I thought this might be an opportunity to use some of that knowledge.  But most of my core work had been done in the community.  I guess my most political action was organizing the Harambee Festival, or looking at, you know just helping to solidify community base support for issues in Dallas [Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how did this come about?  I mean what, what was it--I mean how were you chosen to do this?
Speaker 2: Well my father [Herman M. Mitchell, Jr.] had a friend who said we need somebody to work in this office.  And so it, it really came because I had a slight connection there.  But because I, you know I guess I had qualifications that allowed me to fulfill the job as well.  But they--the director of the office was Mary Esther [Van Shura].  I can't think of Mary Esther's last name.  But she needed to have a staff assistant, and my father suggested he--that she call Gwendolyn, State College, set up something.  She, she, she can do it.  And with his confidence in me, pushing to say go on, Gwendolyn, go for it.  I, I did follow up and, you know, was hired.
Story_ID: 109086
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was your job with Senator [Harris] Wofford?
Speaker 2: (Unclear).  My job as a staff assistant, I had the responsibility of--to certain constituency groups--my constituency consisted of veterans, the--I did some work with the post office.  As an African American, I would serve as a liaison sometimes to the community, and to be sure that when Senator Wofford was in our district, that if there were issues, if there were concerns, and just to be sure that some of the legwork was done to, to prepare for a senate visit into our community, and to be sure that when he was here to do some work that you know, it could be coordinated in an effective manner.  I spent a lot of time--I felt like being in the senator's office was a little bit like being in a social worker's environment because individuals feel that you can make it right here.  You know I, I have a problem, you've gotta help me solve it.  And so we did a lot of solving of problems.  People that may have had--with veterans, they were looking at compensation issues.  I mean were they getting the right compensation for whatever things may have resulted from their service, you know.  So sometimes there were upgrade issues, you know like that you know could they now be classified as a fully disabled person to allow them to have a, a stronger benefit, or just to be sure that any communication that they had.  I mean maybe they did not have the type of discharge that they felt they should have had.  So now they're able to after the fact, look at some of their records and we would help intervene to be sure that whatever correspondence needed to have happen between that individual and the Veterans Administration [now the United States Department of Veterans Affairs] would happen.  So we kind of would help push their cases along, you know to put priority on some of the cases.  Also worked with the IRS [Internal Revenue Service], you know just individuals who just needed a little more support on, on how to talk with the bureaucracy.  You know like the government is a very large entity and we just made it a little easier to have people have conversations with this, with this monster that runs our country.  And so it was a lot of you know just, just really interacting one-on-one with a lot of community members looking at what concerns, looking at housing issues, looking at jobs, jobs was a major concern.  Looking at youth opportunities as well.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 109087
Speaker 1: Now Harris Wofford is--he's one of--he's a interesting personality and has a long history in the Civil Rights Movement like a lot of white senators from, you know, northern states.  I mean he actually you know was a friend of [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]'s and before he was a [United States] senator and involved in the Civil Rights Movement at a high level.  And he's known as quite a storyteller and that sort of thing.  Do you have any stories about Harris Wofford, or did you come in contact with him that much?
Speaker 2: I, I admire Harris Wofford and I was just honored when he would come into our region.  And I would be terrified if I had to be a driver for Harris to get him somewhere 'cause he was real laid back when he'd come in.  And he'd ask, you know he'd talk with you and, and he'd want--he, he would want to know about your concerns or the things that you felt were important.  So I respected him for that.  But I--my concern was just be sure that I knew where I was going and whether I could get him to the destination on time.  You know we were his hands and feet in the, in the region.  So he relied on us just to--know a little bit about our, our city and our, our territory.  One thing I was surprised to find out about Mr. Wofford was that he graduated from Howard University's [Washington, D.C.] law school.  And you know one of the few white individuals to, you know have had that--, you know, honor in that you know degree on his wall.  And he, he would say that well--and my uncle who's a doctor would say this as well.  You know when, when you see Howard University, if you're not really looking close, it does look a lot like Harvard, you know on the wall.  I thought that was cute.  But you know I had the fortunate opportunity to also meet Mrs. [Clare] Wofford, you know who was a very committed person and, and their children.  When we were looking at--working to help re-elect Senator Wofford, we would on our off time and on weekends, you know we would, you know kind of help out with the campaigns.  And so that was nice to see a family of committed people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So are there any stories or anything about him--Senator Wofford that you remember, or anything that he said that--or--
Speaker 2: I, I don't--well--
Speaker 1: Did he talk about Howard at all?
Speaker 2: Just the fact that he went.  And you now also, you know just because he was a confidant with Martin Luther King, just how sometimes you know just, just being in, in those positions you know, to be a white man, you know like in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement.  He wasn't always seen in a favorable, favorable light.  And so like they had some just close calls.  And in--just to be sure that they had safe passage through some of these places.  So he did, you often talk, you know sometimes he would talk about, you know his, his place in the Civil Rights Movement.  But also he was involved in the Peace Corps.  And that was one thing he was very fond of.  His--activity and his relationship with the Peace Corps organization.  Really I think one of the people that helped to start, you know looking at the, the major movement of--the, the emphasis that the country took to support Peace Corp workers.  And after his senate stay, he was over AmeriCorps.  So that was one of the things that kind of put the PeaceCorps into the hands of the young people again looking on what their contribution was stateside in the United States with AmeriCorps.
Story_ID: 109088
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now here--how long did you work for Harris Wofford?
Speaker 2: I really just worked a year at--Harris Wofford was elected--or he really wasn't elected initially.  He came in as an appointed senator after the death of John Heinz.  And then he was elected to his office after that.  So he served the end of Senator Heinz' seat and then was elected for a full term after that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he served, what, about eight years?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Then did he--was '94 [1994] an election year?  The year that you worked for him.
Speaker 2: Right, it ended the election, yes.  So I worked like the year, that '93 [1993], all of '93 [1993] and nine--was it ninety-four [1994]?  I guess ninety-four (1994) is the campaign year, right.  Yeah.  But he didn't, didn't--he wasn't able to pull it out, unfortunately.  There was a lot of opposition in the Republican side and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's when the Repub--Newt Gingrich's Republican Revolution, you know.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So and that was a surprising thing for me.  And, and somewhat painful.  You know I just don't--didn't want to be that intimately involved in what politics was all about on that side looking at the campaign.  You know, 'cause there's clear divisions on the, the work of the Senate, the work of the Senate and then just what has to happen in order to get somebody elected.  You know we really--that wasn't our--that wasn't my job.  You know my job was really to work with the people.  And you know we did see some of the Senate side because you know on, on weekends, we'd, we'd go out and you know, just help campaign.  But that wasn't what, what I did, that wasn't what I was about, so--but it was just part of the process.  So I stayed there a year.  And then when he lost his Senate seat we, we lost our jobs.
Story_ID: 109089
Speaker 1: So after that, I worked with a couple organizations with arts.  And then I did a--
Speaker 2: What were they?  What organizations were they?
Speaker 1: I worked with Shooting Star Review, which was a nonprofit magazine in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  So I volunteered initially there and then you know worked a little on staff with that organization.  And I was able to apply for a Pennsylvania Arts Program in arts management that I guess maybe a year or so after that.  About a--in another year.  And so I worked with the Pennsylvania Arts Council.  And that kind of got me just, just more focused on, on the arts, on my writing, on poetry and just looking at what I needed to do to tend to, to continue to develop my voice as a, as a writer.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So I got here that you, you worked for the--so that was just through--
Speaker 1: That was '97 [1997], so '96 [1996].
Speaker 2: Through '96 [1996], right.
Speaker 1: Ninety-six [1996], right.  And then '97 [1997] I guess is when I came to Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 109090
Speaker 1: Now how did that happen?  'Cause you're in Pennsylvania and you know--Third World Press is in Chicago [Illinois].  I mean how, how did you end up, end up here?
Speaker 2: I had--I've known about Third World Press for a number of years and [HM] Haki Madhubuti even spent time in Texas for readings and different, you know, events that would be--that he would come to speak.  And so I, I had an opportunity early on to, to meet him when I was working with the Harambee Festival.  And you know we would correspond periodically.  Had a friend who would just kind of keep us involved in what was happening in the, the general community.  And so--and be- because of my, my interest as a writer, I would try to get to know like you know as many other writers that would, you know, come through the community as possible.  At least--so I'd know their work.  So I could, you know just see what's going on and look at what, what I had to do for my development.  So when I was at Penn State [University, State College, Pennsylvania], I wrote Haki to give me a recommendation, you know, in order to get to my grad school program.  And he, he just said well I'll do this, but also you know he wanted to just, you know like said, "Keep me posted on what you're doing."  And I had gone to I guess a, a reading with one of my friends and he had mentioned that there was, you know some things, you know like, "Have you talked with anybody in Chicago recently?"  And I said, "Well no."  He said, "Well you need to, you know just, you know they're doing some good things up there now.  I think they bought a new building."  And I said, "Oh okay," you know so--you know this is all in the back of my mind; it's nothing that I'm thinking about coming to Chicago, 'cause Chicago's a big city.  And I'm--it's cold up there, you know.
Speaker 1: Pittsburgh's a big city too and it's cold in Pittsburgh (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, not like Chicago.  But I'm not sure if it was like just a, a flyer or a call-out.  There was a call-out to say that there was a, you know, opening at Third World Press.  And so I just--you know I, I--Haki had you know, just said, "Gwendolyn, are you interested?  This might be a good opportunity for you now to use your M.F.A., you know some of the skills that you developed looking at the work you've been--even done recently, you know with the arts community.  And you know, apply some of those skills here," so.  And I was at a point where I really was looking at some opportunities.  I mean I was in a point of transition because I said I, I--you know, I didn't have to stay in Pittsburgh even though I developed a, a new community looking at people in the arts and writers. The work I had done with the Pennsylvania Arts Council helped to solidify the founding groundwork for Kuumba Trust organization, which is now I believe a very well developed umbrella organization for arts there in the city.  So you know I wanted to stay somewhat in--with my interest and looking at arts and looking at, at writing.  And so coming to Chicago allowed me to do that.  And also look at what I felt was important in having an African centered base for community and for work.
Speaker 1: So did you come and visit first before you decided to do it or what--how did you make that decision?
Speaker 2: I--I know what happened.  While I was in Pennsylvania, still I went--I came to one of the conferences, to a writing conference.  And I guess I kind of was introduced to like get into some of the stuff that was going on.  That was the tip. It was coming to one of the writing conferences that--
Speaker 1: One of the Chicago State--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I guess, Chicago, yeah, that Chicago State University [Chicago, Illinois] sponsors through I guess now the Gwendolyn Brooks Center.  They hosting, have hosted now I think this year maybe is fourteen.  But I came to one of the early conferences, you know and that was like right at the time when I was finishing my--I had finished my M.F.A. and was looking to see what things I wanted to do.  So I think that was when I made the reconnection with professor--with Haki Madhubuti and just gave him an update on, you know like where I am.  And then I guess the year after when I was in the senate office, that following year I was available again, you know to, to look at, you know where is it that I wanna go with my life.  But that opportunity presented itself to come to Third World Press to work in the editorial staff.
Story_ID: 109091
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you came to Chicago [Illinois] and you decided to come to Chicago in 1997?
Speaker 2: Ninety-seven [1997], right.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was your initial, what, what was your job title and what, what were your duties when you got here?
Speaker 2: I came as a editor.  And really to--and I'm basically working somewhat in the same capacity now even though I have the title of senior editor at this point.  But I work with it--in the editorial staff to look at the development of some of the projects.  And to be sure that you know, we can make books.  And so I did a lot of reading, a lot of research to, to look at some of the projects that were presented, you know to me at that time.  One of the first books I worked on was "Afrolantica Legacies" by Carl, not Carl Bell, [HM] Derrick Bell who is a lawyer and I think he worked at--he was a law professor at Yale [Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] or Harvard [Law School, Cambridge Massachusetts] [Bell was a professor at Harvard Law School].  So that was a real good introduction into just the business of editing.  And, and what it takes to, you know like really pull a project together.  So I kind of came in--even though I had some background you know with--just because my English background looking at language and words, I was kind of just immersed into the job to say hey, you can do this, you know, let's just do it.  So--and it's still a learning process.  You know it's every day it's a new challenge and, and fun.  We really have a lot of diverse projects that we work on at the press as you know.  I think you had some in--interactions early on, you know, with what it takes.
Speaker 1: I do, but I must ask questions of you because you're speaking to the general public, not me.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I guess, I, I do.  I have my own ideas about some of this--
Story_ID: 109092
Speaker 1: But tell us what, now what had--what was your--what did you know about Third World Press when you started, or were you, were you--did what you find there, you know, match your expectations and give--us some idea what the setting--what--how is Third World Press situated and, and you know--'cause you got people I think when they, when they look at a book and you see the name of a publishing company, you, you know--people have preconceived notions about what a publisher does and how they're situated and so forth.  So I don't know--
Speaker 2: Well, when I was first introduced to the possibility of coming to a place like Third World Press, I was quite intimidated.  You know just because I knew a little bit about the kind of work that they have produced and the reputation that they have in the publishing business that you know it's a press that has produced quality work.  That has had its focus primarily on expanding the scope for African American writers.  And to be sure that the kind of literature that we would want to read was produced at this press.  So my preconceived notions you know were just that this was an important place to work and, and if you were gonna you know make a contribution here, that you just needed to, to be up for the task and to, to, to be able to look at it--I guess a wide range of, of writing, you know.  I have a liberal arts background, so I think that helps in this kind of work because you're looking at a broad base of, of literature, fiction, poetry, nonfiction, a lot of history.  So I think having a, a little diversity to my background was an advantage to this kind of job.  And you're working with different personalities as an editor.  You're really helping writers to, to shape their work and just to focus it on what specifically they wanna do and wanna say on a particular project.  So you have to be mindful, you know of what somebody's individual needs are.  And to look at the project separate from what personal issues are.  So that, that was, that was interesting and I think I got some of that training in the Senator's [Harris Wofford] office too.  You know 'cause (unclear) what's important is the work here, you know let's put aside whatever personal things we have and just look at what your problem is, you know, how we're gonna solve this.  So you know putting books together is solving problems.  Getting deadlines to--be sure we're meeting deadlines.  Being sure that, you know we're looking at the economic factor of putting a book together.  You know, how much it's gonna cost, who we're gonna have, you know to help work with us to, to print.  Just the interface that I had to do working with our designers, we have in-house staff that really help put the project together.  And designing the covers and you know just all that.  So part of my job was just coordinating to be sure that we can see a project from beginning to end.
Story_ID: 110019
Speaker 1: So what are the major projects at Third World Press that you worked on over the years?
Speaker 2: Okay, I have done a number of projects during my stay so far at Third World Press.  I've worked on a, a couple--a number of poetry books and our publisher at the Press is [HM] Haki Madhubuti.  And the Press this year [2004] is--will be thirty-six, thirty-seven years old.  So it has a long history of work that it's done.  As I said, initially I worked with--on a book for [HM] Derrick Bell, "Afrolantica Legacies."  Just a few years ago we worked with [HM] Dr. Julianne Malveaux on a book "The Paradox of Loyalty[: An African American Response to the War on Terrorism]", which was a book of essays that she pulled together with her associate, Regina Green on the country's reaction to 9/11 [September 11, 2001].  So just really focusing on the war, the--what is it, terrorism.  War against terrorism [War on Terror].  I'm trying to what--specific.  But you know really looking at an alternative voice that had not been given and the media and in other publications.  One of the things that Third World Press does is really give voice to individuals that may not be as mainstream as other writers.  Our--the, the books that have traditionally been like some of the bestsellers for the Press, something like "The Destruction of Black Civilization" by Chancellor Williams, continues to be a book that, you know, people seek out and want.  It just, you know gives another perspective on you know the history of Africans in this country and Africans before their, their place in this country.  Frances Cress Welsing's "The Isis Papers[: The Keys to the Colors]" was another book that the Press had published well prior to my coming, but you know had been a book that maybe would not have been published by another press.  But it's been very significant for the African American community as a, as a way of looking at the psychology, you know, behind you know what runs this country.  You know what it, what it means to be black in a, in a country that is, is still very oppressive to African people.  Some of the other recent projects that we've done, a few--some fiction.  A book by Michael Simanga, "In the Shadow of the Sun."  He's a writer out of Atlanta [Georgia], and that is something you know that the Press is trying to move into some of the genres that people will read.  Looking at not necessarily mainstream, but you know close to mainstream fiction.  Just any sort of good reads.  You know, we want to have good literature.  We wanna have books that will inform as well as entertain.  And we're always gonna do poetry.  That is the mainstay of the Press.
Story_ID: 110020
Speaker 1: This year (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Poetry was sort of--was stalled at one point I guess 'cause--the idea was it, it was not selling as a lot of po--poetry around Third World Press that wasn't moving in the '80s [1980s], I guess, primarily.
Speaker 1: And poetry is not an easy thing to sell, and we recognize that.  But we also recognize that, that it's important that we allow individuals who have strong work, you know to have a place that they can say that we--they can be published.  So that's always gonna be an emphasis with the Press.  This year we're you know we, we have a, a couple major volumes.  [HM] Sterling Plumpp who has been a long time author at Third World Press just come out with "Velvet be-bop kente cloth," a new book of poetry.  Our publisher [HM] Haki Madhubuti, a couple years ago his "HeartLove[:Wedding and Love Poems]," I guess maybe the first or second year I came into the Press.  Now we're gonna be producing some of his new work, "Run Toward Fear."  So that's an exciting project of, of poetry in addition to some of his other things.
Speaker 2: That's Haki--
Speaker 1: Haki Madhubuti.  And you know he'll be coming out with a couple--a new volume of essays and his memoir, something that we'll be working on this year.  So that will be one of the projects that I'll be undertaking.  So that's exciting.  But poetry--Opal Moore, a woman out of Atlanta [Georgia] who is a beautiful writer, you know, you know, writers need to have a place that they can say is theirs, and that's what--one of the things we want to be sure for strong poets that, you know, we can always say that, you know to them.  Even in the, you know it's, it's up to us to really look at how we can market and, and, and focus some of this work so that it can get into the hands of, of people.  Poetry is not an easy thing to sell, but you know we try to be sure that we provide quality work to audiences so it'll make it easier to buy.  You know some of the new things that we've done, you know just moving into this 21st Century, just having a Web presence so that people can find us in more places.  So that's, that's one thing to be sure that if they can't find us in a bookstore, that you know, they can find us on the Web.
Story_ID: 110021
Speaker 1: There's been a resurgence of poetry as a art form in the, I guess the past six or seven years, I suppose.  It's been a tremendous resurgence with spoken word and po--you know poetry.  Poetry slams and that sort of thing, that you know, that's given you know po--poetry a new presence.  Even--there was a time when, when poetry that rhymed was out of fashion.  Pe--people didn't do it with rappers coming back with rhymes and so forth, it's become popular.  Do you do--does--is Third World Press doing any spoken word publishing in terms of audio stuff?
Speaker 2: Well, we have--looking at some of the, I guess the--what, what's happening in the contemporary world of poetry and spoken word, we always want to, you know really look at who these new artists are.  I don't think we're as involved as we could be.  But surely with works produced by Tony Medina who's out of Washington D.C., it's really based in New York, but he's teaching at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] now, Dr. Medina.  Who kind of is bridging the community looking at hip hop poet, spoken word.  The kind of things that young people want to read and are, are performing and listening to.  Our--one of our poetry editors now on staff is Quraysh Ali Lansana who we had produced early work of his "Southside Rain," and we have one of his new works coming out.  But what, what Tony Medina and Quraysh Ali Lansana along with Samiya [A.] Bashir did was allow us to produce another book called "Roll Call[: A Generational Anthology of Social and Political Black Literature and Art]" which is a wonderful anthology of these contemporary writers looking at writers that are under thirty, you know or just in their thirties and you know like in their late or in twenties, late twenties or early twenties just to see who these young writers are, who are these new voices.  So we want to be about cultivating and you know allowing these new voices to, to be heard and to be seen.  But one thing we do encourage and, and you know this is just like my editorial person here coming out, is that craft is important.  I, I think just what, what is done on the stage is good.  But if you're looking to have your work on the page, you really need to look at what it means, how it's gonna be sustained for a broader audience.  You know, you know what, what's gonna happen when all we have is the page and not you performing your work?  Or you know the, the performance of the piece.  And I think that's what we're about; looking at how we can help sustain these voices on the page to help them take them to another level and take them to another audience.
Story_ID: 110022
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any--be--I think before we broke for the last tape we were talking about dealing with the general public in terms of--in [United States Senator] Harris Wofford's office and, and the Third World Press.  Do you have any interesting stories about the general public coming in and people coming in off the street with, with writing ideas or, or with manuscripts and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, I know a couple years ago I put together just a little information packet about you know tips on writing and like it was called like "I've got this book."  'Cause everybody has this book that they, they know is the next bestseller that you've got to publish this, you have to do it.  So we have probably every other phone call that comes into the Press is like can you publish my book and you're gonna love it.  And I'm sure that we will.  But then the next thing they'll say is that my sister read it and she thought it was great, or I read it to my girlfriend or my boyfriend and you know they just thought this was wonderful writing, so you should too.  So I just think there's another criteria that comes in that, that test if this is good work or not.  So that, that's always interesting.  But we, we try to be as open, you know to new, to new writers and new thoughts and new ideas.  Or you know we won't continue as a press.  We do accept submissions from folks off the street, you know, technically.  Once a year or you know really we prefer that they just come through the mail.  But we do, you know read everything that comes, you know, across our desk, you know that opens it--you know submissions that people have.  And I get some really interesting stuff as a result of that.
Speaker 1: Have, have you been able to publish anything like that?  That's come in, you know.
Speaker 2: We have a couple things and I really can't say right now, that, that we're considering; that I've seen recently that have been just, just from open submissions.  So yeah, we, we do.  It's not as large a percentage as we'd like and that's one thing I'm--we're working on with our editorial staff to be sure that we can increase the percentage of things that we publish through open solicitations.  Oftentimes the things that we publish as a press will, you know we get recommendations from other publishers that you know this is the, you know a work that you should consider.  From agent work, you know somewhat that, that there's somebody else who, you know is kind of helping to promote this particular writer and you know can kind of help get their work in the door.  But also that we have an active publisher and editorial staff that we go out and look for work.  So it comes in on recommendation or you know like we say you know we, we recognize what you're doing and we'd like for you to send something to Third World Press.
Story_ID: 110023
Speaker 1: What's your assessment of the--or how, how do you feel about the independent black publishing these days?  Do you think it has a bright future, or it--Third World Press started in '67 [1967] I believe.
Speaker 2: Third World Press did start in '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: One time I think there were over forty or fifty black publishers that formed a organization at one time.  We had Drum & Spear Press at one time, that's no longer with us.  Lot of, lot of the presses are, are--have come and gone.  Third World Press is still here and it's had to struggle to stay where it is.  What, what, what would you--there are a lot--there are more black bookstores now, more black books, independent books published in the--that are displayed in the mainstream bookstores these days.  But, but what's, what's your assessment of it?  I mean what, what's the health of this now?  Are we in a stage where we're over the hump yet or, or what?
Speaker 2: Well, I feel optimistic about just the future of Third World Press and, and other black publishers.  And, and you're right to say there aren't that many.  There aren't as many as we should have.  And we are constantly being just overpowered by a lot of the main publishers, publishing houses that are given, you know, they can support the work by black authors and can get it into the markets.  So you know we know we're not necessarily competing directly with them.  You know we just have to find our, our place within this to continue to say that you know we're gonna publish this kind of work.  And this is what you can expect from Third World Press.  So yes it--we are in a position where it's not as easy to do what we do.  But we do know that there is a need and that there is definitely a market out there for the kind of work that we do.  So we're looking just to be sure that we are--that we understand, you know, what people want, you know as readers.  And that we can meet some of those needs.  I might mention before like this fiction.  People want interesting, entertaining books.  And so we need to be about producing those kind of things for the audience.  If there's a timely issue that's going on, you know just talking about [HM] Dr. [Julieanne] Malveaux's book ["The Paradox of Loyalty: An African American Response to the War on Terrorism"].  That we need to look at how are we being--how are we as a press helping to be part of that conversation and to be sure that it gets out in the public and, and let people read and react to it.  And then bring the next thing up. So we really need to look at the timeliness of what we produce and, and get it in hands and get on to the next project.  I think that sometimes we're published writers, particularly black publish--we wanna rely on a, on a, a repertoire of writing that they can say is Third World Press writing.  And that is not always--unless it's an academic focus work like you know we are the publisher of Gwendolyn Brooks.  So we always want to be sure that her work is in--is, is available to new audiences.  So if you can look at classics that you're developing new audience for, you know work like Gwendolyn Brooks, [HM] Haki [Madhubuti] and a lot of our core poets.  Their kind of work, you know we want to be sure that they're just always in circulation.  But those other projects, you know, we really need to focus on what is it that people want to read.
Story_ID: 110024
Speaker 1: Okay.  Speaking of Gwendolyn Brooks, what--do you have any re--reflections on Gwendolyn Brooks.
Speaker 2: (BRIEF INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Gwendolyn Brooks.  I all--you know for a long time has been one of my favorite poets.  And prior to coming to Chicago [Illinois], you know whenever she would be in the city, I'd make sure I would attend her reading and you know to say hey, hello Ms. Brooks and she was always very personable, always very warm, you know to audiences and I mean the people that would come admiring her work.  And she would always also say you know like if you come to Chicago, you know, look me up, come see me.  So when I did have a chance to come, you know and then come to work at Third World Press, that invitation, you know, was still open and so I did get a chance to interact, you know with Ms. Brooks.  Not a lot, but because she was Ms. Brooks and always very busy.  But I just always felt welcome and warm in her presence.  And the Third World Press has just published "In Montgomery," which was the final work that she produced prior to her death in 2000.  And I had a chance to really look at the work, you know prior to her death.  And just you know it was so funny.  She had sent a note to our publish--to [HM] Haki [Madhubuti], just to confirm that, you know like this is coming out; here it is.  So she gave the table of contents and she didn't want us to really advertise yet, you know like what was gonna happen, you know.  But just to say all right, here, you've got my--in my handwriting you know, my, my confirmation that this work is coming.  So I know when Professor Madhubuti shared that with me, it was just so exciting.  That was like, you know like a real exciting day at the Press.  That we had the confirmation of, of Ms. Brooks' work.  But she, you know I would sometimes go to events that--to help out, to sell books or you know just to, to, to be there with her.  And she would always--never look at her watch, you know.  She would want to stay till like the last person was, was, was there to be sure that anybody who wanted a book, anybody who wanted attention, would, would get that.  So she was a strong example of what it meant to--just to, to be a woman of integrity and a woman of a caring nature.  You know who recognized that because people were readers, you know like that they're important; that she wasn't the important thing.  It was just that, you know, the contributions she could make to them was important.  So that was a good thing for me to see.  To be in her presence.
Story_ID: 110025
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you are a poet and a writer yourself.  And tell us about your, your, your work.  What do you write about?
Speaker 2: I, I am a poet and a writer.  And primarily, you know, I, I don't--I don't think I have any one thing that I write about, but I do find myself coming back to certain issues and certain things.  And I have felt for a number of years now that it's important to, to be in a position to allow others to share their stories, particularly elders.  And particularly women that I found that it's just very humbling to be in the presence of, you know, like other women my--maybe some elders in my family who've now passed on.  But just to, you know kind of sit at their, their side or at their knee and you know, just listen to them.  And to be able to in some way you know, put this back on the page and I, I have a couple books that I've done which had some of that in it.  Like "House of Women" is my most recent book which was published by Third World Press.  And just by the nature of that title, "House of Women," was an opportunity for me to you know, share some of these stories, not, not always mine but you know some of the things that had been given to me and I can put them back out in a poetic form.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How many books have you published so far--I mean have you--
Speaker 2: I have I guess four books that I've really had a major hand in.  "Veins and Rivers" was my first book of poetry, (unclear) small book, a single--a book in a poem, "Ain't I Black," which is kind of fun to do.  And then "House of Women"  And I co-edited two volumes of creative writing I co-edited along with [HM] Haki Madhubuti.  Two works for Gallery 37, "Releasing the Spirit" and I can't think of the other.  But they were two works that were pulled from writing from Chicago writers, young authors that were part of the Gallery 37 literature program.  And that was a real fun undertaking to, to work with their writing, to help develop some young voices.  And since then they are now producing their own volumes of work, which is an exciting thing to see that.  Because of the nurturing that they were able to get from publishers like Third World Press and Tia Chucha and others that worked with them, that now they found it was very important that they take ownership on that kind of project.  So it was good to kind of set groundwork for them to, to, to take that entity on--as their own project.
Story_ID: 110026
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite work of your own?
Speaker 2: Just my own personal poem?  Yeah, well I always like the title poem of my "House of Women."  That's kind of like I guess my signature poem right now.  Every ten years I develop a new signature poem.  And that's the one I think that I always enjoy reading, or I always try and include in readings that I would do.  Would you like to hear it?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I just happen to have it with me here.  "House of Women."  I come from a house of women so no one ever told me that I should not, if I could, why not?  Girl, you do it.  Sing if you want to, but where'd you get that song?  Mamas, babies and shortnin' bread chant from the second level piano music book with the fill and the color picture of girls, their hair is short bowed plaits.  And a round apron woman.  My mother never made shortnin' bread and she would tell me that the word has a G on the end.  I want to hear you say it when you sing.  But sing if you want to, or write your own fair tale of ever after once or twice upon a clock is ticking.  The moment is marked in volumes above shout.  We can all shout and joyful noise make with ease.  It is our blood.  Blues on the inside.  Hide your soul and sing the night course.  How strong you look by moon. How gentle the talk-like whisper.  Watch, wait.  You rehearse the woman sounds.  The voice is hushed to tears by morning is seen a woman working.  She knows the source of sacred song.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.

Speaker 1: Now Third World Press, now I, I know from my research that Third World Press is part of an extended family of organizations and one time was official--which, which included a food co-op at one time, a school and still the school is still associated.  "Black books bulletin" at one time was a publication of the Institute of Positive Education [IPE], which also ran the school.  There are lots of people that are, are associated with this extended family around Third World Press.  Your, your son Sankara [Harouna Mitchell] goes to, you know attends Betty Shabazz School [Betty Shabazz International Charter School], right, which is associated with the Press.  What are your thoughts I guess or feelings about this extended family of, of organizations?
Speaker 2: Right, Third World Press is a, I guess now a sister organization to the Institute of Positive Education, and really is a founding organization, you know, around the Institute of Positive Education, which now runs two schools.  A new concept school, which is the preschool, and the Betty Shabazz International Charter School, which is the school that my son attends.  He's in eighth grade class, the Nkrumah class.  And I was just so delighted and just con--you know it was--that was one thing to help confirm my decision to come to Chicago [Illinois], that there would be a community and nurturing that could help me in raising my son, and to be sure that his education would be focused, you know in a way that would allow him to understand who he was or who he is in this world as an African American, as an African man who is, you know who is--has--is charged with really great expectations.  You know that, you know like we expect that you know he understands what his point--his position is in being a leader in this country, and to be sure that he's developing skills and the Betty Shabazz International Charter School allow to have that--him to have that background.  And it's been very nurturing and just--I was immediately embraced in the community.  Just coming into the school environment as a parent, and also as, as associate, you know, working at the Press.  It just gave--it was a, I guess an affirmation for me on that this was a good move and, and just the affirmed the kind of things that I wanted to have happen in my life and in, in my son's life.  You know this institution, you know like the Press and IPE, you know you realize that you know you're just a small part of it, which is good.  But you have to be a part of it in order for it to continue, and to look at what contributions you're gonna make to be sure that this kind of thing can happen for your children's children and, you know, other children in the community come, come behind you.  I admire Safisha Madhubuti who was just one of the--I guess the lead visionary person behind the school along with her husband, [HM] Haki Madhubuti, along with--what is the woman--the founding directress, gee.  I see her face so clearly.
Speaker 1: Soyini.
Speaker 2: Soyini Walton, right, right.
Speaker 1: Psychic.
Speaker 2: And just to, to know the, the work that they had to put in place you know years ago in order to have something like this happen, and that it still thriving and continuing to nurture, you know, new individuals.  It's exciting, you know just to see that the work that they put in place ha--you know has continued and is growing.  Sankara, as I said he's eighth grader, Nkrumah, like all the classes are, are named--

Speaker 1: Ma'am, what are your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Hopes and concerns for our wonderful community.  Well, I would hope that-
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: I would hope that we're more technology-sound very soon.  That these things are not as foreign to us as, as individuals.  But I'm very--you know one of the things I would hope as a community that we really are able to look beyond ourselves.  You know, just looking at you know what it means to be part of this world and not just part of Chicago [Illinois] and not just part of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] or California or the small places that we live, but that, you know like the, you know the world is, you know, where we need to make our contributions and that we are raising our children to allow them to feel that, that they, you know, can do anything they want to do.  But also they can do it anywhere that they want to, to do it.  That you know we have a lot of--there's a lot of pain, you know, in our communities and in this world.  And that we could find ways to, to be healers, you know, in our own small ways.  You know, that we can, you know, make connections that will allow us to embrace each other's differences.  That will allow us to recognize that there're differences and that's okay.  But that we can be part of like what it means to change and excel and, and to elevate our community as opposed to keeping it in some pocket, or in some way removed from, you know, what's happening in, in the rest of the world.  And, and I think our hope is in our children, you know and the things, and the things that we're trying--preparing them to do to be leaders and to be nurturers of this next generation.  And to recognize who they are, you know.  They--our young people are confronted with so much and so we have to kind of sometimes see through their eyes in order to, to allow us to see what they need.  So I, you know, like we just--I, I wanna be a person who's not--that I, I don't have a narrow vision.  You know, that I don't just see one way or one thing.  That I can allow them to, you know, show me, you know, what direction they'd like, they'd like to take.
Story_ID: 109103
Speaker 1: In that regard, what do you see for your own legacy or I mean, what, what are your aspirations, you know, as you go forward?  And what do you think you've done and what do you think you want to do next?
Speaker 2: Well, I was looking at just myself as a writer, I want to be sure that you know, the things that I'm putting on the page, you know, will help to bring some new light to, to someone about, you know, issues of who we are as, as, as women, as African people in this world.  So that you know I don't think to create something new because, you know, there's new under the sun.  But I do hope to bring a new perspective to those issues and to those things so--that I may make some contribution in that respect.  That I also, you know, may look at just, just what it means to make a contribution to, to my--to the community.  To you know like just to, as I said before, like just the, the healing process of it has to happen in this, in this world, in this community.  That through the work that I'm doing, maybe through my church or you know through just, you know, developing the faith community of, of the school that we're working with.  Our eighth grade class is planning a trip to Ghana and I want to be sure that the--that these young people have this--can keep this--have this opportunity and will fulfill it.  And that the young people coming after them will feel that this is part of who they--of their transition, you know, out of Shabazz [Betty Shabazz International Charter School in Chicago, Illinois] and into high school.  That this is--will be part of who they are.  You know that they can look at another aspect of the world and realize that this is their community as well.  So to help to, you know, like to, to bridge those gaps.  To create communities.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And just to be sure that I, I'm a caring, you know, person that you know I'm, I'm the daughter that my parents [Franzelle C. Mitchell and Herman M. Mitchell, Jr.] you know, have raised me to be and that I continue to understand what my--you know like the significance it is to be in a family and just understand that.  And it's important to, to stay connected, you know with the, the people in the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is that how you'd like to be remembered I guess, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is, it is.  Just as someone who helps to make things brighter for others.  You know I, I feel like sometimes my best place is just allowing to be--to be able to serve somebody, you know that gives me great joy to make someone else happy.  To, to, to listen to other people, you know is just a delight.  You know, sometimes you hear their stories and I, I want to be able to be sure that I'm always an open ear.  And that, you know, that someone--a place--a person they come to and feel safe.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Well, thank you.
Story_ID: 109104
Speaker 1: So just to give, give us a brief description of the photo: who's in the photo and about when it was shot and where.
Speaker 2: That's a photo of my son, Sankara Harouna Mitchell.  I believe this was his seventh grade, maybe his eight, sixth grade class picture from the Betty Shabazz International Charter School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  That's good.  Next.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is a family reunion picture for my mother's [Franzelle C. Mitchell] family.  And this was in California in 1991.  One of the, I guess the first reunion that my son attended, but we have over 300, maybe 400 descendants that were traced from ancestor Frances, who was a slave.  And originally from Georgia, a plantation in Georgia.  So these are some of my relatives that have gathered--we gather every two years in various cities for the reunion of this family.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: That was a picture as you can see of my son Sankara Harouna.  He was three days old here in this picture with my husband, Abdoulaye Harouna, and myself Gwendolyn.  We were in State College [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is my father, Herman Mitchell.  He is--in this photo he was I guess at work.  But he was a commander for the Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] police department [Pittsburgh Bureau of Police] prior to his retirement.  He worked in--as a police--in the--for the Pittsburgh police department for over thirty years.  And we always were excited to see him in his uniform and I think he's the reason why we do a lot of the work we do now as, as family to work in the community.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is a picture I think it was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] at a writers' conference.  I'm there, Gwendolyn and my son Sankara with Amiri Baraka [LeRoi Jones].  Was always to have--so, so Sankara can see that he met these people at least once in his life.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Very good, next.  Can you give us the date for this?
Speaker 1: This was probably around 1991.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: This is Sankara and I.  We were at a, an opening for the--one of the Gallery 37 projects, and we're reviewing some of the work.

Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Got it, next.

Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: This is another family gathering of my father's family in our house.  I guess this is in the late '70s [1970's].  I would say this is like right 1973.  Here is my dad's mother Eva [Poe] Mitchell, and my father's brother and his family.  That's my dad here and my Uncle Wesley.  One of our many family gatherings.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.

This is my mother's oldest--youngest brother and her oldest brother.  That's Dale and Harold Mitchell.  And see we had Mitchells on both sides.  My mother was a Mitchell before she married, and my father of course was a Mitchell.  So then we have my uncle, my aunt's husband Basat [ph.], and then my dad and his brother Wesley and Herman Mitchell, and the Arthur's in the middle.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Now this is an exciting photo.  It was taken last year in 2003 in October in front of Third World Press.  It's "I, Griot: Standing on the shoulders of giants."  This photo of Chicago writers was organized by the Chicago Writers Collective.  And they pulled over--this is over 100 writers from the area, from the region, who gathered in front of the Press to take this, this photo.  Just to, you know, look at, you know who we are and that you know if we, we say that we're writers, that you know we need to be about this business.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay, next.

And we would perform excerpts of poetry, some of my poetry was, was in this collection.  Just--and other well-known writers as well.

No, this is, wait.  This is pre-Sankara.  This was '80-, '87 [1987], yeah.  So that was a family gathering.  First time we had been together for about, in about like five or six years.

This was--I found this photo in her house before she died and you know she had so many wonderful things.  But just to look at the character of these women and just--I, I was just really drawn to this image.
