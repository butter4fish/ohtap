Story_ID: 9276
Speaker 1: I'd like to--we usually ask about your family background.  And I'd like you to give your mother and if you would just sort of talk about her and what you know about her growing up.
Speaker 2: My mother growing up.  My mother had a--her mother was from down south.  I'm not certain where.  I believe in Carolinas.  And her father--I don't know where my grandfather came from.  But he was a--he was either a race car driver and mechanic--. And my mother grew up in Brooklyn [New York].  Bedford-Stuyvesant [neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York] and Brooklyn is the last place she lived in Brooklyn.  I know they moved around.  She has two brothers.  And I believe she's the--I believe she's the youngest of the three siblings.  Grew up pretty poor, you know, and deprived.  Then she excelled quickly in school.  I know my mother was skipped I believe one or two times in school.  And then she became a dancer.  I believe she was one of the first African Americans to ever work in the Playboy Club [now defunct chain of nightclubs owned by 'Playboy' magazine], and won a couple of beauty contests.  And she met my father probably around early 1960s.  And they got together and they wed.  And then they had me.
Speaker 1: And can you give any background about your father?
Speaker 2: As far as I know, my father was one of seven siblings born in Trinidad--born and raised in Trinidad.  He was the oldest of them and--and I think--I think his father left when he was about twelve or thirteen, and my father raised the family from that point on.  And he was also advanced in school.  Skipped in school twice.  And then he came to America when he was about eighteen years old.  Then he slowly brought his family over to Canada or--and America, along with my mother, as they became a couple.  Now siblings, do you have siblings?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So you're the only child.
Speaker 2: Only child.
Story_ID: 9277
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory of growing up would be about two or three years old.
Speaker 1: Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I remember in Trinidad--being in Trinidad playing with my cousins.  And with that side of the family.  My Trinidadian side of the family.  My grandmother.
Speaker 1: Would you say that you have a sense of your Trinidadian background, you know? And you know, West Indian background or heritage in the way you grew up?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Can you give an example?
Speaker 2: Of the sense of my Trinidadian background?  My West Indian heritage?  Well I mean, you know, there's a certain form of discipline that you're taught when you're West Indian.  Not that you're not taught that in any other culture, but there's a certain form of that.  Obviously the food, the music.  The music that is--it's a certain way that they celebrate music and party.  The family--the family structure is a little different from the American structure in regards to how the siblings are towards each other, and usually the son leaving earlier on in life to be self-sufficient.  And then there's--I feel that there's a lot of--there's a lot of emphasis on hard work.  You know, on knowing that you need to work from the earliest stages of your life all the way through.  You know, I think those things are really emphasized in the West Indian culture.  As I said, they're emphasized I'm sure in other cultures, but this is the one that I know that is different from American to some extent.
Speaker 1: And when you say there's a difference in structure.  What were you talking about?  Besides, you know, the--you said, "The older son going off."  What other things in terms of structure?
Speaker 2: Well the family structure usually in the West Indian community, the father has--because of the heavy work ethic and the discipline, a lot of times the father has little to do with the children, in regards to bonding when they're younger, you know.  It's usually the mother raises the children.  The father comes home and meet--and briefly has contact with the children.  And usually it's in a disciplinary form.  Usually because he's probably working too--you know, working a lot, and when he comes home, you know, he's just trying to deal with the problems.  And, you know, West Indian men are more like, you know, just leave him alone.  Let him sleep.  Let him do what he has to do.  And he has to go to work, you know.  And that's that issue.  The--a lot of times when we used to eat dinner, not necessarily my mother or my father, but, you know, the women tend to cook the meal, lay out the food and the men came in and eat.  And then the women go into another room and they eat.  They kind of get together and they congregate together and they let the men do what they have to do.  And, you know, you can ask them, "Please come in.  Please come in and eat.  Please--."  And they tend to not wanna do that.  They wanna really let you guys have your space.  And then later on that night, you know, a lot of times even in party atmosphere, the guys kind of stay with each other, drink and play cards, and the women kind of go and do their thing.  You know, whatever they're doing.  And obviously I wasn't in that circle.  I guess they got--talking about us.  So that's the--that's a lot of times the culture.  But there's a respect level that both parties have for each other, that I think gets a little blurred in the American culture that I don't necessarily disagree with, but I think there's a healthy respect--well and sometimes it's unhealthy in the West Indian tradition.
Speaker 1: So what you're saying is that, you were very--in your early years formed by that West Indian tradition.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 9278
Speaker 1: Now did you--what age were you when you came to New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I was in New York all through the--growing up.  But I was in Trinidad half the time.  Primarily the summer months.  Okay.  Can you just sort of describe, you know, in terms of sights, smells and sounds, you know, your Trinidadian experience? You know, what favorite--you know, or sights, smells and sounds remind of Trinidad?
Speaker 1: Well you know, it was really country, so you know, the smell of the ocean and the smell of long grass and fields and cows remind you of Trinidad.  And sounds like--you know, I primarily remember--for some reason I remember bats a lot.  A lot of bats.  You know, I just remember them hitting the roof a lot of times when we were growing up.  Weird sounds like that in the night.  Not that they were scary at that point, they were just something that you were natural to.  And the smell of cooking.  A lot of cooking.  That's something I remember a lot of.
Story_ID: 9279
Speaker 1: And, let's--let's do--let's take that same question, but here in New York [New York]?  You know.  I'd like to know what, you know, sights, smells and sounds reminded you of your neighborhood growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh New York was different.  New York was the sight of busyness, you know.  I grew up on a major street.  So the sounds were a lot of cars and traffic and action no matter what.  And then also kids.  A lot of kids in the neighborhood playing baseball, football, basketball.  Those type of sights and sounds were what I would hear, you know.
Speaker 1: And what street did you grow up on?
Speaker 2: I grew up on Farmers Boulevard [Hollis, Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: In?
Speaker 2: In Queens.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Queens.  Okay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And airplanes.  'Cause I grew up right near airplanes and railroads.  I grew up right near JFK [John F. Kennedy International Airport, Jamaica, New York].
Speaker 1: And did--can you describe just even some of your neighbors or some of your friends from some of those early days?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  To my house to the right were a family.  These guys, always washing the cars, two younger brothers and a sister.  And a regular family structure.  Next to them was actually one of the people that would later on in my life become my partner in FUBU [clothing company].  I met him when I was about four or five years old.  And he--he's Carl--his name is Carl Brown [co-founder of FUBU clothing company].  And, you know, he had about--he had three brothers and one sister and a dog.  And then to the left of my house was that one nosey neighbor.  That one lady who just, you know, always knew everything.  Always, you know, sat in the window of her house and just watched everything going on.  And across the street there were several other houses with kids.  And we, you know--in every--all the kids were in one or two age brackets.  They were at, you know--if I was five, there was probably another ten kids that were five.  And then the other age bracket would be about nine.  And then the other age bracket would be about thirteen.  And we all played in, you know, in one of the blocks near the house in our own area.  You know, the kids about five years old would play a certain game, the kids about nine would play baseball, and the kids a little older would be sitting there talking about bikes or cars or whatever the case is.  So we all kind of grew up in the same area, but in our little groups.
Story_ID: 9280
Speaker 1: And what was the young Daymond John?  What were you like?  Were you--were you mischievous?  Were you active?  Were you precocious?  I mean who--you know, what were you like?  Were you--?
Speaker 2: I was inquisitive about a lot of things going on, you know.  You know, one minute I would like sports, then I would really like things about airplanes.  And, you know, as I grew up I was very inquisitive about things.  I always wanted to do businesses.  So, you know, earlier on, you know, I started selling maybe pencils when I was in kindergarten to other kids.  Then I started selling--I don't know, mirrors and other things as I grew up.  All the way to selling bikes that I put together--bicycles. I was always trying to be an entrepreneur in some sense.  I was very mischief--you know.  I got into a lot of trouble.  As a young--not necessarily with the police, but just in the neighborhood [Hollis, Queens, New York], you know, fights, rocks throwing--not fights with myself, but just starting one with other people.  Because I traveled a lot, my mother sent me to a lot of places.  You know, I lived in Hawaii for a little brief time, and Trinidad and Barbados and certain areas.  And this wasn't because of a--this wasn't because my mother was unstructured, it was actually a structure she was trying to provide, to send me away to let me see the rest of the world.  So she would save up as much money as possible, work two or three jobs during the year to send me away.  Because of that, when I was in the neighborhood, I was always looking to find out about the other neighborhoods around, or looking to see about further things as I grew up.  Once I started to drive, I wanted to go to other states.  Once I started to fly, I wanted to go to other countries.  So that was my attitude all actually when I was growing up.
Story_ID: 9281
Speaker 1: And tell me, where did this idea of business come from?  I mean, what--you said, at age--what did you say?  Five that you were selling--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I was six probably.
Speaker 1: You were selling pencils.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was stealing them from other kids and selling them to others.  Yeah.  I was Robin Hood.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) Okay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) A modern day Robin Hood (laughs).  Where did it come from?  I think it was my mother.  She always was--she always had a base for paying the bills and doing what she had to do--which was her job one two or three jobs.  And then she always was trying to create a new business.  And she wasn't--she wasn't the kind of person who tried to do it every two weeks.  She would stick with it for a period of time and really give it a good shot.  So I think that type of training, you know, and that type of--seeing her do that really, you know, it made me want to do something.  Plus my mother always gave me chores to do, you know.  And things I had to do and it was my job, so I learned to do a job earlier on in life.  And then I started working probably about eleven years old, and I haven't stopped working since then--ten years old I started working actually.
Speaker 1: And where were you working?  Where'd you start?
Speaker 2: I started working at ten.  When I started, I started mowing lawns.  Then I started shoveling snow.  And then at about eleven, twelve years old, the Coliseum [shopping mall] in Jamaica, Queens [New York] had just opened up--and was gonna open up in a year, and I started handing out fliers for that for them.  And then about thirteen years old, I started working at a little booth in the Coliseum.  They were selling ladies hosiery and socks and things like that.  And I would--I would really monitor the booth, see who's stealing, and help, you know, help bag certain things and this and that.  And about fourteen, fifteen I started working in another booth in the Coliseum candy--selling candy or pretzels and making cotton candy.  And then I went into high school, and I was in a co-op program.  And I worked as a messenger for First Boston--First Boston Banks [now Credit Suisse First Boston LLC].  Then I kept working from there.
Speaker 1: But when you--you know, the other thing that sort of caught my attention was when you said that you put together--you assembled bikes and sold them.  What age were you when you did that?
Speaker 2: I was about nine.  I was about eight, nine years old.  I would--yeah, I would assemble bikes.  A lot of people would throw out bikes, and old bike stores would throw out you know, pieces to bikes.  And, you know, other kids in the neighborhood couldn't afford it.  I'd put them together.  I'd put the bikes together and I'd sell them.
Story_ID: 9282
Speaker 1: And your elementary school--you went to St. Gerard [Majella School, Hollis, Queens, New York]?  Was that--?
Speaker 2: I went to St. Gerard until about--'til seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And what kind of student would you call yourself?
Speaker 2: I was a very good student up until about sixth, seventh grade when my parents started getting a divorce and then I became a very bad student.  And then I actually got left back in seventh grade.
Speaker 1: And were there any subjects that really appealed to you?
Speaker 2: I was a straight "A" student basically everything and--I would say the strongest subject was math.
Speaker 1: And what did----?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Math and a little bit of science.
Speaker 1: What did you like about math?
Speaker 2: It was nothing that I liked about math, it was just nothing that I disliked about it.  Such as the--such as English and spelling.  Spelling seemed to be hard for me and English because of the--English because of my writing was very sloppy.  I'm a left-handed person.  Writing is very sloppy and didn't really--I didn't like it, but I did what I had to do with it.
Speaker 1: And so when you--in elementary school at St. Gerard, was there any teacher that particularly influenced you there?  That you have fond memories of?  Or a teacher that you didn't particularly like?
Speaker 2: It happens to be too far back at this moment, but there was definitely teachers I didn't like.  There was one--you know, there was one teacher--there were teachers that you found funny.  I didn't like or--you know, there's nobody I liked.  But I actually disliked some.  It was one guy was named Mr. Stenseland.  But he had something wrong with him here, and that's the reason why I remember.  'Cause he always had a pee stain on him.  But other than that--and he was always yelling at people.
Speaker 1: But the--I'm just trying to figure out during, you know, up until like seventh grade, you know, what other things were sort of influencing you?  Or even any memories that you have.  Like anecdotal memories about--?
Speaker 2: You know, up 'til seventh grade I think the things that influenced me were kids, other kids, that, you know, I really became tight with around third to fourth grade, and we went all the way up to seventh grade together in school.  So you had your neighborhood friends and then you had these other guys who were all from different neighborhoods, and they got together.  And I think it was kids who were most influential to me at that day.  And I think that's probably with anybody else--would be kids.
Speaker 1: Were you influenced by TV at all?  Did you have any favorite TV programs and things?
Speaker 2: No. You know, not seventh grade.  That's in the 70s [1970s].  It wasn't but so much that you could be influenced by at that time.  You only had three major networks.  And you could only watch TV maybe an hour a week.
Speaker 1: You mean in your household.
Speaker 2: In my household.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In my household I could only watch TV an hour a week probably, maybe at the most.  'The Muppet Show' [television show].
Speaker 1: So okay.  So in seventh grade you went to where?  You went to is it IS?  I couldn't read----?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) IS 238 [Susan B. Anthony School, Hollis, Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: Right. And that was on what street--that's also in Queens?
Speaker 2: That's also in Queens.  That's on Hillside Avenue in Queens.  Hillside Avenue 1--183rd Street.
Story_ID: 9283
Speaker 1: And what's influencing you at this point though, Daymond?
Speaker 2: At that point, outside cultures starting to influence me, and rap is starting to become popular.  Rap is not becoming popular; rap is staring to just emerge, actually.  And at that point, a whole new world was opening up, you know. It was a whole new world in regards to fashion, in regards to attitude, in regards to a culture.  Understanding kids that were speaking your language, but on--in records.  Not having to listen to disco, and not having to listen to traditional soft rock or whatever the case is.  Starting to see a more--a lot of people like your Michael Jordans [basketball player] around.  You know, Mike Tyson [boxer] is coming out.  These other icons that you had to--that you had to acknowledge besides the traditional [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] and Malcolm X hanging in your living room.
Speaker 1: Do you remember when you first heard your first rap song?  You know, where you were or who it was?
Speaker 2: I think I was in a friend's basement when I heard Spoonie Gee [rapper] on a tape.  And that must have been '82 [1982].  Around that. And that's the first time I heard it. My first exposure to something of that type was not necessarily a rap song at first.  You weren't introduced to that at first. The first thing you were introduced to was scratching. And somebody saying something like--you know, I was with my brother.  And he was mixing 'Good Times' [song] a--you know, 'Good Times' was a very--Nile Rogers [musician] had made 'Good Times'--Chic [music group] actually with Nile Rogers. 'Good Times'--mixing 'Good Times'--you're like, "Mixing?"  You know, you're going from eight track tapes to hearing somebody talking about, "I was mixing something."  You just didn't--couldn't comprehend it until you saw them actually put two records together and mix it. And you know, then maybe three or four years after that you heard about rapping.  But that was the first exposure to it, to just to a track, a beat, and then it grew--it grew from there.
Speaker 1: And were you going to parties at that point?  'Cause you're still sort of young? No.
Speaker 2: No.  I wasn't going to parties then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, I was always in parties that my parents threw or something.  But it was the--you know, I was doing the bus stop [dance]. You know, like little small--doing the bus stop to Michael Jackson [singer].  But in regards to that area--that era, I didn't go to parties.  After embracing the hip-hop/rap mixing culture, I didn't--wasn't able to go to parties for about five, six, seven years.  'Cause I must have been twelve at that point.  I didn't--no it must have been earlier.  I must have been about ten.  And I didn't start going to parties until I was sixteen.
Speaker 1: And so this person who you said introduced you to mixing.  Who was that, you said?
Speaker 2: He was a kid in school, and he said his older brother was doing it. And--and he introduced me to it, but it wasn't like, you know, I followed it after that.  I understood it and I liked it.  And I was like, "Wow!"  And then I get a different taste of it here and a different--my ears were attuned to it at that point when another person would talk about it.  So I would get brief encounters with it, all over the place for the next three years, four years.
Speaker 1: And what about it appealed to you?  That's what I'm trying to--you know, trying to understand also.  Besides it just sort of being different?
Speaker 2: I think that it was--it was different, I think.  I think the sound of it was nice, but it was also younger kids that were doing it.  It wasn't--it wasn't people my parents' age.  You know, I would see my parents dance to the O'Jays [music group] and, you know, it looked good and it was fun, but they're still thirty years older than you, twenty years older than you, you don't necessarily understand them. But now the gap is smaller.  Kids--you're ten and another kid fifteen is doing this.  And that's who you wanna be.  You wanna be a fifteen year old.  You don't necessarily wanna be a forty year old at that point.  And I think that that was the influential point.
Story_ID: 9284
Speaker 1: And so here you are.  You're at--but I'm back at sort of IS--in IS 238 [Susan B. Anthony School, Hollis, Queens, New York].  You're--you're not doing well in school, even though you're capable of doing well.  Right?
Speaker 2: No.  At IS 238, I got--I did well.
Speaker 1: You did.
Speaker 2: After I got left back that time I started doing well again.
Speaker 1: Oh I see.  Okay.
Speaker 2: After I got left back in St. Gerard [Majella School, Hollis, Queens, New York], my mother said, "Well I'm not gonna work this hard to put you in private school if you're not gonna respect what I'm doing.  So I'm gonna put you in IS 238."  So after I tasted the discipline, I moved on and became a good student again.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were at IS 238 until ninth grade?  Tenth grade?
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: Two years.
Speaker 2: I was in there for the second year of seventh grade, and my eighth grade, and then I went to high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the high school you went to?
Speaker 2: Bayside.  Bayside High School [Bayside, Queens, New York] in Queens.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you describe Bayside?  You know, how many--How many high schools are there in Queens?  A lot.
Speaker 2: Must be about twenty [sic, thirty-four as of 2005].
Speaker 1: Twenty.  Okay.  But can you describe the population at Bayside?
Speaker 2: Bayside was primarily white.  It was probably about 65 percent white, and another, you know, black was probably about 15 percent.  Then you had your Latino and your Asian.  Maybe Bayside was 50 percent white, excuse me, and then you mix all the rest in.  Unlike other high schools, it was a high school that you really had to drive to or take a bus a fairly long distance. A fair distance. And, you know, that's all I knew about Bayside really.  I mean, I have never been to another high school, so I can't tell you the difference.
Speaker 1: Did you like high school at that point?  Were you engaged?
Speaker 2: I liked high school.  I happened to--yeah I liked high school, I started to drive at sixteen, so, you know, I was one of the only kids in high school with a car.  And, you know, had a lot of girlfriends.  And did pretty well in school.  And then I went into the co-op program in tenth grade--no, eleventh grade.  Which was even easier.  I mean the co-op program was extremely easy. And plus, you know, I worked half the time, and I made money.  And I was in school only half the time.  So that--you know, I'd work in school--I'd be in school one week and go to work the next week and be in school the following week.  So when I'm ready to come back to school, school was fun.  You know, I actually worked the other week.  And, you know, being a messenger, you're sitting down there with thirty other men and women who are just, you know.  And you're just talking. And then what are you doing the rest of the day--walking abound the city.  So it was fairly easy for me.
Story_ID: 9285
Speaker 1: And why did you choose--who chose the co-op program [at Bayside High School, Bayside, Queens, New York] for you?  Was that your choice or your mother's?
Speaker 2: Oh it was mine.  My choice.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So what are you learning, you know, when you're--I mean because that sort of exposing to older people in a different experience out there.
Speaker 2: You learn all kind of things.  You learn about--you're learning--you know, all the people are telling you about life in general.  I mean, you're seeing that--also you're seeing grown men thirty, forty years old with six kids are making four dollars an hour at that point, you know, because of the mistakes they made in their life.  You're also being exposed though in the same environment to other professional men who, you know, you were at First Boston [Bank], so there's several millionaires and billionaires walking around.  So you're seeing professional men who made the right choices in their life.  So it's everything.  Yeah.  You're seeing everything.
Story_ID: 9286
Speaker 1: And at this point are you and Carl Brown [co-founder of FUBU clothing company] still in a lot of contact?  Throughout, you know, your growing up period from the time that you were--?
Speaker 2: We fell out of contact once or twice.  But we were in contact most of the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) But during this high school period were you in contact at that point?
Speaker 2: We were in contact.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it--you know, earlier on--you know, I met J. [Alexander Martin, co-founder of FUBU clothing company]  maybe at the age of eight or nine. I'm not certain.  And we went to IS 238 [Susan B. Anthony School, Hollis, Queens, New York] together.  And we also attended Bayside [High School, Bayside, Queens, New York] together.  And when I went into Bayside I met my other partner Keith [Perrin, co-founder of FUBU clothing company].
Story_ID: 9287
Speaker 1: Was there anything else about high school that was sort of important beside the co-op program?  Those years?
Speaker 2: No, nothing else is important at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Besides relationships with--just personal relationships but nothing else.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yeah, yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Now when you graduate, what are you thinking you wanna do?
Speaker 1: I wanna be rich.  That's what I wanna do. That's all I knew.  Did not know how.  And I think at that time, I thought I was gonna buy and sell crash cars.  Until the--buy crashed cars and refix 'em and sell 'em--resell 'em.  Had the whole--everything laid out. And then I guess reality hit me.  About, you know, it's not that easy, you know?
Speaker 2: Had you been working in an auto shop that would've thought that you would do that?  Or where did that come from?
Speaker 1: That came from one of my friends used to do it. And I--I actually got my first car, I believe--oh no, I got my second car from an auction.  And, you know, if you could turn it around, you can--you can make some good money. A lot of my friends though went into some crooked things, so they were able to do it because they were also stealing cars at the same time and putting their parts on cars.  So it was easier for them. But I was trying to go about it the correct way, you know.
Story_ID: 9288
Speaker 1: So how did you happen on doing FUBU [clothing company] then?  Is what I'm saying.  You're thinking crash cars, was there anything else that you're--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) In between that time to doing FUBU I had--I was a waiter at Red Lobster [restaurant] for a long period of time.  And then there's a van service [Queens Van Plan] that works in Queens [New York].  And they pick up people from the bus stops and take them up to the subway and back towards their homes.  And I went and bought a van and actually was doing that for quite some time.  So that was in between the time of the high school and FUBU.  Got to the--FUBU--the FUBU time was basically when I had the van.  You know, the [New York City] Department of Transportation was cracking down so much on people who were operating those vehicles, it was costing me a lot of money, and I wasn't really--it wasn't as profitable as it used to be, and I took the van and I started putting clothes in there.  And these were clothes that I would buy on 27th Street, or water guns when there's a big beach festival, and I would go and sell the product.  And I remember right around the Rodney King time--when Rodney King had the conflict with the cops [Los Angeles, California resident Rodney King was severely beaten by officers of the Los Angeles Police Department in 1991; despite video evidence, many of the officers were acquitted in a 1992 trial, sparking riots and protests across the country], we started selling shirts with Rodney King sayings on it. And we started doing novelty items such as that.  And then--.
Speaker 1: Now where were you buying those shirts from at that point?
Speaker 2: Well the shirts were blanks--.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 2: And I would just go get them screen printed.  Or some of the shirts were actually--you'd buy 'em at wholesalers who would just sell novelty shirts and you'd go out and resell 'em.  You'd buy 'em at four dollars and sell 'em at eight, something like that.  Then around 1992, and there were these hats that were being--I was seeing in videos all the time.  And I liked the hat, but I just didn't wanna pay eight hundred dollars for it.  And I knew how to sew from growing up.  My mother used to sew some of my clothes, and I knew--at least knew how to sew a straight line, to hem some of my pants and things like that.  And the line--the hat could be sewed by just a couple of straight lines actually.  The hat looked like a sleeve you'd put on your head and you would tie it at the top.  So I went uptown to go buy the hat, and the hat was twenty dollars  And I came back downtown, and I said, "You know, I can make this for like three or four dollars."  So I made the hat.  Then I decided, "You know, let me sell some more of these."  So I cut some--went to a fabric store, got some fabric.  Cut a whole bunch of hats up.  Sewed 'em up.  Sold 'em--it was the Friday prior to Easter Sunday in 1992.  And I went out to Jamaica Avenue [Queens, New York], in front of the Coliseum [shopping] mall. And I sewed about eight hundred dollars worth of hats.  I was very excited about that.  So I decided to move on in selling hats.  But then my partner J. [Alexander] Martin [co-founder of FUBU] came back.  He was just fighting Desert Storm [Persian Gulf War, 1991].  And he came back, and he had a FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York] scholarship from being in the services.  And he said, "Well, you know, why are you just doing these hats?  Why don't we do shirts?  Why don't we do other things?"  And I didn't really know how to do the rest of the process.  And he said, "Well, you know, I--." He knew how to sew--oh, he didn't know how to sew, excuse me.  He knew how to go get raw material and make shirts.  So the step between the hats and the raw material is we would go get shirt and we would embroider this name FUBU.  Because we were frustrated that companies such as Timberland [Company] and the rumor--and I don't know if it's true--of Calvin Klein [clothing company] saying that they don't make clothes for African Americans.  And Timberland said they don't make boots for drug dealers, which I guess they were referring to all young African Americans as drug dealers. We came up with this name out of frustration, 'cause we said, "Who's gonna ever--who's ever gonna respect the community that they sell to?"  And we came up with FUBU.  And it didn't necessarily mean African Americans.  It just meant "For us, by us,"  and we just meant kids. I didn't care what color it was, that understood what we understood, and understood this culture and lifestyles, which was created and powered by African Americans.  But it encompasses everybody.  So we started putting this name FUBU on the product, and it started to sell.  We'd go to black expos in maybe three or four different states.  New York, Virginia, [Washington] D.C., Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and we'd sell out.  And I think after that, we started to solicit artists, because another gentleman who is very famous now as a director named Hype Williams [director] grew up with me.  And Hype said, "You know, I'm doing videos.  So let me put 'em in my videos."  And Hype put 'em in his videos. And then another gentleman that we would earlier on in life go on tours with and just kind of hang out with, LL Cool J [rapper] was an artist.  So we put 'em on LL Cool J.  And it started to build the demand, 'cause they were seen on the videos.
Story_ID: 9289
Speaker 1: I wanna go back though to, you know, the title [of FUBU clothing company].  I mean, you know, "For us, by us".  When--can you describe where you were, you know, when you guys came up with that name and the whole discussion?  'Cause I mean you're sort of got--you're saying the reason why you came up with it, you know, that it--but do you remember the exact circumstances?
Speaker 2: It was the Timberland [Company] circumstance that they said this [Timberland did not market to African Americans], but we basically came up with the idea over a period of time. And just, you know, you kind of--I'm working, J. [Alexander Martin, FUBU co-founder] is working and this guy is working, and I'm kind of just going, "You know, I want to make a company. I'll make a call." "Well, what name are we gonna call it?"  "I don't know, I don't know."  And we thought over a long period of time. It wasn't this--now where we happen to be, you know, a global entity, but you're not thinking that, you know.  When you're in the house.  So I can't really think of where exactly we came up.  It was not a time when we sat in a group and we said, "Let's think of a name."  It just slowly came to be.
Story_ID: 9290
Speaker 1: So it wasn't like so--you know, Carl [Brown, co-founder of FUBU clothing company] wanted one name--I mean or J. [Alexander Martin, co-founder of FUBU] wanted one name and some--was it just you and J. at the beginning?
Speaker 2: It was just me.
Speaker 1: Just you at the beginning.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And then the guys slowly trickled in.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But J. was--he was at FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York] though.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And so you're starting.  So this is in 1992 and you're going around selling these, you know, things.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: And when you made that eight hundred [dollars] the first time, how much had you spent?
Speaker 2: To make the hats?
Speaker 1: To make them.
Speaker 2: Probably had spent about $80--about $60.
Speaker 1: Now that would have someone excited.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And so was that your experience, you know, with all the Black Expos and things like that afterwards?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No as you--no.  Because I made those hats and I sold them personally.  But as you went on to the Black Expos and to get a good quality shirt and to get a good embroiderer and buying the space of the booth, the profit wasn't much.  The margin was not much.  'Cause you had to rent the vehicle to bring it out there. So it wasn't much, but that wasn't the issue at that point.  The issue was that people were wearing the product. People were buying it and going out and wearing it and actually the next expo we'd go to, people would have heard about us, and would come and look for us.  And that was a bigger high than anything else.
Speaker 1: And were there adjustments that you made to the clothing based on what people were saying?  Or you were just--it was just being received period.
Speaker 2: It was just being received.  And we had maybe--we probably had five styles. And--all either said, "FB" or "FUBU" on 'em.  Maybe it was a hockey jersey that we would buy from CCM [sports apparel company].  A blank hockey jersey.  And others were just T-shirts and maybe a girl cutoff T, and maybe two screen prints.  So maybe about seven items.
Story_ID: 9291
Speaker 1: And then when Hype--is it Hype--?
Speaker 2: Hype Williams [music video and film director].
Speaker 1: Right, Hype Williams.  When he got involved, did you approach him or he approached you?  Or how did that happen?
Speaker 2: I approached him.  I mean he had no knowledge about the company [FUBU clothing company].
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 2: I mean the company was only at that point maybe--all we had, you know, maybe after Black Expo was ten shirts.  I mean--so he didn't have any idea about us.  But because he was shooting the videos, I said, "Hey, Hype throw this in."  And it was also very--a very crucial moment to us.  Because what I say, one other gentleman called Ralph McDaniels [television host], who had the [music] video show in New York [New York] and still has one, 'Video Music Box' [television show]  He didn't know us from anywhere, but we kept asking him can he highlight the stuff in his show.  And he actually did a interview on us that hit the tri-state area [New York, New Jersey, Connecticut], and that started the stores buzzing and a lot more consumers.  The New York trend-setting consumers saw that.  And that created a sufficient--a sufficient buzz that when we would go to other video sets people would embrace us.
Speaker 1: Is this now--what year are we in now?  Are we in 1993 at that point?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Right, 1993, 1994.
Speaker 1: Four [1994] okay.
Story_ID: 9292
Speaker 1: And now you're not doing retail at this point?  Are you?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I'm doing some retail at this point.  I mean, in between Black Expos when I can re-order shirts, I was actually--I had a small, really small ad in, I think, 'Right On!' magazine or something like that.  And I placed the ad in there.  I think that was just for hats initially.  And I had got a lot of store requests from Japan and other places.  So I was actually selling to the stores in Japan and Seattle [Washington] and a couple in New York [New York], and maybe twenty accounts.  But I mean what I was really selling was a dozen shirts a time to them.  Wasn't a lot.  And sometimes they were selling and sometimes they weren't.
Speaker 1: And what did you learn during those early years just about the whole retail experience?  And, you know?  'Cause it's different when you're selling at, you know, at like the expos, where you're selling at a show.  And I'm asking what things stood you well in time?  Because that's a whole different--?
Speaker 2: What did I learn about retail?  You know, I can't say that I learned much.  It was just what I learned for the moment.  I didn't have much competition, and I wasn't selling a large amount of goods.  So it really--it really doesn't apply to day when you're running a real business.  Because, you know, if you're only selling twelve pieces, what are they really saying to you?  So I didn't really learn--I didn't really learn much in that regards.
Story_ID: 9293
Speaker 1: But then what was the next important moment then?  You know, with FUBU [clothing company]?  Was it--you know, who came on first?  Was it--?
Speaker 2: Who came on first in what sense?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean Carl [Brown, co-founder of FUBU] or--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) First J. [Alexander Martin, co-founder of FUBU] came on.  And then Carl.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And that was what year?
Speaker 2: Later '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This all--they all came on in '92 [1992], '93 [1993].  First J. came on. Then Carl came on and then Keith [Perrin, co-founder of FUBU] came on.  And what happened is we slowly moved--everybody slowly moved into my house.  And, you know, they--we were all working and paying the rent.  And, you know, running the company.  Kind of having fun with the Black Expo.  Not expecting it to be any huge like this.  And then it started to get a little more serious.  And I started going around trying to get--trying to get funding.  Trying to get SBLAs [Small Business Loan Association loans].
Speaker 1: And how did that work?  Did that work?
Speaker 2: That didn't work out.  I really did have a--I didn't have a business plan really.  And the companies wouldn't--the banks weren't ready to hear what I was talking about.  Because it never was really--has been done prior to that.  So the banks weren't really warm to that idea.  So we kept moving on and doing the product the way--the way we were doing it in the house.  But we were still going to shows.  And we're still getting more and more inquiries from the stores.  So what I finally did was get a second equity on my home.  And after I got the second equity on the home, it took a while for the funding to come through for that.  But in the midst of doing that, we went to a trade show, called the Magic Show [fashion show, Las Vegas, Nevada].  It's still exists today.  And that where all the vendors take out their products and all the, you know--all the retailers come and they purchase the product.  And they say what they wanna see for the next season being delivered.  So I had a small base of accounts, and who--a lot of 'em never really saw me or met me.  Never get to see the line.  They just got the product once it was sent to them.  And we, you know, made up a small sample line, twelve, fifteen pieces.  Some were sewn from hand, and some were bought and embroidered.  An we took a line out, and we stayed in the Mirage Hotel [Las Vegas, Nevada], and that was a quite a distance from the trade show actually.  But we mailed all the accounts that we were gonna be there showing our product.  And then a lot of accounts viewed us. And, you know, we wrote about 300,000 in orders. And, you know, we were obviously very excited about that.  And we came back to New York [New York], and the equity loan came through, and we started to make the goods to sell to them.  But, you know, we're getting into being a factory And that's a bigger problem, because, you know, your fabrics were tied up overseas.  No longer do you wanna buy from the domestic, you know, stores.  And it became a headache.  But we were still going, we were still producing goods and mailing 'em out and getting goods to sell through to the store.  But our money was slowly being depleted.  And then my mother said, "You know, why don't you go after funding from some private people."  And you know, I really didn't--you know, I was so discouraged from all the SBLA banks and everybody turning me down, that I really wasn't, you know, thinking about it.  And my mother put an ad in 'The New York Times' [newspaper] saying something to the effect of, "Million dollars in orders. Need financing."  And a lot of people called. A lot of people called about it.  But, you know, maybe some of them were the wrong people.  Some of had--with scams, you know.  Some could have been mobsters, loan sharks, whatever they were. But Samsung America [electronics company] called.  And for about a year after that they looked at us and saw what we were doing, and they were calling to be at least a distributor in that effect.  But they weren't just gonna jump. So we had to still do what we had to do and make the product.  And when I say make the product, I mean we had raw materials in the house, and we had some young ladies in their sewing clothes, and we had bought sewing machines and made the whole first floor into a factory.  And we were a real, you know--we were a real factory at that point in the middle of a residential area.  So obviously there was a lot of--a lot of codes we were breaking and laws that we were breaking.  So we had to hurry up and get out of there.  And shortly after that, after the people in the textile division of Samsung saw--and were calling around and saw that our product was being sold, I mean sometimes we were selling polar fleece and sweatshirts in the months that were the hottest months of the year.  So people obviously wanted the product, no matter what.  We worked out a deal where they--they became my distributors.  And we--then it was time for us to go nationwide, you know, in a bigger way.
Story_ID: 9294
Speaker 1: Now when your mother placed that ad, that seems on hindsight brilliant.  But I mean did she--why did she choose 'The New York Times' [newspaper] to do it?  Do you--I mean with--or did she discuss any of that with you?  Or--?
Speaker 2: She discussed it a little bit with me.  But, you know, that's--my mother has that type of insight on--and I didn't necessarily have that insight.  You know, I'm--you know, I'm really young at that time.  And I don't know where--I don't even know about the world of getting funding and how people write checks, and all I knew is either you go to a bank or you don't, you know.  And I think that was actually the first thing that my mother tried.  And if that wouldn't have worked, she would have done--you know, several other things to at least try to get that opportunity to raise money.
Speaker 1: Daymond, do you know how much she spent on that ad?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you--when you say, "You got a lot of calls."  And why did she put a million?  That you had a million dollars in orders?  'Cause that wasn't really true at the time.  Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother's a liar.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's just her.
Speaker 1: (laughs) Okay.
Speaker 2: She can't help it.
Speaker 1: (laughs) No, but--.
Speaker 2: No, but I think that's--I mean that's obviously, you know, that's the way to do it.  Nobody's gonna call and say, "I got $10,000 in orders."  I mean maybe somebody'll call.
Story_ID: 9295
Speaker 1: So the person from Samsung [America, electronics company], who was their name that actually called you?  And what did they, you know?  Did they come out to visit your---you know, come out to the house and visit?  And--?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't--they never came out to the house and visit.  I don't recall the name of the person initially that called, but I really don't remember the name.  But we came up with the product.  And it was a long process.  They weren't just looking at us.  They were looking at other people to work with.  I mean, 'cause that's what they do as a company. They--they private label, or they do whatever. So I don't remember.  But we had to bring the stuff over to them in the city [New York, New York] somewhere.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the first--was it--you know, when you mortgaged your house, was that the loan that, you know, I had read that it was a hundred thousand dollar loan.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was about a hundred thousand.
Speaker 1: That's a lot of money even to go after at that point.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you--so they take you to that level, right?  Now what is the--what is your agreement with Samsung at  that point?
Speaker 2: What is my agreement?
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Yeah when they first--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) My agreement was to distribute to--if after three years or five years that we wouldn't distribute more than five thousand--five million dollars worth of product, that it really wasn't, you know, a good business, maybe we should rethink it and part ways.
Speaker 1: And what did that--where was their distribution?  Can you talk a little about there?  'Cause I mean people hear Samsung, a lot of times they may think electronics or they may think other things.
Speaker 2: Right.  What is the--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) So can you talk about what--you know, what their whole distribution channels were?
Speaker 2: Samsung is an $80 billion company.  Samsung distributes everything from nuclear reactors, to cars, to textiles, everything else.  I mean--to electronics.  I don't know all the functionalities of their company, but they are, in sense, a bank.  You know, and in sense a distribution for certain categories that they carry. The textile division, as far as I know, is basically the smallest division.  I think they make most of their money off of generators and cars and nuclear reactors. And at this moment, maybe electronics is becoming a stronger component.  But other than that, I--you know, that's a question for a Samsung executive, I'm sure.
Story_ID: 9296
Speaker 1: So when you--when you decide--remember you were saying that, you know, we had our--you know, our business.  And we were--we had turned into a manufacturing concern.  But at this point at doing those levels, what are your--what are the next things that you have to sort of put in place to--?
Speaker 2: To manufacture?  I think everything needs to be in place after that.  Because there was no technique to what we [FUBU clothing company] were doing.  You know, there was no official billing--proper way of billing.  You know, we're shipping regular UPS [United Parcel Service]--manufacturing the goods.  I mean, you know, some things were irregular, some things were not.  I mean they were--we were just really doing it--everything by hand.  So every aspect of the business was right, because it was being  done, but every aspect was wrong.  Because it wasn't being done the proper way.
Speaker 1: And what did you--what did the fir--you know, you and the three others [J. Alexander Martin, Carl Brown, Keith Perrin, co-founders of FUBU] put in place that help put, you know, take you forward?  That's what I'm trying to--?
Speaker 2: Well once you--once we had the distributor [Samsung America, electronics company], and we came up and saw how the real process was working, the distributor automatically is gonna ship and bill.  And they're already--they're automatically gonna make product off of orders, so you don't have to worry about opening LCs [letter of credit].  And when they open LCs and they're watching their money, they have to secure the manufacturing.  So basically everything got put into order with that agreement.  It was a long process to put that agreement together.
Speaker 1: And so the--so the four of you then focused on just design and, you know, listening more to your market or marketing itself?
Speaker 2: Well we--we focused on design.  We focused on marketing.  We still focus on distribution, because once you get with a distribution company, especially in fashion, they can be distributing to the lower chain, where it can hurt the upper chains that you're trying to distribute to.  So, you know, we had to still be a sales force in regards to that.  You know, we had to hire our own salesmen and make sure that the product was being put in the right places.
Story_ID: 9297
Speaker 1: And were there any--I mean you had said--remember when you were, you know, looking at the car deal and, you know, where you were gonna sort of like refurbish or repackage cars.  But there wasn't enough money in it. And this--all of a sudden, this has sort of taken off in about what?  Two years?
Speaker 2: (nods for yes) Mm-hm.  No, about four years.
Speaker 1: Four years.  Okay.  But it's taken off.  And was there at any point, Daymond, was there any point that you were feeling, "Oh my God!  You know, this is--I feel out of control?"  Or was it all just sort of like, high--you know, you're on a high and going forward?
Speaker 2: No, every day we were out of control.  Every day.  Every single day.  Even 'til today.  You know, it's a healthy paranoia that you have. You know, the--there's a lot of people that never--have not made it as far in the world, not necessarily me, but as far as they would like to be because they relaxed.  And that is why--that's how we [FUBU clothing company] become a worldwide entity, because we never give up.  And every time that we are relaxed, we look for something new to do.  So every day it's out of control.
Story_ID: 9298
Speaker 1: Now let's talk about some of the--you know, the deals that you've put in place, that you were sort of most--you've been most proud of? You know, over time?
Speaker 2: Deals that I put in place?
Speaker 1: Yeah. I mean--you've--you're turning now into really an entertainment concern here.  In some respects.  I think you had done a cosmetics deal before.
Speaker 2: You know, it's just like the day, you know, I signed the distribution with Samsung [America, electronics company].  It's not something you're necessarily proud of; it's something that is your next step.  And you may be proud of it after the success of it--or even after the failure to know that you gave it a good shot.  But it's--that's not necessarily the attitude that we have.  We are happy that we had an opportunity, but we're not proud as--you know, it's like a guy who goes, "Okay.  We did it.  We got it. We're rich."  That doesn't happen.  It's almost like, "Okay.  You guys ready to put your thinking caps on?  We're about to take on this angle.  We're about to take on cosmetics."  If it's bad, it can hurt the bigger--the bigger picture.  So it's like, "Okay guys, start concentrating."  So it's not necessarily proud. I have achievements that we have had.  But I'm not proud about the things as we had signed them.  They weren't moments--maybe the only thing I can say we were proud about, was when we were in the Macy's [department store] window.  You know, we were the first company of our kind to be in the Macy's window on 34th Street [New York, New York].  And, you know, that one can't do bad for your company.  You know, that's just it.  You know, you were--you are respected on a certain level.  I'd say that's a time we're proud.  But other agreements that we've made, I can't say we're proud.  We just knew that there's a lot of work ahead of us.
Story_ID: 9299
Speaker 1: But what about the accomplishments?  What are those that you, you know, consider that are--have been important in the growth of the company [FUBU clothing company]?
Speaker 2: Well there's a lot of accomplishments that have been important in the growth of the company, and then I think a lot of accomplishments that have been important just to individuals here.  You know, in the growth of the company, I think the accomplishments of taking on all the licensed divisions and expanding our company to intertwine with fashion, and say that we're the first ones to hire a supermodel such as Tyson Beckford, and the first ones to open fifty international stores, and the number one men's brand in Korea.  The accomplishments--number two selling tuxedo in the country.  Number one selling boys suit. The first one to go into Linens 'n Things [home furnishing stores].  The type of company we are, a young man's sportswear, going into linens and things and have one of the--our beds are like within the number--top three sellers since our debuted in there. First company to do new music and original music, fashion to music who actually was on videos and a lot of radio play.  So those are a lot of the company accomplishments, and then, you know, you have the personal accomplishments where even though it's a double-edged sword, you see that we've spawned a new industry.  You know, we showed corporate America the relevance of the young America's buying power.  The fact that, you know, there could have been thirty to forty friends from my neighborhood [Hollis, Queens, New York] I grew up with that worked for us at any given time.  The fact that there are a lot of people, Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] graduates, and people who were the head of big companies in other countries who work and report to us.  The fact that we--we have given so many young people jobs, that eventually come here and move on, to change the face of what really happens in fashion and marketing in this world, you know, probably three hundred people walked through these doors and have been employed by me, who are now at Ralph Lauren [clothing company], at Calvin Klein [clothing company], at other places who wouldn't have normally had those opportunities.  And then also, you know, when you talk to kids and stuff you see that the kids now they know that you can't only be a drug dealer or a basketball player when you come out of the neighborhood, that you can actually be entrepreneurs.  It's not us single-handedly who does that.  You know, it's the--it's a lot of entertainers in the world.

Speaker 1: And what about--what would you say about the youth culture and what it's saying in terms of its impact on society?
Speaker 2: Well I think the youth culture right now is society basically. It is what generates any and all of the new movements.  Because, you know, they're the ones on it the quickest.  And they're the most--they're the one who speak about it the loudest.  And they're the one who communicate the most through the Internet, and they make the world smaller.  And they're the ones that are powering our country, 'cause the 'Fortune' [magazine] 500 companies are trying to tap into them.  And they're really chasing that dollar.
Speaker 1: But with success like that comes responsibility.  And I guess what I'm asking also is what is--what do you feel your sense of responsibility out there?
Speaker 2: My sense of responsibility is basically to stay on course with what we've established as our [FUBU clothing company] identity.  I can't tell you that another businessman has a responsibility.  If his--Howard Stern [radio personality] has a different responsibility.  His responsibility is to be who he is.  And our responsibility is to be who we are.  It all depends on, you know, what your target audience is and was and the way your morals are in the company.

Speaker 1: And your friendships, you know, have sustained you. And I was wondering, you know, about, you know, how you've made that--been able to make that possible?  The four of you [Daymond John, J. Alexander Martin, Carl Brown, Keith Perrin, co-founders of FUBU clothing company]?  How have you been able to do that?
Speaker 2: We have had problems just like any brothers do, and we still go through our problems today.  I think that--I think that, you know, if we weren't talking about from a friendship side, we're all bonded to this company, we all have investments in this company.  This is our--this is our kids' future that's tied up in the company.  So we all make what we feel is the right move for the benefit of the company.  And then, again, we definitely are also friends.  So yeah.  You know, my guys don't like me yelling at them if I have to. And I don't like them letting me down.
Story_ID: 9302
Speaker 1: You gotta look at a lot of people who sustain friendships who break up in business are usually groups.  They're usually people with everybody say, "You're the man. You're the man."  And, you know, that's an aesthetic situation.  I can sing just like you can sing.  I may sing terrible and you may sing better.  Or that I may look one way and you may look another way.  So that's why the--you usually see these people who break up are groups.  And then you see the other type of people who break up who are divorced--who are people who have a lot of emotions in it. But, you know, in the form of me and my guys, if my guys or myself wanna do something else, we can do something else while we're still at FUBU [clothing company].  And at the end of the day, you know, we all have our job.  Keith [Perrin, co-founder of FUBU] is sales, J. [Alexander Martin, co-founder of FUBU] is design, I'm the CEO [chief executive officer].  I look over everything.  Carl [Brown, co-founder of FUBU] was entertainment, and he's deciding if he still wants to do anything or put somebody else there.  So we all have our divisions.  So we try to do that so we're not in each other's face all the time.

Speaker 1: I wanna ask you also about the hip-hop culture and what impact you see it having on society?  And, you know, long-standing, because it has become, you know, a major force.
Speaker 2: The hip-hop culture what it has on society, I think this is--this is what--this is the resistance that they faced with jazz when it first came around, and rock and roll. But this is the way that young America speaks to young America. Not black. Just young America speaks to young America.  And I think it will always be the trend-setting.  Because really the kids that are coming out of this culture are street kids generally.  And they're talking about the issues in their community, and every--all the time the issues will be the newer issues in the world.  Even the conflict of war will be in--you hear it change in their rap--in their music.  The music over the last couple of years has been very angry, you know.  Very loud.  You know, and it's from the images they're capturing, from television, and images in the neighborhood.  So I think this is the most relevant one to young America.  Because, you know, rock and roll used to be that, but not everybody knows how to play guitar and can do all those things that you need to do.  When you're in the hip-hop or rap community, I can start rapping right now without anything else around.  And you can tell if I'm good or not.  You know, so I think that its gonna be the most relevant one.  Forever.
Speaker 1: And in terms of--do you have a favorite artist?  Do you have a favorite artist?  Yourself?
Speaker 2: You know, I have several.  You know.  I like everybody.  I like--of course, I'm gonna--I love LL Cool J [rapper].  You know. I like Jennifer Lopez [actress, singer].  But, you know, I like Fleetwood Mac [music group] just as much.  So, you know--and that's the problem with people trying to understand this young generation.  This generation has no color and no certain type of--no certain type of music, you know.

Speaker 1: What do you wanna accomplish next then?
Speaker 2: I'm not looking too far ahead.  We--I just want to keep expanding the company [FUBU clothing company] and reinforcing it in a global way.  And I just want everybody to--you know, I wanna be that company that's around twenty, thirty years.  And if not, then not.  But at least I know I gave it--we give it our best shot.  And, you know, you're not always in control of those things.  There're environment changes, you know.

Speaker 1: What do you want people to say about you though?
Speaker 2: (Pause). You know, normally I would say I couldn't care less about what people say about me, unfortunately. I guess maybe, you know, if somebody would say anything, I guess I would want them to say that, you know, I tried to make the right decisions in everybody's favor.  I tried to do the right thing.  Now if they didn't like it, that's their problem.  But at least I wanted them to know that I had--people can say that I had no bad intent in the things that I was doing.  Whether it was--even with the [FUBU] clothing company to my consumer.  That--I never tried to just put the name on something and sell it to them and not--and not give them the promise of what we say it's supposed to be.  And, you know, just as dealing with people personally, I never want to give them something fake or lie to them to get something.  So I mean, I think that's the best thing I'd like people to say, "He's as honest as they come.  You know, he just told it to you straight up."
Story_ID: 9306
Speaker 1: And FUBU [clothing company].  What does it stand for now?  I mean what is it's--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) It stands for what it always has. "For us, by us."
Speaker 1: I know.  But I'm just saying in terms of, you know, the sense of what that is.  You know. "For us, by us".  It's even changed though, that "for us, by us".
Speaker 2: The "for us, by us" has never changed.  But you say you have a more global view of it now.  Kids are still rapping, kids are still going through political issues in other countries--still--kids are still sixteen, fifteen, who love beautiful clothes, who like to put it on and express themselves, in a certain way with it.  It has never changed.  That's always been the concept.  I should be able to have the same type of--type of discussion with a kid from Nigeria or Korea or from Japan that I have with another one. And say, "You like this jersey?  You know what I'm saying?  See how I put it together with denim?  You see the sneakers match?  It's hot. Right?"  I mean that's--this is what it is.  So it's just an idea.  It's not--it's  nothing else.
