Speaker 1: (Laughter) You're making me hungry. And your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I'd say the fall.  That's when I was married, in the fall and its weather is perfect.
Speaker 1: Definitely in this area, too.  And is there a particular saying that you, you have or that people know that's a Betty Brownism?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, my grandmother was the one that everything you did, she would have a quote for it.  So, she would say, "The fruit doesn't fall far from the tree," (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, that's an awesome one.
Speaker 2: Yes and I've used that quite often.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)  Mrs. Brown [HistoryMaker Mary "Betty" Brown], you actually have another great saying? Can you share that with us (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that is, ye know not when the son of man is coming, and I'm ready.
Speaker 1: And what prompts that saying? You have to give us a background?
Speaker 2: Well, people always say to me, "Oh, you're always dressed," because it's one thing I'm noted for is always having my makeup on, and I just get up like that and when I go to church, I have my hat on every Sunday and everyone has a comment 'cause nobody wears hats anymore, and I still prevail and wear my hat and I don't care what people say.  And so they say, "Where are you going?  You're all dressed up!"  And so I give that comment, ye know not when the son of man may come, and I'm ready (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  I love that one!  That's--can I use that one?
Speaker 2: You certainly may.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Pass it on.
Story_ID: 360264
Speaker 1: So you were born in March 1932 in Schaumburg [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: In Chicago.
Speaker 2: But we moved to Schaumburg when I was about three or four years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, now where in Chicago were you born?
Speaker 2: I was--what's the name of the hospital here, Pro-?
Speaker 1: Provident [Provident Hospital; Provident Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, is that the big hospital?  No.
Speaker 1: On the South Side?
Speaker 2: No.  It wasn't on the South Side.  What's the other hospital?  Oh, I can't think.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was it Michael Reese [Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois]?  There's--
Speaker 2: It wasn't Provident I know.  It's the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was it a black hospital?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  No.  It's the biggest hospital there--
Speaker 1: Well, Cook County [Cook County Hospital; John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Cook County!
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's where I was born, at Cook County Hospital.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your family moved to Schaumburg in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --in the mid-1930s.  Now why did--?
Speaker 2: They moved because my folks [Margaret Brown Stephens and Thermon Stephens, Sr.] wanted us to--they thought that Chicago was getting too crowded and my dad was a chauffeur for Walgreens, and so he became a chauffeur for a very wealthy lawyer.  That's--his name was Attorney Jennings [Everett Jennings] and they had a big estate in Schaumburg, and so they moved there and my dad was still the chauffeur for him.  He commuted to Chicago and my mother was the cook there.  She fixed all the meals, and there were like three houses on the property and fruit trees everywhere.  So, that's where I grew up on the range (laughter) which is now Woodfield [Schaumburg, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Well, that is really amazing.  So your mom was the cook there.  I just wanted to note that here.  Your dad was a chauffeur.
Story_ID: 360265
Speaker 1: And you have three siblings?  Can you give us their (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have two, two siblings.  Two brothers who have passed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm sorry to hear that.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, I have--and, and can you give us their names?
Speaker 2: William [William Stephens] was the oldest and he was a pianist, and my youngest was Thermon [Thermon Stephens, Jr.], and he was a truck driver for those huge trucks.
Speaker 1: Oh, like an eighteen-wheeler?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's how he died though.  Actually because there was a--right before Christmas and it was really slippery and those, those big trucks sometimes though if you're going on a, a decline it pulled over, and my oldest brother, he had a heart attack and passed.
Speaker 1: Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
Speaker 2: Oh, well.  Thanks.
Speaker 1: So William was one, you're two?
Speaker 2: I'm the middle one.
Speaker 1: Okay, and Thermon was three.  So, you guys all grew up on the--on like the estate--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of the Jennings family [in Schaumburg, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes, and then when I was six years old, we moved to Elgin [Illinois]. Okay.  Now at that time, was your dad [Thermon Stephens, Sr.] still the chauffeur for Mr. Jennings [Everett Jennings]?
Speaker 1: Yes, he was.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He, he remained that 'til, 'til--he found a house in Elgin and then he retired from being the chauffeur there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And was your mom [Margaret Brown Stephens] still the, the chef?
Speaker 1: Well, my mom always had a job as she was a fantastic cook.  She could fix anything and she would start cooking on Thursday.  That's what--that was for the desserts, and then on Sunday she would have all the regular food, and then we bought a home in Elgin and we had a huge backyard where we raised chickens.  This was back in the days.  Even in a city, there was a milk man down the street from us and he still had has milk cart, and you could still have a backyard with chickens and raise crops and everything.
Speaker 2: That is really interesting.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 360266
Speaker 1: Let me ask you a little bit--that was about your parents [Margaret Brown Stephens and Thermon Stephens, Sr.].  Do you know where they were born and their roots (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My dad was born in Corinth, Mississippi and he always says he got the name Stephens from--I guess the mayor's name was Stephens, and my mother was born out in Baltimore, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Now how did--how and where did they meet?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: They met in Chicago [Illinois].  My mother was working--I forgot where--and they met and they courted and they married.
Speaker 1: And do you know what year they married?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  Well, they were married what fifty--I had a fifty-year party for them.  I can't remember though, and we had a fifty-year celebration of their marriage.
Speaker 1: Okay. So they were married over fifty years.
Speaker 2: Do you remember what year you had the party?
Speaker 1: No, I don't remember at all.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So they met in Chicago.  Do you know what, what year they came to Chicago?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now your grandparents.  Do you know anything about your maternal or paternal grandparents (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know my grandfather was from Mississippi and--
Speaker 2: Your mom's father?
Speaker 1: This is my dad's father.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And can you--do you know his name?
Speaker 1: No, I can't remember his name.  He's a very stately looking gentleman, and I guess they kind of lost track of each other because he remarried and you know how things happen.  And my mother's father was a minister and his name was Brown and--
Speaker 2: Oh, how interesting.
Speaker 1: Yes, that's funny.  And so my mother was very musical.  She played in the church choir and the music was there, and my grandmother sang a lot.
Speaker 2: Do you--do you know their first names?
Speaker 1: Bertha.
Speaker 2: Bertha Brown?
Speaker 1: Bertha Brown Caldwell [Bertha Caldwell Stephens], and then she married my uncle and became Stephens (laughter).  My dad's uncle.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's really--
Speaker 1: That name keeps--
Speaker 2: Popping up (laughter)!
Speaker 1: --coming up, yes.
Speaker 2: I love it.  So you don't really know a lot about your family history before they came (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  No.  Well, I know that my dad had a lot of relatives in, in Chicago.  His mother, and her name was Rachel [Rachel Stephens (ph.)], a most beautiful woman you'd ever want to see.  She was part Indian [Native American] and she--her sister [Mamie Hill Roberts] was married to, to Bishop Roberts [Bishop William Matthew Roberts] of the Church of God in Christ [Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ, Chicago, Illinois] on 40th [Street] and State [Street], so that family there was no end.  I think they had eighteen children [sic.].  So in the summer, I always spent my summers with my grandmother, Rachel, and I would go to that church.  And so my dad's family was predominant, so I never got to really know my mother's family because this family was overwhelming.  Yeah, and they would come to our house many of those relatives.  On Sunday, my mother would have fifty to sixty people for dinner.
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness.
Speaker 1: I know, 'cause we were the country cousins.
Speaker 2: Right.  That, that is--I guess what was that, that trip like from Chicago to Elgin [Illinois] back then?
Speaker 1: Oh, that was--that was fabulous to come to the country (laughter).
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm--just wondering--
Speaker 1: It's fifty miles.
Speaker 2: Right.  What road was there then?
Speaker 1: [U.S.] Route 20.
Speaker 2: Oh, take 20.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Of course it's all changed now 'cause we have the toll road, but Route 20 was like the way they came.
Speaker 2: Take you right out there.
Speaker 1: And they always loved my mother's cooking, so they always came out.  They invited themselves and now that I think back, I think how did she do that all the time?  Plus, she went to church before.  So like I said, she started cooking on the Thursday.  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Plus her, her work.
Speaker 1: Her reg--regular work.
Speaker 2: A pretty amazing woman.
Speaker 1: She really was.
Story_ID: 360267
Speaker 1: Well you know, you were talking a little bit about your--some of your early childhood memories in Schaumburg [Illinois] and Elgin [Illinois].  Could you talk a little bit more about what your, your home in Elgin was like and--?
Speaker 2: Our home was very nice.  We had--always had a nice home, and my dad [Thermon Stephens, Sr.], after he lived in Elgin awhile, started his own trucking business, a garbage business you would call it back then.  And so he would pick up from South Elgin [Illinois] which is a, a community within itself now, but it was hardly a little town, and he was the garbage man who'd pick up every week from South Elgin, and so he would get to know a lot of people.  I, I was telling my husband [Floyd Brown] the other day, it was amazing during the war [World War II, WWII] I didn't know--we never had a shortage of anything 'cause my dad was a kind of person always met the right person.  So one week if we wanted fish, we'd have barrels of fish and we'd give some away.  We had barrels of sugar.  We had barrels of things because he knew all these people, and meat--we had meat, that we had everything.  So, I didn't know that we were poor.  I guess we were rich in other ways, but we always had a beautiful home and my mother [Margaret Brown Stephens] was always a wonderful homemaker.
Story_ID: 360268
Speaker 1: Any particular sights, sounds and smells from your childhood (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, and I'm noted for that now, too, candied yams.  My mother [Margaret Brown Stephens]--they would pay her to fix that, and we belonged to the church which was right across the street from us.  It was Saint James A.M.E. Church [Elgin, Illinois] and they would have dinners and things and my mother sang in the choir, and of course, I sang in the choir.  Then you went to Bible study on Wednesdays and all of the things that I guess you grow up doing (laughter).  I guess--I guess every--I thought everybody was like that.  Living in a small town, you, you just--you know everybody, they know you.  And then my mother would also make smothered chicken, and then she was noted for her, her lemon chiffon pie with a graham cracker crust, and her seven-layered cake, and her pound cake, which I just gave the recipe to my son [F. Keith Brown] and he just made it for the first time (laughter).
Speaker 1: You've made me so hungry right now (laughter).  I was going to say, "Can we share?"  Well you--now candied yams, what, what was your mom's recipe?  What was it--the recipe?
Speaker 2: Lots of butter.  About a half a pound of butter and about a cup of sugar 'til--and you cook the potatoes--sweet potatoes ahead of time and you peel them, but you didn't make them so that they were done.  They were still firm in the middle.  Then she'd put them in a big pan and she'd slice a half of pound of butter and sugar and she'd rotate, and she put it in the oven and cook it for about an hour and it was like candied.  It was decadent (laughter) to be sure.
Speaker 1: So you have a (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  And the other thing she was noted for because my grandmother always made homemade bread and she had large hands.  So, I remember asking her, "How, how do you measure that?"  She said, "Oh, you just take your hand like that," and she, she--that's the way she made--every week we had homemade bread.  And so my mother would have three-leaf clover bread, you know.  You--our loaves of bread or cinnamon buns done in a black skillet.
Speaker 1: Like a, a regular skillet?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  One of--a big black skillet and then you'd put the brown sugar and butter and pecans, and then you turn the cinnamon rolls and you let them rise, and then you'd bake 'em for fifteen minutes, and then you turn 'em over on a big plate and all of that syrup (laughter).  Needless to say, we liked to eat.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Oh, most definitely.  Now what is three-clover bread?
Speaker 2: Those are the ones you see the three, three bud-, three little--that's what we call it three, three-clover leaf bud.
Story_ID: 360269
Speaker 1: And what was it like being a black family out in Elgin [Illinois]?  How many black families were there?
Speaker 2: Well, there weren't very many, and you still don't have a lot.  It was different and our school was just maybe two or three blocks from our house, and you get called the regular names.  That just happens all the time and I don't know, it made me strong because my mother [Margaret Brown Stephens] was a strong Christian woman and she would say, "Nothing people say to you can destroy you.  It's what you think within," and I grew up with that thought in my--even though I knew there was prejudice, and I didn't realize it until I graduated from high school.
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of your, your elementary school?
Speaker 2: Wing School [Abby C. Wing School, Elgin, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Wing?
Speaker 2: W-I-N-G.  Yes, Wing School.
Speaker 1: And are there any teachers you remember from that time?
Speaker 2: I remember a Mrs.--Ms. Logan [ph.] and she was a very dear teacher and she would pay attention to you.  She was very gentle.
Speaker 1: So, I guess you--like as you were saying, there were not many blacks students, but it was integrated?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, but integrated in a sense you'd might have a class with twenty-five and you have three blacks.  So, you didn't have a lot of black students.
Speaker 1: And what kind of student were you then?
Speaker 2: I was just an average student.  I think one of the advantages I had of just being able to mix everywhere was my grandmother would work two or three jobs so I could have voice lessons, piano lessons, tap dancing lessons, and so I, I truly believe if you have a talent, you're always welcome or invited (laughter) because you can do something.  I've tried to pass that on to my kids [F. Keith Brown and Diane Brown Douglas], but I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: I think they seem kind of talented.  I, I think you did pass it on (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  But that's something and so I grew up singing in the choir, and then I would sing and I always sang in school, too.  So, I was noted for singing.
Story_ID: 360270
Speaker 1: I guess I want to explore that because that I--I'm really intrigued about suburban life then in the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s] as, as a young black girl.  So, you're in between your brothers [William Stephens and Thermon Stephens, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, that's something sibling rivalry, but they always laughed at me.  They said they knew I could protect myself because I had a flat nose (laughter).  They said, "That's because you're always sticking your nose in somebody else's business," (laughter) and so that's what my brothers would say.
Speaker 1: Which came to serve you well--
Speaker 2: Yes, it did.
Speaker 1: --as a society reporter.
Speaker 2: I was always nosey (laughter).  Well, growing up in, in the summer you went to church every Sunday and then in the summertime, you went to bible school.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That's just--you didn't just stay home, you went to bible--summer bible school which was about, about a mile from where I lived.  And so we had to pass a lot of homes that were basically a white neighborhood, and I remembered being called names along the way and lots of times those people had cherry trees and we would pick their cherries and flowers and, of course, they called us really names, but the, the bible school was integrated also.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  So--
Speaker 2: I never thought about prejudice.
Speaker 1: In, in our current sense.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I, I, I knew--I kind of knew, but I didn't know.  I didn't really realize the hurt of it and as they called me names, that didn't really bother me.
Speaker 1: 'Cause your grandmother told you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's right (laughter).
Speaker 1: --it won't hurt you.  You know, I didn't ask what is the, the age difference between you and your brothers?
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: On both sides?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 360271
Speaker 1: So you're at the Wing School [Abby C. Wing School, Elgin, Illinois], you graduate from there in what year?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  I must've been--I graduated from high school in 1950.  So, what--?
Speaker 1: Okay.  So vice versa.  So '46 [1946].
Speaker 2: Forty-six [1946] and it was during the time they had--I don't know if they had that in Chicago [Illinois], but our grade schools were divided in A and B.
Speaker 1: Now, now what did that mean?
Speaker 2: That would mean that you'd go in the B and you'd so many months in there, and then you went to B, A, and then you went to the next grade.  All the classes were A, B.
Speaker 1: Interesting.
Speaker 2: It had nothing to do with your level of knowing or anything.  That's the way--and my class was the last class that did A, B.  And so, I would graduate from high school in 1950, but there wasn't a class to graduate, so I took up--
Speaker 1: Why--now why wasn't there a class?
Speaker 2: Because there weren't enough kids.
Speaker 1: How many--?
Speaker 2: In my class there were like eight.
Speaker 1: Where were you when--I mean--?
Speaker 2: Well see, they kept dividing them also.  Eight in A and eight in B or, you know, they were all divided.  I don't know why they did that.
Speaker 1: That's really--
Speaker 2: It wasn't race or anything.  That's just the way it was back then.  And then I graduated in midterm like in January, and there wasn't a real big class to graduate with.  I could've left school, but I decided that I would take some other courses 'cause there was a college, and so I took psychology and I took up something else and that's when I knew I was going to go into nurse's training.  So then I graduated in 1951, the class of, so I could be in the yearbook and all of those things.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a crazy system (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm trying to grasp that, but--
Speaker 2: They didn't have that in the city.  That was country-like.
Speaker 1: Well, I, I guess it, it made for a more intimate setting in the classroom (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, it did.
Speaker 1: At the very least.  So, you, you graduated from Elgin High School [Elgin, Illinois] in 1951--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --to a larger class.
Story_ID: 360272
Speaker 1: Do you remember any, any mentors from that time?  What made you decide to go into nursing?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd studied voice for about ten years and I really wanted to pursue music and my mother [Margaret Brown Stephens] said, "Oh, no, no, no."  She said for one thing, I would be with a different type of person, the wild people or musicians, (laughter) and the other thing is that she said, "You'd probably never finish and so I want you to be able to support yourself.  Every woman should be able to support herself."  And my other thought was I did like nursing 'cause I always took care of our sick animals and I, I had a feeling for taking care of people.  So, I went into nurse's training.
Story_ID: 360273
Speaker 1: You know what?  I'm going to jump back just a few years.  I didn't kind of explore what it was like being in high school [Elgin High School, Elgin, Illinois] in the--in the heights of World War II [WWII] 'cause you did talk about some of--
Speaker 2: Well, it was fine because I sang, and so I belonged to a group of singers.  One group was all white was called the Unisingers, and then I belonged to a mixed group that were three black gir- women--girls and we sang and then we would compete on a state level, and so our, our group always won first place 'cause we could harmonize.  And so, we were integrated because of the music, and then in high school, you could choose to be involved in whatever you want to. Now that I look back on my high school book that I see my picture, I've got that much listened under my name and my husband [Floyd Brown] said, "When did you do all of that?"  I said, "Well, that's what you did."  He was a city boy, so he didn't realize in the country you do home ec [home economics], you cook, you do lot--a lot volunteer work and that's something you do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, do you--did you have male classmates who were drafted?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I guess that probably contributed to your small class--
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: --as well.
Story_ID: 360274
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-one [1951] you graduated [from Elgin High School, Elgin, Illinois], you decide that you want to pursue nursing?
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to.  I worked at the hospital there.  My mother [Margaret Brown Stephens] was a nurse's aide by then at Sherman Hospital [Elgin, Illinois], and so naturally she said that I could work there for the summer.  She'd let me--find me a job although they only had two blacks in the whole hospital working as aides.
Speaker 1: Now, where is this Sherman--?
Speaker 2: Because Sherman Hospital is in Elgin [Illinois] because they were prejudice, and somehow my mother got the job and she worked in central service, and that's where I worked and I thought, well that's a good job for me because I'll be going into nurse's training.  And so I worked there that summer and then I wanted to pursue nurse's training, so I went to the, the director of nurses and told her I wanted to come in to nurse's training because they had a school of nursing there.  And she said to me, "I'm sorry that you couldn't pursue that because nobody would like you to give them the bed pan."  And so that's when it--prejudice really slapped me in the face because there were Spanish people working there.  In fact, there was one Spanish girl that worked in central service with me that was the same color as me, and she could just barely speak English and they took her in.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So, that was the big hurt that I felt that I really realized that, "Oh, my.  There is a difference."  And the other thing I realized that I wanted to get a job at Woolworth's [F.W. Woolworth Company] and they would not have blacks work there also. So--
Speaker 1: So could you shop there?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we could shop there, and you could eat at the fountain.
Speaker 1: But you couldn't work there?
Speaker 2: Work there, no.
Speaker 1: 'Cause that's an interesting flip.
Speaker 2: Very interesting.  But my mother had a friend who worked for the mother head of Saint Joseph's Hospital [Saint Joseph Hospital; Presence Saint Joseph Medical Center] in Joliet [Illinois], the mother superior, and so her friend said, "I'll intercede for you," and her name was Sister Priscilla [ph.], "And maybe Sister Priscilla would take you in," 'cause she was very fond of this lady who worked for her.  And so she did intercede for me and Sister Priscilla said that she would interview me.  And I went for my interview and she was a very strict woman, very--.  I, I liked her though from the beginning and she said, "Ms. Stephens [HistoryMaker Mary "Betty" Brown], I will treat you no better and no worse than any other student," and I was her first black student at Saint Joseph Hospital in Joliet.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: That was 1951 'cause I went right in.
Story_ID: 360275
Speaker 1: Black families in, in Elgin [Illinois] when she was in high school.  So of, of eight and--eight and ten kids in the families.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I just forgot my question (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  And I sang with them and we would win state competitions for singing together.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.  That's right.  I want to ask were you still in touch with them, or are they still in the area, any of those families (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  No, they're not in the area and then I kind of lost touch.  I think your life changes.  I know there's a group called Life Changes [ph.] and that really is true.  It's nothing to do with prejudice or anything like that, but you go different ways and you don't see people.  They moved away out of the city and I'm still there.  (Laughter)  My kids [F. Keith Brown and Diane Brown Douglas] tease me.  They say, "Gee mom, you really went far," (laughter) and I'm still in the same town.  So, I've stayed there all these years.
Story_ID: 360276
Speaker 1: On the previous tape we just left off where you met with Sister Priscilla [ph.] who told you she would treat you no better or no worse than any other student.  And that was 1951, so how was your, your nurse's training (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  I had three wonderful years at Saint Joseph Hospital [Presence Saint Joseph Medical Center, Joliet, Illinois] and we had students from everywhere from Ottawa [Illinois], from Cicero [Illinois], and I can remember we always were a very close class and they would take me to Cicero and I didn't realize 'til maybe years later.  They said, "Well, that's prejudice there."  I said, "That is?"  Well, I would stay at their homes in Ottawa, that's prejudice, too, and I just went and didn't know 'cause they were my friends and we were all good friends.  We were like sisters.
Speaker 1: That's really interesting, especially--yeah, because Ottawa is--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --way, way out there.  What was the religious order of Saint Joseph's?
Speaker 2: Franciscan.
Speaker 1: Franciscan.  And what did you like most about your, your nursing training?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a big hospital and, of course, I had not been in a hospital and like that it was such a variety of students.  The Ottawa connection there was Polish, and Cicero was Serbian and Italian.  So, there were cultures that I was not acquainted with and on weekends or when we got to go home, we're suppose to bring back something that was part of our culture, and I think I brought back greens one time and some sweet potato pie and my Serbian friend--I forgot what she brought, but my friend that was Polish, she brought back duck blood soup, and so we were suppose to, you know, eat whatever and I, I don't think I can do that one.  (Laughter)  Duck blood soup.  So, we just keep trying.  It was--it tastes like vinegar a little bit.  It was kind of brownish-like, but I would try it because you know she'd eat my food and I would eat hers (laughter).
Speaker 1: Sweet potato pie, duck blood soup.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yes, it was something.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And they were all Catholic and I was not Catholic, but I would go to Mass.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I did it because it was a Catholic--.  Well, but I was always kind of reverent in that sense, so it was nice to go to church.  I didn't have to really understand or anything like that, but I, I really did like it.
Speaker 1: Enjoyed it.  All right.  Were there any of the sisters there who were mentors to you who encouraged you or--?
Speaker 2: Oh, there were a lot of sisters that encouraged you.  One of them worked in surgery and she was very strict and kind of mean, I guess, but she was nice.  I'd liked her anyway, and she would always make sure that we had all our vitamins and that was one thing when you came and when I worked in surgery, oh, she would pop these vitamins and, and then she would give me something that I still use now.  Everybody says, "That's why your skin looks so young."  It was called RNA, ribonucleic acid, and it was so--it's found in fish and it stops the aging process of your skin.  So, I'd tell my friends.  I said, "That's what that nun gave me and I'm still taking it," (laughter).
Speaker 1: I better go get some.  (Laughter)  Because you look fantastic.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Oh, my goodness.  So you're, you're in school in the--in the earliest part of, of the civil rights era, but it's before the Montgomery Bus Boycotts, et cetera.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, before all of that.
Story_ID: 360277
Speaker 1: So what was life like for you outside of, of school being in Joliet [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, outside of school was--there were a lot of black families in Joliet and Elgin [Illinois] didn't have a lot.  So, I got to meet a lot of the black families there.  I never went to their churches or anything like that, but a couple of 'em worked there as secretaries at the hospital [Saint Joseph Hospital; Presence Saint Joseph Medical Center, Joliet, Illinois] or something and I got to meet, and then sometimes the girls that lived in Joliet, they would get jealous of the students, and so they would dare us to come off the hill.  So we--the hospital is situated on a huge hill with all this old stones like they make out of prison stones.  If you go to Joliet, these stones are very famous bricks or whatever.  They're not bricks, they're huge stones and so everything was made out of that, and so sometimes the girls that lived in the city did not want us coming down there talking to their boyfriends or anything.  So they dared us, so we stayed up on the hill.  'Cause by the next year, we had our second black student.
Speaker 1: Right, because you were the--you were the first.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was the first.
Speaker 1: So, you know, knowing how you could--you were probably running up against discrimination at other hospitals when once you graduated, how did you decide where you would go next?
Speaker 2: Well, I came back.  First, I did my psychiatric affiliation 'cause we had to go to different hospitals and we did ours in Fergus Falls, Minnesota.
Speaker 1: Where's that?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's the real end of the earth.  It's all--it's really far, and a lot of Swedish people, Norwegian people and, of course, the nurses.  So many classes that every class had to spend so much time.  I think I was there like five months, and I can remember going on the floor for the first time and the patients would look at me.  It was a sanitarium.  Then so they didn't--they had never seen anybody of color since the war [World War II, WWII].  And so they didn't know anything bad to say to me, so they would say, "Oh, here she comes, the dirty Jap," because a lot of those people had been in there since the '40s [1940s] and they didn't realize--they didn't know what I was.  So they know that they didn't like Japs, Japanese people, so I was called a dirty Jap the whole time I was there.  (Laughter)  It was hilarious.
Speaker 1: Oh, my goodness!  So even in their, their troubled minds--
Speaker 2: Troubled minds.
Speaker 1: --they knew how to find--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --a racist place?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So that shows you that it can be--they don't even have to know what you are (laughter).  Ooh, it's too amusing, and I had to get in the showers with these people because back in those days, you had to--you put on clothes but they didn't have clothes, and you had to get in the showers with these patients.
Speaker 1: And, and shower them?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: I never was frightened though.  I don't why.
Speaker 1: You're, you're a petite woman, so.
Speaker 2: Yes, I know.  One day this one lady, she was about six foot something and she picked me right up by the arm and she stood me up, and then she brought me up to her face and then she set me down, but she didn't harm me.  And people say, "Weren't you afraid with those people?"  I really have never been afraid.  Maybe that's the innocence of youth (laughter).
Story_ID: 360278
Speaker 1: After I graduated from [St. Joseph School of Nursing, Elgin, Illinois], I worked in Chicago [Illinois] with Skid Row, and so we had to go there where Skid Row.  They had little chamber rooms and we would go in there chasing down for TB [tuberculosis] and people said, "Weren't you afraid you'll be all by yourself?"  And I wasn't afraid of those old men, young men, whatever.
Speaker 2: Well, can you explain because people will watch this in fifty years say maybe TB won't exist, so can you explain a little bit about what tuberculosis is and that process?
Speaker 1: It affects the lungs and, of course, you can die.  It's passed on and if you're around somebody who has that--and we had to spend so much time like six weeks, six months at the TB san [Chicago Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium] here in Chicago.  On Pulaski [Road] was it?
Speaker 2: I was going to ask you where, where was it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, on Pulaski and, of course, you got shots and everything.  So, I wasn't ever afraid, but I never came up positive 'cause even if, if you've been around if they give you that little prick in the arm, you'll come up positive.  It doesn't mean you have TB, but it affects the lungs and you can die and you do a great deal of coughing.  And so the men that were--lived on Skid Row here in Chicago naturally they didn't eat right and they would get TB.  Just a great epidemic, but they never talked about it.  And so we would go around and make sure that they got their medicine.
Speaker 2: And how--?
Speaker 1: When we could catch them 'cause once you came around, they didn't want anybody cat-, knowing that they had TB, so they would move again.
Speaker 2: And then what was--what was the treatment that you had to provide?
Speaker 1: We--it was some kind of liquid they had to swallow.
Speaker 2: And how often did they have to take it?
Speaker 1: Oh, they got that every week.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, they didn't--because of their fear of, of others knowing--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --they would run away?
Speaker 1: Yes.  And they didn't like you to know too much about them either.  Families or anything like that.
Speaker 2: At all.
Story_ID: 360279
Speaker 1: You finish in 1954.  Now how do you meet the fabulous Floyd Brown?
Speaker 2: I met him in 1951 when I graduated from high school [Elgin High School, Elgin, Illinois].  I was singing at the Episcopal Church [Saint James A.M.E. Church] in Elgin [Illinois].  I was singing 'Ave Maria,' and he says that he came to Elgin, he thought this was the most hick town he has every seen.  The men don't polish their shoes and he was a spis- spiffy-like dresser 'cause he was from the city and I never paid any attention that they didn't polish their shoes, but he said they didn't.  And so he didn't know anybody in town and the people that he stayed with, the young man there said, "Well, why don't you go to this wedding?  There's nothing else going on here."  I mean, there was no taverns open, no place to go.  You either went to church or that was it.  So he went to church and that's where I met him singing 'Ave Maria.'
Speaker 1: In 1951 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) 'Ave Maria' and he said--I had on a yellow hat, a big yellow hat and I was wearing pale yellow and he said he thought I was the most beautiful angel he ever saw (laughter) and singing 'Ave Maria.'
Speaker 1: On top of it.  And why, why was this clean city boy out in Elgin?
Speaker 2: Because he worked at the radio station [WRMN Radio, Elgin, Illinois].  He had come out to work.  He was an engineer, graduated from the school in Chicago [Illinois], and he was a radio engineer and they asked him would he come to Elgin.  So he, he didn't have a job by then 'cause he'd just graduated from the Radio School of Technology [ph.] and he said as a favor he would come, but he wasn't going to stay there in Elgin.  And he knew he wasn't going to stay when saw there was nothing there 'cause every weekend, he would come back to Chicago because there were things going on.  Swinging places here which I didn't even know about.  I knew about the Club DeLisa [Chicago, Illinois].  I guess that would be about the only thing I had gone to once.
Story_ID: 360280
Speaker 1: So he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In all that time--I mean, except for treating patients, you had not even come into Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: I came with my relatives that was Bishop Roberts [Bishop William Matthew Roberts] from--I went--every summer I came in.
Speaker 2: To--from the first time--
Speaker 1: Yeah, from the time I was a little girl 'til I was grown.
Speaker 2: But did you ever go to Marshall Field's [Marshall Field and Company Building; Macy's, Chicago, Illinois] on State Street or--
Speaker 1: Oh, I went to those places.  Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  So you--I mean, you had--
Speaker 1: But if you were--my relatives were sanctified, and half my relatives never even went to a movie because you didn't do that.
Speaker 2: None of that, that worldly--
Speaker 1: That worldly thing, and they even had a cafeteria in the church [Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ, Chicago, Illinois], so.  And they never went to movies and never--but I didn't mind that because, I don't know, I liked the--I liked to see them do the--they're holy rollers and did that as shouting 'cause I never saw that.  I was a Methodist and they said we were--we didn't have any Christianity because we didn't shout and talk in tongues.  And so the other thing, they liked to make fun of me because they--when we would come--when I would stay with my [paternal] grandmother [Rachel Stephens (ph.)], there was--every place had an alley and people would have carts and they would have watermelon and ice and everything on these carts they'd sell.  "Watermelon!" and people would run up, and so I guess I spoke a little different because I would say, "Hi you guys?" and they'd say, "Oh, we gotta take her up the alley," and they said, "Speak, speak!"  And I said, "You guys!"  They'd all fall out laughing because I said, "You guys," and they said, "You all"--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and they just made fun of me.
Speaker 2: That's so cute.
Speaker 1: But the best thing is I would--this game Little Sally Saucer?
Speaker 2: Tell me about Little Sally Saucer.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Oh, that was really funny 'cause that was really--I'll never forget that because we were playing Little Sally Saucer and "Sitting in the--weeping and crying because your mother's dying," they'll tell you.  Everyone's in a circle and you're in the middle.  "Rise, Sally, rise, wipe your weeping eyes," and I said, "You turn to the east," you point, "Turn to the east, turn to the west, point to the one that you love best," and they said, "No, no, no."  They said, "You've got it all wrong.  You put your hands on your hips and let your backbone slip.  Ah shake it to the east, ah shake it to the west," (laughter).  I had never heard of that.
Speaker 2: Oh, goodness (laughter).
Speaker 1: So would take me up and down the alley.  "This is our country cousin.  Say it, say it!"  (Laughter)  So, I would have to say all these things that were just normal to me.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they were not normal to them (laughter).
Speaker 2: You're like their own little variety show.
Speaker 1: Yes, it was funny.
Speaker 2: Oh, that is so good.  Absolutely a cultural difference.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes, and we're all the same race.
Speaker 2: And the same family?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: "Put your hand on the hips and let your backbone slip."
Speaker 1: Yeah.  "Ah, shake it to the east, shake it to the west."  And I came home and I did that and my mother [Margaret Brown Stephens] said--she snatched me up.  She said, "Where did you get that?"  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I love it.
Story_ID: 360281
Speaker 1: Trying to just put it together now, but when your father [Thermon Stephens, Sr.] was the chauffeur for the Walgreens family and the Jennings family, did you ever interact with, with those families, or is it's just like--
Speaker 2: No.  No.  It was--yeah.
Speaker 1: --strictly business?
Speaker 2: Oh, you--no.  I just know that's what he did.  And even the Jennings family they lived on a big estate [in Schaumburg, Illinois] and when we first moved there, there were two houses, one brick one and one stucco, and we lived out there 'cause Mr. Jennings [Everett Jennings] would go in to Chicago [Illinois].  My dad would take him into the station and he never came back 'til late in the evening.  He and his secretary lived there also, and we lived in the other house.  I never--and they never even knew we lived on the premises 'cause my dad had rigged up something that when they were walking in the yard in the estate, he'd press a buzz and we would be very quiet.  So we lived there 'til, you know, we got our home in Elgin [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Oh, so he did--oh.  Interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they never knew or they wouldn't have wanted us to be there, children.
Speaker 1: Right, three children?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh, that is so interesting.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: See the things you learn about people (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 360282
Speaker 1: So you and Floyd Brown met in '51 [1951] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And he went off to the [U.S.] Army and I went to nurse's training, and we wrote to each other, and then we both came back to Elgin [Illinois].  He came back to work at the radio station.
Speaker 1: What was the radio station?
Speaker 2: WRMN [WRMN Radio] and it's still in Elgin.  He built the station.  And then I came back and, of course, I told you I couldn't get in nurse's training at--I mean, I couldn't go and work at Sherman Hospital [Elgin, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so I worked at Saint Joseph Hospital [Presence Saint Joseph Medical Center, Joliet, Illinois] which I was proud to do 'cause I always said I'd never forget the Franciscan nuns because they took me in, and so I worked there, and then I did private duty at Sherman, too, a lot of times.  And then Floyd he worked there and one day somebody got sick at the station and he had to go on in the man's place.  He didn't get sick, he got drunk, and back in those days I guess radio announcers drank a lot.  That's what I hear.  Anyway, he came on.  They wouldn't hire him to work there because they said no one would listen to a black announcer.  And so he filled in and from that time on--'cause he had perfect diction--and from that time on, he was working at the radio station announcing, and no one even knew he was black.
Speaker 1: A black man.
Story_ID: 360283
Speaker 1: Now how did he [Brown's husband, Floyd Brown] propose to you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, he proposed to me because every weekend he would go to Chicago [Illinois] and live it up, and so I would tell him, "Don't waste my time," and I--so he said I really put it to him.  There was a song, I can't think of the name of it.  So he said, "I can't let this one go," and so he proposed to me because he knew I wouldn't be wasting my time waiting for him.  'Cause he was kind of like--well, he was like--I was country and he was city.  He liked jazz music and all of those--and he knew all the right places in the city to go, and my life was completely different from that and I, I--but I know that I wasn't going to sit around waiting for him.
Speaker 1: You're not going sit on a hot stool waiting (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).  Not that I had anyone, but I just know (laughter)--
Speaker 1: That's perfectly okay you know, and it all worked out.  And you were married in Elgin [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --as well.
Speaker 2: We were married at the First Methodist Church [First United Methodist Church] in Elgin, although I belonged to Saint James [Saint James A.M.E. Church, Elgin, Illinois] which was an African Methodist church [African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.)], but we--it was a big wedding.  So we were married at Saint-, First Methodist which is the largest Methodist and the largest church in Elgin, and we had a big wedding there.  In fact this weekend, I'm going to be going to the man that married us, Dr. Rogers [Reverend Carleton C. Rogers], his wife's ninetieth birthday.
Speaker 1: Whoa.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  See, you stay in the same area all the time.
Speaker 1: Right.  Well, and, and you stayed in contact with everyone else.  So 1956, what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, is that the year my first child was born?
Speaker 1: Why yes, it is (laughter). How'd you do?
Speaker 2: Keith, Floyd Keith [F. Keith Brown] but he doesn't go by Floyd Keith.  His name is F. Keith.  He goes--he wanted to have an identity of his own, so he goes by F. Keith Brown.  Born in--August 5th, the hottest day in the whole year, and back then they didn't have air conditioning in the hospital.  And so--
Speaker 1: You didn't deliver at Sherman Hospital [Elgin, Illinois], did you?
Speaker 2: No, I was at Saint Joe's [Saint Joseph Hospital; Presence Saint Joseph Medical Center, Joliet, Illinois] and Floyd went in with me 'cause they said, "Well, the husbands have to stay in the room back," you weren't in the room while I was having labor.  I said, "Well, he shouldn't stay anyway" 'cause I knew he would faint, and he did.  (Laughter) Clump.  They had to stop taking care of me and take care of him (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, my goodness.
Speaker 2: I knew he wasn't going to stay too long.
Speaker 1: That wasn't his cup of tea.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Story_ID: 360284
Speaker 1: Let's talk about Keith [Brown's son, F. Keith Brown] just for a little bit at this point.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us what he does right now (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Keith is a judge now.  He's the first African American judge in the northern suburbs, and he is with the sixteenth district [16th Judicial Circuit] in Geneva, Illinois and we're very proud of him.
Speaker 1: Oh, definitely.
Speaker 2: He went to Drake [Drake University, Des Moines, Iowa].
Speaker 1: Right.  Where did he--?
Speaker 2: Drake in Des Moines, Iowa.
Speaker 1: Did he graduate from Elgin High School [Elgin, Illinois], too?
Speaker 2: No.  By that time, we had the second high--he went to Larkin High School [Elgin, Illinois], and he was president of the class and he was always running for something.  And when he got to Drake, he was running for president of the student body and he won that and he, he came up with a campaign slogan and he at least a hundred or so little brown bags and he said, "Put your vote in the brown bag."  (Laughter)  So he was head of the class--of the university student body when he was at Drake.
Speaker 1: Nice.
Speaker 2: He was always running for something.
Speaker 1: It, it paid off in the end.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And Diane [Diane Brown Douglas] was born in 1958.
Speaker 2: And she went to Drake also--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --with her big brother and she was going into the field of television and she was doing, too, very well.  And then she decided because her father [Floyd Brown] was gone a lot, she said, "I don't think I want a career in television 'cause you're never going to be home."  And so she pursued other ventures, but now she's back in school and getting her master's [degree] in human resources.  So, I don't know where she'll go from there, but she works at the college [Elgin Community College] in Elgin [Illinois]--TRiO program where she's working with students to help them get their degrees.
Story_ID: 360285
Speaker 1: So, I guess you have to take a little time off when the children [F. Keith Brown and Diane Brown Douglas] were born--but you're still working--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the whole time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I never took a complete time off.  I always did something.  It wasn't until my husband [Floyd Brown] got the job in Chicago [Illinois] at WMAQ [WMAQ Radio, Chicago, Illinois].  He start working there, then I--he was gone all the time, and I went to the hospital and I said, "Well, I can't work full time, could I work part time," and they would not let nurses work part time.  If you didn't work full time, you couldn't work.  So, I came home and I was good at fundraising.  I liked to do that, and I was very active with my kids in school.  So you get to meet a lot of people, and then I raised our kids and I did a lot of fundraising.  Belonged to a lot of organizations.  That's where you meet everybody.
Speaker 1: Right.  Like now what were some of those, those organizations you belonged to (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, one of them was Junior Service Board [Elgin Junior Service Board, Elgin, Illinois] which is like Junior League, and I was their first black member.  I don't think they have any yet.
Speaker 1: Still, still don't?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I suggested the name and then she was on and she moved out of town, so they haven't got it anymore (laughter).  And then I belonged to PTA [Parent Teacher Association] and I belonged a group of singers, Unisingers we were called, and we sang from school to school, and then I became president of the PTA and I, I would go to thirty--we had thirty-seven schools then and I had to visit all those schools.
Speaker 1: Oh.  And like what were some of things that you did (unclear)?
Speaker 2: It was keeping a rapport with the schools and the boards of the various schools and making sure that their voice was heard, and I was like the ambassador.  Every year I would go to all those--several times a year I'd go to those schools.
Speaker 1: And establish that rapport?
Speaker 2: Right.  Yes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So--
Story_ID: 360286
Speaker 1: So now you've kind of morphed into--so you're not working in nursing at all at this time?
Speaker 2: I'm doing some private duty.
Speaker 1: Private duty still?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Someone hires you specifically?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  A patient would hire me and that's the only person I would take care of.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, how'd you like doing that?
Speaker 2: I liked it.  I, I was very good at one-on-one and all of the patients--all the doctors liked me because I was, they said, a good nurse and I, I really believe I was.  I liked what I did.  They don't do bedside nursing like that anymore where you would wash the people's feet in a basin.  You'd wash everything and they don't do that.  Yeah, but I liked that.  That was the one-on-one and I would have people lined up if they were sick would want me for their private duty nurse, and the doctors would recommend me all the time, too.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're right.  I, I don't think they do that anymore.
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  Because you did one leg at a time and one foot at a time.  You did all of that.
Speaker 1: Wow!  So--
Speaker 2: That was really bedside nursing, too.  Plus you gave shots, but you gave personal care to every patient.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Maybe they can't get through anymore, so they stopped.
Speaker 1: So, now how did--between 1960 and 1970, what are some of the things that you're, you're doing?
Speaker 2: I'm doing a lot of fundraising for schools, for PTA [Parent Teacher Association] or whatever there would be.
Speaker 1: So, now how it's--we'll kind of wrap up for, for this tape, but the civil rights era is definitely in full swing at this time, and what impact is it having on you as you're one of a smaller number of black families out in the northwest suburbs [of Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] would come to the area and more or less I think my husband [Floyd Brown] was probably more involved than I was.  I was really geared to the homemaking, the homemaker and working, and so I never--I knew it was going on, but then we'd formed a group of women in Elgin [Illinois] and from every nationality and be trying to get a rapport so the white people would understand different ethnic groups.  We had a Jew, we had a Spanish, and we were called United Nations--American United [ph.]--I can't think of the exact name, but we would get invited to different neighborhoods or different cities, and we would discuss race relation.
Story_ID: 360287
Speaker 1: Now, before we left off on the last tape, you were talking about your women's group called (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --the UN [United Nations (ph.)], but you also had another name [American United (ph.)] for it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We had every nationality represented and we would go from town to town speaking about prejudice, and people could ask us any question.  I called it Rent-a-Negro. 'Cause some of the questions they said, "Well, what do you say to Negroes," and they're talking to me.  And, and it was like, you know, there were all these small towns that don't have any ethnic people.  It, it really is different and some of the questions were rather silly, but the--it made sense.  If you've never seen a person or then you wouldn't know.
Speaker 1: What, like your experiences in Minnesota?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Where--well, at least they weren't calling you, you know, dirty Jap.
Speaker 2: No.  They--well, they called me dirty Jap.  They just didn't know what else to call me.  They didn't know what I was.  That's the last time they had seen someone of color.  So it was the war [World War II, WWII].
Speaker 1: Dirty Jap.  I've really figured out--so (laughter).  Now all during this time--as you said your, your husband [Floyd Brown] probably had a little more pragmatic experience in the civil rights.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's--yes, he was more involved in that.  And then of course, then when he came into Chicago [Illinois] to work, you know, he, he was like maybe the first to work here, the first to work there.  He was always being the first because they didn't hire too many blacks then.
Story_ID: 360288
Speaker 1: Now, he [Brown's husband, Floyd Brown] was at WMAQ [WMAQ Radio, Chicago, Illinois] then when did he--?
Speaker 2: W--
Speaker 1: --join WGN [WGN Radio, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Oh, thirty-two years ago.  He just retired.  Thirty-three years ago (laughter).  He just retired from there.  He worked there for thirty-three years.
Speaker 1: That's amazing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And he had all kinds of jobs.  He was sports and he used to do the high school basketball games, and then he did blues show, jazz show, everything.  And he worked--at the end, he worked all kinds of crazy hours that he was glad to retire 'cause driving into the city was just tremendous.
Speaker 1: From Elgin [Illinois].
Speaker 2: And then he was on the board for the Sunday Evening Club [Chicago Sunday Evening Club].  So every Sunday for maybe twelve years, he would do the Sunday Evening Club--
Speaker 1: And what was the Sunday Evening Club (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) on Channel 11 [WTTW-TV, Chicago, Illinois].  '30 Good Minutes' on Channel 11.  He was the announcer on there.
Speaker 1: As well.  So, now during the '70s [1970s] I've--let's see if I have this right.  You said you were a pre-natal duty nurse?  Or maybe I couldn't read your handwriting (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Private duty.
Speaker 1: Private duty.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Well pre-natal, too.  I was supervisor when I first graduated, the head of the OB [obstetrics] department--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --until I had my children [F. Keith Brown and Diane Brown Douglas] and I could not stand to hear another lady say her water was broke or intact.  (Laughter)  I didn't want--I thought, I can't hear this anymore.  So they said, "Well, why don't we transfer you to pediatrics," and then I really got very upset after I start having my children and I would see abused children and it--of course, that was not something you knew about back then.  And I would become very attached to different kids and one child, her name was April [ph.], and I told my husband, "We're gonna adopt this child because she was always being abused."  She would come in, maybe her mother said she fell out of the bed.  One time she--the water--she reached up on the stove and got the tea kettle and burned herself.  And she was the most precious child.  And then one night when I was working private duty and it was at night--no, I was on the emergency room call--and they, they--you'd have to press a button to get into the emergency room, and I heard this gasping of breath and they brought this baby in and that's when I said, "We're gonna adopt this child."  I didn't even ask the mother.  That's how silly I was.  And she passed away and then I didn't--could not work in pediatrics anymore.  But back then there were no laws and when I think about it, there are a lot of abused babies.
Speaker 1: That, that, that you saw when you were working?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah.  But it was something you couldn't prove and you wouldn't dare go to law and say that such and such happened.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: So, we've come a long way in the health field in that sense.
Story_ID: 360289
Speaker 1: In the mid-'70s [1970s], your kids [F. Keith Brown and Diane Brown Douglas] are getting ready to head off to Drake [Drake University, Des Moines, Iowa]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, what's life like when you have the sort of empty nest?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved it.  I've never been one to, you know, brood and think of what are you gonna do and I don't think I can live without my kids being home.  I just thought it was wonderful that they moved on.  I feel like that all the time, with grandchildren or whatever.  I guess my life was full that I didn't have to live through anybody and part of that is that.  You don't have anything else to do.  You can't cook, you can't clean, and I don't miss any of that (laughter).  Maybe that's bad to say, but I didn't.
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's not--it's not--it's not bad.  I suppose that you know, there's a, a season--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: --for, for everything (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) "Thou givest them their due in good season," my mother [Margaret Brown Stephens] would say.
Speaker 1: Oh, I like that one.
Speaker 2: That's if something didn't happen just right.  During my lifetime, I was asked to be on a board of directors of a bank and it was back in the '70s [1970s] or '80s [1980s] where they didn't put women on the board.  There's not too many women on boards now and I realize why.  You get paid, and so they didn't--
Speaker 1: Right (laughter).
Speaker 2: --put women on those boards.  (Laughter)  And I was asked to be on the board of directors of a bank in Elgin [Illinois] and--
Speaker 1: And you accepted that?
Speaker 2: Well, no because my husband [Floyd Brown] had an advertising agency and I worked with him and we advertised for another bank, and I felt it was--would be a conflict of interest and I went to the people that we were working for and I told him that they were--asked me to be on the board of directors.  He almost flipped.  He couldn't believe they asked me.  And he called them all kinds of names.  Little did I know, after I refused, he sold the bank that we worked for.  I'll never forget that.  And I was very upset and I called my mother up and I said, "Can you believe that?  Why didn't he tell me?"  And my mother said, "Well, it wasn't for you."  She always said it wasn't for you if you didn't get it.  She said, "You don't read your Bible because it says in the Bible 'and thou givest them their fruit in good season' and it's not your season."
Speaker 1: That's great advice.  So now, how far did you live from your parents in Elgin [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: My parents lived in Elgin until they moved to California, so it was like maybe a couple blocks.  They were always there, my mother and father [Thermon Stephens, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you're, you're fundraising, you're an active member on, on a variety of boards.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And--now when did you start your, your own firm 'cause I know you said Mr. Brown had it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Well, yeah.  Well I, I worked with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I would take pictures and then we had a magazine called La Petite:  Dressing Up and Dining Out [ph.]. And we had fifteen thousand readers, and I would sell advertising and I would take pictures, and so we had two whole centerfolds of pictures and that's what I did.
Story_ID: 360290
Speaker 1: And I just loved--I loved people and in the meanwhile, I got involved with the Miss America pageant and that was in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Right.  I was going to ask you about Fashion Group International and, and you--
Speaker 1: The pageant.
Speaker 2: --coming involved with Miss, Miss Illinois preparing to go to Miss America.
Speaker 1: Yes, and--
Speaker 2: Can you tell us something about how that happened (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  I, I was the wardrober and I did the, the resumes and help them inquiry--like you're doing now--interviews, and I would tell the girls what to read.  Like Barron's and listen to the radio and get the news and in 1984, we had a Miss--the first Miss black, black Miss America [sic. Miss Illinois], Ruth Booker from Chicago [Illinois], here.  And I was her wardrober and her companion because you always had a companion.  And in 1984, I was in Newsweek magazine as a mentor of the year.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: My picture with Ruth Booker.
Speaker 2: Because she went--oh, so 1984 that was--was that when Vanessa Williams won?
Speaker 1: Yes, I was there when Vanessa Williams won.  That was the year she won.  Oh, she was beautiful.
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, how--what was--?
Speaker 1: She stayed in the same hotel.
Speaker 2: What was that experience like?
Speaker 1: Oh, that whole life of Miss America pageant was like a dream world and I can see why many of those girls get lost in the--they have the superior feeling, you know, 'cause here I am, and I can remember many of them would say, "Well my IQ is a hundred and eighty or something," and I would say, "Well, when you walk through that door, there's no sign that says 'Bleep, bleep.  Hundred eighty.'"  So, you have to get in the room first and that's part of your personality to get in that room.  And I will say that Ruth Booker from Chicago--she was a beautiful, beautiful young woman.  I think she still models some now, and she would not--she was just gorgeous, but something happened and she didn't make it and Vanessa won and she was--she stayed in the same hotel and I can remember looking at her and saying, she is the most gorgeous young lady, and she was so poised and well-spoken also.  Beautiful, beautiful woman.
Speaker 2: What was--what was the feeling after she won?
Speaker 1: Oh, they were just thrilled and thrilled.  They were just--finally we had somebody black that would--was won.  She was talented that most of all, she was--she couldn't help that she was beautiful, but she was very talented, and she had a beautiful figure and she looked good in everything including the swimsuit.  And so that was really, really something and after she left, I--I'm trying to think of the young woman--.
Speaker 2: Suzette Charles--
Speaker 1: Yes, and, and--
Speaker 2: --who took over for her?
Speaker 1: --I still went to Atlantic City [New Jersey] after the time and people would think I was Suzette Charles or her mother 'cause I had long hair then and they would stop me.  They'd give me everything free and my friends said, "I'm going with Betty [HistoryMaker Mary "Betty" Brown] because she gets free everything," (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  So that's nice.
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: That was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's good--
Story_ID: 360291
Speaker 1: --But I would be the wardrober and meanwhile while I wardrobed the Miss Illinois pageant, I got to meet all the designers in, in Ill--Chicago [Illinois], the top ten designers.  Of course, they all want to--just like with being the president's wife, everybody wants to wardrobe somebody who's famous and say, "That's my dress."  And so she had quite a wardrobe and all the Miss America contestants from Illinois had fabulous clothes and wardrobes, and they had cars that--they didn't give them to them, but they had free use of that--those cars, and cleaning bills--everything.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  So I got to meet all the designers and so I figured if they're designing from them, they ought to design for me (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  That's right.
Speaker 1: And when I went to Atlantic City [New Jersey], they all laughed.  They'd say, "Boy, you look as good as the Miss America ladies" (laughter).
Speaker 2: Like, "Of course.  Why shouldn't I."
Speaker 1: It, it, it was a good lesson and it, it, it exposed me to a whole different group of people and fashion, but I will say that I had an aunt--and she's still living--she's ninety-six years old and she lives in Harlem [New York, New York] and she's lived there all her life.  And of course, I have to tell you about Harlem afterwards, and she worked for Mollie Parnis who wardrobed all the presidents' wives.  And so I had these gorgeous clothes because if somebody didn't like them, they just threw it away.  That's how extravagant the whole field--it's like food, they throw it away.  Our country throws away things.  And so my aunt would send me these beautiful clothes and little did I realize and one day I'm looking in the back of one of my dresses and I--and I was reading a magazine.  I said to my husband, "Mollie Parnis?"  I said, "That's what I wear," and Floyd [Floyd Brown] says, "Oh, you don't wear Mollie Parnis."  (Laughter) And there it was, and the lady that wore the same size as me was Mrs. Lyndon Baines Johnson.
Speaker 2: Oh, Lady Bird [Lady Bird Johnson].
Speaker 1: Lady Bird, and so he [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] didn't like anything 'cause he would come there and help pick her clothes and he would reject everything, so everything he rejected, my aunt would pick it up and she'd send it to me.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  That is too funny.
Speaker 1: So when I was a young woman, I had these five thousand dollar gowns and things.  I didn't have that kind of money, but I had those gowns.  In fact, they used to say that, "No wonder poor Floyd works so hard, his wife is in those thousand dollar gowns," (laughter).
Speaker 2: She's running him ragged (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And then I really became very friendly with a lot of the designers here in the city and they were very nice to me.  Lots of times they would just like to--I paid for them, but maybe not the cost that most people would but they would--if I was going to something, they would make sure I had on their gown.
Speaker 2: Like who, who were some of those designers?
Speaker 1: Oh, the one that's--Yolanda [Yolanda Lorente] who is--has a showroom in the Bloomingdale Building [Chicago, Illinois] on the fifth floor.  She designs most of my things now.
Speaker 2: Really?  Now who designed this outfit that you're wearing today?
Speaker 1: Oh, this was just off the rack.  I have a sense of style and color though.  I just know clothes because if you're around them, it doesn't have to be expensive.  I keep telling people that.  You just have to look a lot (laughter).
Speaker 2: This is very true.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Story_ID: 360292
Speaker 1: I guess we didn't get to how you were asked to be the wardrober for Miss Illinois (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I was very involved in a lot of things and I used to teach classes on makeup and classes on manners.  And one of my classes was called mind your manners, or maybe your mother was right.  (Laughter)  That was the most popular class.  I would do--mostly it started by--I met a lot of lawyers.  Not that there were lawyers in my family or anything at the time, but the lawyers' wives would call me and I worked in Aurora [Illinois].  I would do lawyers' and doctors' kids.  I would do manners classes.
Speaker 1: They needed the help.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, all kids do and now the boys don't even own suits.  And you'd be surprised that boys always want to know what to do.  They may not say that.  Like they, they, they know that they don't just have to take a girl to McDonald's, but young--one young man asked me, "Well, how do you pick out a restaurant and the young lady doesn't gouge you?  You know, get the most expensive."  I said, "Well, you go ahead of time and you get the menu, and you know what you can afford and so when you get there you say, 'May I suggest--?'  She's not going to say no, and then you know what's in your pocketbook."  (Laughter)  You know what you can afford.  And so I taught matters--manner at the college.  I taught it at Harper [Harper College, Palatine, Illinois].  I taught manners at Elgin Community College [Elgin, Illinois].  I had big classes.
Speaker 1: That's really interesting.  Now what years were that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was in the '90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: Really?  See, I'm thinking that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  I didn't even put that down, I don't think.
Speaker 1: No, no.  That's why I was thinking it must have been in the '70s [1970s] because people don't care about manners now.
Speaker 2: Well, some still do.  They ask me now would I still teach manners.
Speaker 1: Well would you?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I would.  And sometimes it--you don't think it's important now, but later on and as our, out world becomes smaller, we know when we go to different countries that a lot of those countries resent what we wear.  Like they don't want us wearing white some places.  It's abusive to them and, and there's, there's--if you get to be--suppose you became an ambassador some place.  You'd have to learn their customs and I think that's where we failed and we never--we go into countries and we think we're Miss USA, and, and we haven't picked up any of their customs, and those are important things.
Speaker 1: Most definitely.
Story_ID: 360293
Speaker 1: So, now how were you chosen to be one of the One Hundred Women of Destiny?  And repre--and you represented Marilyn Miglin.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, she--I guess she had read about me and I was very active in lots of organizations, and I told you I'd joined a fashion group and then she--and she always admired my skin and as you know, she has a--she has her own place here, but she has a chemistry lab there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Because she does--and she would always admire my skin.  And she says what do you (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  It's RNA [ribonucleic acid] (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Well, I tell everybody that.  Floyd [Floyd Brown] said I could be making money off RNA. And so she, she did a background chec- a test--a check on me and of all the women, I was the only one from the suburbs.  I felt very honored because most of the women were well-known women from Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: So now what did it entail for you to be a Woman of Destiny?
Speaker 2: Well it was just a, a--things that you were involved in doing.  A fash- a sense of fashion.  Volunteer work.  It was a lot of things.  I wish I had one of the books here.  I should call Marilyn and ask her.  I see here now, so she's written so many--she's written her own book.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  She has her--like her own thing on QVC and--.
Speaker 2: Yes, and the Wes Farragma or that perfume.
Speaker 1: Pheromone.
Speaker 2: Pheromone.
Speaker 1: And she has her, her store on Oak Street [Chicago, Illinois] so.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, now this is quite prestigious.  What year was, was that that you were a Woman of Destiny?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think it was in the '80s [1980s] also or maybe at the latter part of the '80s [1980s].
Story_ID: 360294
Speaker 1: And one thing I, I thought was interesting in, in reading and researching about you is that you were--I think you were a, a licensing investigator for the department of, of nursing [Illinois Department of Public Health]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now that is totally different than anything that you've done.  What, what led you to accept that appointment?
Speaker 2: I think I got that appointment because I was involved in PTA [Parent Teacher Association] and I was a registered nurse, and I guess they just picked my name and I would go to Springfield [Illinois] and we would go through--now that I look back, I think that was a really important time because they were licensing nursing homes and now that I look back, I see who was buying those nursing homes.
Speaker 1: Who was buying the nursing homes?
Speaker 2: People who were superintendents of hospitals.
Speaker 1: Ah (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Always retiring very early and with a lot of money.  I didn't realize it then.  Sometimes you're in a place and maybe you weren't prepared or didn't know all the details, but we did have to license those homes and restrictions are even worse now.  I mean, you really have to be up on licensing and, of course, to have a registered nurse that would--you know, pick up some of these things that they weren't doing.
Speaker 1: Right.  So did that entail you traveling around the state or in any particular reason?
Speaker 2: No, we would just--they--I would just travel to Springfield [Illinois] and that's where we met every month.  And so many of, of the hosp- of the nursing homes would have to send in their credentials and we would go over those.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, so you didn't have to go to the hospitals and investigate.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But now they're doing that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Restaurants and--nursing homes.
Story_ID: 360295
Speaker 1: I mean, I find your career so fascinating because it has spanned so many different things.  So in, in the--in the '80s [1980s] and '90s [1990s], you're at--why don't I turn this sideways--you're freelancing for Northshore magazine.
Speaker 2: Magazine.
Speaker 1: How did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, they didn't have any connection in the suburbs, so it was always Chicago [Illinois] that's written up in the Northshore magazine.
Speaker 1: Which is not very North Shore (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  And, and--but most of it is Chicago, and somebody turned my name in and said, "Well, Barrington [Illinois] and Elgin [Illinois], why don't you cover them?"  So they did a special issue on Fox Valley [Illinois] which I live in Elgin which is part of the Fox Valley which is Aurora [Illinois], Batavia [Illinois], St. Charles [Illinois], Geneva [Illinois] and Elgin, and those towns all sit on the Fox River. That's where the name came from.  So they, they saw that I was very social and they asked me to write for them.  And that's what I did.  I wrote about events that I went to in Elgin.
Speaker 1: And, and how, how long did you--?
Speaker 2: I worked for them for about three years.
Speaker 1: And then when did you become a society columnist (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  And then after a while they said, "Well Elgin really wasn't enough society for them."  (Laughter)  And so, it's--you know, they don't perceive little towns as real society.  Maybe Glencoe [Illinois], Winnetka [Illinois], Kenilworth [Illinois], they--
Speaker 1: Barrington.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Barrington, yes.  But they didn't even include Barrington anymore.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Well they include Duchossois [Richard L. Duchossois] 'cause he lives in Barrington.  It depends on names.
Speaker 1: Ah, okay.
Speaker 2: And so The Courier News--I'm from Elgin all my life.  They said, "Well, we don't know anyone that knows as many people and has been involved in so many different avenues as you," and they asked me to be their society writer.
Speaker 1: And what's your column called?
Speaker 2: It's called Steppin' Out with Betty Brown. And my picture--I should have brought it.  My picture's in there--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --with me holding my arm at about like that.  And I go cover events.  I cover the symphony [Elgin Symphony Orchestra].  Tonight when I go home, I'll cover the Boys & Girls Club [Boys & Girls Club of Elgin, Elgin, Illinois], and this week I covered PADS [Public Action to Deliver Shelter of Elgin, Inc., Elgin, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And what's PADS?
Speaker 2: PADS is homelessness.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: The home- and they had a, a harvest festival for the homeless.
Speaker 1: So now what is it that you like about covering the society events?
Speaker 2: I love the people.  I really--I, I couldn't exist without people.  I just--I can just touch every person.  I, I, I see this--maybe it's this need in me.  And I know them though.  I don't--you know, I can come in Chicago and if I go downtown or somewhere, I know just as many people here because I go to a lot of the events.  I go to the Red Hot Chicago [ph.] when they have that and now coming up, Bunky Cushing gives this sweetheart Valentine's Tea for all the ladies.  He invites eighty ladies, and we--and he's the only man.  And he serves high, high tea and we all come to that.
Speaker 1: That's so fantastic (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And you hope you get invited.
Story_ID: 360296
Speaker 1: And then I'm a member of the Fashion Group [Fashion Group International].
Speaker 2: Yes, can you tell us a little bit about the, the Fashion Group?
Speaker 1: The Fashion Group is, is for young designers that are just designing.  It's a non-profit and you see so many young designers that start off and sometimes it's heart-shattering because you see they're so good, but they all can't make it, and it's a very difficult field.  And they try to help these young designers and there's--you have a College of the Academy [sic. The Illinois Institute of Art - Chicago] at the Apparel Center [Chicago Apparel Center, Chicago, Illinois].  Then you have Harper College [Palatine, Illinois] has a school and there's, there's another school here, maybe--.
Speaker 2: Illinois Institute of Design [IIT Institute of Design, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Design, yeah.  I think so.
Speaker 2: Okay.  'Cause I see those commercials (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  I think Columbia [Columbia College Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] has colleges, too, and so that's what they try to do.  They give a big fashion show every year and they pick an outstanding stu- student.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And they can win a scholarship to Europe, to New York [New York] and I, I just think that's wonderful 'cause I used to like to sew, but who'd ever think that you'd be--I mean, you just sew.  You don't think about you're going to be anybody.
Speaker 2: Not making for other people besides--
Speaker 1: No and there's some wonderful designers here in Chicago [Illinois].  Very, very good.
Speaker 2: Even if it's off the rack (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, sometimes you see some of those like they--well after they've done their line they call it, sometimes somebody goes in there and before they can even show it, they've stole--
Speaker 2: Oh, the, the, the--
Speaker 1: --the design.
Speaker 2: --design.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That happens so often.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Well it's just like they say, "Well, you saw the dress that--from the, the Academy Awards [Oscars]?"  They've already copied that within the week.  They said, "You can buy it for dol- a hundred and sixty dollars or fifty dollars.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  That's true.  That's right.
Speaker 1: It's not the same quality, but it's that dress.
Speaker 2: Right.  I mean there's a difference between ten thousand [dollars] versus one fifty [dollars] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Yes.  And that's what happens many times.  But that's a wonderful organization and Marsha Brenner is their director, and Dorothy Fuller is the president of that.  And so I belong to that because they do a lot of good to help.  I came in, in December and they did the little black dress at The Peninsula [The Peninsula Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], and they had designers design their dresses, and maybe they had twenty designers and they put their dresses on a mannequin on a pedestal and you go around and you bid on them.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  To help to raise the funds, but also--
Speaker 1: Yes, to help students.
Story_ID: 360297
Speaker 1: Another thing I, I find so fascinating about you is that you have stayed out in, in the suburbs and--I mean, conventional thought might be that one would move into the city.  There are--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --more black people and more things happening.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So why have you chosen to stay?
Speaker 2: Well, I chose--the one reason my husband [Floyd Brown] wanted to stay.  If I had--I would still stay, but I would like to have an apartment in Chicago [Illinois].  I really would, especially in the summertime because there's so many things going on, and that's one thing if I ever win the lottery, which I don't even play, but that's what I would do.  I would--I would have a--just a small apartment here.  And I chose to stay there because of him and then when we were raising our kids [F. Keith Brown and Diane Brown Douglas], I didn't want them to become celebrity kids or anything of that sort and they never have.  They're just, you know, people and if they choose to do whatever--their volunteer work or something, it's just helping and you're not anybody special for doing it.
Story_ID: 360298
Speaker 1: So, we're just saying in, in the previous tape, or I asked you about why you've chosen to stay in, in Elgin [Illinois] and you were speaking about how it keeps you grounded, but what was that great saying that you have?
Speaker 2: Well, I say and too, you know I can be in Elgin although I go down the street, I know lots of people because I lived there all my life, but I always quote the saying that, "Omar is never a prophet in his own tent."  So you know, and he could be elevated so high that you think you're somebody very special.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  I love that one.
Speaker 2: I was a nurse there.  I sing at churches there.  They ask me to sing.
Speaker 1: So the--
Speaker 2: So, I'm just Betty Brown [HistoryMaker Mary "Betty" Brown].
Speaker 1: You're not--not Floyd Brown's wife?  Not Keith Brown's [F. Keith Brown] mom?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, I used to be Floyd Brown's wife and Keith Brown's mother, and I think what happened I start doing things in the city and I never told them that I was Floyd Brown's wife.  I never told anyone.  And one day we were at some event and Floyd was with me and a lady from the Tribune [Chicago Tribune], came up to me and she said, "Hi, Betty!"  I said, "Well, you know Floyd, don't you?"  And she said, "Yes, I know Floyd."  I said, "Well, you know he's my husband."  She said, "Floyd's your husband?  You never told me that."  What was I going to do, come in and say Floyd Brown is my husband?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you've always been very independent.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and him being my husband is not going to help me to be just me.
Speaker 1: Well now who, who taught you to be so independent, or is that something that--?
Speaker 2: Well, I think my dad [Thermon Stephens, Sr.] was like that.  My dad  was kind of arrogant (laughter) and he was always like that and it wasn't education or anything, but he always felt well about himself and he passed that along.  And just like the first disc jockey in Chicago [Illinois] is Jack L. Cooper.  Well, he was married to my cousin, so I used to see all these celebrity people, but I didn't know they were celebrities.  They were just people, so you didn't get that feeling that you were anybody better 'cause they always worked and I always work.  I don't want to just sit home.
Story_ID: 360299
Speaker 1: In the era when you were raising your children [F. Keith Brown and Diane Brown Douglas], women still weren't necessarily in, in the workplace.
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Margaret Brown Stephens] was always working, I will say that.  She worked, you know, for the private family and then she worked in a laundry 'cause sometimes in the summertime she would take me down the laundry with her and I remember how you back fold sheets 'cause they had mangles back then, and I know how to fold those sheets.  Boy, can I fold--and I can iron.  My mom used to take in ironing.  I see why they had a home and it was nice 'cause they all worked a lot, and my mother would do lawyers' shirts.  Maybe every week we'd have fifteen shirts, and I knew what you did.  You would just get this big pan of Argo Starch [Argo Gloss Laundry Starch] and you cook that up and you would take the shirts and you would dip the neck and you would dip the front of it and the cuffs in the starch, and that's where they--well, how I would--oh, I can star-, I can iron.  I really can iron like a professional.
Speaker 1: I tried to starch something once and I had terrible burns, so 'cause I jumped up on my skin.  It was like, I'm never doing this again.
Speaker 2: Well, that's the way they used to do.
Speaker 1: Wow, 'cause I--
Speaker 2: Now you got spray starch.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because that, that old fashioned kind.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I, I must have boiled it too hot (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I still got some on the shelf.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Argo.  Argo Starch in a blue box (laughter).
Speaker 1: That is too funny.  Now--I mean so right now if I popped out a box, you could whip it up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I could whip it up.  Yes.
Speaker 1: That is so funny--
Story_ID: 360300
Speaker 1: I mean you have all of these really interesting elements that, you know, have passed down from your family.  What are some of the things that you think that you've passed down to, to your children and to your grandchildren?
Speaker 2: Well, I've passed down the music ability.  Both my children studied piano and I was very disappointed as we do with our kids that our daughter [Diane Brown Douglas] quit in her senior year and she came home and didn't want to take piano lessons anymore and I said, "Why?"  She said, "Because I'm gonna be a cheerleader."  I said, "You're going to be a cheerleader?"  I could not believe that she wanted to be a cheerleader, but then I realized you know, you can't just ruled their lives all the time.  She's always done everything, I will say that.  She'd go to Sunday school, she went to this, she did that, and there comes a time that you have to let go and it was the glory of being a cheer- when you're a cheerleader, I--everybody loves you, and--
Speaker 1: You have all the games.
Speaker 2: Yes, all the games and the piano, it just goes astray and she came by yesterday and she said, "Guess what?  I sat down and I start playing the piano again."  I really wanted--almost cried.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: She had the piano and the violin, and that was part of my heritage the music part.  I didn't care about any athletes, I didn't even know who they are, and I don't even know half of 'em now.  That was not something that was--music and the background and music was the most important thing.  If you had that, that was your culture.  Not sports, and so people--I had athletes ask me for a date.  I would never go out with an athlete.  Oh, no.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  You look down on them.
Speaker 2: Well it was terrible, but it was just that that was not in my, my circle.  And so my son [F. Keith Brown] played the base and the piano, and he played for a band from our church and he played when he was fourteen.  He was making seven dollars an hour.
Speaker 1: Well that's pretty good (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He would just play in the park, and he played the bass and now he's going back to the piano and the base, but they both had that.  And I took my dau-, I was so upset over our daughter quitting.  I took her violin and I mounted in a big frame over the piano.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Just, just so she could see every time she walked by.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh, you're too funny.
Speaker 2: And I'm thinking, now I guess I'm not going to have any musicians.
Story_ID: 360301
Speaker 1: Now Keith [Brown's son, F. Keith Brown] may not be a musician, but as you're saying he is, is a judge.  How--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but the other thing is like this year during Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]--Black History Month is this month coming up and it was this month, too, we had a lot of activities in Elgin [Illinois].  We had the black--the Martin Luther King breakfast and we're going to a soul something at the library, and he at the courthouse decided he wanted to do something and he said he wanted to do a like a celebration.  So he came to me and he said, "Well mom, what's your recipe for cornbread?"  So I gave that to him.  He said, "Well, that looks a little too hard."  I said, "Well, you can make my pound cake."  And so a pound of butter, a pound of powdered sugar and six eggs and flour and he made it.  It was fabulous.  So, he served all the judges in Geneva [Illinois] for lunch.  He hired some ladies from Aurora [Illinois].  They come up and they brought greens and cornbread and black-eyed peas.  He said, "They were eating greens, mom," and they ate his, his pound cake.  They couldn't believe, but he's always cooking.  He likes to cook because that's what I used to like to do.
Speaker 1: You liked to and your mom [Margaret Brown Stephens] liked to cook, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and he can fix--he fixes a turkey all the time.
Story_ID: 360302
Speaker 1: So now how many grandchildren do you have?
Speaker 2: I have four.  I have three girls and a boy.  Marcus [ph.] is the oldest and he graduated from school--high school this past year and he's working at Kohl's in between and he goes to Elgin Community College [Elgin, Illinois].  And Jordan [ph.], she's sixteen and she goes to Stevenson High School [Adlai E. Stevenson High School, Lincolnshire, Illinois], that's a high school in Buffalo Grove [sic.] which is one of the top twenty-five high schools in the country, and she's a good student there, but you have to be or they don't keep you around.  And then I have Nicole [ph.] who is my model.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She likes to perform.  She's always in a play.  She was in 'Aida' last year, and she models for Marshall Field's and Carson's, and she's a beautiful girl.  She is my color and has blue eyes 'cause in her, her, grandfather on her mother's side, there's blue eyes, and she came up though people look at her, "What is she doing?  This little brown girl with blue eyes."
Speaker 1: Hey, it can happen.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and her brother has brown eyes.  So you never know.  I tell people that all the time.  I say we never know.  It's like opening a jack-in-the-box.  You never know what color you're going to be in the family, what kind of hair, what kind of eye color because it, it--that's just it.  It can go back into--
Speaker 1: It can--it can be anything.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Just glad to have ten fingers and ten toes--
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: --and, and one good brain.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but she likes to model and she's modeled a lot.  And then Taylor [ph.], I haven't figured Taylor out.  She's the pleaser.  If she met you, she would always have something complimentary to say.  "I like your blouse.  I like this.  What did you do today?"  She's always asking a lot.  She carries on the conversation where the rest of them wouldn't ever do--just go up to people and carry on a conversation.  She's a conversationalist.
Speaker 1: That sounds like a nice--and, and your children both live in--?
Speaker 2: She lives--Diane [Diane Brown Douglas], my daughter, lives in Buffalo Grove [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Our son [F. Keith Brown] lives in Elgin [Illinois].  He's like I've lived in Elgin all my life.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  So they--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they went far (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, you know, it's--I think that's another thing I really find so interesting is like you guys have established a, a beachhead and you're, you're not moving an inch--you're--the Browns, Elgin, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes, and everybody knows us.
Speaker 1: --go hand in hand.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Story_ID: 360303
Speaker 1: In looking back on your life, what are some of the things that you feel most proud about?  How, how do you want to be remembered by others (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I wanted--I want to be remembered as a caring person, and I think that shows in all my volunteer work I've done.  So many years of volunteer work and, like I said, I was chosen outstanding woman of the year and I have lots of awards for that, but it's all people.  It's just--I, I love people.  I like to be around.  I don't care if they're rich, poor, black, white, whatever--homeless or I'd get down on my feet or knees, wash their feet.  It doesn't matter, and I think that feeling of love for people is my most wonderful accomplishment.
Story_ID: 360304
Speaker 1: And in a kind of slightly different, but on the same note, what, what is the legacy that you think you will leave for, for others to follow?
Speaker 2: That I was always a caring person.  People stop me now and say, "I remember you were my nurse," or "You helped delivered me."  I said, "Don't tell 'em.  That gives my age away."  But they remember that about me.
Speaker 1: That's a pretty good memory they remember someone delivered you (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes.  They remember.
Story_ID: 360305
Speaker 1: Elgin [Illinois] people kind of know everybody.  I don't know what that is.  My daughter [Diane Brown Douglas] used to say, "I like coming home from college and you go to the store and they say, 'Oh, you're home.'
Speaker 2: (Laughter) 'Where have you been?'
Speaker 1: 'Here's Floyd's [Floyd Brown] daughter.  Diane or Betty Brown's [HistoryMaker Mary "Betty" Brown] daughter or son [F. Keith Brown],'" 'cause everybody knows you.  I don't know, it's still has that maybe kind of southern or the simplicity of a small town, but it's grown.  It's about 90,000 now.
Speaker 2: Right, but everyone knows the Brown family.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And I belong to the symphony there and I go.  I've, I've been a member of our Elgin Symphony [Elgin Symphony Orchestra] which is over fifty years old, and I've been a member every since it started and I go all the time.  I never miss, and this is my signet pin for the symphony and I used to be very active, but now I just pay my dues, but I go to all the concerts.
Story_ID: 360306
Speaker 1: Now you're, you're in your seventh decade, and you're still going strong, looking fabulous.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Where, where do you see yourself in the next ten, twenty years?
Speaker 2: I really don't know.  I hope I can--my husband [Floyd Brown] would like for me to retire.  Well, I cannot do that.  He's been really interesting lately, like we just celebrated our fiftieth anniversary in October.
Speaker 1: Congratulations.
Speaker 2: Thank you.  And he said, "Well, we have to do something.  I'm not going to have a party 'cause that's over fast."  So we want a cruise, our first cruise like that.  We've gone to the islands, but we went to the Mediterranean.  For two whole weeks we were together there and--
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  What was that like?
Speaker 2: No, that was--it was nice.  It was really nice.  But I just could not retire, and now he--we're just getting ready to go on another cruise.
Speaker 1: Where are you going?
Speaker 2: We're going to the, the Panama Canal.
Speaker 1: Oh, that should be fantastic.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: And he is so excited, I haven't got excited yet.  I just, you know, take it in my stride and just one day at a time, but I'm not going to retire 'cause I always have something to come back to and do.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  People have great expectations for you.  I mean, they look forward to reading your column [Steppin' Out with Betty Brown] or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, they do.  It, it is so funny.  They said, "Oh, I catch up."  The older people say, "People that I don't get to see anymore 'cause I don't get out, it's nice to read their names."  And so when I do my column, I try to include new people that maybe their names haven't been in my column because people remember and they like that part, and then like that I talk about like all dressed up and I'll say I was wearing drop-dead red or I was doing this, you know.  (Laughter)  Not just red, I mean let's give it some pizzazz.
Speaker 1: Drop-dead red. I like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  And, and that's why I admire about a lot of the writers that write here for the Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times] like Stella [Stella Foster] and Lisa Lunt Lenoir [Lisa Lenoir], and there's another, Jenkins [Maureen Jenkins].  Well, she worked for me in my office (laughter).
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now she's a feature writer.  I think she spent two years in Italy last year or a couple of years ago.  She just got back.  A wonderful writer.
Speaker 1: It started with you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and here they all are doing so well and I'm, I'm so proud.
Speaker 1: To see them.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I didn't get to ask you much about Betty Brown Promotions [Elgin, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Betty Brown Promotions was a--Floyd and I had the book together, the magazine.
Speaker 1: Right.  La Petite--
Speaker 2: And then he cou-, it's La Petite: Dressing Up and Dining Out [ph.], and then he decided he didn't want to do it.  Oh, well I must say I was devastated.  Just a--how could he not want to do that?  But men have there--they're things they want to do.  He likes investments, so he's been involved in that.  And so, I didn't know what else to do and when they asked me to write for the paper, I thought, oh, this is my wonderful avenue.  But I would like to have a magazine, but I know--yeah, I'm too old now to have all of that energy to do that, but I will--I would like to continue writing.  One year I went to Switzerland and I could write about that, and that was wonderful.  I'd like to travel and write about, but I don't ever want to just quit working 'cause I've--they're gonna say, "She died."  That's all they'll say.  "She's not retired, she just died," (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's what you want them to say about you.
Speaker 2: She died.
Speaker 1: Well, okay.  I guess that's fair enough.
Story_ID: 360307
Speaker 1: And I have great faith, too, and even though everything--nothing is perfect in life as we know, but if we know that we have faith, we know that things happen for the good for the best.  I lost my mother [Margaret Brown Stephens] three years ago and I tell you, I didn't think I'd ever get over that and it still bothers me because she was just really instrumental in a lot of things to me and she was a, a Christian woman, and she was just a beautiful person and there was just the two of us left.
Speaker 2: Right.  And how wonderful that you had her with you for so--
Speaker 1: Yes, for all those years.  I should be thankful for that.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: To be--to be in your seventies is--
Speaker 1: Yes.  And my grandmother left an impression with me because she always sang and she sang at a lot of big churches here in Chicago [Illinois], and her song was 'His Eye is on the Sparrow.'
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a beautiful song.
Speaker 1: That was her favorite song, and then in Elgin [Illinois] we have a cemetery walk and we have a beautiful site in the cemetery in Elgin, and they always want--we can portray people and they always want me to do my grandmother.  I say, "Oh, I can't do it yet," 'cause when I do it, I'm gonna sing that at the--at her gravesite and I'm not ready.
Speaker 2: To do that just yet.
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: That's pretty emotional.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that it is.
Speaker 2: So, what are--what are some of the things that, that your mom taught you that you would share with someone, another young black woman--
Speaker 1: She would and--
Speaker 2: --or man?
Speaker 1: She always instilled in me God and, and the Lord and the church was very important, but it was what was in--within you and, and things that you do in life.  I see so many things, but I was always thinking God's watching me.  There's things I wouldn't do.  I don't drink.  I don't do any.  It wasn't I was a saint, it's just that she instilled that in me, and I've tried to instill that in my children [F. Keith Brown and Diane Brown Douglas] 'cause it doesn't matter what I say or do because there's a greater being and he's the one that watches and sees what you do.  So, that's something she left where she was that kind of a person, and she always read the 23rd Psalm which was her best, but she read the Bible more than I did.  I used to go to bible school and I was very good at it.  I could just quote all kinds of scripture and I knew all the books of the Bible, and I--but it wasn't that I was over religious, it was just that that's the way you grew up.
Speaker 2: Well as you were saying earlier, there wasn't a lot to do.  The church or--
Speaker 1: No.  And they belonged--they didn't belong to as many clubs that are out there now.  Like my mother was an American War Mother, and she sang in the choir, but outside clubs other than working, of course--I mean, there couldn't be much left.  You had to be tired sometimes (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Possibly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But they didn't have all the outside influence.  Somebody's always asking you to do something.  Join this club, join that club, and if you're not doing that, they'll say, "Well, you live in such and such block.  Would you collect money for the heart fund," and they get a fund for you to chit.  "You just have to walk two blocks."  You know, there's something, and then we never had that when I was young.
Speaker 2: In your town.  Well, is there anything that I haven't ask you that, that you want to talk about or--?
Speaker 1: No, I think you've asked about everything and my marriage, my children.  It's been a wonderful life and not everything is perfect.  I, I would like to say that.  Everyone says, "Oh, you guys are the perfect couple."  No one--nobody's perfect, and life gives you its tumbles and you just have to have faith.
Speaker 2: And, and that stood you a good stead?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes, it has.
Speaker 2: These many years.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does.
Speaker 2: That's beautiful.  I've so enjoyed talking with you this afternoon.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you so much for coming--
Speaker 1: It's been my pleasure.
Speaker 2: --coming out and you have a very interesting life.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: I've enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: And God bless you.
Speaker 2: Oh, God bless you, too.  Thank you.
