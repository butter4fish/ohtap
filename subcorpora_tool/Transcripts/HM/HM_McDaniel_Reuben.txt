Story_ID: 515714
Speaker 1: All right let's begin by talking about your mother.  Can you please tell me her name, spell it for me and if you know when she was born?
Speaker 2: Nannie Finney [Nannie Finney McDaniel], N-A-N-N-I-E, F-I-N-N-E-Y; I really don't know when she was born but I could get at it because she's ninety-eight years old right now.
Speaker 1: Okay and where was she born?
Speaker 2: Cumberland, Virginia.
Speaker 1: All right now tell me about her parents?
Speaker 2: Her father was Robert Finney, and he has the distinction or had the distinction of being one of the first African American college graduates in the State of Virginia. He graduated from Virginia State University [Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] long, long, long ago, one of the very first graduates of that institution. Her mother was Nannie Finney and she was also a two year college graduate from Saint Paul's College [Saint Paul Normal and Industrial School; Saint Paul's College, Lawrenceville, Virginia]. He was a schoolteacher and a farmer and she was a schoolteacher and housekeeper, they had nine children that they educated at home and that's who they were.
Speaker 1: Okay, now tell me about your relationship with them, did you have a relationship with them?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah I knew them very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Grandpapa Finney was a great guy, great storyteller, had interesting views of the world. For example when you went to visit him, the first day he'd stop whatever he was doing, take care of his animals and come entertain you. The second day he would go to work and the third day you would go to work (laughter) if you gonna stay there that long, but he's a great guy and he was great leader in the community in Cumberland, Virginia, certainly better educated than--probably than 99 percent of the African Americans in that county and was a great mainstay in his church [Mount Olive Baptist Church, Cumberland, Virginia], Deacon Finney ran the church as long as I was--knew him (laughter), and my grandmother was a wonderful woman, great, great cook. So it was always good to go up to her house and get some decent food and so I knew them pretty well. I spent some summers up there with them on the farm.
Speaker 1: What were some of the things that you did on the farm?
Speaker 2: Well I was just a little boy (laughter) and I was there primarily with my cousin Ernest [ph.] who's a couple of years older than I am. So the first thing I did on the farm was try to keep him from beating me up, (laughter) but we did the things that one--that little kids do on farms, went out and got the cows, shucked corn, slopped pigs. I learned to milk a cow and had a good time.
Speaker 1: Now where was their farm?
Speaker 2: In Cumberland, Virginia.
Speaker 1: In Cumberland, Virginia okay, all right, and what did your, what did you--what food did you like that your grandmother would prepare, you said she was a good cook?
Speaker 2: She cooked a soup that is known in our family as grandmamma's soup and it was just really good and it sat on the stove all day as people did in those days and a little bit added here and a little bit added there and at the end of the day it was really good.
Speaker 1: Okay now--
Speaker 2: She--lots of things when she--she was an excellent cook. She had a big family to feed, nine people, nine children to feed and so there was always ham and chicken, and greens and all but the soup was probably the best.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: My wife [HistoryMaker Myra McDaniel] makes that soup now, it's still pretty good.
Story_ID: 515715
Speaker 1: You said that your [maternal] grandfather told plenty of stories. Have any stories to share that he shared with you?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well I know some stories that he told.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he would tell stories about things that went on at the church. He would tell stories about the adventures he had when he went to college [Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia]. In, in that period of time going to college was not something people just did, it was quite an adventure. He was a very, very popular guy and church in the country--let's see now this is 1942. Church in the country was a once a month adventure for all day, and in the middle of church they served dinner and all the people had brought food from their homes to the church to have dinner, and I'm sure that all of us should've died from eating that food out there in this field with that hot sun, but none of us did as far as I know (laughter), but my fath- my grandfather was a great flirt, and he would go around from woman to woman and get himself some food and my grandmother [Nannie Finney] use to say to him, "Robert [Robert Finney] ain't nobody gonna want to have anything to do with you when I'm finished with you, so I don't worry about you going around there," and so, but that was a lot of fun going around with him just at church. Church was boring (laughter), but--it was.
Speaker 1: What kind of church was it?
Speaker 2: Baptist church, country Baptist church, Mount Olive Baptist Church [Cumberland, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: It, it was boring because I was six years not because anything was wrong with the church (laughter).
Story_ID: 515716
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your father.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me your father's name?
Speaker 2: Reuben R. McDaniel [Reuben R. McDaniel, Sr.], same as mine.
Speaker 1: He was a Sr. obviously.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And how old was he or is he?
Speaker 2: Well he died in 1974, he was about seventy-two when he died.
Speaker 1: Okay and tell me about his parents, tell me about his mother first?
Speaker 2: Okay, I knew his mother, his mother was a housewife.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Annie [Annie McDaniel (ph.)].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he--she was a very elegant, very dark-skinned woman. I remember her sitting on the porch of her house rocking, all the children playing around and running. She would command plenty of respect and obedience and great--had a great presence. It was seven children in that family, my father was the youngest but that's what she did, she was a housewife. Before I knew her she worked in service, which in the African American community at that time meant she cleaned house for white folks and she did a lot of that and I did not know her when she was doing that, she was--by the time I knew her she was home.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how much education did she have?
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I say none, she, she may have gone to the third grade or the sixth grade and she could read, but she was not an educated person.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now tell me about your grandfather, what was his name?
Speaker 2: Beryl [Beryl McDaniel (ph.)], and I think it's spelled B-E-R-Y-L but I wouldn't wanna swear about it, but it's Beryl. He was a shoemaker, really an entrepreneur, a small businessman. He was also a farmer. So he had a farm and fairly prosperous farm, and but he made his living making shoes for people, and repairing shoes, but a lot of it was making shoes. So he was a businessman.
Speaker 1: All right and how much education did he have?
Speaker 2: I'm sure--I don't know the answer to that question. I would imagine third or fourth grade, at that point in time that was about all the education African Americans got.
Speaker 1: Okay. Any stories to share about time spent with your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Well my grandparents' home was about a quarter of a mile away from one of his daughters' homes, her husband and they had a couple of boys, and I use to go up there and play--when I was--when I went to visit with them that's where I stayed was with Uncle June [June Lee (ph.)] and with those boys, Skippy [ph.] and Stanley [ph.]. They probably taught me about as much evil stuff as I know (laughter) but it was a, it was a very, it was a close family. Both sides of my family are very close, not necessarily with each other of course, but the McDaniels are very close and the Finneys are very close. I am the third youngest cousin on my father's side and the second oldest on my mother's [Nannie Finney McDaniel] side so I've got cousins that go from yonder to when and always had a good time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Did stuff you do in the country (laughter).
Story_ID: 515717
Speaker 1: Now tell me about your father [Reuben R. McDaniel, Sr.], did he share stories about him--his growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm sure he did. The reason why I'm so sure he did is because we are a family of storytellers (laughter) and so we all tell a lot of stories all the time. So he told stories about his relationship with his father [Beryl McDaniel (ph.)], how he left home and he and his father fell out because his father had an idea and, and not an unreasonable idea that a successful farmer was a big farmer, had a big farm and my father had the idea that a successful farmer was somebody who could grow lots of stuff as opposed to having a big farm, and so my grandfather thought Buster was lazy because he didn't want to have to work a big farm. My grand- my father tried to prove to him that you can grow more potatoes or corn in a smaller space if you take care of it. So they had a falling out and daddy left home not--I don't think he wasn't put out or anything like that but he left home and went to Washington, D.C. and worked as a mail boy at the Department of Navy [U.S. Department of the Navy] where he was the mail boy for [President] Franklin Delano Roosevelt who told him he should go back to school, so that's why he went back to high school, went on to college, got his Ph.D.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he left home, he hadn't complete high school yet or?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, he had just gone to sixth grade which was the farthest that you go in that community at that time. So he left home and went to Washington, went there to work, not to go to school.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But Roosevelt told him he should go back to school, he did, went to--I don't remember the lady's name now but went to a little school where he got his elementary education, then went to Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School] in Washington where he got his high school diploma and then he went onto Rutgers University [The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey], was Phi Beta Kappa [Phi Beta Kappa Society] there. Went on to Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], the space is there but the--actually he went from Rutgers to Cornell and got his master's degree, left there went to Saint Paul [Saint Paul Normal and Industrial School; Saint Paul College, Lawrenceville, Virginia] to teach, left there went to Virginia State [Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] to teach. Then went to Cornell and got his Ph.D. in mathematics.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-eight [1938]. So he had an interesting adventure. I use to tell him that if he, if he and is daddy hadn't both been so stubborn he would probably have worked on that farm all his life (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: Both of them pretty stubborn.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: But they had a good relationship, I, I don't want to imply that their relationship was unsatisfactory. There was nothing any different than the relationship lots of kids have with their parents.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Where there's stress and you need somebody home to work and so daddy left and in fact the man who came and took my father's place, his name was June Sta- Lee [June Lee (ph.)] and he married one of my father's sisters, Eleanor [Eleanor McDaniel Lee (ph.)].
Story_ID: 515718
Speaker 1: Tell me about your relationship with your father [Reuben R. McDaniel, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: It was good, the reason why I hesitated a little bit was not because I have anything negative or positive to say about it particularly. It is very, very difficult having a father as a genius and my father was a real genius, no kidding for real and was a very, very kind person, very agreeable. He certainly supported me in everything I tried to do, and we got along very well right 'til his death. When I say it's hard to be a child of a genius, (laughter) I mean just that (laughter), for one thing their expectations are sometimes high, but even worse you can't be as good as they were. So you get mad at yourself so, but you get over that after a while and one of the kinds of things that, that I've done which may be of interest is father taught at Virginia State [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] and when I was a kid I use to go to class with him and it was very fascinating 'cause he was very, very popular yeah, unbelievably so. I was telling you just a while ago about a man who not long ago wrote to my son [Reuben McDaniel III] (laughter) and said his father had been such a big influence on him, but playing on the campus and being a part of the campus family is different than the way a lot of children grew up. I grew up in a very safe environment, we had lots and lots of books and I could read them all. My father told me I shouldn't read 'Mein Kampf' [Adolf Hitler] so I stole it off the bookcase and read it anyway, and I was only about eight years old, but--so we had lots of that kind of thing and at the college we had lots of concerts, Marian Anderson sang there and Duke Ellington played there. So I was exposed to all those kinds of things when I was just a little bitty kid and got along good, well with dad, he was a good man.
Speaker 1: What about your relationship with your mother [Nannie Finney McDaniel]?
Speaker 2: Very good, very affectionate. Mother's also a professor; in fact she's a business professor. I'm the only person you know who can say the following thing: "I am a professor of business, and my mother was a professor of business," (laughter). Lots of people can say I was a professor of business, my father was a professor of business, but not a whole lot of 'em can say my mother was a professor of business, and when I was home--I, I left home when I was about eleven and I'll tell you about that in a minute but when I was home my mother was not teaching for a variety of reasons, but my sister is seven younger than I am so she was raising, Joann [Joann McDaniel], but Joann tells about the problem of living at Virginia State and people would say, "So you're the McDaniel child," and it was, "which McDaniel are you made at" (laughter), you know but it was a good, good close relationship and like many boys I was a mama's boy and she always thought I was neat. She's mad at me now 'cause I don't shave (shrugs).
Story_ID: 515719
Speaker 1: What was the lesson, one of the lessons learned from your mother [Nannie Finney McDaniel]?
Speaker 2: People ask me how did you get so smart. First thing is I don't think I'm very smart, but that's the question people ask and there really is an answer. When I was about eight, I had this question. I was interested in knowing whether or not boiling water would freeze, which is a reasonable question exactly as a scientist would say. It's a very reasonable question. So I boiled some water and put it in the--took out the ice out of the ice cube trays and put the boiling water in the refrigerator and closed the door. My mother came home from work and the refrigerator was defrosted as you would know and she said, "Well has the electricity been off?" I said, "No ma'am." "Was the refrigerator door open?" "No ma'am." "Wonder how everything got defrosted?"  And I remember we ate the steaks 'cause (laughter) they had come--had been frozen now they weren't frozen anymore. So a little bit later on in the evening when my mother was washing dishes I went and opened the refrigerator door and tapped on the ice cube trays and my mother said, "What are you doing?" 'Cause she was watching, 'cause this was her refrigerator that just messed up all her food. "What you doing?" And I told--said, "I wanted to find out if boiling water would freeze so I put some boiling water in here." So she said, "Well does it freeze?" I said, "Yes ma'am." She said, "Fine."  She never said, "You know you defrosted my refrigerator." "Well if you wanted to know why didn't you ask me," you know, yes, okay fine. I was five, seven, eight years later before I realized I had defrosted that refrigerator, but that was the kind of thing that my mother did and that particular incident of course I remember because almost every parent including myself would say, "Well now listen, if you wanna know if water freezes, you ask me you know 'cause I know whether it freezes or not," but she didn't she just says, "Well did it?" "Yes ma'am, it sure did." She didn't say, "Well you ruined my dinner," or, "You melted my ice cream," or any of those things which she could've said, and I think that has encouraged me to be curious, to be willing to ask questions, to be willing to find out for myself (laughter). So that--there're lots of other lessons of course, but that was one of which I remember a lot.
Story_ID: 515720
Speaker 1: What trait did you get from your father [Reuben R. McDaniel, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: Trait?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, characteristic.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I know, I know what you--I know what the question is, I just don't know what the answer is right now, just, well let me tell you something else first' cause it's not, not really a trait.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The thing that I think I got from my father was the love of mathematics. He was a math teacher and he knew how to teach math, he knew how to make it interesting, not trivial, make it a challenge so, and, and that's a very, very handy thing (laughter). That is, really is handy to be facile with mathematics, to not be afraid of it, not that I necessary knew calculus or different equations when I was a high school student, I didn't. I learned some calculus in high school, but, but it was just not being afraid of it, being open to math and to counting things and to thinking with the kind of logic that mathematicians use, careful thought about what you're trying to do. So that was one kind of thing. Another kind of thing that was very important was that although we lived on the campus [of Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] in a fairly small town where most of the African Americans were relatively poor, we went to church in town, Zion Baptist Church [Petersburg, Virginia]. I had friends in town, my mother [Nannie Finney McDaniel] and father had friends in town. We never excluded ourselves from anybody in the community and I think that was a very important lesson that everybody was worth talking to and respecting and working with and being--I wanna say friendly with, but that's not right. That's true too but, but being aware that they're all worthwhile and that you're worth--in great measures depending on them, and mama and daddy just always, that was the way they did things and I think they got that in good measure from their parents, and I knew Mr. and Mrs. Finney [McDaniel's maternal grandparents, Nannie Finney and Robert Finney] very well and they were the same way. Just very straight up with people, very--I don't know. I don't wanna say anything foolish. I don't mind being foolish (laughter), but they just had a way of dealing with folks that was very straightforward and very honest and a lot of respect. My mother and father both respected their students a lot (laughter). I remember one point in life my father was considering coming to work for me when I was at Baldwin-Wallace College [Baldwin Wallace University, Berea, Ohio] there was a program I needed a director, so he was gonna at least came interviewed for the job (laughter). The president asked him, "Well what do you think about working for your son?" He said he never had any children or a student he wouldn't work for. He just felt that way, it didn't have anything to do with that. I mean if I was a bad boss he'd a kicked me but that's not the point to him, the point to him was not well is this your son, can you work with him, you know and I think that has been--I tried to emulate that. I don't claim to have done it but I've tried and I think it's been--stood me in good stead.
Story_ID: 515721
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother [Nannie Finney McDaniel] and father [Reuben R. McDaniel, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: My mother was my father's student. My father was a professor and my mother was in his class.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's how they met.
Speaker 1: That's how they met (laughter) all right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now do you have siblings?
Speaker 2: I have a sister seven years younger than I am.
Speaker 1: And tell me her name?
Speaker 2: Joann [Joann McDaniel].
Speaker 1: And what does she do?
Speaker 2: She's retired, lazy girl (laughter). She was a school teacher for many, many years in northern Virginia as an administrator in a school system, never a principal or superintendent, although I think she could've been if she wanted to be, but she held staff administrative jobs and was a very, very successful teacher and got you know you get to the point in the world if you work in same place long enough where it costs you money to keep working (laughter), where your retirement is more than you making 'cause--so she's now retired, has been for some time.
Story_ID: 515722
Speaker 1: I think the following statement is true although I wouldn't want to have to swear to it. My father's [Reuben R. McDaniel, Sr.] grandmother was a slave. Now there were people in, on my mother's [Nannie Finney McDaniel] side of the family who were slaves. They would be my, my--I think probably my grandfather's grandfather. I'm, I'm thinking that that's the generation but I'm not positive of that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But yes they were, they were well aware of slavery in their family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We never particularly talked about it, excessively that's what I meant there wasn't any--nobody was mad at anybody, let's say that (laughter).
Story_ID: 515723
Speaker 1: Now let's talk about your early childhood years. What, what actually is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) My earliest childhood memory and I don't really know how old I was, I'm gonna guess I was about four is running across the snow on the campus [of Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] to a man's house named Mr. Rogers [ph.] on Christmas to take him a Christmas present (laughter). He was a--he and his wife had no children. He was very good to the children but to explain that just a little bit more. At the campus there was this big lawn and I see it that way. It's kind of a big mall and at one end of the mall was the president's house and then some faculty homes including Mr. Rogers' home, and at the other end of the mall were some apartment buildings where my, my family lived and I remember getting all dressed up in a snowsuit and everything and running across the snow and it was about the length of I'm guessing, a football field maybe, to take him something for Christmas that--and I'm sure there were things that happened after that but I don't remember. I just do remember very clearly that and I don't remember just because I was told about it, although I've been told about it, but I really do remember that.
Story_ID: 515724
Speaker 1: When you think back to the years that you were in elementary school, what sounds or smells or sights take you back to that time?
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: None?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't go back there (laughter), I really don't. I don't have any feelings, I mean negative feelings about it, but I don't have anything that reminds me of being in elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I'm not trying to be difficult just isn't anything (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) No, that's fine then, if there's nothing there, there's nothing there.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: All right well tell me about elementary school [Matoaca Laboratory Elementary School, Petersburg, Virginia], you were on the Virginia State campus [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Campus, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay tell me about that?
Speaker 2: It was a four room school house, the woman who was president--was the principal was a woman named Ms. Robinson [ph.], big ugly woman who had a big yardstick she beat you with, and mostly we were taught by student teachers, people who were getting their college degrees at Virginia State but used that to teach. About my second or third grade I guess a woman named Ms. Cooper [ph.] came, full time teaching there to help with the student teachers, but almost all of my teachers in elementary school were college kids who were learning how to teach and Ms. Robinson and her yardstick would keep you in line, and it was a fun time. I don't, don't mean to say anything disparaging about it, it was nothing disparagingly to be said about it. In Virginia at that time, let's remember when this is, 1941, '47 [1947], the community, the, the Anglo community did not want African American children to be educated so you didn't have--you had used textbooks from the other schools, grade schools in town. You know the story, well my textbook was stamped with the name of the school. Frankly, it didn't bother me at all. It was a book and I could use it (laughter), just never. A lot of the children I went to elementary school with were from the county and lived in much less prosperous circumstances than I lived. Not that we had any money 'cause we didn't have any money, but comparatively speaking we had money, we had our wonderful home, heat and food, everything, but I don't know that there was anything other than we knew that they were not prosperous. I don't even know if I knew the word prosperous (laughter), but we didn't even have any money, but they were good people, nice people. We had fun together, the girls beat up on the boys. They seemed to particularly enjoy beating up on me 'cause I was so big, but it didn't bother me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was fun, I mean it was a good experience.
Speaker 1: What were some of the activities that you participated in then?
Speaker 2: Dodge ball, sang, we put on little plays for our parents and we made Christmas chains and put 'em up on the tree and the same things. Well it's not necessarily the same thing kids do now but the same kind of thing, things I think to help us enjoy ourselves and be good at what we did. The--I think the biggest issue if there was an issue, (unclear) is expectations were very low and 'cause that's not anything strange, new. One of the biggest issues in elementary, in, in education, public school education for African Americans in that time, was the expectations were so low and as we now know kids about live up to expectations so it was a struggle, not, not, not a struggle for me personally of any kind. I wasn't climbing any ropes (laughter). I had a good life I didn't have anything bad happening but it was a struggle in the sense that we were not given the tools in the school that were necessary to be very successful. Now I was given lots of tools at home but that's a different problem, and there're other children in that school whose parents were professors and teachers also were given tools at home, but the school itself did not have very high expectations of us.
Story_ID: 515725
Speaker 1: Well the teachers [at Matoaca Laboratory Elementary School, Petersburg, Virginia] were student teachers, did they--was there anyone who, as a teacher might have encouraged you to, to do more or better in education?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, the reason why I hesitated is because I don't want that to turn into, did those teachers not encourage anybody. They didn't particularly encourage me and but I, I came in the school building with a head start (laughter) with mother [Nannie Finney McDaniel] and father [Reuben R. McDaniel, Sr.] who are both well educated, very ambitious who could provide lots of stimulation and I don't think I got any of my elementary school stimulation from the teachers there. I'm sure that they made a big difference to some kids--that didn't--I'm not making that debate at all, but just for me personally I was already standing in a whole pile of fertilizer (laughter) you know.
Story_ID: 515726
Speaker 1: So when you left elementary school [Matoaca Laboratory Elementary School, Petersburg, Virginia] did you go to a middle school or into high school?
Speaker 2: I went into high school, I went into high school right there on the campus. The high school, D.W. Davis High School [D. Webster Davis Laboratory High School, Petersburg, Virginia], and I need to give you some more information. I went to elementary school when I was four instead of six. I'm the only person you know who got thrown out of kindergarten. I may not be the only person you know who got thrown out of--okay, I'm one of the few you know who got thrown out of kindergarten and they figured if they put up in elementary school with those big kids and they beat, beat up on me that I'd better but I skipped a grade there. So I was very, very young when I went to high school, I was nine and--
Speaker 1: You were how old?
Speaker 2: Nine.
Speaker 1: Nine.
Speaker 2: And went into a school which was even more, even less challenging than my elementary school work. Although I had a very interesting experience there. They didn't teach science in that school because they didn't want any black folks to know any science and didn't teach it to 'em, but I, I had a student teacher who thought that I could do something at a science fair so I did. What I did was I went out in the field, I didn't go in the field, I went out in the street and caught some cats and killed them and dissected them and did a study of the anatomy of the cats and wrote a paper and won a prize at a science fair in Norfolk, Virginia. The school was very disappointed 'cause I wasn't supposed to be taking any science (laughter). I wasn't supposed to know any science, but we actually did that at night. The man would go to the school at night and we would sneak in along with a friend of mine named Vivian Verdell [Vivian Verdell Gordon], who was a couple of years older than I am, but was and but in the same grade and Vivian would sit around while we dissected this cat and pricked up in formaldehyde and I wrote up this paper which my mother [Nannie Finney McDaniel] typed up for me and then I went to Norfolk and presented the paper and won a place, first prize.
Speaker 1: And how old were you?
Speaker 2: Ten.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: But the point, not the point, a point is that I knew what was going on. I mean I knew that we weren't supposed to be doing any of this and that we were sneaking in the middle of the night and I guess I probably didn't care much about killing cats then. Probably now I wouldn't--swear I wouldn't tell anybody I killed 'em (laughter). I'm not sure I wouldn't still kill 'em, but we caught them right in the street and killed him and, and carefully did a, a good biology project trying to understand the anatomy of a cat.

Speaker 1: So how did you decide what college you would go to?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, there's another step in there (laughter), you don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well you didn't know about it yet but.
Speaker 1: Well tell me about it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother [Nannie Finney McDaniel] and father [Reuben R. McDaniel, Sr.] sent me away from home when I was eleven years old to Mount Hermon School in Massachusetts [Mount Hermon School for Boys; Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts], which is a boys high school and I spent five years there, so I actually spent seven years in high school and when I--but when I went to Mount Hermon at eleven, I was way, way behind even though I'd had quote two years of high school, I was way, way behind the other kids in the school, but so that is where I actually got my high school education and incidentally most of my liberal arts education I got there, and as I said, stayed there five years. I graduated when I was seventeen so that (laughter), 'cause I went--I was eleven, graduated from high school when I was seventeen, and I really decided where to go to college from that spot, not from Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And I went to the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] because I really went there because Howard Del- I was a basketball star at Mount Hermon School and highly recruited basketball player. I went to Penn in part because my high school coach encouraged me to do that, but the real reason was is a man there named Howard Dallmar [Howie Dallmar] whose career I had followed as a professional player, and as a coach that I wanted to play for. It turns out that--and at the-- after my first year at Penn, Howard Dallmar left and went to Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California]. It's a different kind of story, but so I spent time there at Mount Hermon School and learned a lot, got smarter (laughter) didn't do very well, but that's a different (unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 1: You did not do very well?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I majored in girls and basketball and music and I did well in those three things. That doesn't get you good grades in English and French and math and, I learned a lot, but that different that getting good grades (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, now tell me about your music (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I learned a tremendous amount.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your music?
Speaker 2: At Mount Hermon School music and sports were two big items in the world. These were the heroes. It turns out that I have, probably don't have any more, but I had a very good voice and I sang in a sequence of choirs, the glee club, then the church choir, then the a capella choir, then the--it was called the Triple Quartet, which was the twelve best voices--well that's not true. There were three voices in each--first and second tenor, first and second bass but we were the stars (laughter) on that and I really loved it. Al Raymond [Albert Raymond] who was our director became the person at--the teacher at the school whom I most admired and that's what I did and I've, I've done it every--I don't do it now for a couple of three reasons but done it for a long time everywhere.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I do it fairly well (laughter), at least I use to do it fairly well (cough).
Speaker 1: So you don't want to give us a rendition of (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, I don't wanna give you a rendition if it's okay with you.
Story_ID: 515728
Speaker 1: So at this point what are you thinking about college since you're not doing so well in your classes?
Speaker 2: I had more colleges recruiting me than I can stand. I did very, very well on the SATs because at--five years at Mount Hermon [Mount Hermon School for Boys; Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts] I had become a very good test taker. I'd actually learned a lot, don't have to had good grades to have learned things (laughter) and so I had very, very high SAT scores. So I was offered scholarships to Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island], to Colby [Colby College, Waterville, Maine] and to the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] which is where I ended up going, and I went there, went to college primarily to play basketball for Howie Dallmar and the good thing that happened to me at Penn was I met my wife [HistoryMaker Myra McDaniel] and fifty-two years later we're still on the go (laughter). I think that's pretty good from being in college (laughter).
Speaker 1: And you were incoming freshman and she was a upper classman?
Speaker 2: Senior.
Speaker 1: She was a senior, oh okay and so this was in 1954 when you went to the University of Pennsylvania?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '53 [1953] I think it was.
Speaker 1: Fifty-three [1953]?
Speaker 2: She graduated in '54 [1954] and I went there in '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So tell me what happens when you get to the university? How was basketball, and (unclear).
Speaker 2: When I went to the University of Pennsylvania an interesting thing had just occurred. The, the Penn and other Ivy League schools had decided to go honest and so actually I--they did not give me the scholarship they had promised me and, and we had a tremendous freshman basketball team 'cause in those days freshman couldn't play on the varsity and none of us ever graduated from Penn. None of the rest of 'em flunked out but they didn't graduate, they went on elsewhere to play ball, et cetera and if I hadn't met my wife I might have gone to Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] with Howie Dallmar 'cause he asked me to go, but I didn't go to class. I had a good time, flunked out of school, got a job, made a living (laughter) and been working ever since. Well I actually worked before that so, (laughter), most of my life I worked.
Speaker 1: What job did you have before you got to college, what type of job?
Speaker 2: Lord, lady, I worked as a janitor at Virginia State College [Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] for a summer. I worked as a farm hand at--Mount Hermon had a big farm and I worked there two summers. I worked as a camp counselor for one summer. I worked at the Northfield School for Girls [Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts]. In the summer they had a series of church conferences and they hired boys to come and do things, clean dormitories and stuff like that. So I'd, I had always--since I was eleven, since before I went away to prep school, every summer I've always had a full-time job and then when I was in prep school, everybody worked ten hours a week doing all kinds of things. I mean you had a job for the whole year but I was a janitor one year, and I worked on the farm two years and I worked in the dining hall two years, so that was work.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: I can make a hustle (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right (laughter).
Speaker 2: I may not be able to conjugate a verb but I can hustle.
Story_ID: 515729
Speaker 1: So you left school [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and what job did you get then?
Speaker 2: When I first, okay when I left school I got a job as an accountant for the U.S government. Those were the days when you could become an accountant by taking a test and I didn't have to know any accounting, I was a very good test taker (laughter). I didn't know any accounting. Then I read about a job at Philco Corporation [Philco International Company] as a draftsman and I applied for that job and again (laughter) I was given a test (laughter). It was really interesting because in the, in the--I found out later that, that lots of people took this test, let's say a hundred and the three top scorers were African Americans but they had already decided they weren't gonna have but two in the class (laughter). So I didn't get in the first class really, but they never told me well you didn't get the job. They just kept saying call back and we'll get in touch la-di-da, and then when their second class started they said okay, come on go to work, and at that moment I didn't know that there had already been a first class. As far as I knew there was one job and I was getting it, but of course it didn't take me but two and one half minutes to figure out what had happened (laughter). Now I went to work for Philco in a training program for draftsman and designers. At Philco Corporation--well first, I was very successful at that job in part because the first man I worked for, a guy named Harry Wilson was very good and he taught me a lot. I learned what he had to say and at Philco Corporation at that time, people in my position were all encouraged to go back to school and we went--I went to night school at Drexel University [Drexel Institute of Technology; Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and that's how I got my undergraduate degree was working full time and I went to school at night and got an engineering degree, and that was not uncommon. People at Philco Corporation who were technicians and draftsman and so and so, they were encouraged to go to school. After five years I left there and went to work for UNIVAC corporation [Sperry Rand Corporation; Sperry Corporation] because I wanted to get out of the military business. I was actually a designer for--in the Sidewinder missile [AIM-9 Sidewinder] which is still killing people today (laughter).
Speaker 1: The Sidewinder?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, it's a good missile, but I went to work for UNIVAC corporation, I was a mechanical design engineer on the first commercial solid state computer made in the United States (laughter). That, that's just 'cause I'm old. It has nothing to do with anything other than that--old and in the right place, and went on finished my college degree and actually for a year was a reliability engineer for UNIVAC corporation and--
Speaker 1: Tell me about that job, what did you do in that position?
Speaker 2: As a reliability engineer? (Cough) You're responsible for trying to improve the performance the reliability of the performance of the equipment. Now, I was in charge of the reliability for all the paper handling equipment that UNIVAC made, so this time there was more than just a little bit of it, paper card readers, punches and printers and paper tape readers. So when they broke down my task was to try to figure out why and try to figure out was it a design error, was it a manufacturing error, was it an abuse error--not usually intentional abuse, but somebody misused the equipment, and stuff like that. So that was my job was to try to--when things broke down we were sent the parts along with what was called the failure and malfunction report and this kind of told you what happened and da, da, da and all that then, so you try to analyze it and see what you wanted to do and so.
Speaker 1: That's what you did.
Speaker 2: I don't (laughter) I mean I don't know much more how to say it than that, and so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'll say it--I mean that's fine--
Speaker 2: That's what I did.
Speaker 1: I mean I just needed to have a description of what you, what you did.
Story_ID: 515730
Speaker 1: At the same time that you were going to night school, you became the president of some association for night school. Tell me about that?
Speaker 2: Well I'll go back a half a step before that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: When I--while I was in school at Drexel [Drexel Institute of Technology; Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] I became very active as a student in the life of the university. I sang in the glee club, I was eventually president of the student body and then was elected president of the interna- actually I was elected vice president of the International Association of Evening Student Councils, and the person who was elected president, a guy named Tom Moore [ph.] was diagnosed with tuberculosis and so he had to give up the job and I became president. See how sometimes you get things without deserving them at all (laughter), (unclear) lucky, and but when I was at Drexel I was very active in school in the governance systems. I worked hard at, at several programs that, that I, I wanna say I started but--and that would be a true statement but that were just part of an on-going kind of a thing that was going on. The, the school was a very and supportive of its adult students and evening college students, and Drexel was then a place where all the students worked because the day students were all co-op students so they worked six months and went to school six months and the evening students we were working all day and going to school at night and nobody put up with any foolishness from you. You couldn't walk in and you didn't say things like, "You know it's so hard to go to night school, poor me," and people would just laugh at you. You go to school, you go to school and I became very good at it and did very well and no particular reason except that I learned how to do it. There's, there's a secret to doing well--assuming you have reasonable intelligence, there's a secret to doing well in school and if you learn it then you can do well without working very hard at it. Well that's not true, hard work is part of the secret, but when I say not working very hard I mean it's not a mystery what to do, it's what you do you know (laughter) you know. Well things for example, when you get an assignment in engineering school to do problem one, five, seven and twelve for your homework. The real meaning of that is you do all the problems.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then you turn in one, five, seven and twelve (laughter), but you do 'em all.
Story_ID: 515731
Speaker 1: One of the things I, I should point out to you that's very important is that I really got my liberal arts education at Mount Hermon School [Mount Hermon School for Boys; Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts] in high school. That's where I studied religion, I studied philosophy, I studied world history, ancient history, U.S. history. I took lots of math and physics and chemistry, lots and lots of English, read lots of things, learned to write. Most people get their liberal arts education in college, I got mine in high school and when I left high school I was a capable person in that sense. So a lot of the things that I do (laughter) well today, which are based on my liberal arts background really are not based in my liberal arts background in college and, but rather in high school. So when I got to Drexel [Drexel Institute of Technology; Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and began as an engineering student, you may well know that engineering programs are not liberal education (laughter), but I didn't need it I already had it by then. I was reading voraciously, I was writing--I could write whatever I needed to do. So that was very important and then I learned for example in addition to work every problem is that, this will sound crazy but it's not. If you got a job to do you don't need to go to bed (laughter), you don't really (unclear), you just--you gotta do, you gotta do. Now, I'm not trying to say that people shouldn't sleep, I didn't make that statement, but I remember one I night I was studying with a guy named Adam Zawasky [ph.] and I said, "Adam, yeah man it's three o'clock in the morning, I gotta go to work at seven." He says, "We'll stop at seven, we'll let you go to work at seven." (Laughter) "What do you mean you gotta go to work man?" 'Cause we weren't finished, we weren't finished with what we had to do. Now, again I'm not--I did not just say people shouldn't sleep, but what you have to recognize I think is that sometime you have to do extraordinary things. Not because you expect to be rewarded but because you do that to get your job done, to get finished what it was you're trying to. So a lot of people (laughter), they get tired early and they can't finish their assignment or they didn't quite read everything they were supposed to read for class and so they're surprised when they don't do as well as they should. Another thing (laughter) is that you, you don't wait until the teacher's taught something before you study it. You have to study before the teacher teaches it. So if you go into a class in thermodynamics or fluid mechanics, you can't go to class--I couldn't go to class and listen to the teacher, then go home and study. You have to study it first (laughter), then when you go to class the teacher helps you with the things you were having difficulty with, but you already should know 87 percent of what he's gonna say by the time you go to class. You never go to class without having done the assignment first. So, but like most people--many people think well I'm gonna go to history class and the man is gonna talk about this period of history. So I'm gonna go listen to him talk and then I'm gonna go and read about it. Well (laughter) that was--he didn't do that. People make good grades doing that, but if you're, if you're not very good like I am then you have to read it first, then you go listen to him talk about it. And that's what I mean when I say you have to learn some of the trick of the trade.
Story_ID: 515732
Speaker 1: So when you leave UNIVAC [Sperry Rand Corporation; Sperry Corporation] where do you go? This is in 1965 now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, I went to Baldwin-Wallace College [Baldwin Wallace University, Berea, Ohio] as director of the division of educational services. I really had made a decision to leave engineering for a short period of time, two or three years while I got a master's degree in business and got some experience doing some other kind of management than engineering management. So I had looked for a job over in the country as an assistant dean in an adult education program because I knew a lot about it by then, I had traveled over all the United States talking about it and visiting with people about it, and I thought I had something to offer, and a man whose name is Fred Harris [Fred E. Harris] called me up and he said he didn't have a job as an assistant dean, but he had a job as dean, did I think I could do it? And because I was pretty stupid I said yes and so he said, "Okay, come on out here and interview." So I went, and he tell--he did, now he told the story he says, "When he got off the plane and I saw him I said, 'Oh, we'll get him on the basketball team,' and I took him to church and heard him sing, I said, 'Well okay we'll get him down to the conservatory.'" They had a Conservatory of Music there [Berea, Ohio], but at any rate I impressed him, he impressed me and then there was this, this event that occurred. The president of the college, about two weeks after I'd had that interview had a heart attack, and the man who was the vice president became the acting president. So he needed somebody right away to do this job as director of educational services. So he called me he says, "Reuben [HistoryMaker Reuben R. McDaniel], I know we talked about your coming out here in June or July.  Could you come right now?" Well, fortunately I was working at UNIVAC I would just give 'em two week notice, I'd go wherever I wanted to. So I said, "Okay, I'll come right now." So that's, that was very fortunate thing for me because one thing it meant I got the job okay 'cause he's looking up in the morning, he ain't got but one person, (laughter) that's me, but also I jumped right into it. I was there, I was needed it wasn't something where you know well let's mess around for a while. So I went there to work.
Story_ID: 515733
Speaker 1: Now during this time civil rights is going full force. Were you involved?
Speaker 2: No they weren't--people were trying to get civil rights, and there were no civil rights around (laughter).
Speaker 1: And so I'm saying (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) We're still on these civil rights.
Speaker 1: The Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: Movement, okay that was going forward (laughter). I'm sorry I shouldn't--that, that's ridiculous but it's true, but yeah the Civil Rights Movement is (unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, were you involved at all?
Speaker 2: Was I?
Speaker 1: Or how were you involved?
Speaker 2: Lots of different ways actually, I was never a big Civil Rights Movement leader; I make no claims to that. I participated in some sit-ins in Virginia while I was actually working at UNIVAC [Sperry Rand Corporation; Sperry Corporation] which is my home where my mother [Nannie Finney McDaniel] and father [Reuben R. McDaniel, Sr.] lived and when the issues in the movement we'd stay, I took time off from work and went down and sat-in. I was certainly sensitive to and aware of what was going on in the country. I had, had the opportunity to do things like meet Whitney Young. I wasn't an advisor to Whitney Young (laughter), we just drank some scotch together (laughter), but I think I got some feel for, from him what kinds of things were going on and, and for example. One of the kinds of things we talked about one night was people gave him a hard time because he would ride first class in airplanes and they would say, "You know you need ride back with the people," and his response was, "Reuben [HistoryMaker Reuben R. McDaniel], nobody in coach has any money, and what I need to do is get money, and yes I liked riding in first class I'm not gonna deny that but the fact is that for what I have to do, I've got to be where people are who have money," and you know that's hard for people to understand who don't know much about let's say the business community or this kind of thing, so that was interesting. I was at Baldwin-Wallace College [Baldwin Wallace University, Berea, Ohio] when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed and so I was in the middle of serious turmoil there. I spent some time in Detroit [Michigan] where there was some serious turmoil going on and in Cleveland [Ohio]. There was at that same time a student movement in the world going on. Students were protesting, looking for new things, et cetera and two things happened to stop the student movement (laughter). It's not, it isn't--the anatomy of it can be complicated but it doesn't have to be. One thing happened at the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], a man named Gaylord Harnwell who's president of the university--they were having a big sit-in and demonstration and everything, and Gaylord Harnwell said, "Well let's have a teach-in," and the damn students, they're so stupid, they said, "Okay."  Well when you're in a situation and you're having a teach-in then the teacher gets to be in charge (laughter) and the students just lost all of their political--actually the things they could have done when they let the teachers get in charge. So of course everybody else, every other college, university said, "Oh let's have a teach-in, we're gonna have a protest, something, let's have a teach-in, we're gonna have a teach-in," (scoffs) that was stupid, and I told lots of people who were in the middle of it that. They said, "But Reuben you don't understand you know these people really, they want to help." I said, "You damn fool (laughter) they don't wanna help you they help themselves, you crazy." No, no union would have a strike and let the management say, "Let's have a teach-in," okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 515734
Speaker 1: But the other thing was somewhat more serious, well, no that was very serious, I'm sorry. It was very, very serious but the other thing was a seriousness of a different nature and actually when it happened I was giving a talk at a college whose name I can't recall right now but when they shot those kids at Kent State [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio], I don't know how much you know about that but, but the students at Kent State were not, they didn't have no guns, they weren't--it was not Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and, and they were shot by their mothers and fathers, by their fathers actually. Now not, not in the sense of I shot my son, but in the sense that the people in the National Guard who shot those kids lived in that community, the kids lived in that community and it was a very, very, very revealing thing when you realize that people will shoot their own children to keep things their way rather than change, but that's what happened. So those two events teach-ins and--let me just show you something, I gonna shoot you, (laughter) now, let's--this isn't in Berkeley we're not gonna go out and shoot some hippies, that's okay. You can go shoot all the hippies you want to but we're gonna go to Kent State University in northern Ohio with just plain, ordinary, northern Ohio kids and plain northern Ohio Army reservists [U.S. Army Reserve] and we're gonna put guns in their hands and have them shoot them, so (laughter) so you, you know and, and you--that was the end of that whole movement, and the end of that movement was a very, very--even though we don't talk about it very much, was a very, very bad time for the Civil Rights Movement, because the whole idea of people being engaged in their rights. Students, women, African Americans whomever really kind of went away.  Women tried to get the whatever amendment it was [19th Amendment] and the men said no (laughter), "No, we're not gonna give you more rights," and the women said, "Oh, okay. Well that's what they said so" (laughter), I mean you know and so it think it was very, very difficult for the Civil Rights Movement to sustain itself because it, it lost, of course it already lost by that point in time the, the key intellectual leader of the movement and some--you know Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] but Whitney [Whitney Young] and some other people too. I did a lot of things; I mean I gave talks at national conventions, particularly about counseling. I, I use to be an expert in guidance and counseling and I use to give talks around the country in guidance and counseling (laughter) a lot of people do that, and I remember giving a talk in Chicago [Illinois] with--we thought there'd be thirty people, twenty maybe, turned out to be several hundred filling up the room and I don't think they came to hear me talk. I think they came to hear somebody talk about how we can help students deal with the issues of race and this kind of thing.
Story_ID: 515735
Speaker 1: Well you were the only--were you the only black teacher at Baldwin--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Wallace [Baldwin-Wallace College; Baldwin Wallace University, Berea, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So what was that like for you as a fac- as a faculty member there?
Speaker 2: It was fine. The reason why I hesitated a minute was because it was fine but I'm trying--the, the question is, is perfectly reasonable it just is the wrong question (laughter), okay. Now it's a perfectly reasonable question but let's start--since I was eleven years old I spent my time living with white folks (laughter). When I was in prep school [Mount Hermon School for Boys; Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts] there were five hundred boys, twelve, twelve black boys. When I was at UNIVAC [Sperry Rand Corporation; Sperry Corporation] I was also the only black person in the neighborhood. Even in the community where UNIVAC was located Blue Bell [Blue Bell, Pennsylvania], they wouldn't've let me live there for money. So I had developed by then a, an ability to live in that kind of a community. Now that doesn't mean I liked it, it just means that I developed that skill. I understood how to do that, I understood how to not get in arguments with white people that went, "Would you mind telling me what it's like to be black?" The answer was, "Yes I would" (laughter) okay? I, I lost my feeling that I should educate people about race you know (laughter). It's not a problem, so, so the answer to the question is it was fine, but it was not fine just fine, it was fine because I had developed over a fairly long period of time by then some fairly decent ways of looking at the world if you're gonna have to spend a lot of time with white folks (laughter) okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my wife [HistoryMaker Myra McDaniel] and kids [Diane McDaniel Rhodes and Rueben McDaniel III] were able to deal, deal with that and I think in a--I believe in a very healthy way. I think we're all healthy today (laughter) but I don't wanna to make any claims to anything other than the opportunity since I was eleven years old to live in a part of society and do certain kinds of things. That doesn't make it better than anything else or worse than anything else and there's lots of people who say to me, "Well you know you don't do anything for your people." Now, that's an interesting question, but (laughter) yeah, and I don't try to argue with people about it, I mean it--I think that one of the biggest problems in the African American community today is health and if I can do something to improve healthcare in America, I'll be doing a lot more for African Americans than somebody preaching down on the corner, but that's my opinion about the world, it's not the truth (laughter), it's just my opinion about life. So I do what I do and I try to do it well and I try to do it honestly.
Speaker 1: All right so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Is that helpful (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yes, thank you very much.

Speaker 1: So when I was at Baldwin-Wallace [Baldwin-Wallace College; Baldwin Wallace University] it was, Baldwin-Wallace is a little town in Berea, Ohio that--I don't think it's ever seen two black people. It had all kinds of problems at the college that I had to confront and did. I set up a, an experimental learning center there to try to increase the African American enrollment at the college and it was successful. I'm a good administrator; I was good at being able to establish a vision for something to articulate that vision to other people to get them to buy into it.
Speaker 2: There was a statement about the school becoming an upper middle class rich kids school, what was that about?
Speaker 1: Baldwin-Wallace College is a private Methodist college in Ohio for eco- for reasons of higher education economics, it was becoming more and more expensive. A lot people were, particularly from the East Coast would send their children to the Midwest to church related schools (laughter). My daughter [Diane McDaniel Rhodes] came here a virgin and a Methodist, won't talk about how she left, but and the college I think had an honest, and I think I was part of developing it--had an honest attitude of we'd like to be more diverse, we want to have a richer student body in that sense and then I was able to develop a program that helped them do that.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, anything else about that particular school?
Speaker 1: I was, they got--they gave me a wonderful opportunity professionally. I was lucky because the man was--he said, Fred Harris [Fred E. Harris] who hired me said, "I saw your resume on my desk and I said 'I gotta see this man.  He's weird, he doesn't look like any of the other people applying for this job, he doesn't even have a master's degree, he's had this weird education. Why would anybody who's an engineer wanna come work in a--and why would anybody with arrogance think he could do the job and never had any experience at all?'" Then the man had a heart attack (laughter), (unclear) oops and there you are, and you need to be careful not to think you did that (laughter). Now, did I take advantage of it? Yes, but I didn't do it and a lot of people helped including Fred Harris, the other faculty at the college who really worked hard to see to it that I was respected--that students, not all of them but most of them very supportive. African American students who understood the--didn't understand, that's the wrong word, who were willing to deal with the issue of my existence (laughter) and so you know you need to be careful and not think you did anything (laughter).
Story_ID: 515737
Speaker 1: Now tell me, you got your M.S. from the University of Akron [Akron, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right. How did that fit in 'cause--were you still--you were still at the college [Baldwin-Wallace College; Baldwin Wallace University, Berea, Ohio] then?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me how you worked out that in?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, sure. One of the things the college did when I went there it was agreed that I would have time off in the summer to go to school and that I could take classes at night. So I would--Akron's [Akron, Ohio] about forty miles away from Berea [Ohio] and I would drive down there to school one night a week and go to class and then the summer I drove down every day and went to Cleveland [Ohio], and had a really interesting experience there. I was planning on getting my M.B.A. and could have gotten it there, no question about that. My boss Fred Harris [Fred E. Harris] said, "You know you really don't wanna do that, you're not gonna go back to business not as good as you are at this," you know, I said, "Okay." So he said, "I want you to go there and talk to a woman named Mabel Riedinger who is the head of the guidance and counseling program at the University of Akron." I said, "Okay," so I went down to see Mabel. Mabel was an old lady (laughter), fat, pleasant lady with gray hair and she had an office that was about the messiest thing you ever wanna lay your eyes on. Walk in there and you find some place to sit down you're lucky, but she was very positive about my coming and she had talked to Fred. She said, "Okay here are the courses I want you to take this first semester."  So I said, "Okay, they looked a little strange these courses." "Well you can try them, you can try them." Well the long story I could tell you but I'm not drinking so I won't but (laughter) the short story is she decided that I didn't need to take the first year courses. I could just start with the second year courses. So I did and then instead of taking second year courses then I took other classes, social psychology. I took courses in urban sociology. It was so funny, I would go into her office to be advised and I would have a list of courses, good stuff right? She'd go, "Reuben [HistoryMaker Reuben R. McDaniel], that looks so good, that looks--that is wonderful," and she'd take out her little pencil, "maybe instead of this one, take that one." At the end of the session I wouldn't take anything I had on my list. You know I'd take whatever was on her list, but she was right. "Dr.--you got to take Dr. Dovispek [ph.]." Okay, why? I didn't say why 'cause I wasn't stupid, but I thought why. "'Cause he's really smart. He just came down here from Kent State [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio] and he's really smart." Of course the truth of the matter is you should take courses from smart people. It doesn't hardly make any difference what is in the course (laughter), as long as they're smart you can learn from 'em, but after two years I had finished my master's degree and I had a good number of courses that applied for my Ph.D., my Ed.D. and poor Mabel she didn't--she said, "You know you're not ever actually gonna work in a public school" (laughter), and I said, "Well that's right." Said, "You don't need to take this little course, but you do need to take that course." It was a wonderful experience and the teachers were great, the students were great and the teacher she always kind of told the teachers before I arrived in the room you know and they were supposed to give me a hard time, so they did and that meant I learned a lot (laughter), but again see that--we can make mistakes about those kinds of things. Fred Harris knew Mabel and he knew that she would try to do as good for me as she could, and Mabel was very good at getting arrogant, stupid men to listen, (laughter) you know, so she kind of guided me in and I'm pretty smart and I could learn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I had a great time.
Story_ID: 515738
Speaker 1: So where did you go after you finished your master's [degree]?
Speaker 2: I went to Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana], doctorate in education again see just be careful about what you think happens to you. August Everly [ph.] was a friend of Fred Harris [Fred E. Harris], who was this man who hired me. So Fred decided he would invite Everly to Baldwin-Wallace [Baldwin-Wallace College; Baldwin Wallace University, Berea, Ohio] to talk to me. Now see he could've said you go to him. He invited Everly up to talk to me and Everly came and later talked to our faculty and stuff, but he also convinced me that I should go to Indiana and study with him. So I went to Indiana and he was my advisor and I studied with him for two years and learned a lot and (laughter). Some of this sounds like a fairy tale (unclear). One of the things--I didn't know very much about getting a doctor's degree but one thing I did know was that you should really, really go to school with smart people. So I was what was called the university fellow and I knew that, that meant I was smart (laughter), 'cause they told me. They said we're gonna give you this fellowship because you're smart. I said okay I got it, but it was another guy on campus who had the fellowship in my department. His name was Tom West [ph.]. So I said, "Tom, what courses are you taking this semester?" He told me the only course he was taking that I could take was a course on individual behavior in the business school with a guy named Bernie Hinton [Bernard L. Hinton]. I said, "Okay, I'm gonna take that course 'cause I wanna be in class with you." Well I loved the class then I took the sequence to the class from a guy named Joe Reitz [H. Joseph Reitz] in group behavior.
Speaker 1: Then?
Speaker 2: And that's how I ended up at the business school here [Kelley School of Business, Bloomington, Indiana]. It wasn't because I went down and decided I was gonna take all these business courses 'cause I knew Tom was smart and you should go to school with smart people (laughter).
Story_ID: 515739
Speaker 1: I was saying that I took the individual course from Bernie Hinton [Bernard L. Hinton] because Tom West [ph.] was taking it, not because I thought I wanted to be in the business school [Kelley School of Business, Bloomington, Indiana]. In fact my cognate field wasn't even business, my cognate field was counseling and psychology, and then I took Joe Reitz's [H. Joseph Reitz] course because I liked the first one. Joe's one of the best teachers I ever had, really a young man just out of MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], damn he was good, and then I took three other business courses just for the fun of it but I did the same thing over time. I looked for really smart teachers, people who, who had a reputation of being four--not just four wall college professors, except but, but of thinking bigger than and beyond them okay, and then when I ended up interviewing for a job here [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] the dean said, "Well you've already had some business courses." I said, "Oh yeah," (laughter) but it wasn't--and then I (unclear) I--advantages from doing it too. And I had a good time and teachers at Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] were good to me, wasn't particularly good program for what I ended up doing with life, but they didn't intend to teach me what I was doing with my (unclear). They were preparing people to be college administrators and that's what I thought I was going to do. I thought I was going to be a college president, college dean. I never thought I'd be doing what I'm doing. So they were not trying to prepare people to be research scholars. So I had to learn that somewhere.
Speaker 2: And where was that?
Speaker 1: Right here, taught myself.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 515740
Speaker 1: What are some of the research that you have done?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Most of my life and all of my research life I have been pursuing the answer to the same question, which is how do you have institutions which set--organizations with such smart people in 'em that are run so poorly, and the institution which I studied for a long time with universities. So I've done research in universities, how they're run, how they're organized, what things make a difference to them. The other place that I've done a lot, that has been in healthcare (cough) and that was somebody else's heart attack (cough). I was working here and I was doing some consulting for the welfare department [Texas State Department of Public Welfare] and the Medicaid commissioner had a heart attack and they asked me to come and be the acting commissioner, and I didn't know nothing about health care. I knew a lot by the time I was finished at six months but I didn't know--but what the man Chapman, Jerry Chapman's [Jerome Chapman] thought was that I was smart and I could really develop a way to work with the legislature who was getting ready to have a legislative session so it was very important to have somebody who was, who could converse with legislators who could develop arguments and that kind of thing, and in that process I really learned a lot about healthcare (laughter). I learned for example that one reason people go to nursing homes or use to go to nursing homes was because they didn't have any teeth, and they couldn't chew their foods. Now if people can't chew their food because they don't have any teeth you might say, "Well why don't, why don't we get them some teeth?" Well, the answer is it's against the law (laughter). We could buy them teeth but we couldn't prepare their mouth for the teeth. Now I don't know if you have any false teeth, I have a lot of 'em. Let me tell you the mouth takes a lot of preparation. So one of the things that I did was, was to create a little program where in communities where there were people who needed teeth. There would be social agencies that would help them get their mouths prepared then we could buy the teeth, then they didn't have to go to the nursing home. Now, I didn't do that for a thousand people, I may have did it for twenty, but it's still an interesting (unclear) okay. I learned lots and lots of other things about healthcare too.
Speaker 1: What are some of the other things you learned about healthcare?
Speaker 2: Oh lady we could be here talking for two or three weeks, it's what I do for a living, I (unclear) talk about this, but just, just as an example how, how strange the financing system is. How you could ever get to the point where you'd say to somebody, "We won't let Medicare negotiate pharmacy prices," that's stupid, except that when you understand the whole system and the political system you begin to say, okay that's not so surprising, it's still bad policy but it's not so surprising, and when I, when I became a Medicaid commissioner, the State of Texas didn't have any home health program because the nursing home lobby was successfully keeping all the money for themselves, and I helped create a home healthcare program in the State of Texas. Now I'm not trying to make anything out--but there's some people who now are not in nursing homes--oh yeah and were not in nursing homes because we did something to kind of help 'em out, and most people who don't go to nursing homes and could've gone under those other circumstances are pretty grateful about that. They think that's not a bad thing (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well tell me what year was this that you were the Medic- Medicare (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think it was 1979.
Story_ID: 515741
Speaker 1: So you came to the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] in 1972 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seventy-two [1972] and that was after assistant professorship at Florida State [Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida]?
Speaker 1: Florida State.
Speaker 2: Okay and you came to University of Texas as associate dean of students, is that right?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay, so tell me from that point on what happens here, 'cause you stayed here, you've been ever since is that right?
Speaker 1: Um-hm been pretty good to me (laughter). I was associate dean of students for a year, then I became--and I was also an assistant professor of business and then I switched and had three quarters of my time in the business school [College of Business Administration; McCombs School of Business, Austin, Texas] and a quarter of the time in the dean's office and when I was in the associate dean's office I was hired to do some things which I think I accomplished most of it, but among those was to set up the African American and Mexican American student associations. There were no student associations for African Americans or Mexican Americans. Before that I did some things to improve the student orientation program for new students. I set up a volunteer action program so undergraduate students could get volunteer opportunities in the community. I set up a general information program so people could find the--things. We set up a booth in the main building so people could go and say well where's the registrar's office, or how do I get a transcript or when is spring break, or all those kinds of things. So, but that was my job and when I say that was my job I mean the, the man who's the dean of students Jim Duncan [James Duncan] hired me to come here and do that. To set up these programs for--to improve student life, let's say it that way, okay, and then when I went, came to the business school taught, got tenure that's important (laughter) okay, and then became associate dean of the business school. My job title was associate dean for planning and analysis and I really had two different jobs, one was I was in charge of the undergraduate program in the business school. At that time we had about ten thousand students.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Larger than most of the free standing college universities in the United States (laughter) and the other thing was to help in some of the planning for the future of the business school. So I was involved in the planning for this complex. I was involved in planning of a number of curricular kinds of things. I worked with George Kozmetsky, he was the dean at that time, very closely and then left, actually left that job in December of 1978 to go and be the acting deputy commissioner [of the Texas Department of Human Resources; Texas Department of Health and Human Services] in January of 1979 and then when I came back here I was--went back on the faculty, was full time on the faculty.
Story_ID: 515742
Speaker 1: Then I, I did something that was--(pause) I started to say it was weird and it was weird but, I--maybe I just need to describe it. I made a decision--when I came here the College of Business [College of Business Administration; McCombs School of Business, Austin, Texas] was not a major research university essentially. The way you got ahead in the College of Business you were a good teacher and do some consulting, maybe write something every three or four years, but it was not a big competitive research--I don't mean in size, but I mean in intensity, research university, but it became that shortly after I came and I was part of the reason it became, and I decided that I wanted to be a part of that. Now I had not learned to do this in my graduate training, I never--nobody ever taught me how to do this so I was gonna teach myself how to do this. A fellow who was my boss at the time, it was a guy named Jim Dyer, he was chairman of the management department and I went to Jim and talked to him about it and Jim says, "You know Rueben [HistoryMaker Reuben R. McDaniel] that's dumb. You can't do that, people don't do that. If you wanna learn to be a researcher you learn that in graduate school, you have mentors, you develop skills that writing and doing research and stuff," and said, "you know you're really good at what you do. You're a good teacher you know, why don't you just do what you do, you know stop trying to do something you can't do." So I said, "Well Jim, I'd like to try." So the thing about Jim Dyer was that he was very honest in saying he didn't think I could do but he supported my effort to try. He didn't say because I don't think you can do it I won't help you, okay? So he helped and I actually spent a summer in California teaching at Claremont college [Claremont Graduate School and University Center; Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, California], but living in an apartment and learning an awful lot about a whole lot of stuff (laughter). I then got a quarter of a million dollar grant from the welfare department [Texas State Department of Public Welfare] to do some--a major studies in, in an area called problem formulation and Jim actually worked on the grant with me, and learned to be a researcher. I'm not a world class researcher, I'm good, but I'm not a world class researcher, not by any stretch of the imagination. I, I can show you some work people do around here (laughter) that really is world class, but I'm not bad you know. I don't have to be ashamed of it at all and I think my colleagues have over the years evaluated my work such that I can confidently say that they think I'm pretty good at it too, okay, but I learned how to do it, I learned statistics, I learned research design and I'm, and, and my originally what almost all the work I did was in this area of problem formulation. Let me say there are a number of ways more like English--how do people decide what problems they're going to work on? It turns out that that's a very, very difficult question. It is a very difficult question to decide. How does the CEO of Ford [Ford Motor Company] decide what problems he's gonna work on, or how does the manager at a McDonald's decide what, what is he gonna do, how's he work out problems? And so I did a lot of work in that area, published some things in that area and then I became really interested in the healthcare area and began to do research in that area, a lot of research in hospitals and one of the things that I had discovered in the, in the course of my career, is that one reason why organizations with lots of smart people are poorly managed is that smart people will not work on easy problems. So that means when you have an organization with lots of smart people, either the problems are hard in their nature or the smart people will make them hard (laughter), sometimes creating all kinds of shit that does not need to be created, but the issue is that they're not gonna be satisfied if the systems are routine, easy, if the information is routine. I wrote a book with a guy named Ken Knight on information systems of the firm ['Organizations: An Information Systems Perspective,' Kenneth E. Knight and Reuben R. McDaniel, Jr.] about that, but so that was one kind of thing but it related to that is that when professionals, they happen to be the smart people in many organizations, participate in decision making in the organization, then the organization does better than when they don't participate. Now, so I've done a whole bunch of research on participation and decision making in hospitals and in nursing homes. That research is--a lot of it has been published and I, I began to work with a woman whose name is Ruth Anderson [Ruth A. Anderson] who's now do- but she was active PCT [patient care technician] student in the School of Nursing in nursing home management, and we've done a lot of what other people think is very good stuff in that area. So that's about what I do (laughter).
Story_ID: 515743
Speaker 1: Now in 2007, okay, the thing that I do is I studied the, the management of healthcare delivery systems from the standpoint of complexity science. Now it's two, two parts to that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't study insurance companies, I don't study government policy, I don't study financing of healthcare. What I study is how healthcare is delivered to people. So I'm interested in the organization that puts their hand on your body (laughter) okay, not, not I' not arguing about the others. It's just what I know a lot about, so family practices, specialty practices, hospitals, nursing homes, places where they actually, as I say, kill people (laughter). Now, the other thing I do is something that I'm getting to be fairly well known for is that I have learned lot about complexity science. I'll say in a moment what that is, how it applies to help us understand better how to manage healthcare delivery systems. Complexity science is lots, I mean it's really a complicated thing to explain, but I can give you an explanation, it's very straightforward.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Most science is about how simple things create simple things or how complicated things create complicated things. Complexity science is about how simple things can create complicated things.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In general that's under the rubric of chaos theory. It is also about how complicated things can create simple things, and that under the rubric of complexity theory. So let me see what I mean by it. First, a simple thing creating a complicated thing--a manager goes in and says something to a worker and the next thing you know there's a strike, and the manager goes, "What happened?" Okay, or somebody gets a round tube of plastic and their daughter swings it around their hips and the next thing you know you have hula hoops, and you've got hula hoop contests all over the United States. You've got men, women, old men and women stupidly standing around twisting and you've got Rueben McDaniel [HistoryMaker Reuben R. McDaniel] driving his son [Reuben McDaniel III] to Dallas [Texas] to compete in the state hula hoop contest. In the heat in the summertime that was really stupid (laughter), but that's a complicated thing that comes out of a very simple thing and that, that is, that's a very sophisticated way of analyzing those issues. Now a simple thing out of a complicated thing--okay. The best way to think of it is how do you get order in a system where you would not expect to have any order. So how do things become orderly in a system where, well why would you expect that it would become orderly? Let's take an example. If you go into an elementary school it doesn't take you long to figure out it's a pretty complex thing. Lots of children, all ages, mothers and fathers doing this, that and the others, teachers young, old and in between, principals smart and stupid, but somehow or the other out of that emerges order. (Makes noise) Kids go to their rooms, they study curriculum, they learn to read often. So how do you get order out of a--that kind of a complicated thing? So that's what complexity--complexity science is about a lot of other things, but it's about those two things primarily.
Story_ID: 515744
Speaker 1: And you can use the, the insights from complexity science to un- to get a better understanding of how healthcare works. Specific example: one of the things complexity science teaches you is that the interdependencies among the people in the organization are very important, but most of the time we don't pay any attention to that at all. So let's say you have a doctor's office, a family practice. So what do you pay attention to if you want it to be better? Well you get a better doctor, get a better nurse, you get better rules. Let's call those treatment guidelines but it's also true that high quality family practices look like jazz groups where the interdependencies between the people in the practice, not just the patient but within it--it's like a jazz group. Now I don't know what you know about jazz? Do you know a lot about jazz?
Speaker 2: Oh I think so, not a lot but I know about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Here's just a couple of quick things. In a good jazz group everybody gets a turn. Wynton Marsalis says one of the things you learn about--in jazz is how to listen. In jazz there's no such thing as I played a bad note; it is I could not do anything with the note that was played (laughter). Those are all relationship issues, so if myself and some colleagues have in fact published a paper on practice jazz ['Practice Jazz: Understanding Variation in Family Practice Using Complexity Science']. Helping people to see that high quality family practices are like jazz groups and I'm actually working on an extension of that paper with a woman in New Jersey right now. So complexity science causes us to think hard about the relationship systems in the practices, not that we think you need to have dumb doctors, not that we think you need to have nice nurses, but it turns out that the way in which they interdepend is more important than their individual characteristics. Order emerges from the interdependencies among diverse agents who learn this. Somebody could prove that up for you if you wanted it, but so if that's a true statement and I want order in that family practice, then I've got to think about how am I gonna manage diversity, learning and interdependencies. I just spent a summer working on a fairly interesting project on just that very problem.  Is that helpful?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's what I do for a living (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We understand, so now we understand complexity science.
Speaker 1: No you got a beginning, I think that's--hopefully that will help you think about it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Yes.
Story_ID: 515745
Speaker 1: We jumped to 2007 but I wanted to talk a little bit about--
Speaker 2: I've been doing that since about 1996.
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-six [1996].
Speaker 2: It's been about a decade now that I've been working on that problem.
Speaker 1: Okay, I wanted to talk about Helsinki because you said that was a place that you'd like to go back to and you spent summers there. Tell me about that?
Speaker 2: The Helsinki School of Economics [Helsinki School of Economics and Business Administration; Aalto University School of Business, Helsinki, Finland] has an international M.B.A. program and they hire professors from all around the world to come and teach the courses that they normally teach. In this program they're in Helsinki, Finland and I was chosen by them to come and teach. Depends on who you believe as to what the criteria was probably 'cause I would go when they needed me, but, but at any rate I liked it and they liked me. Helsinki's a wonderful town. You ever been?
Speaker 1: No, I have not.
Speaker 2: The first thing is they just have wonderful beer, just really good beer god, Jesus, and good people. The people say things like you know Finns won't talk. Not true.  All you gotta do is give 'em a chance, they'll talk your head off and I had a great time teaching there. I taught there I think for ten summers. I taught both in their regular M.B.A. program and did some teaching in their executive M.B.A. program which--for executives. Got to meet lots of people, students who were very warm and open and, and Helsinki also has wonderful food. I mean nobody ever said anything to me about Helsinki having good food but it does have wonderful food. So.
Question: what's your favorite food there?
Speaker 2: My favorite food in Helsinki is salmon, made by a good friend of mine whose name is Lena and she and her husband Utzee have me--every time I come to Helsinki they have me out to their house where Lena fixes me some salmon. It's Lena Maslin [ph.] and Utzee Maslin [ph.], two, three, four kids and one of 'em just been here not too long ago, but that's a--that dinner is wonderful. She cooks up that dinner, it's good and I don't even like fish (laughter), but Helsinki was the first place I ever was abroad other than go to Mexico and Canada and it's interesting the first place you ever get off an airplane is in Helsinki, Finland (laughter) yes indeedy, but I was lucky because it wasn't Paris [France] and it wasn't Berlin [Germany] and it wasn't London [England] and I was--went there to work, and I went there to work at something that I know how to do pretty well, and which they wanted me to do and where I had a lot to learn and a lot to give and I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Any extracurricular activities there while you were there?
Speaker 2: Other than eating and drinking?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: No that's about it.
Speaker 1: That's it huh, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I need to say a couple of more things. All kinds of interesting things happened while I was there. There is in Helsinki a Church of the Rock [Temppeliaukio Church].  It's a church that's actually been carved out of a rock. It's very beautiful, very peaceful, a wonderful place to go. Every time I'm in Helsinki, I go and meditate, sit there, enjoy, lightly, and one day I was there and lo and behold rehearsing was the national choir from Estonia, and that choir was absolutely unbelievable plus that church has a humongous acoustical system. I'd heard string quartets play there and flutists play there so I knew about the acoustics, but I mean those voices. So they were rehearsing and I sat there through the rehearsal and I figured out that they were gonna give a concert that night so I stayed around the church 'til the concert and it was just the most, wonderful, wonderful experience to hear that music and that place. So yeah, I mean lots of young, lots of nice experiences like that in Helsinki.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's--
Speaker 2: I bought my wife [HistoryMaker Myra McDaniel] some nice jewelry, beautiful jewelry in Helsinki.
Story_ID: 515746
Speaker 1: Wonderful kids [Diane McDaniel Rhodes and Reuben McDaniel III] they're good, they're good to me and as you probably have gathered my wife [HistoryMaker Myra McDaniel] and I get along very well, very supportive of each other. We've both had two careers so we're a four career family. We have no information about how to manage a two career family (laughter). I think we have--admire each other and support each other. The thing we haven't talked about are my students [at the University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas]. I think that, that I've been really, really lucky at almost every level. I've had tremendous undergraduate students. I, I haven't taught undergraduate for ten, twelve years but I still get Christmas cards from them, they stop by. I've had them bring their children here and saying that my daughter is coming here to school next year and I've told her she got to come to see you and. I teach M.B.A.'s now and I've taught a lot of M.B.A.'s during my career. I have been doing all kinds of things, just recently I've graduated an M.B.A. named Tom Archibald [ph.], he's the president of a medical supply company in Detroit, Michigan. He comes down here and gets advice every once in a while still, claims I taught him something, and the M.B.A.'s have selected me many times on their teaching honor roll, but my Ph.D. students have just been absolutely fabulous. I would not even be close to success--as successful as I am without them. Much of the work that I've published I've published with them, and I've--some very good ones I've--Jim Thomas [James Thomas] is presently the dean of the business school [Smeal College of Business] at Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] and prior to that he was the dean of the school of information [College of Information Sciences and Technology] at Penn State. Donde Ashmos [Donde Ashmos Plowman] is going now to be full professor of management at the University of Tennessee [Knoxville, Tennessee]. Ruth Anderson [Ruth A. Anderson] is full professor of nursing at Duke University [Durham, North Carolina], university is successful, but I've written with--I'm still writing and doing reactively doing research with Ruth. Right now I'm not actively doing any research with Donde and Jim--Cindy [ph.], but in fact before you came in the door I was working on a paper with Sanim Gunae [ph.] who's recently graduated and is now at the State University of New York at Albany [Albany, New York]. It's awfully cold today, it was one degree, Larry Fulton [Lawrence Fulton] is a lieutenant colonel in the [U.S.] Army and he--yesterday I worked on a paper with him on the use of mathematical programming for the sighting of Army medical centers, so I'm presently involved with 'em. Holly Lanham who's my present Ph.D. student has been very good to me and she and I right now have had one paper published a major research presentation done. So my students have really, really been good. I think I work 'em hard (laughter), they seem to say I'm a damn slave driver (laughter), I know I am. African Americans know something about driving slaves, but that I think has been a major contributor to any success that I've had. The, the Ph.D. students are more visible because they show up on my vitae [curriculum vitae], they're the ones I published with Ashmos, Anderson and McDaniel [HistoryMaker Reuben R. McDaniel], and (unclear) you can just count them off, but the undergraduates again very good. I love teaching 'em. I stopped teaching 'em at the request of the dean because he needed me to teach M.B.A. electives, not because I didn't like it or wasn't doing it well, doing it very well and then I get awards from 'em all the time (laughter). I had a wonderful thing happen today. I got an email from a student, he sent the email to my class. I teach my class 8:00 to 9:15 on Mondays and Wednesdays and he sent the email to the class and said that he wanted the class to meet at 7:30 tomorrow morning to continue the discussion we had in class last Monday on their own time (laughter).  Now it will be interesting to see who shows up. I don't have ideas, but just the thought that one student even would think that it would be worthwhile to ask if you all wouldn't mind coming in at 7:30 in the morning to discuss some of the issues we were talking about in class on Monday. Now, I'm debating, I asked Holly, my Ph.D. student, whether I ought to send that to the dean as evidence that I make--earn my living here. I haven't decided yet whether I'm gonna do that. I like to show off occasionally.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).

Speaker 1: Is there something that you have not done in your lifetime that you think that you still want to do?
Speaker 2: No, (laughter) not the way you asked the question.  There're things I have not done in my lifetime that I wish I had done but there's nothing that I still want to do (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Like I, I wish that I had put some energy into and been successful, I don't know if I would've been successful at publishing in some higher quality journals, not necessarily a lot. I have some stuff published in that but I could have done more of that. So when I think about it the way I've spent my time I'm happy with it. I've spent a lot of my time in administration. I spent a lot of my time as chairman of the faculty of the university [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], but those things detract from the amount of time and energy you can put to really, really high quality research. I may still achieve that, I don't mean to imply that I haven't done good stuff and I'm not gonna try it, I mean it isn't something which I'm sitting here going well I think I'll try that next week, (laughter) that's the least (unclear) business we can do, but you know as I look back and I look around I can say okay, that's something you'd like to have done. In some ways I wish I'd spent--been able to spend more time with my extended family, but I live in Texas and they all live on the East Coast, so, so that was not something that was doable; I can't just drive over and see my cousins, they're not driveable okay, so sometimes I wish that I had been physically closer to Ernest [ph.] and we'd spent more time drinking--I'm not sure if I'd lived right there in South Carolina with him if I'd have seen him anymore but if you ask the question it's something (unclear), but I don't plan to make any effort to do that now, particularly, I measured the front door of my house, I can get a casket out. I'm planning to die right there (laughter) so, I'm not gonna do that kind of thing now.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I've, I've been pretty lucky, I've had a good run and one of the things I say to people that sometimes they don't think I don't mean but actually I do mean. You know I say to people, "You know I'm, I'm sorry that I messed it up. I'm glad you young people are so smart and good luck," (laughter) you know. I've had a good run, I've done some good things, I don't feel a need to be in charge any more, never felt a real need to be in charge but I, I was a big man on campus for many years. I gave it up because I wanted to give it up because I thought you've done it enough, it's time to let somebody else do it. Nobody ran me off, I didn't feel really--I felt very appreciated and I've been given some significant recognition by the university for the things I've done, but I'm having a good time doing what I do now and I'm at peace with it.
Story_ID: 515748
Speaker 1: Because this information will be available for future generations, is there a message you would send to the future generations?
Speaker 2: You mean other than I'm glad you're smarter than I am (laughter)? I, I do understand your question and I've thought about it a good bit and I'm gonna go back to what I said to you--actually the very beginning here and that is I really would send a message to learn as if the world would never ending be. Don't ever stop learning, don't ever--never let a day go by that you are not learning about things. The world is exciting and it's changing and there are people who are, will just shock you with what they can contribute to you, but live as if the world was gonna end right now (laughter), don't, don't live for tomorrow, don't, don't say today, I did something today. I, a man, man who had been dean here at the business school [College of Business Administration; McCombs School of Business, Austin, Texas], Bob May [Robert May]. I took him to lunch and to tell him that I thought he was the best dean we'd ever had here. I just don't want to put that off, you know once I began to understand it and think about it, said okay gotta do that because you might die. It'd be a damn shame you die and not tell him that (laughter), okay. Don't, don't wait to be kind to somebody (laughter), you know it's not gonna. Don't, don't wait until you retire before you do something that you wanna do. I'm not saying you shouldn't retire, of course you should--I'm gonna retire when I get tired and get bored, but the point is I'm not, I'm not sitting here going well you know when I retire I'm gonna read a book.  Well I'd buy the book right now (laughter). I'd buy it right this minute (laughter), and I may or may not get to read it but that'll just be because I don't have time but you know so I really do think that that's what I would say to people and to young people, old people too for that matter. This question of learning is something that we under value (laughter) and I think I know why we under value it but we do, but it's the most valuable thing you can get. Nobody can take that away from you, no, no president of the United States who decides to go to war in Iraq can take away what you have learned. Now, I didn't say he [President George Walker Bush] wouldn't kill you over in Iraq. I didn't say that 'cause he might (laughter) and it looks like he will if he has his way, but, but he can't take away what you've learned and what you've learned today may change what you think about yesterday. That's okay, and don't learn so you'll have your mind made up forever, but it's the approach that--from that point of view, and, and not from the point of view of well I wanna know everything, I wanna be the smartest guy in the block, richest man in the block and take away your money and have nothing, but he can't take away what you've learned and if you just decide, 'cause this is how I wanna live today. I don't know how I want to live tomorrow, I don't know the answer to that question, but I do know how I wanna live today and I can do that, I don't have to wait for that. So that's what I'd tell 'em--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --if I just get that kind of choice (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well you have the choice to tell 'em that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And so you gave it to me.
Story_ID: 515749
Speaker 1: How do you want people to remember you?
Speaker 2: (Pause) That's an interesting question whether I want them to remember me at all (laughter), and I don't, I don't say that facetiously. I want people to live their lives to be energetic about what they're doing to, to look ahead, but I would like for the students that I've had to remember me as somebody who transformed their lives, who made their lives different. Maybe it's different because they--maybe it's different because they didn't know an African American could be smart. I've actually had a student tell me that (laughter) right here at the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas]. I didn't know you all had any smart people in your group. Really, but more likely it's gonna be because I--maybe I've thought about the world differently, I think about healthcare differently so I'd like for my students to think of me that way. I'd like other folks to think of me as somebody who enjoyed life and my students too for that matter. Somebody who enjoyed life, tried to take care of folks, love folks, did the best I know how, died with a smile. That really is what I want, I mean (laughter), that's about it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
