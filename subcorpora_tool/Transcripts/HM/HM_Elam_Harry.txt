Speaker 1: Early on in these interviews before we get into your career and your family history, we have a few warm-up questions.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: People magazine type questions.  It will also give the viewers of your interview another dimension of your personality, and so I'd like to ask you first of all, Judge, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food (laughter) that's a good question.  I have a lot of favorite foods but I think lobster, far as fish is concerned and I'm going to have to stay away from certain things, but I love fried chicken and my wife [Barbara Clark Elam] now fix it rather than frying in the pan, fries it in the oven, oven fried chicken which is very tasty so.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of year is I would say the spring when these days you don't seem to get too much spring in the New England area, so we seem to go from winter directly into summer, but spring has always been my favorite time of the year.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color, blue.  I like the color blue.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite vacation destination or one that you used a lot in the past?
Speaker 2: Well you know actually Cape Cod [Massachusetts] was always a favorite vacation destination for me and my family going back to the early years and I remember honeymooning on Cape Cod fifty-five years ago when Hyannis [Massachusetts], when Hyannis was--hadn't been developed at all and so that, that still even though I live close to the heart of Cape Cod now I--that's always been a great vacation spot.  Other than that the Caribbean Islands, I've visited several of them.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last warm-up question, do you have a favorite kind of philosophical saying or phrase that you use, that you repeat to yourself sometimes or that you share with others?
Speaker 2: Well, that, that's a good question I have to think about that.  At the top of my, right off the top of my head I can't think of any one particular phrase but I--I'm sure that--
Speaker 1: It will may, something may come out as we talk (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right, fine.
Speaker 1: Through the afternoon I'm sure.
Story_ID: 300075
Speaker 1: Would you very briefly title, describe your profession?  What were you, what are you now?  What are your overall professional accomplishments very briefly?  We'll do the depth later, but I just wanna get a sense of--
Speaker 2: Well the law has been my interest and profession for over fifty years now and I practiced law for close to twenty years in the Roxbury section of Boston [Massachusetts] and was fortunate enough to serve as a member of the judiciary for close to twenty years and in retirement I still do a little work in the area of the law, arbitration and mediation and that's been my life pretty much for I'd say for over fifty years now, and even though I'm an octogenarian and I'm not called upon as much to do arbitration and mediation, they feel that maybe this judge is a little too old but in any event I'm available and I do, I handle other legal work like the probate, probate of estates and real estate transactions, nothing that will take me into court.  I don't try cases anymore.
Story_ID: 300076
Speaker 1: We're going to really begin by exploring your family background so that those who look at your interview over time will have a context and a backdrop to understanding your growing up years and your development as a lawyer and as a judge and so on, and so we're gonna start with your mother, would you give me your mother's name and when she was born and where?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was--full name was Blanche Delnora [ph.] Lee before she married my father [Robert Elam] and she was born in Aiken, South Carolina and I believe the year was 1899.
Speaker 1: What do you know about her growing up years in Aiken, did she talk with you about her childhood?
Speaker 2: Yes, the family was poor growing up in, instead of farm--the farming section of Aiken I think their father was a farmer and she used to work in the fields with the family members and she had one sister and six brothers.  They all grew up, but they moved at during--then she went as far as the eighth grade and right after the eighth grade the family moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts and that's where my mother met my father in Cambridge, so that her early years in Aiken were limited I would say up to her teenage years.
Speaker 1: Why did the family move to Cambridge?  Did she ever talk about why they moved and?
Speaker 2: Well they were looking for--my--I know my grandfather and grandmother wanted a better life for their children.  They thought that moving north they would find it, and then how they decided upon Cambridge I don't really know, but that's where they moved.
Speaker 1: What do you know about your mother's mother, your maternal grandmother?  Do you know her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Henrietta, Henrietta Frasier [Henrietta Frasier Lee] was her was her maiden name and my best recollection of her was as a little boy, she was blind and she had a diabetic condition that caused her blindness and she also had lost a leg--had been amputated as a result of the diabetic condition and I remember her as being a very straightforward woman and really seemed to love her grandchildren, to have them around.
Speaker 1: And what about your mother's father, what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Sherman Justin Lee and I remember him as being a very dapper dresser, and he was a chauffeur for many years for some well-to-do families, white families in the area and I remember he use to bring the car home on occasions, a very big Packard Sedan that he drove.
Speaker 1: Now did they also live in Mass [Massachusetts] or were still in the South during this time?
Speaker 2: No they were living, they were living in Massachusetts at the time that I knew what it is on Western Avenue in Cambridge.
Story_ID: 300077
Speaker 1: What are some of the other stories that you recall your mother [Blanche Lee Elam] sharing with you about her growing up years, anything stand out (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well she talked about their wedding, my father [Robert Elam] and mother's wedding, and I remember the date March 10, 1920 and they were married in the--the family at that time were living in a home on Worcester Street, I think it was No. 9 Worcester Street in Cambridge [Massachusetts] and the wedding took place as I say at the family home and the minister was the Reverend E.E. Thompson, the pastor of the Mass Avenue Baptist Church [Massachusetts Avenue Baptist Church, Cambridge, Massachusetts], the church they attended and right after the ceremony the reception was held, and in the living room people were dancing and all of a sudden the floor gave way, but it didn't go all the way down and the reason why it didn't was that my [maternal] grandfather [Sherman Lee] over the years collected a lot of wood for to burn in the stoves and the wood was piled so high that the top of it almost reached the bottom of the floor.  So when the floor gave in, it rested on the wood, otherwise folk would've been hurt, but nobody was hurt and the party continued in the dining room, but I always remember that story about the floor, the living room floor caving in and what saved everybody was the pile of wood in the basement.
Speaker 1: Did your mother have an occupation or work?
Speaker 2: My mother was a, she worked in--as a homemaker and for families in the community and, but for the most part she at home and she would do this on occasion, maybe two or three days a week she would go out to work for in the homes of well-to-do white families which many black women did in those days.
Speaker 1: Right, how do you remember your mother as a person, her personality, what was she like?
Speaker 2: My mother was for her lack of a real long formal education, as I said she went as far as the eighth grade was a very wise and astute person and really did a lot to, to get us on the right path as children and was very conscious of and always wanted us to have a good education and was determined that each of her children would do better than, than she was able to do as far as education was concerned and was very much concerned about the fact that this is what she wanted for us and was determined that somehow we would, would get certainly a much better education than she did and we all did, but she was very determined that, that would happen.
Speaker 1: We're going to talk about your formal education in a little bit from elementary through law school, but were there any kind of lessons that you remember that she taught you at home that were kind of academic?  Did she get you started before you went to school on learning tasks or?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, she wanted her children, when we attended school that we behaved ourselves, we didn't--pay attention to the teacher and I think we all tried to do our best to do to follow mother's directions and instructions, and I remember in kindergarten [Houghton School; Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] I use to have nosebleeds on a sort of a regular basis and it was always a young girl in the kindergarten who would bring an extra handkerchief for me to make sure that I, when I had a nosebleed (laughter) that she had a handkerchief and her name was Deloise [ph.] and this goes back many, many years but I remember that quite clearly from my early educational days.

Speaker 1: Tell me about your father, would you give me his full name and the year he was born and where he was born?

Speaker 1: Where is Chase City?
Speaker 2: Chase City is in the southern part of Virginia, near the tip--near, near North Carolina near the border.
Speaker 1: And where did he grow up, in Chase?
Speaker 2: He grew up in Chase for the most part but he became fifteen he said his--he only went as far as the fifth grade and went to work early in the fields but he--his older brothers had gone earlier to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to work in the steel mills, and he as a teenager he joined them I think, two older brothers Jack [Elam (ph.)] and Walter [Elam (ph.)] and he went to live with the two older brothers in Pittsburgh as a teenager.  They worked at the steel mills until World War II started and then went into the [U.S. military] service in World War II.
Speaker 1: So he went in the service in World War II?
Speaker 2: World War I [WWI], I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: World War I, you were World War II.
Speaker 2: I get my wars straightened out yeah, World War I, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Before he went to Pittsburgh did he share any stories with you about his childhood years in Chase City?
Speaker 2: That I remember he had, his father [Creed Elam], his mother [Nanny Elam (ph.)] rather had died early and his father had to remarry and the one of the children by the second marriage was named Dewey [Elam] and Dewey was closer in age than his older brothers and they got along just well--he talked about Dewey a lot and more so than he did about some of the other brothers because they pretty much in the--around the same age Dewey's a little younger.
Speaker 1: Let's go to Pittsburgh and the steel mills, any other stories or things that he shared with you about, about that big change (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well he talked about working in the steel mills, how hot it was and that he had to sort of raise his age in order to, to get a job and that he worked I think about two or three years in the steel mills and at that time the money that they made was considered good pay; he was making good money.
Speaker 1: How much were they making, any idea?
Speaker 2: I've forgotten now what it was but--
Speaker 1: What did he do exactly, do you know what his job was, or jobs?
Speaker 2: I honestly don't remember exactly what it was, but it was probably labor, general labor in the steel mills.
Story_ID: 300079
Speaker 1: How long did he [Elam's father, Robert Elam] remain in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: He remained in Pittsburgh until--he went there when he was about fifteen until he was about eighteen and then joined, enlisted in the [U.S. military] service at the beginning of World War I [WWI], and went overseas and I remember him talking about serving in France and the good times that he had when they  had, when they had--were off duty and he, he--I'd forgotten the type of outfit that he was in to be perfectly honest with you, but I think it was probably one of these heavy battalion construction battalions, quartermaster outfits that you found in those days that most of--they didn't use the colored soldiers, as they called 'em on the front lines, but he talked mostly about the experience of visiting Paris [France] and enjoying that time and in--when he was overseas.
Speaker 1: Once he finished his military service, the war was over, what was next for your father?
Speaker 2: Well that's when he came back to Massachusetts and to Cambridge [Massachusetts] as a matter of fact and began working in an automobile repair shop.  He liked automobiles and as I say he didn't have more than a fifth grade education, but somehow he had a knack for working and fixing automobiles and became quite skilled at it, and at one point opened his own auto repair shop and he had--at one of the nicest locations on the corner of Memorial Drive and Western Avenue and this was in around the middle '20s [1920s], '20 [1920], '26 [1926], but in 1929 along came the crash and my father was just wiped out--his business.  The only thing that I can recall him saying that he was able to retain was a 1926 Hudson automobile that belonged to one of his clients who wasn't able to pay for it, so he had an automobile.  He didn't own one himself but he--this now became his and I remember moving to--from Boston [Massachusetts] to Cambridge, Cambridge to Boston 1930 we still had that same old automobile a '26 [1926] Hudson.
Story_ID: 300080
Speaker 1: Now when did he [Elam's father, Robert Elam] marry your mother [Blanche Lee Elam] (unclear)?
Speaker 2: They married in 1920.
Speaker 1: Nineteen twenty [1920], okay, okay and they met in Cambridge [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: They married in Cambridge and that's why I said he had--evidently when he came, before they married, and married he began working in a repair shop and this is when he learned the trade and subsequent to their marriage he began--opened his own business.
Speaker 1: How do you remember your father, personality wise?  What was he like as a person, how do (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was a very strict person as I remember and we boys would have to toe the line with dad and particularly when he was around we didn't want to upset him and if we ever did anything wrong during the day while he was away, word got--mother would let dad know and dad I remember would get out his strap and take us into a closet where he would give us a good lickin', and I remember (laughter)--so he, he was very strict and we really didn't form a good relationship with our father, we boys until we were older, but we didn't.
Speaker 1: What do you know about his parentage, his mother and father?
Speaker 2: Very little because he never talked too much.  He talked about his father's name was Creed and his mother was Lucy [Elam] and Nanny [Elam (ph.)] rather, Lucy was his stepmother and, but.
Speaker 1: Not much about?
Speaker 2: I know his father was a farmer.
Speaker 1: Creed, so Creed Elam?
Speaker 2: Creed, Creed Elam, yeah and he use to work in the fields with his father, he talked about that before he went to join his brothers in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], but I remember very little about the--my father and his parents to be honest with you, but.
Speaker 1: What do you know about the origin of your family name Elam?  What do you think?
Speaker 2: Well I know it's a biblical name, the Land of Elam was formerly Persia and it's referred to in the Bible in a number of places, the land of Elam, and so that's where its origin is, it's biblical and the Elamites, were the people who lived in the land of Elam--were referred to as Elamites.
Story_ID: 300081
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the children of Blanche [Lee Elam] and Robert Elam.  You were born in 1922, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes I was,
Speaker 1: --you have a brother before, but tell us about your brothers and sisters, what are their names, when they were born and what they're doing now, or what they did do?
Speaker 2: My oldest brother, Charles [Elam] was born December 9, 1920.  I use to kid my mother, later years mother and father said you folks didn't waste any time.  You got married on March 10th and almost nine months to the day, Charles was born, and Charles went on to--he didn't--he finished high school but he didn't go on to college, he worked in the Public Works Department in the City of Boston [Massachusetts] for many years and he was married he went into the [U.S. military] service.  We all went into World War II [WWII] around the same time and he married after coming out of the service and had seven children, and Charles died in 1998 I believe.  And then I had a younger brother, Clarence [Elam].  Clarence was born October 3, 1923 and Clarence went on to not only finish high school, but he graduated from Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] and went to the law school [Boston University School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts], went to law school late, but he was always interested in politics and became in politics--became involved in politics earlier on with former Mayor [John B.] Hynes and then he became involved with Christian Herter when he ran for governor back in the early '50s [1950s] and when Herter was elected governor, Clarence was named to his staff as the executive secretary of the governor's council and later Herter appointed Clarence chairman of the Boston Licensing Board which was the board that licensed all liquor establishments in the City of Boston and he that job for many years, and Clarence died--he got married and had a family, three children, but he died early, so he died twenty years ago, 1985.  Then there was a sister, Anetta [Anetta Elam Capdeville] who was born May 29, 1925 and Anetta was, we called her the heart of the Elam family, the soul of the Elam family.  She loved to sing and to write poetry and had a beautiful voice and she went to Emerson College [Boston, Massachusetts] and just was a beautiful person, she's--she just loved to sing in the church, was lead singer in the church choir, St. Mark Church [St. Mark Congregational Church; St. Mark Congregational Church United Church of Christ, Dorchester, Massachusetts] choir and sang at funerals and weddings and you name it and she married and a chap by the name of Thomas Jones and she had two children by Mr. Jones, two girls and later they divorced and she married a second time to an Andrew Capdeville and they moved to Denver, Colorado some years ago and he--she, that's when she became ill and was in a nursing home and then Andrew died and his sister who had brought them out to Denver, she also died and Anetta was in the nursing home with no family and a daughter and who lived in the State of Washington went to work and brought her to the State of Washington and she's now living in an in a nursing home there.  Her daughter, her oldest daughter, and as I think I may have indicated to you earlier celebrated her eightieth birthday earlier this year and we just had a wonderful time visiting with her at that time, and then I have another sister, Harriet [Harriet Elam-Thomas] who was born sixteen years after Anetta and who was twenty years younger than I am.
Story_ID: 300082
Speaker 1: And Harriet [Harriet Elam-Thomas] is really the jewel of the family.  She's the youngest and Harriet went on to finish high school, Roxbury High School [Roxbury Memorial High School, Boston, Massachusetts] with honors and then Simmons College [Boston, Massachusetts] and after graduating Simmons College she headed to the [U.S.] Foreign Service and remained in the Foreign Service for some forty-two years and traveled all over the world to various countries, Greece and Turkey and France and the Ivory Coast and spoke the language. She learned Greek and Turkish and French and, and we--my wife [Barbara Clark Elam] and I were very fortunate over the years to visit her at her various posts and the red carpet was always laid out for us.  Harriet was loved dearly by her co- all of the countries where she worked and in 19--just before she, I guess it was 1990--about five years ago, 1996, 1999 she was appointed by--for then President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] to be the ambassador, the United States ambassador to the Republic of Senegal which is a country on the eastern coast of Africa and she served there for three years and sort of winding down her career and came back to the United States and is now serving as a diplomat in residence at the University of Central Florida in Orlando [Florida] and after two years there she's now officially retiring in October 1st, but the University of Central Florida wants her to come back.  They are establishing a center in international studies and want Harriet, they want Harriet to head that department up at--so we look forward to her continuing her work in the foreign, in the field of the foreign relations.
Story_ID: 299877
Speaker 1: Judge Elam [HistoryMaker Harry Elam] tell me a little about the neighborhood of Cambridge [Massachusetts] where you and Charles [Elam] and Clarence [Elam] and Annette [Annette Elam Capdeville] grew up initially, what was that--where did you live and what was your neighborhood like, who were the neighbors?
Speaker 2: We lived in an area of Cambridge that was called the Coast; that was the nickname that was given to it.  Western Avenue, River Street just below Central Square in Cambridge where the predominately black section of Cambridge is--we lived--for the time that we were there and then we--I remember our moving several times living on Putnam Avenue and River Street, Pleasant Street and not knowing at the time why we were moving so much but it was during the [Great] Depression and it was difficult to keep up with the rent and so we'd find ourselves moving later (unclear)--we had to move to find a place that we could afford and we usually would move to a three-decker apartment building wooden-frame three-decker and usually it was a third floor and then when we moved from Cambridge to Boston [Massachusetts] it was to another three-decker on the third floor, but growing up in Cambridge was as I say was right in an area near Central Square and I remember playground, the Hoyt Playground [Russell Hoyt Playground, Cambridge, Massachusetts] which is fairly close to where we lived and where most of the activity, we'd play ball, football and baseball and most of our activities were there at the Hoyt Playground in Cambridge I remember clearly.
Story_ID: 299878
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory, your farthest back memory of growing up as a child in Cambridge [Massachusetts]?  How far back can you remember?
Speaker 2: I can remember back I think I mentioned to you my [maternal] grandmother [Henrietta Frasier Lee] having lost a leg and being blind.  She died shortly after, and in those days they would bring the casket into the family home in the living room and I can remember looking at the casket and my grandmother laid out in the living room.  I would say I wasn't probably more than four or five years old at the time and that, and I remember she had seemed to have suffered so and as I remember her earlier on being blind and losing a leg and I sort of felt (unclear) some peace will come to her now looking at her in the casket.
Story_ID: 299879
Speaker 1: Any other very early childhood memories that stand out in your mind?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: Any other early childhood memories far, far back that you remember?
Speaker 2: Except to that I remember my, my uncle Ralph [Lee (ph.)], one of my father--one of my mother's [Blanche Lee Elam] brothers was a member of the cast of Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle's--what, now the name escapes me it was on Broadway in the Roaring Twenties and I remember he use to come home from these trips to New York [New York] to perform and talk about the Broadway show that he was in-'Shuffle Along,' that's the name of the-'Shuffle Along,' and he talked about how he got one of the lead roles in Shuffle Along.  He was in the chorus, the male chorus and so one day the chorus was finishing its part and was dancing off the stage and he slipped and fell and he sort of picked himself up quickly and he started strutting and the audience laughed at him strutting off the stage and so they kind of like that strut that he had so they decided to give him the role of the strutter.  So when the chorus performed after that there was a dance that my Uncle Ralph did called the strutter.  And I remember looking at a book years later that showed the salary of what these performers were receiving.  Most of them received thirty dollars a week, that was the pay, but my uncle Ralph received thirty-five dollars a week so he got five dollars more than the rest of the members of the cast, and I remember that story he was telling.
Speaker 1: Did you hear this story from him or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I heard it from him, yeah.
Speaker 1: He used to tell you this?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then I read about it later on in this book that I read but--
Speaker 1: So it got corroborated?
Speaker 2: Yeah, corroborated.
Story_ID: 299880
Speaker 1: What sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up in Cambridge [Massachusetts]?  What sights, sounds and smells remind (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sights, sounds and?
Speaker 1: Smells--remind you of growing up in Cambridge?
Speaker 2: Well, I have to think about that for a minute.  I frankly don't recall anything that I can put my finger on that would get at what your, your--the question is that you're putting to me but I can remember certain things about family (unclear).  I can remember that mother [Blanche Lee Elam] had a brother, Willard [Lee] who was sick most of the time whenever we were young and he contracted tuberculosis and as a young man I remember going to his room and visiting with him and he died while I was a young child and that kind of set me back a little bit 'cause you know I liked Willard, and then another brother, Fred [Lee] who was sort of the life of the family, very jolly and he contracted tuberculosis as well and he used to work as the doorman of the, of the old Deaconess Hospital [Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center] in Boston [Massachusetts] and everybody liked Fred, he greeted them well and were going over to the Deaconess Hospital just to see him do his job as a youngster, and I enjoyed that and he died early on and then there was my mother had a sister who--name was Helen, Helen Lee and Helen was the one in the family that had the most education and she was a secretary for George Goodman who was the first executive secretary of the Urban League in Greater Boston back in the 1920s, and she did most of the work--George--(laughter) she'd be on the telephone, at that time they were finding jobs and, and doing other kinds of things trying to help blacks get employment and, but and people will this day remember Helen Lee and how she helped them get a job and bring, helped to bring families up from the South.  The Morris family, I don't know whether you remember the Morris family in Boston, a group of about eleven or twelve and they all did--came up from Mobile, Alabama.  First the--when the older sister came up and she came to see Helen and she helped her find a job and she brought her family up as a result of that and they all grew up and one of the Morris boys was in at Latin School [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts] with me and he became a doctor and, and they all did very well, but I remember the oldest member of the family, that Morris family, talked about my Aunt Helen Lee and how she was instrumental in bringing all of her family up from the South.  So those are some things that I remember about growing up in Cambridge.

Speaker 1: What were the family events on a yearly basis, family traditions that you and your parents [Blanche Lee Elam and Robert Elam] and brothers [Charles Elam and Clarence Elam] and sisters [Annette Elam Capdeville and Harriet Elam-Thomas] participated in as a family, what were the major family things that you always looked forward to?
Speaker 2: Okay, well the big thing usually was the church picnic, Mass Avenue Baptist Church [Massachusetts Avenue Baptist Church, Cambridge, Massachusetts] annual picnic at Salem Willows [Salem, Massachusetts], and I can always look forward to that, getting on the bus and taking the big, getting the lunch and finding a place once we got out there and, and that was the big time for the family back in those days, the annual church picnic held at the Salem Willows.
Speaker 1: And when, what type, time of the year was that?
Speaker 2: That was usually in the, in the summertime, yeah, July.
Speaker 1: And where was Salem Willows for those who?
Speaker 2: Salem, right outside of Salem inside of a recreation area in the town of Salem, Massachusetts, north of Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: And how would you travel up to Salem?
Speaker 2: We would, they would--by bus, they would--the church would hire, rent buses and take all of the members of the church out there and we'd have a good time visiting one family, getting food and from this family or that family and just had a wonderful time in those days.  That's the big thing I remember about growing up.
Speaker 1: What other family traditions and events do you recall from your childhood with your family?
Speaker 2: Well, not in Cambridge [Massachusetts] but later when we moved to Boston I can recall the annual picnics that we would take every summer you know in Cape Cod [Massachusetts], and that was my first introduction to Cape Cod, and the Hyannis [Massachusetts] area was generally where we would go and you'd get the cousins and nephews and all the relatives would join in for this big family picnic every summer on the Cape.
Story_ID: 299882
Speaker 1: When did you and your family move to the City of Boston [Massachusetts], and why did you move to Boston?
Speaker 2: The family moved from Cambridge [Massachusetts] to the City of Boston in 1932, again, I believe it was during the [Great] Depression years and my parents [Blanche Lee Elam and Robert Elam] were looking for a home where that they could afford and I guess they found it, the one that they could best afford at that time in Boston in the Roxbury section of Boston off what was known as Sugar Hill, a dead-end street, Elbert Street in Roxbury.
Speaker 1: What as the name of the street?
Speaker 2: Elbert, E-L-B-E-R-T.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: I think they tore down all of the houses on that street now but that's the first street we lived on and a three-decker again, third floor with three-decker and it was a street, a dead-end street and we had the only automobile on the street.  My father had this 1926 Hudson and which we learned to drive on that dead-end street years ago.
Speaker 1: Who were your neighbors?  Who do you recall the people were in that early first Boston neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, there were I remember many of them well living--we lived on the top floor on the second floor in the other apartment was the Singleton family, a large family.  They had about ten or twelve children and some--we became very good friends and next door were the Desmond family and the White family all very large families and across the street the Hyde [ph.] family and further up the street the Murray family, and I remember well growing up on Elbert Street playing with the children of the families and I remember the Murray family in particular, and Ann who later went on to become a psychiatrist and married and had several children and she died unfortunately early on, but we had neighbors that we enjoyed and we were all in the same straits.
Speaker 1: And to what extent was the Elbert Street neighborhood and Roxbury, Sugar Hill--what extent was it integrated?  By that I mean black and white, what was the racial mix at that time?
Speaker 2: Well at that time I think there were maybe two or three Jewish families that lived on Elbert Street and they didn't stay very long, but it was predominately, the area was becoming predominately black, African American, Negro whatever in those days (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And before that it was what?
Speaker 2: Jewish, it was a Jewish neighborhood, and the upper--we lived I'd say on the Hill, on the lower part of the Hill, the upper streets on the Hill were then pretty much occupied by Jewish families.  The lower part of the Hill, Munroe Street and Elbert Street and Bower Street, Townsend Street by black families, predominantly.

Speaker 1: Let's talk about your formal schooling, the beginning of your formal schooling.  You started in Cambridge [Massachusetts] I assume?  Your, your early schooling was in Cambridge?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah. What was your first elementary school that you attended in Cambridge?
Speaker 2: The Houghton School [Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] on Putnam Avenue I believe.  It was the first school that I recall attending, and they did kindergarten and first grade.
Speaker 1: How many years did you stay there, until I guess until you moved to?
Speaker 2: I think there were just two years there then we moved to another section of Cambridge and I can't think of the name of the school but I remember the street it was on, Upton Street, but the school, the name of the school escapes me and I remember that we continued in that school until we moved to Boston [Massachusetts], I think up to the fifth grade and we moved to Boston and I entered the sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Do you have any memories of those first five years of elementary school in Cambridge, anything stands out in your mind about that time?
Speaker 2: No except that I told you I think earlier that I remember in kindergarten I always had nosebleeds and it was a young girl [Deloise (ph.)] who would bring an extra handkerchief for me to make sure that I had enough handkerchiefs when I had a nosebleed.  That's the only thing I can remember like that and I don't remember any of the teachers.  So I'm--very little do I recall of.
Speaker 1: Okay, well let's go to Boston because now you're into grade six.  What school did you attend when you moved to Boston?
Speaker 2: The Henry L. Higginson [Elementary] School [Boston, Massachusetts] in Harrishof [Street] and that school at that time was predominately white, had been predominately Jewish.  There were still some Jewish families in the area and I remember in the sixth grade I remember my teacher's name was Ms. King [ph.] and she said to me that I think you know I had, she seemed to think I was a good student and that I ought to apply to Latin School, Boston Latin School [Boston, Massachusetts] and I had never heard of it and of course we had just moved from Cambridge so she told me about Boston Latin School, and I told my parents [Blanche Lee Elam and Robert Elam] and we looked into it and you could either enter the Latin School from the seventh grade or the ninth grade and I was going into the seventh grade and I applied and they--I was accepted without taking examinations (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was just gonna ask you, if you had to (unclear).
Speaker 2: At that time you, if there was some question as to whether or not they felt you could make the grade you would have to take an exam, but it wasn't required, it was only required in the event that they, they weren't certain about you, but they looked at my grades and talked to me and felt that I didn't need to take the examination.  So I entered the seventh grade at Boston Latin School.
Story_ID: 299884
Speaker 1: Tell me about entering grade seven at Latin School [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts] and those early years there?  How do you remember those years and what was it like for you?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember that I was the only black face in the seventh grade at the time, and it was a very lonely existence.  It seemed that they had a culture there at the Latin School that the, the upperclassmen did not associate with the lower classmen and so even though there were a number of boys from my neighborhood that were ahead of me in school there, I really didn't get to meet them or associate with them because of this, this culture that we had to buy into and so that it wasn't until I entered the ninth grade that I began to--there were some blacks had came into my class at the ninth grade, two or three and so I had some company from that point on (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who were they?  Do you remember who they were?
Speaker 2: Yes Joe Lynch [ph.] was one of them and George Gilford [ph.].  George Gilford and I one day were walking home from school and I said to George, "Today's my birthday," and he said, "Well, today's my birthday too" and it turned out the two of us were born on the same day, same year, same hospital [Boston Lying-In Hospital; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts], even though our parents didn't know one another, but here we were had been going to school for two or three years together and walking home and didn't realize we were born on the same day, same year.  George died some years ago.  And so I might point out that I had a very bitter experience at Latin School when it came--I--we started as I indicated to you the seventh grade and I got promoted to the eighth grade.  We were called, they were called classes, you'd go from class six which is seventh grade, to class five, to class four, to class, the seniors were class one.  We got to class two which is my junior year.  At the end of the junior year in class two, my homeroom master called me up and said, "Harry [HistoryMaker Harry Elam], I think you're gonna have to repeat this year, you're flunking math."  "What?"  This is the end of the school year."  I said, "Well can't I go to summer school?"  "Oh, no, no you're gonna have to do the whole year over."  "But, I"--I just, I was devastated I went to the headmaster and I got, brought my parents [Blanche Lee Elam and Robert Elam] up to school, but I said, "I'll go to summer school."  No, they said they insisted and I had no choice.  I really wanted to leave Latin School at that point.
Speaker 1: They wanted you to repeat the whole year?
Speaker 2: That I had to repeat the entire year.
Speaker 1: Just because of one subject?
Speaker 2: Because of one subject and that's--and this is, you know I wasn't alone.  This has happened to many, but I just, I had never failed anything before in life and so it was very dam--and to this very day I, I really feel that, that devastation.
Speaker 1: Well what happened, I mean what was the upside?
Speaker 2: And so I had to contin- I had to repeat that year over again.  It was just like you know it was coasting because I had the same subjects, and I didn't really have to do much work and then went on and then I was joined by some other blacks who--I'm trying to think of some--Benjamin Handy [ph.], Ellis--Gill Ellis [ph.] who went to become a lawyer in New York and some others.  We had a class, a graduating class of about five or six blacks and, and I said at that time when I left Latin School that I was not coming back.  I just felt so badly at the graduation that I had to lose a year, spend an additional year, seven years instead of six years, and I didn't even try to apply for a scholarship.  I just felt so badly--
Story_ID: 299885
Speaker 1: --And then I got a call from a cousin of mine who was teaching at Virginia State College [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] and said, "Harry [HistoryMaker Harry Elam], I understand that you don't have any money to go to school and no scholarship.  Why don't you come down to Virginia State and go to school here?"  Now this was a black college [HBCU], I had never heard of it.  So I said, "Wow," he said, "Well you can stay with me, I'll help you find a job," and so I did and in the fall of 1940 after graduating from Latin School [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts] entered Virginia State College and two of the best years of my life was spent there.  My self-esteem coming out of Latin School was so low, had a good education, but I knew nothing about history, black history.  The only thing I can recall being said about blacks in the history was that Crispus Attucks was a drunken sailor who got in the way of a bullet.  The class got a big laugh outta that and of course I didn't.
Story_ID: 299886
Speaker 1: Before we get to Virginia State [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] which is very important, let me just--a couple of other things.  I wanna talk about church life and church affiliation for you, your brothers and sisters [Annetta Elam Capdeville and Harriet Elam-Thomas] and your parents [Blanche Lee Elam and Robert Elam].  What were your church experiences growing up, and the other question, well, let's do that one first.  What did, where did church, what role did church play?
Speaker 2: We, well growing up we attended, I can recall early on Sunday school at in Cambridge [Massachusetts] at the Mass Avenue Baptist Church [Massachusetts Avenue Baptist Church], the Reverend E.E. Thompson, what the E.E stands for now I don't remember, but the E.E. Thompson very gentlemanly minister, and I can recall some of the Sunday school teachers that I had and, but I--my real interest in church was when we moved to Boston [Massachusetts] in 1932.  Many of my friends in the neighborhood belonged to the Boy Scouts [of America] and I wanted to join the Boy Scouts and the church that had Boy Scout group was at St. Mark Congregational Church [St. Mark Congregational Church United Church of Christ, Dorchester, Massachusetts], which was just one block up from where we lived on Elbert Street, and it church--Boy Scouts were a big thing in those days and so that the church troop was over-subscribed and you'd have to be on a waiting list, unless you were a member of the church.  So my brothers and I prevailed upon my parents, two years after we were living in Boston to join St. Mark Congregational Church so we could get into Boy Scouts, 'cause they'd drive back and forth every Sunday to, to take us with them to Cambridge, and so in 1934 my brothers Clarence [Elam], Charles [Elam] and I walked down the aisle dressed in our Buster Brown outfits and looking good and the Reverend Samuel Leroy Laviscount was the pastor, longtime pastor of that church, took us in as members, and we--I have been a member of that church since 1934.
Speaker 1: And you're still a member?
Speaker 2: And still a member, and I can remember the nurturing that we got from the Sunday school teachers, everybody at that time lived in the same neighborhood you know, the members of the church, whether they were considered the proper class or what have you or college educated, and there were a few that members of the church that had gone to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and other colleges and so they were interested in making sure that we, the members of St. Mark's Sunday school got a rich education and were able to go on to college, and I found that that experience was one that did so much for me, for my brothers and we were all able to finish high school and go on to college because of the nurturing that began at St. Mark Church.
Story_ID: 299887
Speaker 1: And then the church when I--then at the--I'd gone away to school and went into the [U.S. military] service in 1942 into World War II [WWII] and returning from the service in 1946.  I came back to St. Mark [St. Mark Congregational Church; St. Mark Congregational United Church of Christ, Dorchester, Massachusetts] on Sunday, I was planning to go back to Virginia State College [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] and came to St. Mark's Church  and a young lady in the choir stood up and indicated that the church, the choir was holding a fundraising affair in the next few weeks and I said, well I think I'll go to that.  I like what the young lady had to say and how she said it and how she looked, so I thought I would go to the fundraising affair, and as it turned she didn't show up at the fund--so I had to join the choir to meet this young lady and that young lady became my bride some years later.
Speaker 2: And her name?
Speaker 1: And so I never went back to Virginia State, I stayed in Boston [Massachusetts] after this, I was planning to go back.
Speaker 2: So you met Barbara (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At--
Speaker 2: --Clark--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Barbara Clark, my wife of fifty-five years now.
Speaker 2: At the church?
Speaker 1: At the church.
Story_ID: 299888
Speaker 1: As you finished Latin School [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts] and had the opportunity to go to Virginia State [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], did you have any notion or thoughts at that point about what you wanted to be professionally as an adult any (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To be perfectly honest with you, I did not.
Speaker 1: You didn't?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed the classics, Latin and Greek, those were my best subjects and so when I went to Virginia State I wanted to take Latin and Greek.  Well they didn't offer Greek but they offered Latin, so I took Latin and history.  I think I majored in history, but I didn't have any inkling of what I wanted to do (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you weren't thinking about a legal professional or lawyer at that point?
Speaker 2: No I was not, I was not at that time, yeah--
Story_ID: 299889
Speaker 1: Let's continue by talking about your entering Virginia State [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], and you were there two years, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well tell us about those two years at Virginia State?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Was it the first time you had really been south and stayed in the South?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, the first time that I had ever gone south and as a matter-of-fact in traveling there I found that I had to go to the back of the bus or the train and I never had that experience before on my way to school, and I had never been to you know all black school--schools were always predominately white so that was something that--and then I, I remember well the professors that I had.  Most of the professors at Virginia State were Ph.D.s who couldn't get jobs at the white universities and had to go to the black schools and they were top notch teachers.  I can remember especially a history professor by the name of Luther [Porter] Jackson.  He was just outstanding and it was there that I began to really feel, oh we did make a contribution.  We do have a history.  And it just opened up so much for me that I, I just did never got that at Latin School [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts] or any other school that I attended and he was a very dedicated person.  At that time blacks couldn't vote unless they paid the poll tax, and he was interested in their voting, he warned them, "You know we'll pay that poll tax for now but we need to get you to vote."  So he encouraged blacks to pay the poll tax 'cause one day we're gonna get rid of it, but we need for you to vote and just went all over the South lecturing and folk and then getting them to register to vote, and just a fine person and then there was another, Dr. [Henry Walter] Roberts who taught sociology and was the, the debating team, you know he was in charge of the debating team.
Speaker 1: Were you on the debate--?
Speaker 2: Yeah and he invited me to join and so I did and encouraged me and I spent, I think--not my freshman year, my second year on the debating team and enjoyed traveling to other colleges to debate.  I remember going to A&T College in North Carolina [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] and so I got a chance to do some traveling through the South as a result.
Story_ID: 299890
Speaker 1: What other memories do you have of your time at Virginia State [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Some of the friendships that I made at Virginia State were just life-long friendships.  There was one chap who was my roommate, the second year not the first year, the second year.  I met him first year and we became roommates the second year and we just had a beautiful friendship over years until he died maybe about four or five years ago.  He lived in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: His name?
Speaker 2: John Kosling [ph.] and he went on--he studied law also and became the chief probation officer for the federal court system in New Jersey, and raised a family, then we and then others that I met there were just very fine and we kept up a relationship throughout the years and I joined the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity there I remember, and in those days hazing was the big thing on college campuses and we went through thirteen days, there were thirteen of us on line as I (unclear) probation and we'd have to dress differently.  It was hard to wear the same thing every day then if you didn't have it you had to find somebody that had a tuxedo, or a blue suit or whatever that was the garb for the day and everybody managed to be dressed alike and carry a brick and every evening we'd get that paddle and then the day we crossed the burning sands that thirteenth day, two o'clock in the morning, I'll never forget was Pearl Harbor Day, December 9, 1941 [sic.].  While they were bombing Pearl Harbor they were (laughter) beating our butt, hazing.  So and I remember picking up the newspapers the next morning (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You will never forget that day.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were living with your cousin while you were?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: You were living with your cousin?
Speaker 2: No I didn't have to, I found that I could get a room.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: Very reasonably and I had a job working in the kitchen, and you know tuition wasn't that, that much when you look at everything.  I think for out of state--for state students it was a hundred dollars a year, now this is 1940 and for out of state--there was--two hundred dollars was a lot of money in those days, but I was able to raise the money working and I just had a wonderful time those two years.
Story_ID: 299891
Speaker 1: You came back home between the first and second year (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then after that then I was--actually I wasn't drafted I was classified as 4F because of my poor eyesight at the time.  I was very nearsighted, but I was determined that I wanted to get into the [U.S. military] service and so I went back to the recruiting station.  I memorized the chart and enlisted and so I (laughter) even though I had been declared 4F they, they took me in as an enlisted man in nineteen (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, why did you decide you wanted to go military and not continue at Virginia State [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Well everybody was going, all of my friends were called into the service that I had met there.  Had I stayed at Virginia State my friends were all gone, so I, I wanted to go, my friends were going.  My brothers [Charles Elam and Clarence Elam] they were going in the service.  I was determined that's--and I think most of us in those days felt that was the thing to do, and so I did.
Speaker 1: So you entered which military branch?
Speaker 2: I entered the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: And that was what 1940?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-two [1942].
Speaker 1: Okay, and I was sent to school, the [U.S. Army] Signal Corps school [U.S. Army Signal School, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey] in New Jersey, and studied the operation and repair of long distance telephone circuits, spent a year in school but when I left school I was sent to a Signal Corps heavy construction battalion.  What they did was to dig holes and set telephone poles and string wire and this thing that, the operation that I was studying the long distance, I never got to use any of it.  Which was typical for what happened to many of us in the, in the service in those days and so and I was sent overseas to China-Burma-India Theater to Assam [India], which is on the far eastern border or close to the Burma [Myanmar] border, the Ledo Road [Stilwell Road] and spent two years there.
Speaker 2: Now you were in segregated units at this point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Segregated unit, yeah.
Speaker 2: Tell me about the segregation, how you remember that practice and that policy as a military man?
Speaker 1: Well I--it was a very unhappy situation for all of I'm sure.  All of the officers were white and seemed to be really didn't--the, they weren't that interested in us and non-commissioned officers were black and of course all of the enlistment men, and so the relationship--we didn't have a good relationship at all with the commissioned officers, but you know we, that was our lot and we understood it and so we did our job nevertheless, and I can recall going over to, to this particular part of India in the jungle, I was so sure that I would meet up with some animals in the jungles.  There're lions (laughter)--you know you read about, but, but never, that never happened, but we did a lot of maintaining of telephone lines, the communication lines on the Ledo Road.  Our particular unit had to set poles and whenever there was a break in the line, usually that was about two or three o'clock in the morning, we'd have to find it and fix it and, but two years went without incident and I can recall being on a telephone pole when the word came that the war [World War II, WWII] was over, I got the message--
Story_ID: 299892
Speaker 1: So you finished your [U.S.] military service in what year?
Speaker 2: In 1946.
Speaker 1: And how did you feel at that point in your life?
Speaker 2: Well I (laughter) was happy to be back home after being at--'cause we were so far away and I thought we'd never get back to the [United] States but we did, and so I wanted to complete my education and I decided I would stay in Boston [Massachusetts] with the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] and my credits were accepted at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].  As a matter-of-fact let me tell you about the story about--I, I first decided I'd try to get into Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  So I went to see the dean of admissions, his name was William Bender, I'll never forget it.
Speaker 1: William?
Speaker 2: Bender, B-E-N-D-E-R.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Yeah sometime after I got back and he looked at my record from Virginia State [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] and Latin School [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts] and he said to me, "You know it just so happens we just admitted a black fellow last week, you might know him, Royal Bolling?"  I said, 'cause I didn't know Royal Bolling then and I knew him later in politics and he said--so I guess they had met their quota and he was so sorry but that was my fate (laughter) when I sought admission to Harvard back in 1946.
Speaker 1: Ed Cooper [ph.] told me the same story when he tried to get into the School of Business Administration [College of Business Administration; Questrom School of Business] at Boston University.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: And it was '30 [1930], 1932 and they told him the same thing you know.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 299893
Speaker 1: So in any event I was accepted at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] the college of liberal arts and again I wasn't sure what I was gonna do but I knew I was gonna finish college and it so happened that during that first year, freshman year several of my friends that I'd met at Virginia State [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] who were ahead of me, they had finished college in 1942 and then went into the [U.S. military] service came to Boston University to go to law school.  There were six of them, they lived in an apartment on Humboldt Avenue and that's when I began to take an interest in law, I said, "Well if my friends from Virginia State can study law why I can't I?"  So I looked forward to when I finished my undergraduate work to go into law school and that's how the interest in law school began.  There, I remember clearly--and all of 'em they went on to do well in law and pra- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who were some of them?
Speaker 1: Yeah one, there was Hilary Jones [Jr.] who was from Norfolk, Virginia.  He had married a Boston [Massachusetts] girl, Corinne Davis [Jones], and went back to practice law in Norfolk and he became a member of the school committee [Norfolk School Board] and did very well, he's deceased now and then there was a Noel Torres who was from New York City [New York, New York] who decided that he would practice in Massachusetts and he passed the bar and practiced for a while in Springfield [Massachusetts].  Then he decided that he wanted to go overseas and so he left Massachusetts and went to Switzerland and became part of an international law firm in Switzerland and the last I heard he was--I don't know whether he's alive or not, but that, that's where he lived and married and had a family and then there was Jim Bailey [James W. Bailey].  Jim Bailey who stayed in Boston, who had, who was from Roanoke, Virginia and he finished in 1942 and went into service and very bright fellow and he and Ed Brooke [HistoryMaker Edward Brooke] were classmates at BU law school [Boston University School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts].  They were members of the class of 1948, they finished in '48 [1948] and he became a judge in Massachusetts as well.  So those are some of the--and there was another one by the name Reuben [K.] Davis who became a judge in New York, but these were as I say, friends of mine who I had attended Virginia State with, in the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 2: So you say this was the spark that gave you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Absolutely, yeah.
Speaker 2: --an idea to go to law school?
Speaker 1: And so when I completed my undergraduate work I applied to BU law school, was accepted.
Story_ID: 299894
Speaker 1: Tell me about those two years when you completed for your bachelor's degree at BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], what was BU like at that time?  How do you remember those two years and what did you major in?
Speaker 2: Well BU was a large university and it didn't have the, the air that I you know found at, at Virginia State [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] which was smaller and--so that I didn't become so attached, I didn't join any clubs or organizations there, I just wanted to get my education and get out, and so I made very few friends and during those two years because I was primarily interested in a young lady [Barbara Clark Elam] at that time.  I think I told you I that I had met my future bride when I came back from the [U.S. military] service and church [St. Mark Congregational Church; St. Mark Congregational Church United Church of Christ, Dorchester, Massachusetts], and so I courted her during the time I was in law school [Boston University School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts] and--
Speaker 1: Now what was she doing during this time?
Speaker 2: She was a student at Simmons College [Boston, Massachusetts], studying library science and finished in the class of 1949 and she was the only black in her class and she was an honor graduate and when she finished she wanted to work for a year in New York in the, the public library system so she was hired to work in Brooklyn [New York] and so she worked a year there and I use to go by--drive back and forth to visit her so and try to study in law school, so I--there wasn't much time for me to do too many other things.
Speaker 1: Were you active in Omega Psi Phi [Fraternity] when you got to Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes as a matter-of-fact I was the, the basileus or the president of a chapter here at the time.
Speaker 1: While you were in undergrad?
Speaker 2: While I was in law school.
Speaker 1: In law school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you work during the two years you were at BU?  Did you?
Speaker 2: No I was on the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944], there was no need.  I think we--tuition was paid and we got a stipend as well, so.
Speaker 1: Were you living with your parents [Blanche Lee Elam and Robert Elam] at the time?
Speaker 2: Yeah I was living with my parents at the time.
Speaker 1: You were?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 299895
Speaker 1: Was your father [Robert Elam] still working at that point?
Speaker 2: My father was still working, he at that time was working for the [U.S.] Army.  He had gone to school up in (unclear) to study diesel engines and so he was hired was hired as a diesel mechanic at the Boston army, airbase--yeah, South Boston Army Base [Boston, Massachusetts] that they had there.  The--I've forgotten the full name of it but anyway he was--reckon he worked there until he retired (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now you said earlier your brother Clarence [Elam] went to law school, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Before you?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Before you?
Speaker 2: No, no he went to law school [Boston University School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts] back in the '60s [1960s] I believe.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay he went later (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he had graduated from--he had got a master's degree in business administration from--
Speaker 1: Oh, it was later he went to law school?
Speaker 2: And later he went to law school.
Speaker 1: All right.

Speaker 1: So you entered the Boston University law school [Boston University School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts] and tell me about that experience, how long was that and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that, that--there was a class of about three hundred and there were about five black law students at the time and one young fellow was from Little Rock, Arkansas.  I'll never forget him, Donald McCollum [ph.].  He was the youngest one in the class, I think he had finished Talladega College [Talladega, Alabama] and hadn't gone into the [U.S. military] service so that he would have to do his service once he finished law school, and then there was a fellow named Roy Ellis from Washington, D.C. who had gone to Tufts [University, Medford, Massachusetts] and another young fellow Emil Drysdale from New York who'd gone to Fordham [University, New York, New York].  And these were the blacks that I met--that I became good friends while I was in law school, studied together and--so we did the three years at law school.
Speaker 1: Did you find it difficult going to BU Law, was it any special challenges that you faced?
Speaker 2: No, you know I really found that my--the hardest studying that I had to do in school was at Boston Latin School [Boston, Massachusetts].  I was prepared for college and the professional school as a result of the studies, so that I didn't find it difficult reading and studying.  I got, had that background from Boston Latin School.  I think most of the graduates of Latin School will tell you, that they had a more difficult time in high school than they did in college and in professional school, and so it wasn't a breeze, but I certainly you know were--there was a lot of reading involved but I found that I could be helpful to some of my friends as well in our study sessions.
Story_ID: 299897
Speaker 1: Are you married (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I was--again another disappointment, I have to be honest, took the bar examination, thought I had nailed it.  When I got a notice, I didn't.  Again, I was devastated, then the second time I took it took I passed and I didn't think I had passed so it was, it was crazy, but I did pass the bar and I tried to.
Speaker 1: You got married--you were married before you finished law school [Boston University School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, as a matter-of-fact I married in my senior year in law school, September 1950, the senior year.
Speaker 1: Okay, and Barbara [Clark Elam] at that point was?
Speaker 2: At that point she was--
Speaker 1: Back in Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: --working here in Boston, she had finished a year in New York and was working with the Boston Public Library when we--at the time we were married.
Story_ID: 299898
Speaker 1: You finish BU law school [Boston University School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts], and let me ask you about one of your law partners and then long-time friends and associates who graduated from BU Law School I think in 1949 former U.S. Senator Edward W. Brooke [HistoryMaker Edward Brooke].
Speaker 2: He graduated in '48 [1948], yeah.
Speaker 1: Forty-eight [1948], yeah.  When did you first get to know Edward W. Brooke?
Speaker 2: Well I got--as a matter-of-fact my brother Clarence [Elam] was in the [U.S. military] service with him during World War II [WWII], the 366th Infantry [336th Infantry Regiment], Ed Brooke was a captain, his captain, the captain of his company and he, along with Al Brothers who was also a Bostonian encouraged Brooke who was in Washington, D.C. to settle in Boston [Massachusetts] and so he did and set up a law practice on Humboldt Avenue and became involved in politics.
Speaker 1: Is this before you finished law school?
Speaker 2: And this was before I finished, this was 1948 when he finished law school, and so when I finished law school three years later and then passed the bar and was trying to find a job and the law firms, big white law firms downtown, were not--not even the Legal Aid Society were hiring blacks, and I thought I'd probably get a job in the post office, and this is what happened to many of our law school graduates that they couldn't find work as lawyers, they had to go into government service, but Ed Brooke called me one day, Clarence suggested that I might be interested, and he said, "Why don't you come, I understand you can't find a job?  Why don't you just come and work with me and I can't you anything but you can you know--office rent free."  And--so, so I did.  I joined Ed Brooke when I passed the bar and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did he--was he a solo, a solo law firm?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a solo practitioner.
Speaker 1: He was a solo practitioner at that time.
Speaker 2: He was a solo practitioner.
Speaker 1: Where was his office?
Speaker 2: 151 Humboldt Avenue, I believe.  It use to be the old Humboldt Theatre [Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts] building.  The Humboldt Theatre was, had several offices above it and he had an office there and Al Brothers had a real estate office right next to it and there was an empty space that, for (unclear) a desk and a chair in the, in Al Brothers office so I worked out of Al Brothers but was associated with Ed Brooke, and we'd go to court with him began to pick up cases and that's where I got my start and after about five years Ed Brooke decided he wanted to move in town and practice in town, and I decided I'd wouldn't go in town that I'd stay in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Were you two partners during this time?
Speaker 2: Yeah we were, we had a firm called Brooke and Elam [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At some point and I think there was another person that joined us and there was Brooke, Elam and Johnson, but then when he decided to move in town and I--Johnson and I decided to stay in Roxbury and I continued my practice.
Story_ID: 299899
Speaker 1: Now were you a general legal counsel (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) General practitioner.
Speaker 1: General, you did a little bit of everything?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we all were in those days.  They didn't have specialties as such, whatever--you know there were divorce cases, criminal cases, probate cases, whatever area of the law you could find a case in you took, and so I began--because of my having lived in the community or just about all my life growing up there, the church--I had--a lot of my clients were members of St. Mark Church [St. Mark Congregational Church; St. Mark Congregational Church United Church of Christ, Dorchester, Massachusetts] and their families so I began to build, build a fairly solid practice and we became interested in politics I think I mentioned that Ed Brooke [HistoryMaker Edward Brooke] first ran for office for state representative in 1950.  I supported him, he ran in '52 [1952], but at that time the district that we were seeking to represent was predominately Jewish and they would elect two representatives to represent the district, both of 'em were Jewish and they maintained that hold during '50 [1950], and '52 [1952] and I ran in '54 [1954], and '56 [1956].  We couldn't, we just didn't have enough votes in the black community at that time and it wasn't until 1956 I think Ossie Jordan [Oswald "Ossie" Jordan, Sr.] became the first black representative to be elected from that district.
Speaker 1: What was happening in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston [Massachusetts] in the early '50s [1950s], what, what was happening going on?  You had just come out of law school [Boston University School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts]--you're starting your career, what was going on in (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah the neighborhood was beginning to change, and we knew at some point you know there would be sufficient numbers because the Jewish people began to move out and at one point there--it, it seemed that they couldn't get out fast enough and blacks were moving in and beginning in the late '50s [1950s] this began to happen and by the early '60s [1960s], middle '60s [1960s] it was really a predominately black neighborhood then.  So the change was beginning when I came outta law school, and it was still difficult for, for blacks practicing law because even members of the black community were--had always gone to Jewish lawyers you know whenever they had and so it was hard getting them acclimated to going to black lawyers but finally we began to break the ice there as well.
Speaker 1: You mentioned that after five or so years Ed Brooke decided to move his office or change his practice?
Speaker 2: Yeah to move, yeah into the downtown Boston area.
Speaker 1: And what did you do at that point?
Speaker 2: He was a single, solo practitioner but he was interested--I think at that point he had run for office three times, run for secretary of state, and he was thinking again of running statewide and he thought he would build a bigger base by moving his law practice into the center of the City of Boston and so he did and he was very successful down there as a solo practitioner and then became interested in running for attorney general.
Speaker 1: How did he, very quickly move to the point where he could actually run for office, secretary of state, attorney general.  How did he make that, those moves, I mean he was a Washingtonian, he wasn't from Boston?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's true.
Speaker 1: How did he make those moves?
Speaker 2: Well he was very personable, handsome guy and was very bright and he tried a lot of cases in the court system and they began to watch him and saw that he was a good lawyer.  He had graduated magna cum laude from law school.  He was a member of the Law Review at Boston University law school so, and he had contacts from white friends in law school so that worked with him politically and were encouraging him to run statewide.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And finally after that, after the secretary of state he was very close, he almost won that but he came back and ran for attorney general and did in fact become the state's attorney general in the late '60s [1960s], I believe and then on to the United States Senate after that.
Story_ID: 299900
Speaker 1: You continued your law practice for roughly twenty years?
Speaker 2: Yes I did.
Speaker 1: Now were you a solo?
Speaker 2: I was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or did you have partners?
Speaker 2: I, I was for a while and then I had an associate by the name of Herman Hemingway.  Herman worked with me for a while then Louis White was another young man that came in my office.
Speaker 1: Now during this time, during the first ten years of your practice with law you also were interested in politics?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And when did you, what moves did you make to, to be?
Speaker 2: Well again as I indicated I had worked with the political campaigns of Ed Brooke [HistoryMaker Edward Brooke] in 1950 and 1952 and he decided he wasn't gonna run a third time and so he encouraged me and others said, "Why don't you run, to pick up the mantle?"  So I ran for office in 1954 without success, we ran a very strong campaign but again we didn't have the numbers, and what the Jewish candidates would do would come in to the black community and say, "You have two votes, I'm not asking for you to vote--if you'll just give me one of those two votes, vote for [HistoryMaker] Harry Elam as well."  And, but when they went into the Jewish community they--the two of them would say, "Vote for the Jewish candidates," so we were closed out of getting any votes in the Jewish community and lost--many people would support the Jewish candidate.  "I got two votes, I'll--," and we had to try to educate them what you do is bullet vote you just vote for the black candidate, but that took a while, that educational process, (laughter) political educ- took a while, and so I ran in '54 [1954] and then in '56 [1956] I ran again and without success, and then Al Brothers ran as a team.  We thought maybe running as a team--
Story_ID: 300099
Speaker 1: Judge Elam [HistoryMaker Harry Elam], during the first roughly ten years when you were practicing law in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] you also started your family, and you have four children.  So let's talk about the coming of the Elam family, you and Barbra [Clark Elam]. Who was your first child, second and so on?
Speaker 2: All right, yes our oldest child is Patricia [Patricia Elam-Walker], a girl and she was born in 1954, January 29th same day as Oprah Winfrey (laughter), and Patricia was a good student, went on to graduate from The Winsor School [Boston, Massachusetts].  The Winsor School is a private school and she and Paul Podge's [ph.] daughter, Pamela [ph.] and the Pinderhughes' daughter, Ellen [Pinderhughes] all integrated The Winsor School and they graduated the same year and all of 'em have done well since, but she graduated from there and went to college, at Adelphi University [Garden City, New York] and then decided she'd study law, went to Northeastern University law school [Northeastern University School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts] and clerked for one of the appeals court judges, passed the bar on the first try and later got married.  Married a young doctor who was interning in [Washington] D.C. so she practiced law in D.C. for several years and became an administrative law judge and then subsequently was appointed the chief administrative law judge of this particular department and, but the judges working under administrative judges resented the fact that she, a woman was in charge and tried in every way to sabotage her operation when the--so she'd have to read their decisions very quick, carefully and, and finally she couldn't fire them because it was civil service.  She decided she would resign and go back to school and follow her first love, writing.  Always wanted to write and went back to the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland], got her master's degree in creative writing and later gave up the law and became an author and was--her first book was published about three years, a novel three years ago, Simon & Schuster paid her.  There were several publishing houses bidding on her book and Simon & Schuster won the bid and so she was very fortunate to be published in the early stages of her writing career.
Speaker 1: The title of the novel?
Speaker 2: The novel was 'Breathing Room' [Patricia Elam] but the novel never got marketed well.  It got good reviews, but it didn't get marketed well so they never made their money back what they paid for the book and she's in the process now--she teaches now at the Duke Ellington School of the Arts [Washington, D.C.] and is head of the literary arts department there and is writing another book, she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where is that in?
Speaker 2: That's in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: In Washington, I see, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. So that's my oldest daughter, she has three children.
Story_ID: 300100
Speaker 1: And then my oldest son, Harry [Elam, Jr.], went to Noble and Greenough School [Dedham, Massachusetts], when we, we pulled our children out of the, the Boston Public Schools [BPS] earlier on because we found that the schools really weren't up to snuff and sent them all to private schools.  Harry went to Noble and Greenough--you know Harry, Keith [Elam; Guru] and Jocelyn [Elam]--
Speaker 2: What year was Harry born?
Speaker 1: Harry was born in 1956, okay.
Speaker 2: And went to Noble and Greenough School and was president of his class there and was told by his senior advisors, "Don't bother, don't apply to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], you're not gonna get into Harvard."  So that made him all the more determined that he was going get--he applied to Harvard, not only was he accepted, but later he received what they call, we thought was a monetary award, a scholarship for his academic record in his freshman year, "Oh we're gonna get some money."  But no money was attached to this scholarship unfortunately (laughter), but in any event he did very well at Harvard and was selected to be the student speaker at the commencement exercises, he gave the student oration at his commencement exercise in 1978, went on to get a doctorate in the theater; always wanted to act and direct.  Did a lot of that in high school and college and went to, to Cal-Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and got a doctorate's degree there and received a number of awards for his acting, directing ability and then from there went on to teach for several years at--seven years at Maryland, the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] and then went out to Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] as a visiting professor.  After that and they liked what he had to offer and they put him on a tenure track and he's been at Stanford now for some fifteen years.
Speaker 1: And he's had a very distinguished professorship (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And he's tenured and not only tenured but he's also--has an endowed chair and is head of the drama department this year at Stanford University. He's also was one of eight faculty members selected university-wide to be fellows of the university, a very--a distinction for to give recognition to, to teaching, outstanding teaching and this was maybe a few four years ago so he's done quite well out there and is considered an August Wilson scholar.  He has written several books and the latest is called 'The Past and Present of August Wilson' [sic. 'The Past As Present in the Drama of August Wilson,' Harry Justin Elam], and, and it's really an academic treatise and is being used considered the last word on August Wilson used in theater schools all over the country.  So he's done quite well out there at Stanford, married last year for the first time and I performed the ceremony.  His wife [Michele Elam] also teaches at Stanford.
Speaker 1: I remember you telling me about that.
Story_ID: 300101
Speaker 1: And then my third child Keith [Elam; Guru] went to Morehouse after finishing high school.  Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] (unclear) but he always wanted--loved music and he decided he wanted to first go to FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology] in New York [New York] studying decorating, it's a--and so we sent him there for a year, but then he said, "I really wanna, I really want music."  I said, "Son you're on your own now."  (Laughter) And so he decided he would stay in New York and work and get into the music field and became a hip hop artist and for the past twelve, thirteen years he's been traveling all over the world and his, his thing is a fusion of jazz and rap, and his principle audience seems to be overseas and he's, in fact he's probably, he's over there now touring Europe.
Speaker 2: Where is he right now, what?
Speaker 1: He lives in New York, but he's touring Europe at the present time with a new album, and my youngest daughter, Jocelyn [Elam] was born in 1964, August 16th so she's got a birthday coming up, and she became a school teacher, went to Simmons College [Boston, Massachusetts] and master's degree in early education in Wheelock [Wheelock College, Boston, Massachusetts] and taught for several years in the Boston [Massachusetts] school system. She also is a bilingual teacher speaks and writes Spanish fluently and went out to live in and got married and lived in Arizona, now lives, she's divorced but she and her son live in the State of Maryland.  She's teaching there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that accounts for all my children, and I say I have five grandchildren, but yeah.
Speaker 2: That's good, that's good.
Story_ID: 300102
Speaker 1: You remained in private law practice, coming back to your profession now, until 1971 and then there was a very historic appointment in Boston [Massachusetts].  Tell us about--
Speaker 2: Well what happened there, I wanted for some time to become a judge, I think there were very few black judges on--serving in judiciary in Massachusetts at the time.  I think there were three or four and there was an opening on the Boston Municipal Court and I had worked for the then Governor [Francis W.] Sargent, his campaign and having worked in other political campaigns so and I had done the usual thing in seeking office, but I saw that it may not happen and what turned the tide for me was some women in the community led by Mrs. Melanie Cash [ph.], who was a member of St. Mark [Congregational Church; St. Mark Congregational Church United Church of Christ, Dorchester, Massachusetts], here's my church again, these are church women.  Paid a visit to the Governor, then Governor Francis Sargent, said, "We want you to appoint," this is without my knowledge or suggestion, "We want you to appoint [HistoryMaker] Harry Elam to that judgeship in the Boston Municipal Court." A few days later after their visit to the governor I got a call from Governor Sargent.  "Attorney Elam, just calling to see if you'd be interested in a vacancy that is presently on the Boston Municipal Court, you don't have to let me know now."  And I said, "Oh, Governor I'm very much interested and I'll let you know now that yes, I'd be happy to accept the appointment."  So that's how I became the first black judge on the Boston Municipal Court which is sort of a premiere court in the City of Boston.
Speaker 1: It's a what court?
Speaker 2: Premiere court.
Speaker 1: Premiere court?
Speaker 2: It's located in the downtown section of Boston and it has, it doesn't have unlimited jurisdiction but it has more jurisdiction than a number of the so-called municipal courts and there are several in Boston beside the Boston Municipal Court.  The Roxbury Municipal Court called the [Roxbury] District Court now, and the Dorchester District Court, East Boston [East Boston Municipal Court; East Boston District Court], et cetera, but the Boston Municipal Court had nine judges and a legendary chief justice at the time was Elijah Adlow, who was quite the, he was well known and he was the chief justice at the time that I came on that court, but the chief justice at that point at that time would serve until he retired and there wasn't any retirement ages for judges.  There were judges serving into their eighties and Adlow at that time was pretty close to eighty, but a new law was instituted shortly after I came on the bench that went into effect in 1978 that required judges to retire at the age of seventy and also established different criteria for selecting chief justices and the Boston Municipal Court at that time, 1978, 'cause Adlow, he retired in, in--a little before that and then a Judge [Jacob] Lewiton replaced him, but he had three years to serve before he had to retire.
Story_ID: 300103
Speaker 1: But during that three years it was very interesting the first three years that I served on the Boston Municipal Court when [Elijah] Adlow--when [Jacob] Lewiton became chief justice.  George Skelly was the first assistant probation officer, chief probation officer, and the chief probation officer retired shortly after I came on board and Lewiton then said, "Well I'm gonna conduct a nationwide search for--."  I said, "A nationwide search?  Here's a man who's been he's black, been the first assistant for all of these years, he's been a probation officer for twenty-five years, top notch, why do we need to conduct a nationwide search?"  "Well I think we wanna get the best person."  So in any event when he conducted this nationwide search and was gonna appoint a chap from Lowell [Massachusetts] who knew nothing about the Boston [Massachusetts] community, I said to him, "If you're gonna appoint this man, chief jus- I'm going to the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], 'cause George Skelly deserves to be chief probation officer."  "You wouldn't do that would you?"  "I certainly would," so he changed his mind.  He appointed George Skelly, chief probation officer.  Poor George suffered as a result because he was on his back for everything, like water on rice.  "George, why haven't you done" calling him down, "Why haven't?"  And poor George a year thereafter suffered a heart attack and died.  That, that shows you what was going in the court at that time, but I was determined that he was gonna be that chief probation officer.
Story_ID: 300104
Speaker 1: And subsequently and--shortly after I came on board to the governor, [Francis W. Sargent], there was an eruption in the various prisons throughout--with the--starting with Attica [Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York] throughout the county, and we began to have eruptions in the Massachusetts prison so he appointed a citizens committee to look into the correction system in Massachusetts and asked me to chair it, and so I did and for about a year we traveled, this commission all over--this is between my work in the court, all over the state visiting all the state prisons, all of the correctional institutes, and the problem we had in each of them, we could talk to the warden and the inmates but the guards had a union that would not allow them to talk to this commission, 'cause we wanted to get some feel from them what they saw as the problem, because they were the ones that are the closest to the inmates, but we had no opportunity to talk and they were all--there were no black correction officers, they were all white and even then in those days, this is back in 1971 there was a significant number of blacks in prison, but in any event we made our report and recommendations to the governor and, as to what we felt ought to be done and made a point that you know we felt sorry, badly that we weren't able to get the viewpoint of the correction officers but this was prevented by--.  But we had recommendations to make in that area as well, and so we did and some it could--those, those recommendations were taken up and by the legislature and--.  But that was an experience that I had while shortly after coming on board as, as a justice of the Boston Municipal Court.
Story_ID: 300105
Speaker 1: And then in 1978 the Court Reform Act called for the appointment of a chief justice in all of the district court chief justice--then they set up seven departments, that's what it was.  Seven departments of the trial court, the probate court department, juvenile court department, superior court department, and all of it dealt with specialties these areas of the law and then there was the Boston Municipal Court Department.  Now the Boston Municipal Court is only one court but they're making this a department and my suggestion to them at the time was that what we ought to do is put all of the district courts in the City of Boston [Massachusetts] and now in the state district courts into the Boston Municipal Court Department.  This made sense and I think the chairman of the commission went, "Oh that makes a lot of sense."  'Cause Boston is an urban center, it has, it has problems different from those of the suburban courts and the rural courts, it's a major urban center and we could concentrate all of these goods on the problems at Boston, but politics defeated that.  Now remember this is 1978 and so that didn't happen, but they set up a separate department and then the supreme justice of the court was--had the authority to select the chief justice for each department and each member of the court could, could apply for the chief justice position and I think of the nine judges in our court, five applied and I was named chief justice for a five-year term in 1978, and served for five years as the chief justice and had the appointing authority to appoint court officers and probation officers and other court personnel and as a result was able to get finally some blacks appointed and because we were always never considered for court officers' jobs and probation officers' jobs and other court personnel, and I was also named chairman of the affirmative action committee for the entire state court system, and traveled throughout the state to every county in the state encouraging--and I would go with the chief justice of the supreme district court, the chief administrative justice and, but I was the person that spoke at all of these various county locations about affirmative action and what I felt needed to be done to increase the, the numbers of employees in the court system, because it--there were very, there are very few in Boston and the major cities so you can know what in the other counties there are even fewer but they began to see the light and begin to hire blacks in some of the counties thereafter.  So I, I had an opportunity to use those but five years went so quickly (laughter) I couldn't get done all I wanted to get done during that period.
Story_ID: 300106
Speaker 1: But at the end of the five-year period I would have to revert back to becoming an associate judge and I--at the time there was a vacancy on the superior court which is the trial court above the level of the district and municipal courts and the statewide court and was appointed a member, an associate member of the superior court by Governor [Michael] Dukakis.
Speaker 2: Yeah before we get to that.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Big judicial appointment--with this judicial progression that you achieved and the impact that you had on the judicial system in Boston [Massachusetts] and in statewide, I recall and I think people remember well your community and civic activities.  So while you were moving up in the judiciary and had all these heavy responsibilities, you were still rooted back in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] and still in the city.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: And you were doing a number of things in the community, would you share some of the highlights of your community work and some of the challenges as a resident of Roxbury?
Speaker 1: Well NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] who had even prior to going on the bench I was very active in the NAACP and worked as legal counsel for the Boston branch for two or three years prior to my being appointed, but I was also interested in the social problems in the city and was very active with the Roxbury Multi-Service Center [Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts], developing that, founding it as a matter-of-fact which was--provided all kinds of social services for Roxbury and that, we had an outstanding board of directors at that time David [S.] Nelson, who later became a judge, John [D.] O'Bryant who later became a Boston School Committee member, and I was the first chairman of that board, the Roxbury Multi-Service Center board and really did a lot and became--still served on that board after I went on the bench, and also worked on the board of the Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts [Boston, Massachusetts].  I served as the chairman of her [HistoryMaker Elma Lewis] board for a number of years, and the Urban League, prior to going on the bench I was president of the, the Boston--Greater Boston branch of the Urban League [Urban League of Greater Boston; Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts], so I was very active civically and I kept--and what I did, one of the things that I felt was so important was for the kids to really see the positive side of the court system.  I established a program I called Project Commitment [Inc.] and which I recruited judges, I tried to get a many black judges to serve as possible and probation officers and attorneys and court officers and other court personnel and we set up teams for each of several middle schools, they thought middle school would be the area where we ought to really concentrate, 'cause that's when kids can get turned off or turned on, and this Project Commitment worked for several years for some twelve years before I retired and decided to give it up, and the governor at that time decided to cut our funding.  We got our substantial funding from the state and--
Speaker 2: I remember the program well and that's why I wanted you to talk about it.  It was quite unique and (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, so in any event this, this really began to make an impact.  I also tried to get other professions to do the same kind of thing, to give some time to the kids--you set up the program, give the kind of time you feel you can give.  I talked to the doctors, the black doctors, the black dentists, black bankers and to try to get them, but I never could get them to, to see that this was a responsibility that--and they could do it but to find the time to do it.  I found the time as a, as a lawyer as a judge. Another (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My next question was with all your judiciary responsibilities and high appointments and with all these community activities and your intense involve--how did you find the time and the energy to do all this Harry [HistoryMaker Harry Elam]?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Somehow you do, you know if you want to do it, if you have the will you find a way, and I just felt all of these things were important, I really did and I was in reasonably good health and I was able to, to set my time in such a way that I'd do my court, my--before working the schools early in the morning before I went to court and be able to do that you know, that wouldn't be every day, but we had a schedule set up so that it wouldn't be hard on anybody if you really were interested and had the desire to, to do this kind of thing and, and I'll tell you it began to make an impact.  Kids began to, "Are you, too (unclear)?"  You too can become a judge, a district attorney, a defense attorney, a court officer, probation officer, these jobs are out there.  They thought that they were shut out of those you know and I wanted them to see as many black faces as possible.  I got a lot of white judges and white--that wanted to participate.  I wouldn't keep them from participating but I wanted to show--to because this, the schools were predominately--and they were the problems, the kids needed to know that this was out there.  This was, this was possible for them.

Speaker 1: So you certainly well, I don't always like to use this term but you were a role model, who were your role models before you became a judge?  You certainly had--
Speaker 2: My role model really was Wade [H.] McCree.  I remember Wade McCree.
Speaker 1: Who is Wade McCree?
Speaker 2: Wade McCree went on to become one of the first black federal judges in the state, in the United States.  He was the second black appointed to the federal district court and the second to the federal court of appeals.  He later went on to become solicitor general of the United States.  He gave up his judgeship on the court of appeals [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit] which was a lifetime appointment to become--so he followed Thurgood Marshall.  Thurgood Marshall had gone to the Supreme Court of the United States and he--Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] appointed Wade McCree solicitor general.  The solicitor general represents the United States government in all cases before, in which the government has an interest before the Supreme Court.  He's sometimes considered the tenth member of the Supreme Court of the United States, and I'm sure that had Wade--had Carter been elected to a second term that Wade would've gone on to the Supreme Court, but he was an outstanding, he was the first black appointed a judge in the State of Michigan.  I can remember, now I'm living in Massachusetts I remember reading about Wade, I knew Wade from the time we were Boy Scouts together.  He was two years older than I, but he was really somebody that I wanted--I always wanted to be like Wade, outstanding Boy Scout.  The first boy--black Boy Scout in Massachusetts to become an Eagle Scout which is the highest honor you can attain in the Boy Scouts, and then he went, he was graduated from Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee], magna cum laude, went on to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] was twelfth in his class, and then couldn't get a job in Massachusetts, had to go to Detroit [Michigan] to get a job in a law--it was a black firm out there and then went on to become the first black judge in federal court, went on federal district court, court of appeals and then solicitor general.  So he was my role model.  I always wanted, when I saw--I said one day I hope I could be a judge like Wade.
Speaker 1: And you did it.
Speaker 2: And it did happen.
Speaker 1: Were there any other role models that sand out along the way?
Speaker 2: He was the principal one there to be honest with you and of course Ed Brooke [HistoryMaker Edward Brooke] was somebody that I always admired and, and watched, and he was very, as I said he was very instrumental in my starting out in the law practice.
Story_ID: 300108
Speaker 1: --Then one of the things that I, that, that we were able to do, we set up an organization, with as few black judges that were on the court when I went on, what they called the Massachusetts Judges Conference [Massachusetts Black Judges Conference] and I was their first president and what we did was to really try to get more jobs for blacks in the court system, more blacks as judges.  That was our goal to increase our numbers and I can remember one incident in particular where we were trying to get for the first time a black appointed, an assistant clerk in the superior court.  Never had one there before, there were twenty positions, and the just in Suffolk County [Massachusetts] alone and so there came a time when the clerk of that court had six appointments to make, all at one time and there was a young man who was--a black man who worked in the office came to me and said, "Judge, I been working in this office for nine years, and I'd like to be considered for an assistant clerkship position."  And I said, "Well I don't see why not," but when the clerk named these six people to fill this spot he wasn't one among them, so I--at that time I was chief justice of the, of the [Boston Municipal Court]--and also president of the black judges conference.  I went to the chief administrative judge of the trial court who had to sign off on all these on all these appointments, I said, "You cannot allow these appointments to go through 'cause this is the best opportunity I told 'em what the situation was, he was a young man, here we're getting all of these people that are being appointed, or being recommended by state representatives and you know their--but none of them had the experience that this man has had."
Story_ID: 299920
Speaker 1: Well when, when the judge--I approached the chief justice about not signing off and he says, "I'll send 'em back, I'll send 'em back."  So he did, but the clerk magistrate sent the same names back a second time.  So the chief justice who again has the, has the right to sign off to approve or not approve said to me, "Well why don't we wait?  Let this go.  We'll get the next."  I said, "No, no, no, we've waited too long.  I'm gonna take some action here."  So what I did, I had contacted [HistoryMaker] Wayne Budd who was practicing law at the time.  I said, "Wayne would you take on this case, we don't have any money representing the black judges association [Massachusetts Black Judges Conference]?  We want to get this chap Frank Barbour [ph.] appointed assistant clerk in Suffolk County [Massachusetts].  He has all the qualifications.  I gave him all of the information that there were six openings--the clerk magistrate and chairman not to appoint him, so I think we need to go to court on this."  So he brought up a petition in the [Massachusetts] Supreme Judicial Court at a hearing before one of the single justices and laid out the case and won the case and we, we got this young man appointed.  That was a struggle with the--and it ended up--and he's done an outstanding job.  Now this goes back several years, ever since that time he's still serving as assistant clerk magistrate and highly respected.
Story_ID: 299923
Speaker 1: What are some of the other most memorable and tough and significant cases that you dealt with (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, let me say that while on the [Boston] Municipal Court while I was there a case came before me involving the, the peddlers on the North End [Boston, Massachusetts] and you know there is a market that they have on weekends, an open market, the (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Faneuil Hall [Boston, Massachusetts], Faneuil Hall, yeah.
Speaker 2: The pushcart vendors, yeah, they--for years and now when the Quincy Market [Boston, Massachusetts] was built in, in that same area, in the North End they didn't like the idea of these pushcarts still being there on weekends so they went to the police department and told the police department that they're creating a traffic hazard on the weekends, and so the, the police department wanted to shut them down and they agreed with them and then they, the peddlers brought a case in the Municipal Court and the case came before me.  So I said I'd like to take a view of the area so one day I took a view with my staff and with the representatives from the peddlers' group and others that were with the police department and I saw that they weren't creating any traffic problem, and I could see exactly what was going on, they just didn't like the idea of these open carts and of course sometimes the--some of their products spills on the ground and I said the only thing I'm gonna ask you to do is make sure you keep the area clean, don't allow garbage to collect on the streets, but as far as I'm concerned there is no traffic hazard and that you ought to--I said, "I use to come down here fifty years ago when I was a kid my father [Robert Elam] use to come Saturday nights and get the leftovers and everything, you know vegetables and fruit, very cheap down at the market."
Speaker 1: I still do it (laughter), when I can get to Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: So they didn't and the police didn't appeal it and that settled the case right then and there but I was the pride and joy (laughter) of the North End after that, I could do no wrong, but I was--something that was just (unclear), that was right, you know.  You don't do this to people, these--this is their livelihood, you're putting them out of business, they've been doing, and, and they're operating today.  And then it was a case involving the Chinese community, well the Chinese community they never no problems, I mean they never any problems.  The only time we have a problem with them, they like to gamble and the police would sometimes raid their gambling operations and come in and--with--wouldn't necessarily bring in all their money, they'd take off a piece I'm sure (laughter), so one day, one Saturday I was, this was when they--you had to sit on Saturdays.  They had this raid in Chinatown [Boston, Massachusetts] and what they did they would--the squad, the gambling squad of the police department with hatchets and picks went to this place where they were at and they broke down the doors and just broke up the place and took the money and brought it in and it was some thirty thousand they, they really put some heavy stakes up but you know they weren't harming anybody and this is what they do.  This is their fun and they do it amongst themselves, nobody was ever hurt.  And so I said, "Well you know why was it necessary to tear down?"  "Well we didn't--we wanted to surprise."  I said, "You could very easily have gone in and there and maybe without," so I made them give all of the money back to--all that they turned in.  I don't think they turned in all of it.  Give all of it back to these Chinese merchants who never were involved with the defendants and I dismissed the case.  The DA's [district attorney] office got upset with me--but I just felt that, I said, "These people they don't--they're not hurting anybody.  We never see them in here.  They're not committing any assault and da, da, da, they're not troublemakers and I just don't feel that you went about it the right way."  I wanted to--and so the Chinese community was very happy about that.
Story_ID: 299924
Speaker 1: You have one more case (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Those were two things, there's one other case.
Speaker 1: One other?
Speaker 2: When I went on the Superior Court--case came before, all the other judges were ducking this case for a long time and finally it came to me and I says now I don't know whether I should take this case or not.  I said--the attorney came to me, he said, "Why, judge why don't take this case, you know?"  I said, "Well first of all he's the son of another judge, and the other judge happens to be black.  Now even though we aren't social friends, and I don't know this boy I really don't think that I ought to get involved."  He said, "Well you think about it, said everybody's ducking this case he said you take the case if--."  So finally I said, "Well, all right (laughter), let's put a stop to it.  I'll take the case if the--." So when the case came before me the district attorney and the family of a victim, this was an assault with a dangerous weapon case.  The case came before me the district attorney said the family doesn't want you to hear this case.  They think you are friends with the father of the defendant.
Speaker 1: I remember this case you know.
Speaker 2: And I said to 'em okay, I said, "Let me tell you what my relationship is," and I said, "Yes, I know him, all the other judges know him too, and but I we live in Dorchester [Boston, Massachusetts], but I've never visited his home, he's never visited my home, we don't--we're not social friends, we're not enemies, but the only time is see him is when I was on the Superior Court, I'm sitting in Cambridge [Massachusetts], he sits in Cambridge.  As a matter-of-fact I'd gone on for ten years and had never seen this judge, and then because he sits in Cambridge and all of the judges that sit the Cambridge area have the same lunchroom, so I'd see him and on occasion I would sit and talk with him, chat with him and but that's the only relationship we had," and I said, "Now, I don't know this young man nor do I know this young woman, and if you feel that because we're all of the same color that I shouldn't hear this case, well then I'm gonna give you fifteen--you go outside and you talk about it.  If you feel I should recuse myself, disqualify myself, I'll do it."  So they went outside and they talked and they back and they said we feel that you can year this case judge, we won't object to your hearing.  I said okay, so I heard the case and what they call a stipulation of facts, we didn't have to have a trial because everybody admitted to what happened.  This young man had in fact stabbed his girlfriend, but they weren't, I didn't consider the stab wounds life-threatening injuries, and it was--she was evidently taking up with another young man.  He was upset about it and so this is what he did.  It was wrong and I found him guilty on the stipulation of facts and based on the fact that the, it was not a life-threatening injury that was stood, I was not gonna send--I gave him a ten-year conquered sentence [ph.] and I suspended it, put him on probation for three years I think it was and he had to pay restitution for medical expenses in the amount of $25,000 to the family for this victim, and then three hundred hours of community service, and I thought that was sufficient punishment.  He never--no criminal record, but and I said if he gets, if he violates any of the conditions of probation I'm gonna send him away.  So I thought that was gonna be the end of the case but the family decided that I should have sent him to jail, they went to the Judicial Conduct Commission [Commission on Judicial Conduct] through their attorney, claimed that I had admitted to the press that I was a crony of this judge and that this is what I did, and it was the kind of disposition I would've made no matter who the person was.  No record, no life-threatening--the situation was the same it was--
Story_ID: 299925
Speaker 1: But, in any event they were unhappy that I didn't send him to jail and as a result I was taken before the Judicial Conduct Commission [Commission on Judicial Conduct], they did an investigation and because the newspapers were--playing the television that you know, and it was just terrible what they were doing to me and so in any event the Judicial Conduct Commission did their investigation, it took 'em some time and found out that, that I did nothing in for--wrong, nothing that required any punishment on the part of the Judicial Conduct Commission and they exonerated me, but so they weren't happy.  The family said we're going to take this to the Supreme Judicial Court.  So they filed a petition in the supreme district court to have me punished in some way for, for making the dispositions that I did.  So they heard the case and they finally threw it out.  It took almost a year before they made final disposition of this case.  I was completely exonerated but you'd have to look on the back page of the newspapers to find out because there wasn't news when I was exonerated, but it was news when I was supposedly a crony, and the headlines and everything else you know, did what they--so they really did a job, The [Boston] Globe in particular really did a job on me, but that was an experience that--an unhappy experience but there--and as I say I could've avoided all that by not taking on the case.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But you know one of the reasons I did, I said I have a son who was about the same age at the time, twenty-five years old and he was growing up in the black community. He was could've gotten involved in some difficulty you know with gangs and what not, and at some point might have gotten into trouble and would have to go before the court and I said, well if this were my son I'd be looking for someone who is sensitive to some of the problems in the community and to hear the case, so for that reason I did hear it and I, really did--if I felt that this kid ought of gone to jail if it was just so bad, I wouldn't have no hesitation in sending him, but that was not the case, but at any rate those were (laughter) some of the interesting.
Story_ID: 299931
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-three [1983] you were appointed associate justice of the Massachusetts Superior Court, tell us about that appointment and the tenure on that court.
Speaker 2: All right well at that--at 1983 my five year term as chief justice of the Boston Municipal Court was about to run out and I would have to go back to being an associate justice in the court that I had been the chief, and I thought that I needed a new experience, judicial experience.  I wasn't ready to retire, so there was a vacancy, one or two vacancies at the time in the superior court and Michael Dukakis was the governor and I made application, was interviewed by the Judicial Nominating Committee [Judicial Nominating Commission] and recommended to the governor, was interviewed by him and finally was appointed, and so I was pleased that I got this.  Now, the Superior Court is a circuit court, the judges travel around the state, they sit maybe one or two months in one county and then move on to another county.  So I get an opportunity to travel around the state, to see parts of the state that I had never seen before, listen to lawyers that I hadn't heard before and exposed myself as a black judge and many communities that had never seen one before, and (laughter) to give you an example of what, what can happen sometimes I was assigned to sit in the Salem, the Essex County Superior Court in Salem [Massachusetts].  I don't know if they have black judges out in Salem, so I went out to the court this morning and found the court all right and looked for the area, usually there's a parking area for judges to park their cars.  So I found the area and I started pulling into the area, the parking area for judges, and I, this white court officer runs up to me, "Hey can't you read, can't you see that's for judges?"  I said, "What the hell do you think I am."  A court officer?  Came up with my robe, oh he was so red-faced embarrassed (laughter) and so he but he couldn't do enough for me during the time that I sat out there, but just to show you he had never seen a black judge out there.  When I pulled into the judge's--assumed that I was pulling in the wrong space (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He just didn't believe it probably for an instant.
Speaker 2: But Superior Court was a very interesting experience and like I said we traveled all over the state.  I had to go to two or three counties that I didn't get to sit in, I had never sat in.
Speaker 1: How were the cases different?
Speaker 2: The cases--yeah.
Speaker 1: Than in Municipal Court?
Speaker 2: The municipal cases, the court, the jurisdiction is very limited, civil cases is limited to $25,000 and under, and the Superior Court there is no limitation on the amount of money.  A person can sue for a million dollars or whatever, as a matter-of-fact I had heard one of the first million dollar verdict cases in the Superior Court some years ago.  They hadn't had any million dollar verdict--maybe one and this case came before me and then an auto accident case, and [The Boston] Globe was the defendant and this person was very badly injured and I think the jury came back with a $2.1 million verdict for the--which was a big verdict in those days, and they were gonna appeal it and, "It was up to you to do with it what you want.  You have a right to appeal."  And finally they settled it for a little less than but, it was just there's no limit on the jurisdiction either criminal or civil, all kinds of criminal cases, murder cases, rape cases, the whole bit.  I had heard several murder cases while I was sitting in the Superior Court.  Willie [J.] Davis, who--a black lawyer, criminal defense lawyer who I know quite well tried a number of these cases and he's has one that I had to get in Brockton [Massachusetts] that he represented the defendant and he was found guilty, and I had to sentence him for a long term, this young man but as I say, they--it was a different kind of experience and you had an opportunity to do a number of things that you couldn't do in the lower courts, and so I served there until my retirement in 1988.
Story_ID: 299932
Speaker 1: Now in reading over some of the materials that you provided for me for this [The] HistoryMakers interview, I see that you really haven't retired and that you are still quite involved in several dimensions of legal work.  So in retirement tell us what you've been doing since 1988 with regards to your profession?
Speaker 2: Okay, well right about the time I retired there seemed to be a lot of business going to retired judges sitting on civil cases.  The case load, the civil case load is so crowded in Superior Court that many times it takes close to three, four years just to get a trial and you can opt to have a trial here before a neutral, a retired judge, and in arbitration or mediation and so this was just beginning to take hold, and yet it was sort of a boon for retired judges, it gave them something to do.  It was just civil cases, and you would have to be selected by both--be approved by both the defense attorney and the, the plaintiff's attorney, and usually the insurance company is representing the defendant and so early on I would get a number of these cases to try and, and you, I--but then as time went on and as I became older they began to feel, well I was getting a little too old.  I found that I wasn't receiving the same number of cases and I'd always have to travel to where I was living at this time down in the Cape [Cape Cod, Massachusetts] area and I'd travel to Boston [Massachusetts] for maybe one or two cases a month.  It wasn't--really wasn't worth my while and finally I decided that I would give that up.  I think I did it for maybe close to ten years, the first ten years of my retirement, and but I also keep my hand and I do a little civil work, handling probate of estates for persons, families that I know they call upon me.  I don't do anything that's gonna take me into court before a judge if I can help it and so I do a little of that, enough to--'cause we're living on the same pension that we got seventeen years, with no cost of living increases so that I find that with children that I have who have problems sometimes, and grandchildren, that extra money is needed so this has helped me considerably doing the arbitration, mediation work and this work as an attorney.  So I've been busy, you know as busy as I want to be.  I'm not that busy that I--but and I still get a chance to enjoy some things that I like to do on occasion, to golf and what have you.
Story_ID: 299933
Speaker 1: You retired in 1988, your wife Barbara [Clark Elam].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Distinguished librarian in the Boston Public Schools [BPS] and I believe director of library service--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in the Boston schools.  Did she retire around that time?
Speaker 2: She retired at the same time--she had, she was retiring--she had just been appointed director of library services for the City of Boston [Massachusetts] for the public schools for the City of Boston.  She had been co-director and the other director had retired before her and even though she could have worked longer, she's younger than I am she felt that well the two of us ought to retire at the same time, but she had quite a career.  She didn't start working in the school system until after the children were sort of out of the way and she went back to work as a librarian in the Boston school system.  It started out as a librarian at the Lee School in Dorchester [Boston, Massachusetts] and moved on from there to become associate director and co-director of the program.  What they did was to empower women in the community to become pro--paraprofessionals in librarian, in libraries because there weren't enough professional librarians to serve all of the schools.  They wanted a librarian in all of the 110 schools in the city and they did eventually get one in every school, but the elementary schools and the middle schools for the most part had to use paraprofessionals.  They trained these paraprofessionals; they had a course that they would give 'em at the University of Mass [University of Massachusetts] in which they could get a college credit and some of them went on later to get college degrees and come back, and so they, so they empowered community women, they did a beautiful job in that area, and it was unfortunate when they retired that there really wasn't anybody that had that same interest to keep this thing alive.  So today I don't think the libraries, schools' library program is what it was when my wife was there to be perfectly honest with you.
Speaker 1: Given the tremendous work that she did in education in Boston as a library professional and given the intense work that you did as a lawyer and as a judge, tell me about how your wife Barbara helped and supported you in your judicial work.  What does she mean to you as you developed your profession?
Speaker 2: Oh, she, she was always there for me and she would--I would allow her to read some of these opinions that I'd have to write and I would always ask her to read them for grammatical errors or whatever and she was always very careful to make sure that I (laughter) you know punctuated properly and, and was very helpful to me in, in that area as well and was really a good mother to the kids and was always concerned about their getting a good education, made them read, the kids would always get a book for presents for birthdays, and Christmas and, "We (unclear) we always get a book" (laughter), they would complain but it paid off later on, they all went on to do well in school and college and in their professions.
Speaker 1: And I think you've demonstrated that by (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --what you told us earlier.
Speaker 2: Yeah, absolutely.
Story_ID: 299934
Speaker 1: You talked about some of your special and significant community projects, particularly Project Commitment [Inc.], which I remember, but you also came back in more recent years to honor your model, Wade [H.] McCree.  Tell us what you did at Boston Latin School [Boston, Massachusetts] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was, that was very interesting.  At Boston Latin School in the--in their school auditorium, school auditorium on the upper frieze of the auditorium there are names of distinguished, eminent graduates of the school, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, John Hancock, Benjamin Franklin, George Santayana, Joseph [P.] Kennedy, Leonard Bernstein, all white males and it was called to my attention by our good friend who is not a graduate of Latin School of course and, but did some work over there for many years--a historian named that on T--oh, Cromwell, Adelaide (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Adelaide.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Adelaide Cromwell.
Speaker 1: Cromwell.
Speaker 2: She use to teach the afterschool course to kids at the Latin School.  Harry [HistoryMaker Harry Elam], she'd call, "You know there's one space left up there in the upper frieze at Latin School, I think we gotta do something about that and certainly there are eminent black graduates at the school and I think maybe."  And I said, "I think maybe you're right, I hadn't really thought about that," and she was the catalyst that got me started.  She named some people that she felt--I said, "Really, they're good people that you've named, they're early graduates, but they don't have the kind of distinguished career that Wade McCree has."  She said okay, "Fine we'll go with Wade."  I said--one of the requirements is that the person had to be deceased and you know have and so I thought surely I would have no problem, this would be a slam dunk to get Wade McCree's name put up there along with the other eminent graduates of the school.  I wrote first to--the headmaster [Michael G. Contompasis] who was just retiring and to get his thoughts on and how would I go about it.  Never got a response from him, he's too busy to even get back to me.  Then I talked to the, the acting headmaster and a woman [Cornelia A. Kelley], she said, "Well you know what I think we're building a new library here, and I think that in the library we can have a nice dedicate area, dedicated to Wade McCree."  I said, "No, no, no, that's not what I want, I want his name up there with the other eminent graduates, that's what I really want" and so she tried to sidetrack me and whatnot, to deter me, but then I decided that I wasn't getting any--the right kind of response that I needed a team, a committee.  So I contacted a number of white alumni both, white and black alumni (unclear)--black and white alumni of Latin School that I knew and some of them lived--wherever they lived in the United States, and--about fifty of 'em and they always responded.  I told them what I'd them to do, to contact the headmaster and also the superintendent of schools and tell them why I feel that Wade McCree's name ought to be included amongst the distinguished graduates of the School on the upper frees, and they did and finally got a word, the superintendent he was very happy to do this but still the, the school, the alumni association of the school needed to vote on it and so they decided they would set up some criteria. First the person would have to wait ten years before the name would go up, then after you submit the name.  Now, nobody else--there's no other name to be considered. They haven't considered anybody for the up for the frieze since Leonard Bernstein died, his name, and his name went up there, and it's been many years so that they you know, but anyway they, they came up with a list of criteria which was crazy and of course we saw that that was voted down.  Finally, one of the upstanding graduates, white graduates of the school wrote to the association and he blasted them for not, he said, "I can't understand why you are delaying on a, on naming, giving this kind of recognition to Wade."  And he went on to tell 'em what the solicitor general does, the outstanding graduate that he was and that he deserves to be up there and because of his action, the committee decided, well we better move on this, because he had--
Story_ID: 300115
Speaker 1: So, in any event we finally convinced the alumni association [of Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts] that this recognition ought be given to Wade [H.] McCree and so we immediately went ahead to set up a ceremony in which it can be done and again I was having problems getting a date.  They first would agree on this, and that date and finally the headmaster called me and said, "Why don't we do this at one of the, at the, the time we do the public declamation.  It'll be students who will be there, there'll be the fifty year class, a twenty-five year class."  I said, "That's fine, I said we could--during while the judges are deciding, it's not, the program's not gon' take very long.  While the judges are deciding the winners of the oratorical declamation contest, we'll present our program."  So when I, so then they--okay that was agreed upon, and then I called the alumni director, I said, "Well now we gotta have a program."  So he said, "Well, I--," he said, "look, if you have any problem--I will design the program."  I designed the program and I meant that--I think I brought a copy for you here that you can look at but, and so the thing--we invited Mrs. McCree [Dores McCree], Wade's widow and his children.  He has three children, one is a judge, matter-of-fact his son [Wade McCree, Jr.] who is a judge took the same--recently was appointed judge of the same court that Wade was appointed fifty years ago.  In 1954 he was the first black judge, and his son in 1994 is appointed at that same court.  I went out for that ceremony, that was back in October of ninety--last year for that ceremony, but in any event all of the family came and we had a wonderful celebration and I got a, had an opportunity to get some things off my chest at that time and established the Wade McCree Scholarship also and we raised close to fifty thousand dollars and each year a scholarship is awarded in the name of Wade McCree, and I have never been invited to the awards program and I, I said I'm not asking to determine who the recipient is, I just think that since I was instrumental in getting the scholarship program set up that I'd like to see who the person is and, and congratulate them.  I've never received--this is the fifth year and the only reason I know who won it this year, I went to the first time to a Latin School graduation.  One of my former neighbor's child was graduating and asked me to come, would I come and what they did, they didn't have enough tickets.  They went to the headmaster, "Oh I would like for the Elams to be my guest." (Laughter) So she sent me tickets to be her guest and I met young, you know, Bob Gittins [ph.] who is--his son was the recipient of the Wade McCree Scholarship fund this--scholarship this year, Matthew Gittins [ph.] and I was pleased to know that 'cause I'd known the father and mother and what--I never would've known Bob, and I think that's so crude for them to do that kind of thing but, and I could've raised more money, but I just got disheartened when they--but at any rate that money's there and the name goes on and the scholarship goes on.  So I'm very happy, it took me three years to get the thing done, but it's done and I'm very you know very happy about it and very proud of that.

Speaker 1: Of the many recognitions that you've received, and awards, is there any one award that kind of stands out above the others to you that you feel very special about of the awards that you received?
Speaker 2: Well there have a number of them, the one that I do remember quite distinctly 'cause my good friend, Allen Monroe [ph.], who is now deceased and I received the same award at the time same the annual [Dr.] Martin Luther King Memorial Breakfast that's given each year by the two churches I believe which St. Cyprian's [Episcopal Church, Boston, Massachusetts] and Union Methodist [Union United Methodist Church, Boston, Massachusetts] and I think one year in 1978 we were selected to be the recipients of a Martin Luther King Drum Major for Justice Award and I loved of course Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and all that he did and to get that award and I just really, of the many I received that's one that I treasure.
Speaker 1: What experience and contact did you have with Martin Luther King, Jr.?
Speaker 2: Well during the time that I was counsel for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] we, they had the march on Boston [Massachusetts].  Martin Luther King came to Boston to do a march on--and at the time I had--and Dick Banks [ph.] who I was working with, we had brought suit in the superior court because of what we felt was discrimination at the--at one of the schools.  The Boardman School in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] was principally an all-black school.  Well there was a lot of construction, there was--urban renewal was going on and we felt that many of these kids could be transferred to another school, the [William Lloyd] Garrison School in Roxbury where they wouldn't have to encounter the urban renewal problems, the digging and the noise and so we, and, and we just felt that there wouldn't--the school committee decided, no that they weren't gonna do that.  So we brought suit and during, while that suit was pending Martin Luther King came here and we, Dick Banks and I invited him to come to see the inside of the school and told him what was going on and that was an opportunity I had to meet him personally and just chat with him, and of course I was thrilled and the next day was the march on Boston.  So that was my opportunity to meet and greet Martin Luther King, Jr., 1963 I remember.  And just one other thing about it.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: I remember when Martin Luther King died in 1968 I was presiding at a meeting of the Urban League [New Urban League of Greater Boston], Mel King [HistoryMaker Melvin King] was the executive director, and he got a telephone call during the meeting that Martin Luther King had been shot, and shortly thereafter that he died and it was--and so we ended the meeting and it was at an Urban League meeting when that notice came to all of us about his death.
Speaker 1: I also recall that the day after the King assassination, maybe it was in the week, I don't remember exactly, we had a riot in Roxbury.
Speaker 2: Oh, but we did.
Speaker 1: And Roxbury was burning and I remember distinctively that you were the one of the persons, lead persons out there trying to calm and counsel the community.  Tell me about that experience, 'cause I know it was.
Speaker 2: Yeah at the time I was chairman of the board of a Roxbury Multi-Service Center [Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts] and our offices were on Blue Hill Avenue and that's where much of this rioting was taking place, and I remember [HistoryMaker] Hubie Jones was the executive director at the time and some of the board members--we went over to that building and we spent the night and went out in the streets and try to calm people down.
Speaker 1: I remember.
Speaker 2: And this is not the way we ought to react 'cause we (laughter)--the response we got was--in any event we, we did the best that we could and under the circumstances, but it was a trying time but I'm glad you recall that but, I had almost forgotten that.
Speaker 1: Oh I haven't forgotten, 'cause I remember Brian Rawlings [ph.] and his, his actions and so on and it was quite a time.

Speaker 1: Judge Elam [HistoryMaker Harry Elam], you've been in Boston [Massachusetts], started your legal training at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts], extensive law practice, significant judicial appointments and a founder of the Black Judges of Massachusetts [sic. Massachusetts Black Judges Conference] and so on.  How have opportunities changed over the years for African Americans in the legal profession in Boston?
Speaker 2: Well they've changed considerably.  I think I pointed out when I came out of law school [Boston University School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts] almost fifty-five years ago now, couldn't get a job even in the Legal Aid Society and no law firm downtown would hire blacks in any capacity, but today I notice that many of the law firms, not only have black partners, but more than one, I think there are two law firms that have several, five or six black partners and the number of black associates in law firms has grown, so I, I see a major difference in the time that the practice of law--and then, then the specialties, of course everybody was a general practitioner over fifty years ago but there are so many specialties in the law today that people get into and these opportunities are there and young people seem to be taking advantage of them and they're getting good response as a result.  If a young person male or female, a black that has it, they can really move up the ladder today and I look at the judiciary.  When I came on the bench back in 1971 I believe there were three other black judges serving.  Today there must be some thirty-odd black judges serving all over the state.  So even though that's not the ultimate, it's a long ways from where we were fifty years ago, so I've seen a lot--I'm glad I'm alive to see, to have seen the progress that has been made in the law over those many years, indeed.

Speaker 1: We have some wind down questions now and the first one I wanna ask you, is there anything you'd like to add to your HistoryMaker interview that I haven't asked you about?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden], I think you've pretty much covered all bases, all of the activities that I've been involved in through the years and I can't really think of anything that we have overlooked to be sure.
Speaker 1: Why, why did you want to do this interview, I know that you were invited but why did you feel that you wanted to participate?
Speaker 2: Well, I felt this was an opportunity for me to give a wider audience to some of the things that I feel strongly about that blacks need to be helping blacks, that like Project Commitment [Inc.].  I think if we're ever able to get out of the situation that we are in, we are the ones that are gonna have to do it.  We're gonna have to help along, and I think it's so important--even I, I remember I was asked to speak at the NAACP's [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] annual Martin Luther King meeting in Cape Cod [Massachusetts] this year and my message was, I think the Bill Cosby thing, what Bill Cosby had to say about blacks was pretty much in the air and I said, well many of the things that Bill Cosby has said maybe--he may be on tag with it for the most part, but he's not providing any answers.  I think what we have to do--is yes there are many reasons for the problem.  They are not limited to what Bill Cosby talked about but I think we have to find some answers and one of the ways is through projects like this Project Commitment I talked about and I told 'em about it.  That we professionals who have the opportunities, who've done well and we've moved out the community, we need to come back into the community and give some time.  Talk to these young people, let them know these opportunities are--they can make it and then, then, you know the education is not a white thing.  I mean we've always wanted, I remember as kids our parents wanted education for our people so that we, we--what we have to make the difference.  So I would like to see much more of that.  That's why I'm glad you're giving me this kind of audience 'cause I think there's so many of our professionals who there who forget where they came from.  I look at--I use to say that many of our black judges you know when they get they use their blackness to get appointed, then they forget once they're on the bench that they're still black you know and there are problems out there.  So you couldn't probably name more than five out of the thirty-five judges, black judges that are sitting and I don't think anybody could 'cause you don't hear anything about them.  You know they're not active in the community, they live in--they don't live in the Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] area, and I'm not saying they should live in the Rox- wherever they live but they still could spend some time there where the problems are.  So this is why I'm glad I was given this opportunity to be a HistoryMaker.

Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way that you have lived your life so far?
Speaker 2: Well I feel quite gratified, I, I feel that I've been very fortunate in many, many respects.  The church [St. Mark Congregational Church United Church of Christ, Dorchester, Massachusetts] has helped me, working in the church and giving to the church.  How the church has really nurtured me and others and, and the people in the church supported me when I started my law practice.  They supported me when I wanted to become a judge.  That, that--so, I'm, I'm very grateful for all of these things that happened.  They happened at a time when you know [Great] Depression years and things were really pretty bad but with the help of other people, the support of other people I was able to, to attain a career and to move on and to do things that, that I feel good about and I'm pleased that the Good Lord has given me time, even at this age to continue to do things.  I'm looking at number eighty-four coming up and I, I feel in reasonably good health.  I've been very fortunate health wise.  I haven't had any serious illness.  I've had illnesses and I've had problems and other things to deal with but so how I've been able to do that and still carry on, and what the (laughter)--some of my friends say, "Well who's gonna speak for you when you know?  You're always speaking at funerals for some other friends."  John O'Bryant, Arnold James, Ronald Griffith and so many of my friends of the past and given the opportunity to eulogize them at their funerals.  "Who's gonna speak for you?"  I said, "Well my children will speak for me" (laughter).  I said, I don't worry who's gonna speak for me, but it's been a great life, Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden], great journey.  I have a beautiful wife [Barbara Clark Elam] of fifty-five years and my children and grandchildren, I'm proud of, so I couldn't have asked for more.
Speaker 1: But on--
Speaker 2: Good friends.
Speaker 1: But on top of all that, let me ask you this, what do you still wanna do that you have not yet done?
Speaker 2: Well I would like to just watch and be able to support my young grandchild.  I have two generations of grandchildren.  The oldest is twenty-three and the youngest two are four and five, and just watching those youngsters, the little ones and my, my--the youngest of the four was living with us for a while and how he loves books.  Can't read yet, but you'd think he was reading he gets books, books and, and sit and look at pictures and--when and just, just enjoys that and just--seems that there's a lot of potential that there I could see that coming just--and so I'd like to live long enough to see my younger grandchildren grow up and see what they're gonna do with their lives.  That's all I and then be able to help them and see them on occasion.  They all live distances from me now, my family is trying to get us to move closer to where they live in the Maryland area in the [Washington] D.C. area, so that may happen.
Speaker 1: Who knows?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Last question, last question, how do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  As somebody who gave the best that he had to make this a better place for all of us, and that's all I would have to say.
