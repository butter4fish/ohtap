My mother [Anana Kambon] was one of those people, mother and father [Kwame Kambon], who decided to change their names to feel more connected to their African descent and therefore decided that they wanted their children to also have the same, the same kind of name or African inspired name.

Speaker 1: And where?
Speaker 2: Baltimore [Maryland] sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now how far back can you trace your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Probably as to my great, my great-great-grandfather, great-great-grandfather.
Speaker 1: Do you know his name or any stories about him?
Speaker 2: I don't know many stories about him.  You know I have pictures of him but no I, I to be truthfully honest I really don't know much about him.  Yeah I don't.  I think, I mean what I know about him has pretty much been consistent with what I know about our family and that in or that side of the family that everybody was close knit.  We're pretty much our family name is Proctor so the Proctors are pretty significant, have a significant presence in the Prince George's County of, of Maryland to this day.  And I do know that we on both sides we had a strong presence of Native American there.  My, see I'm sketchy 'cause I know that my great-grandfather I guess the generation before you know those were--that was slavery you know.  So during that time was when we--the Native American, the Anglo Saxon, the mix you know that, that's when that mix happened because my great-grandfather on my, my mother's side is extremely light, light extremely light so much so that when he was growing up he would actually pass for being white.  But to know exactly where the mix was, I'm not sure about that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay is there a story passed down about what the end of slavery life was for your great-great-grandfather or in what capacity he served you know 'cause some people worked in the fields, some worked in the house you know or some were had trades you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, no, no from what I know they weren't field workers partly because as I said my, my great-grandfather didn't look as if he was, he was black so he would--so even my [maternal] grandfather [Leon J. Proctor] did the same thing.  He could sometimes pass you know for being white you know.
Speaker 1: Okay so the implication being they were in close proximity to the white people that owned them too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would, I would say so.  Yeah I would say so um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, but there're no stories passed down about what he did right after slavery, if he left the land that he was born on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That I wouldn't--
Speaker 1: --that if he went to town or was a farmer or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did your great-grandfather do?  Was he a farmer or did he live in--
Speaker 2: My great-grandfather?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: My great father--great-grandfather hm, I'm stumped.  Like I said I didn't have much interaction with him so I don't know what, what he did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 509073
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But they [Kambon's maternal family] were all out in Prince George's County [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: In Prince George's County, yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, which is a suburb of Washington, D.C. now I guess but.
Speaker 2: Yeah it's kind of like it's in between yeah it's in between D.C. and Baltimore [Maryland].  It's, it's a country.  I mean it's a country though that part is Brandywine [Maryland] and PG County which if you know anybody goes to Brandywine know the Proctors are a very strong presence there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did they have land there?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: A farm or something (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yeah they had I don't know if it's farm.  I don't know they were farming like I said you know I don't, I don't remember that, I don't recall any trips that I took to the country.  We weren't on a farm you know.  We were--the country was it was the country.  You know the trees you know but no they weren't farmers.
Speaker 1: Okay so they didn't live off the land or anything?
Speaker 2: No, not that I know of.
Story_ID: 509074
Speaker 1: Well are there any stories from that side of the family that are passed down? Did--was your mother [Anana Kambon] raised in Prince George's County [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: My mother was raised in Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So basically my grandfather [Leon J. Proctor] and grandmother [Yolanda Proctor] on my mother's side--well my grandfather was the first of the family to actually leave Prince George's County.  He attended Morgan State University [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] where he met my grandmother and from there they moved to Baltimore with--yeah they moved to Baltimore and that's where our family roots pretty much you know started in the city you know with the next generation settle their roots.  And from there you know we had cousins that also were but that was on my grandmother's side of the family but for the most part my, my grandfather's sisters and yeah my grandfather's sisters and brothers all stayed in Prince George's County.  So growing up I was from Baltimore, but we knew PG County as the country and that's where all of our--you know my mother's or my grandfather's folks were you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what did your mother say about growing up you know about school and the neighborhood that she grew up in?
Speaker 2: Well Baltimore on the east side of Baltimore at that time was a great time.  I mean we as African Americans had especially in areas like that on the east side and there're a lot of areas in Baltimore, but it was a very close knit area.  My mother came from a household of five kids but everybody was connected.  You know we had cousins that lived up the street you know everybody all the neighbors knew each other, it was a very close knit.  But at the same time, my mother and her brother and her siblings were exposed to private school and so they went to--my mother attended Mercy High School [Baltimore, Maryland] and so she was aware of the different dynamics that existed as a result of, as a result of--the result of segregation that you know happened before, before her time (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 509075
Speaker 1: Now was she [Kambon's mother, Anana Kambon] Catholic or did she just go to Catholic school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They grew up as Catholic.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, they grew up as Catholics.
Speaker 1: All right.  What church did they go to do you know?
Speaker 2: Was it St., St. Ann's [St. Ann Catholic Church, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 1: That sounds like right.
Speaker 2: St. Anne's, I wanna say St. Anne's or St. Mark's [ph.].  St. Anne's, yeah you know I'm not sure.  Because interesting enough I didn't grow up as Catholic so and after she left or graduated from high school [Mercy High School, Baltimore, Maryland], she didn't, she didn't live by Catholicism or anything like that.  Although I do have an aunt [Gwynette Proctor] who is a nun so, a Catholic nun, so um-hm.
Story_ID: 509076
Speaker 1: Well, are there any stories that your mother [Anana Kambon] shared with you about her life growing up or what it was like for her in the--
Speaker 2: As far as?
Speaker 1: Growing up in Baltimore [Maryland]?  I mean did, you know, what did she like to do?  Did she have any particular talents, gifts or, or what her friends were like or anything?
Speaker 2: Well I mean there was--her experience was, was pretty diverse.  I mean I think that probably one of the things that's more significant than anything is the fact that there was a strong connection in, in the African American community and that's something that's we, we don't tend to see as much like that anymore where the support. I mean when you think of things like the Harlem Renaissance and you hear about the camaraderie and the kind of family unit that was established during that time between artists, a lot of that existed in families because the political climate I think really encouraged us to be that way you know.  Encouraged us to support one another you know from a family unit you know and the political dynamics you know really encouraged that.  So I think that when, when my mother ever talks about her experience growing up, she always talks about you know the kinds of you know interaction she had with her cousins you know and the family units that were always there, going here, going on this trip with the cousins and everybody was together and then, and then she would talk about how she would have that but then she would go to high school where it was a lot different because you know you had, it was a predominantly white school and so the dynamic was, was drastically different than you know being, being at home or being around your, around your cousins.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now she, she came of age during the time of the urban rebellions, death of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know did she talk about that kind of thing to you about you know did she?
Speaker 2: Yeah I mean there was no way that you couldn't be affected you know, by the time.  I think that my mother's political involvement really happened in the '70s [1970s].  I mean I think that the '50s [1950s] and the '60s [1960s] it was her time when she was--well the '60s [1960s] she was a teen but that was her parents' [Yolanda Proctor and Leon J. Proctor] time to really get politically active.  It was in the '70s [1970s] that she really started to hone in.  I mean the early twenties, late teens you know when she really became active and really started to articulate you know her voice politically you know.  And you know that was yeah that was just after you know Malcom X was, was assassinated and there were a lot of things that were happening in the late '60s [1960s] and that encouraged her to, to get involved.
Speaker 1: Yeah Malcom X in '65 [1965], Dr. King in '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know there were riots in Baltimore right after Dr. King was killed.  I just wondered what you know her impressions of some of those things were.  But, tell us, tell now tell us about your--oh what year did your mother graduate from Mercy [Mercy High School, Baltimore, Maryland]?  Was it about '71 [1971] or so?
Speaker 2: Maybe '70 [1970], maybe I couldn't tell you for sure.  Yeah I couldn't tell you for sure.
Speaker 1: Fifty-three [1953] seems like it would be about '71 [1971].
Story_ID: 509077
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Kwame Sietu Kambon [Kwame Kambon], that's Kwame, K-W-A-M-E, Sietu is, S-I-E-T-U, Kambon, K-A-M-B-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay now do you feel free to give us his given name or you think we should leave that alone?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean to be truthfully honest you know I didn't have you know much contact with my father so I can't give you much information.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, it's an interesting name.  I know his middle name means artist, Sietu.
Speaker 2: And he was an artist um-hm.
Speaker 1: So that makes you know and his--what was his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Well Baltimore, Maryland, 7/26/50 [July 26, 1950] I think 1950.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Or '51 [1951], maybe '51 [1951] yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know much about your father's family history, how far they go back (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't, I didn't have much contact with my, my father's family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is it your impression that his family was--had been in Baltimore a long time or?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, definitely, definitely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what--did you know your grandparents on your father's side?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have you know any, any interaction with them?
Speaker 1: Well what happened to him?  I mean tell us what happened to him?
Speaker 2: I mean it's a classic story.  I think you know you have you know I really can't tell you.  I mean I really can't tell you what, what--I think that you know some, sometimes that in, in families we get--you just kind of move to that next chapter a little sooner than you're able to, than you're really for it and maybe you know he just had you know some, some personal issues that he needed to deal with and that's what he did.  But I really can't tell you, I have no idea.
Speaker 1: So he wasn't around at all when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Was he in Baltimore?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you meet him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah when I was younger you know I spent you know spent time with him.  You know there were certain things that I mean since he was an artist and I'm a musician, there was a certain connection there that you know I can remember as, as a little kid but you're talking about after seven, six or seven years old you know just not really having any, any contact at all.  So the kinds of things that I would remember are very rudimentary I mean very so.
Speaker 1: So were your parents together until you were about seven or did you just meet him (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Until about five yeah.
Speaker 1: Until about five.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: But he was around until you were about seven.  I mean where you had interaction?
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly, yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Then there was no more interaction?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is he still alive?
Speaker 2: I don't know to tell you the truth yeah; I do not know you know.  Yeah, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now did he go to high school in Baltimore too?
Speaker 2: He went to I mean you're, you're probing and I'm sorry, but I just, I don't have the answers you know.  Yeah I really don't know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  I don't know the public high school for where he grew up was?  I don't know where--I know Dunbar [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar High School for Health Professionals, Baltimore, Maryland]--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is a school a lot of people went to and I don't know a lot of the schools like I say.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know, I mean I know all of the schools in Baltimore (laughter), won't help me out in this one.
Story_ID: 509078
Speaker 1: So the grand- you never had much interaction with the [paternal] grandparents either or they never--
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any uncles or aunts or anything that you recognize on that side I mean on his side?
Speaker 2: There, there was a time when you know there was an attempt for you know just as a family unit you know because family's always been important on my mother's [Anana Kambon] side.  There's always, there was always a strong attention and effort to really promote family.  So early on, my mother definitely was--wanted to promote me being--and my brother [Khari Kambon], because I have a brother also, having as much contact as we could with our cousins on my father's [Kwame Kambon] side, but it didn't quite, we didn't quite gel I guess you know and it's interesting we're talking about this because I think that a lot of times, when you're talking about you know family history, I don't know the answers, I can't tell you why there wasn't any you know interaction okay.  I do know that I think historically that our history has influenced how you work or not work as a family you know.  Whether that's because of you know, you know being mentally bruised or whether that's because you know certain traits that you learn just by you know as you, as you grow up or that you learn from your parents or whatever.  But I you know I can't really tell you exactly you know I can't give you information as to, as to why or you know what I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Even that because you can't that's says something about you know how you came up in a way that you don't--that you can't you know.  I mean it has something to do with how you're made up now (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 509079
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Anana Kambon and Kwame Kambon] met that they passed that they passed down (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The movement.  They met through the movement yeah.
Speaker 1: Were they in a particular organization at the time?
Speaker 2: At the time Dr. Ron Karenga [HistoryMaker Maulana Karenga] he was establishing you know, Nguzo Saba and you know Kwanzaa and every, everything related to that.  There was Amiri Baraka all of these people who were in this network at the--there were a lot of people who were there in this, in this movement network and my mother was part of it as a student.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was she a part of a group that was in Congress of Afrikan People?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Does that sound right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah okay.
Speaker 2: Yep sure was.
Speaker 1: Now Maulana Karenga he was incarcerated in '71 [1971] but Amiri Baraka took his message and--
Speaker 2: Wait a minute, is this a history lesson (laughter)?
Speaker 1: No people of Congress of Afrikan People, some people don't know.  I don't know.
Speaker 2: No, I don't mean, believe me (laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm just, I'm just trying--
Speaker 2: No, no, I'm just messing with you.
Speaker 1: --fill in for anybody you know who watches this in the future--
Speaker 2: I'm just messing with you.
Speaker 1: --to just let 'em know what situation--
Speaker 2: No, I'm just messing with you.
Speaker 1: --this is, because it's unique.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know it's unique.  And not everybody came through the same thing your parents came through with--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: The Congress of Afrikan People.
Speaker 2: Well that's the thing, I mean and it's important to note too that you know when in, in that movement I mean in fact James Mtume, you know Mtume, James Mtume was at my naming ceremony you know and--
Speaker 1: What is--their family name is?  Is that I think related to the Heath [Heath Brothers]--Mtume is a--yeah I know James Mtume.
Speaker 2: Yeah the musician, musician yeah.  But there was a strong network of people that because of the movement came together that's what I'm saying you know there's like a, there's a group of people who were together during the '50s [1950s] and the '60s [1960s] you know Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] movement, the Civil Rights Movement.  In the '70s [1970s] it was also that movement too that my mother was more a part of you know and you know the studying and celebrating Kwanzaa and studying Swahili and I mean those were all things that were part of you know our existence at that time.
Speaker 1: Was your mother a part of the independent school movement with--I know there's an independent school in Baltimore [Maryland], no Washington [D.C.], that's (unclear).  I don't know who it was in Baltimore but was she part of the independent black school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Or an organization that any specific organization that you know?  Because there were organizations all over the place.
Speaker 2: Yeah she you know I don't remember the name off the top of my head and it's interesting because it was something that was like I would just say off the tip of my tongue all the time you know because--
Speaker 1: In Chicago [Illinois] you had the Institute for Positive Education [sic. Institute of Positive Education], Ahidiana [Ahidiana Work Study Center] in New Orleans [Louisiana], the Center for Black Education in D.C. (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I don't know.
Speaker 1: These are all organizations Uhuru Sasa [Uhuru Sasa Shule] in Brooklyn [New York] you know so I just wondered which one you know well I guess somebody you know if anybody's interested in pursuing it further, they can look it up but basically I was just trying to get some of that.
Story_ID: 509080
Speaker 1: Oh I was asking before we ended the last tape so was there any story that your mother [Anana Kambon] told you or that your father [Kwame Kambon] told you about how they met or what the circumstances were?
Speaker 2: Well it was, it was through the movement.  My father was a teacher.  He was teaching Swahili and they--she met at--met him at one of the classes and that was how, how they met.  That was the beginning.
Speaker 1: Okay now was he a student at Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] or any of the--Coppin State [Coppin State College; Coppin State University, Baltimore, Maryland] or any schools around?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I wouldn't know.
Speaker 1: So you don't know where he learned to teach Swahili or?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah he taught himself.  That's how he learned.
Speaker 1: He taught himself?
Speaker 2: He taught himself yeah.  He taught himself how to speak Korean and Swahili, those were his two languages.
Speaker 1: Now did he serve in the [U.S.] military at all or was he a Vietnam [Vietnam War] vet or?
Speaker 2: He wasn't in Vietnam but I have a feeling he did serve in some capacity but I'm not sure.  I'm not sure because yeah I have recollection that he did serve in some capacity but I'm, I'm not sure, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 509081
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest memory of growing up I mean as a, I mean what's your earliest memory period of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory, earliest memory.  I guess one of my earliest memories was I had mentioned before about the connection, the family connection that my mother [Anana Kambon] had growing up on the east side of Baltimore [Maryland] and my brother [Khari Kambon] and I growing up with more contact with my mother's side of the family we were always, my grandmother [Yolanda Proctor] lived on the east side of Baltimore and we had so many great memories there on the east side of Baltimore in The Alameda you know on the east side.  And I guess the earliest memory that I remember is you know just playing out although we didn't have cousins that were around our same age when we were growing up the--you, you had a sense that there was a strong you know community, that eyes were always watching you and you know friendly, friendly eyes, the neighbors you know were always watching you you know and we would go up to our neighbor but it was Uncle Bunny [ph.], it wasn't the neighbor it was Uncle Bunny and you know that's something that, that is a strong memory you know and my grandmother doesn't live in that house any more now but that was a very strong memory you know being there and kind of being a part of that community and feeling the warmth from the community and that was the whole block actually.  I mean we knew--we were at you figure there were probably about twenty houses on one block and you would go up and down the street and the people at the top of the block knew the people down at the bottom of the block and it's amazing.  I mean that is something that I never thought about it before now, but that was definitely a strong memory.
Story_ID: 509082
Speaker 1: We always ask this question, what was some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds?  Wow.  Well I mentioned the, the sandwich (laughter), the turkey sandwich my father [Kwame Kambon] actually would make this turkey sandwich and for some reason it was, it was definitely, it's definitely nostalgic you know definitely brings a certain kind of connection or makes me nostalgic about the time that I did spend you know with him.  In Baltimore [Maryland] it's, it's a small city but it has a sound.  You know the sound of the, the sound of movement and as I grew up I realized that I was definitely a city boy you know.  I you know even although I may go to the mountains or I might like going to the country for some solace, the movement is something or the sounds of movement is something that I really felt peace in you know.  I'm going to New York [New York] and I was energized by the movement you know by.  I'm trying to think of--another sound that was kind of endearing growing up is and this would only happen every, every seven years is we have this thing called the cicadas--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: --and when the cicadas come, that's something that's very Baltimore; it's very you know Atlantic you know at that time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Those, those insects that look like locusts or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're like locust and they do terrible, smell terrible you know but that is one sound and they make this very high pitched screeching noise you know it's annoying you know.  But having said that it's something that when I think of Baltimore, that's something that I remember.  You know that's a sound that I remember.  I remember that time.  I mean there are lots of things the fireflies you know growing up.  We would catch fireflies all the time.  These sound very, very rudimentary and simple but endearing nonetheless you know endearing, endearing times you know growing up in Baltimore you know.

Speaker 1: Now is the east side, is that I know Edmondson Avenue is one of the main drags someplace in Baltimore [Maryland] but I'm not--I'm kind of disoriented in terms of Baltimore, was that, was that the main drag through where you lived?
Speaker 2: That, well west coast--where I lived (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know where I lived--
Speaker 1: Yeah where you grew up.
Speaker 2: --where I grew up I was between Pikesville [Maryland] and Cheswolde [Baltimore, Maryland] which is just north, just north of Pimlico [Baltimore, Maryland] yeah just north of, of Pimlico so it's like north--west of Pimlico.
Speaker 1: Is this like the traditional black neighborhood in Baltimore or is it different kind of neighborhood?  I know I been around Union Baptist Church [Baltimore, Maryland] the sort of thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it's, it's different I mean--
Speaker 1: Is it near there?
Speaker 2: --actually you know tradition when the African Americans were kind of settled in the, in the east side you know west Cold Spring [Baltimore, Maryland] of course North Avenue down like we lived in Eutaw Place you know that was kind of weird where we lived.  When we moved, we were kind of like see it wasn't a suburb because we were still in the city but it was going northwest, northwest of the city which was a bit different.  The, the area was predominantly well at that time it was Orthodox Jewish and African American you know and now it's more Orthodox Jew- Jewish.
Speaker 1: Okay.  About how old were you when your family moved there?
Speaker 2: I was five.
Speaker 1: Five okay so you grew up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, so I grew up there.
Speaker 1: You grew up basically.
Speaker 2: I grew up there you know and would always go back to the east side because my [maternal] grandmother [Yolanda Proctor] was there.  I mean it's only fifteen minutes away.  I actually went to school on the east side although it was a private school but it was on the east side.  But you know so I knew the east side and that would be like near Morgan State [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] you know like The Alameda, East Cold Spring [Lane] that area.  I'm not far from, from Loch Raven [Baltimore, Maryland].  I knew that area as that was my east side home and then my west side home was you know where I grew up.

Speaker 1: You've got a brother [Khari Kambon]?  It's just the two of you?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And how far apart are you?
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: Two years.
Speaker 2: Two years um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm yeah.  So we're--
Speaker 1: So what kinds of things did you like to do growing up?  What were your favorite things?
Speaker 2: Ironically enough I mean you know music was, since I was two years old, was definitely a strong influence you know in my life.  I did the same thing that other kids do you know with the athletics or baseball that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: When did you--now in fact there's a note here that you were like a child prodigy way back but how--you were two years old?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It was noted that you had some musical ability?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Or you knew you did?
Speaker 2: Yeah my mother [Anana Kambon] was aware.  She, she was a teacher and was very kind of--was very aware of, of children and being--she had a barometer for having a sense of where children's talents lie you know and she's an amazing teacher.  Actually my whole family is teachers.  My [maternal] grandmother [Yolanda Proctor] is a teacher, my aunt's [Gwynette Proctor] a teacher.
Speaker 1: Now you didn't tell us your mother now, where did she go to college?
Speaker 2: She went to Coppin [Coppin State College; Coppin State University, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Coppin State.
Speaker 2: Yeah Coppin State um-hm.
Speaker 1: She taught in high school or grade school level?
Speaker 2: She taught in preschool.
Speaker 1: Oh?
Speaker 2: Yeah she was preschool.  She started off as a preschool teacher and that's why I say she was very in tune you know with, with kids you know and having a sense of what they were attracted to.  She used to tell a story that or still tells a story now that she would you know push me in a stroller at eighteen months and I would say, "You know shut up dog, shut up dog," and she's like, "Camara [HistoryMaker Camara Kambon] what are, what are you talking?"  And it would be a dog that was like around the corner, down the street, I would hear and I was talking to this dog and I would hear this dog you know like and she's like, "I don't even hear."  And it was things like that, that she would say that she tells a story about how when I was little and I didn't know the names of songs that I, that I wanted to hear but I knew my colors.  So for instance I would tell her, "Okay I wanna hear (humming)," and I would say purple because the label on the record of Motown [Motown Records] was purple and so I would tell her purple you know or I would say you know (humming) which was the Bee Gees and it was a pig because RSO [RSO Records] at that time had a pig on it.  And I would say oh it's the pig you know and that's what I would and I had a turntable and so it was little things like that that gave her the hint that okay this, this kid is you know is into music you know.
Speaker 1: So music was--there's a lot of music in the house I guess I'm getting that.  There were some records around for you to listen to and, and they were playing I guess a lot.
Speaker 2: Well yeah, yeah, we, we definitely were an artistic family.  You know my mother you know was a dancer.  My father [Kwame Kambon] you know was an artist and he taught himself how to paint.  He didn't go to school.  My brother is an artist also so that was definitely in, in the blood you know needless to say.
Story_ID: 509085
Speaker 1: Did you hear a wide variety of music growing up in the home (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh from, I mean from Bob Marley, to the Bee Gees to John Coltrane to all kinds of music you know, all kinds.  You know Dollar Brand [Abdullah Ibrahim] to I mean, I mean a lot of different music you know.  Yeah a lot of different music.  Nat King Cole I mean all of the jazz greats.  So, so it was actually very eas- well not easy, that's not the right word, it was, it wasn't a surprise that when I had the opportunity to meet and play with you know people like Ahmad Jamal and Dizzy Gillespie, and, and [HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins and all of these people that are amazing legends that I felt at home because I had been hearing them and listening to them you know.  As I grew up you know listening to you know jazz tunes on the radio and saying awe that's Dizzy playing you know and waiting for the radio to say that was, 'A Night in Tunisia' you know and I said yes I you know yeah so.
Speaker 1: Yeah you had decent radio stations too.  I know a friend of mines (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --brother in Chicago [Illinois]--brother in Baltimore [Maryland] well Masona Lasona [ph.] used to play music at Morgan State [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] used to have a radio show.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  That radio show 88.9 [WEAA Radio, Baltimore, Maryland] it was the radio station you know, it was the radio station.  I grew up--I mean I had fond memories of Kweisi MFume doing his radio show 'Two Way Talk' you know and, and in between that you know playing music and we--I grew up listening to that radio station.  I mean that was the station that I grew up listening to and influence and especially because you know as I grew up, grew older and started to perform in the, in the club scene in Baltimore I would hear myself on the radio too you know because they would do you know different recordings, different broadcasts you know of musicians in the city so it's a great, great time (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 509086
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let's go back a little bit now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what was your first instrument as such, when did you first start, what did you first play?
Speaker 2: I, I started playing drums initially and I think a lot of that came out of again you know the movement, the drum was the instrument that was used whenever we had circles, we had drum circles.
Speaker 1: Okay so you talking about African drums?  You talking traps, you're talking about like--
Speaker 2: Yeah like congas, congas and djembe yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  So did you make your own djembe?  Did you have a group that actually could make the djembes and the junjungs?
Speaker 2: I didn't, I didn't make my own, they would give it to me.  And actually early on I don't know how it came--I was studying trap drums and piano but for some reason I gravitated towards the piano.  I don't remember why but I did.  I gravitated towards the piano and it--something just clicked for me on the piano.  I mean I was reading at five years old you know like reading legit you know charts you know at five years old and it was just something that I, I just knew.  I just it clicked for me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did you--I mean did somebody teach you how to read the--
Speaker 2: Well initially, initially I went to a, to a teacher so and yeah she introduced me to like I had my, my lead sheets but from there it was interesting because my ear was so good that I could play something once and memorize it and you know just play it again.  My teacher noticed that I was memorizing things you know so fast and I, I can't remember how she encouraged me to read but I just remember read this, we went through it and I just got it, it just made sense to me.  It was very, music is very mathematical you know and so mathematics was always something that I really enjoyed and, and--
Speaker 1: About how old were you I'm sorry when you started reading (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Five.
Speaker 1: Five years old?
Speaker 2: Five.  This is five years old yeah.
Speaker 1: A lot of kids can't, can't read you know words at five but you're reading music (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I mean this--yeah, five years old and it was, it was interesting because I have, I have a daughter who's seven now and she actually, she started when she was four you know around the same time you know and I think of what I was reading at five and how it clicked for me in comparison to what she's reading now and I can't believe well wait a minute, how it's one of those things.  You can't explain.  How is a kid at five years old just able to just understand you know and just get you know well okay that's a C, oh, well that's a C, that's a E and it just clicked for me.
Story_ID: 509087
Speaker 1: What was your favorite music in those days when you were five?  I mean do you remember?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I know I listened to a lot of, a lot of Dizzy [Dizzy Gillespie].  I listened to a lot of Coltrane [John Coltrane].  I listened to a lot of Bob Marley then.  I mean like I have fond memories of 'A Love Supreme' you know, you know I have fond memories of listening to it, 'My Favorite Things' also the--my teacher [Odell Wilson] introduced me to a lot of, of music then and we were also studying Agnihotra which was a Yoruba, you know, part of a Yoruba religion.
Speaker 1: Perhaps I think I believe now I don't wanna freak you out here but that was Fred Clifton I believe in Baltimore [Maryland] that was involved with--Lucille Clifton's son [sic. husband].
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  Was it really?
Speaker 1: Yeah Fred Clifton was a Agnihotra leader I think for Baltimore as the Chicago [Illinois]--Baltimore is (unclear) told me.
Speaker 2: Really, I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: Yeah Lucille Clifton was a very good mentor to a lot of the people--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that came to Chicago.
Speaker 2: That's interesting.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well that was, that was a great, great time.
Speaker 1: Well now Agnihotra what exactly did you understand Agnihotra to be?
Speaker 2: Well for a five year old I mean basically what we were doing is I mean we didn't actually study Agnihotra, but what we did is it was, it was--I was in a band at five that was found--that was established by my music teacher and she basically put five or six of her students that were exceptional together and we performed.  Basically, we--part of our whole study, musical study is really studying self and being connected to self.  The music really comes from the inner you, you know, your ability to express really comes from that.  Without really understanding what Agnihotra is for us we would do our chants to prepare us for our performances and that was a way for us to really get focused and really get settled and go from there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, now--
Story_ID: 509088
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I just wanna make sure that people understand that are watching us understand and that even that I understand it, this is, this is we're not talking about a public school we're talking about, we're talking about a private school right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And we're talking about a probably independent black school in the sense that I don't know if that's the best way to frame it or what, but this is a community supported school right that has?
Speaker 2: Well actually no this is a private instructor.  A private instructor who, Odell Wilson was her name and she basically had a private--she was a private teacher who incorporated some of the--so this was set in parcel from, separate from traditional in my school you know my day to day schooling you know.  This was you know like now--
Speaker 1: So did you go to public school?
Speaker 2: Yeah I went to public school at this time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And then I went to--and I had my private instruction also.
Speaker 1: Was this like after school program sort of thing or was it on Saturdays or what?
Speaker 2: Yeah it was extracurricular.  I mean if you yeah.
Speaker 1: So after school program--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --after you got out of public school you go to in the evening to Ms. Wilson's class?
Speaker 2: Right or which you know on a Saturday.  Yeah it was just extracurricular activity that you know I would have my private lessons and yeah so I would go to--
Speaker 1: And that's where you would do the drumming and the--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Learn how to play the keyboards and--.
Speaker 2: Yeah it was piano, it was piano class.  Yeah so piano instruction and instead of going to Peabody Conservatory [Peabody Conservatory of Music; Peabody Institute, Baltimore, Maryland] as I did later, I would go to my teacher Odell Wilson and we would have piano class there.
Speaker 1: Now was she connected with Agnihotra movement?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was.  And that's how the introduction was made.  Yeah she yeah um-hm that's how the introduction was.
Speaker 1: Okay I just wanted to make sure it was clear--
Speaker 2: Yeah um-hm.
Speaker 1: I knew it wasn't a public school situation, I mean, not that part of it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah that would be interesting (laughter).
Speaker 1: So it seemed like they would--it seemed like what she was teaching was beyond what you probably could get in a public school or way beyond if you read music at age five.  Now were you--
Speaker 2: Well I think you know there's a lot to be said for I mean there's--I think a portion of it is teaching.  I think a lot of it is just who you are.  I mean perfect example, I mentioned my father [Kwame Kambon], he was an artist you know.  He was born an artist.  I mean he that's just what he was you know.  I was a musician.  I was born a musician so you say hey here's some music because I'm a musician, that makes sense to me to look at the music and be able to translate it and make sense of it you know and that's what's really amazing about when you talk about prodigies which I definitely was a prodigy you know something just clicked there for me and it all made sense and I felt at home and I continue to feel that way you know with music.
Story_ID: 509089
Speaker 1: Now was there a period of time when the public, general public or the neighborhood figured out that you were a prodigy and--
Speaker 2: Yeah after they started seeing articles of me in the papers I mean.
Speaker 1: Was there a time in the paper, when did the paper figure it out?  I mean The Baltimore Sun I guess right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, The Sun the Afro-American newspaper [Baltimore Afro-American; Afro-American Newspapers] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you appear in the Afro-American first or?
Speaker 2: No.  I, I can't tell you I don't remember yeah.
Speaker 1: But the paper started noticing you?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I guess.
Speaker 2: I mean yeah that was in its earliest--
Speaker 1: Now were you exceptional for that class of students?  Were you I mean were the other students you know reading music too at age five that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, these were--this was a group of exceptional kids.  I mean like there was a guitar player I can't remember his name, but this guy was ridiculous.  I mean he--I learned so much from him you know.  He was, what was his name?  I can't remember.  But we were all very accom- accomplished you know musicians.  I mean for--it's all relative you know for our age you know but you figure we're all--I mean I'm five, six you know seven years old and you know these other kids were probably in their teens, twelve, thirteen, fourteen but we all had a connection because our--we were extremely proficient relative to our age on our instruments you know.
Speaker 1: Okay so you would actually perform as a, as a group?
Speaker 2: Um-hm exactly.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Would you for special community events or did you have a concert (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All different kinds of things you know events, you know special events, churches, events at you know the community roller skate rink, I mean all kinds of things you know.
Speaker 1: Was there a name for the group?
Speaker 2: It's called Satyadharma.
Speaker 1: Okay you have to spell that for me man.
Speaker 2: S-A-T-Y-A-D-H-A-R-M-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Satyadharma. Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Satyadharma.
Story_ID: 509090
Speaker 1: I know during the mid-'70s [1970s] there were albums that appeared with Alice Coltrane where she--'Journey in Satchidananda' and she was studying with Hindu--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --yeah.  Did that have any influence on I mean was there any connection between what you all were doing and what Alice Coltrane was doing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I wouldn't know.  I wouldn't know I was too young.  I mean like I said for me it was just a routine that you know that I had become familiar with.  You know ironically enough later when I actually moved to, to Los Angeles [California], I actually met Ms. Coltrane and actually before I met her--Ms. Coltrane she's something else.  I mean something else.  I mean you talk about the, just the spirit exuding you know just from a person.  It was ironic because it felt--meeting her felt like the same feeling we got when we were chanting and because there's such a presence you know there but at any rate and having seeing her and meeting her that brought me back to that time when, when I was studying you know music just, just starting out.
Speaker 1: So you were--it was much later that you met Alice Coltrane?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah that was a long time afterwards.
Speaker 1: About what year did you meet her?  Or how about how old were you?  You had already moved out to Los Angeles right?
Speaker 2: Yes I was in Los Angeles already.
Speaker 1: So this was your mid-twenties (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That had to be when I first got here so I was twenty-three maybe, yeah twenty-three.
Speaker 1: That was about 1995 I guess, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 509091
Speaker 1: Now you're in a situation where at a certain--at age seven your mother [Anana Kambon] basically is raising you by herself right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. Were they--well what were things like?  I mean were there any other--was there any other male role models around that you related to as mentors in those days other than you know?
Speaker 2: Well I had, I had my uncles.  You know I had my grandfather [Leon J. Proctor] who was definitely a role model.  I was extremely close--my grandfather since passed on my mother's side but I was extremely close with my mother's side of the family you know.  So my uncles and my grandfather, those were the, the male role models that that I look to.
Story_ID: 509092
Speaker 1: Now where did you go to grade school?  What was the name of your grade school?
Speaker 2: Grade School, Cross Country.  I went to Cross Country Elementary School [Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: That's a public school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's a public school, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Cross Country okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And then from there I went to Fallstaff Middle School [Fallstaff Elementary/Middle School, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Fallstaff huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Fallstaff.
Speaker 1: Was it named after the Shakespearean character [Falstaff] or do you know?
Speaker 2: You probably know more than me (laughter) you know the--I, I have a feeling that maybe the street might have been.
Speaker 1: Oh it's Fallstaff Street [sic. Fallstaff Road]?
Speaker 2: Fallstaff yeah and then yeah the school that was on the street but and then from there I went to St. Paul's School [Brooklandville, Maryland], which was a private school and then from there I went to Friends School [Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Now going back to Cross Country, how was the music instruction at Cross Country?
Speaker 2: There wasn't any (laughter) you know what I mean no, I take that back, I take that back.  I didn't do my music instruction there so I had my private lessons so.
Speaker 1: So Ms. Odell Wilson took care of that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly yeah.  Yeah so--
Speaker 1: But there was just for the record there was really none at Cross Country?
Speaker 2: I can't--I don't remember to tell you the truth I really don't remember because I wasn't--I didn't participate you know in that, in the music program.  When we did plays or you know I would write the music for the plays and but I really don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now did--was your favorite subject math then in grade school?
Speaker 2: In grade school yeah math, math has always been you know my subject.  I mean all the way up to calculus two you know.  It was--that was my subject in school yeah.  I was a math--in fact before when I was thinking of schools because I was thinking about actually majoring in engineering, I mean that was because of the math connection you know um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay now what about at Fallstaff, did they have any music instruction there or?
Speaker 2: They did and we had a band which at that time I saw that as an opportunity for me to play other instruments because piano was my main instrument.  I was known as the piano--pianist whenever there was a show and there was a piano needed, I was the guy who played but in, in middle school, I played percussion.  You know so I played the timpanis, and I played the xylophone and I played the glockenspiel, and the mallet instruments, all the mallet instruments, all the percussion and felt at home you know doing that also.
Story_ID: 509093
Speaker 1: Now at this point, now you said the media discovered you early, the newspapers.  What were they saying about you and how did you feel about that kind of attention?  I mean did people give you a lot of attention for your musical capacity (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah I embraced it.  I mean as a young kid I mean if you don't know any better you just kind of you just go with the flow.  I mean I always, I always felt that I was very grounded and things were put in perspective because my mother [Anana Kambon] was, was always present, she was always there and she was definitely a strong influence on how to maintain a level head throughout everything.  But it was fun.  It was always fun to me.  Music was fun, the process was always fun.
Speaker 1: Okay so what kind of venues would you play in public in those days?  I guess if you're in the paper you must be doing public performances someplace right?
Speaker 2: Exactly yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so what were you doing?
Speaker 2: One of, one of the--this is a pretty significant story actually.  I grew up going to clubs you know and my mother would take me to Left Bank Jazz Society [Baltimore, Maryland] at the famous ballroom because at that time Blues Alley [Baltimore, Maryland] wasn't around then.  That was the first--that was the only place that we could go in Baltimore [Maryland] to really hear the major players you know, hear the Freddie Hubbards and, and Dizzy [Dizzy Gillespie] and one day I actually we went to a show where Freddie Hubbard was playing and we asked the owner, she asked the owner if I could play, if I could sit in.  And I was, I was what about ten, eleven at this time.   And he says, "Oh no, he can't sit in today but maybe you come back next week, Dizzy will be here and maybe you can sit in with Dizzy."  I said oh eleven year old I'm a little disappointed because I wanna play, I wanna play.  But at any rate we come back the next weekend, Dizzy is playing and the owner introduces me to Dizzy and says, "Hey this is [HistoryMaker] Camara Kambon," and it was so cute because at the time I had a, my sheet music of 'Georgia On My Mind' which he signed and he said, "Hey so what are you playing nowadays?"  And at that time I was, I was you know 'St. Thomas' was one of my favorite pieces to do you know and I said, "I can do 'St. Thomas'."  He said, "Okay, all right."
Speaker 1: How does that go?  Just for you know sake of?
Speaker 2: (Humming) So [HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins--and he says okay so we would go and sit down and the night goes on you know--
Story_ID: 509094
Speaker 1: At that time I didn't realize that you know jazz musicians you could go through you know three sets before--and that's your show.  You usually do those three sets and then that's your show.  You know so when we get to the second set or the second break, after I'm like oh he's not gonna call, he's not gonna--maybe he forgot all about me.  He's not gonna ask me up.  Well at the beginning of the third set, he says, "At this time I'd like to bring one of my friends up," and he mispronounces my name, but it didn't matter well because he called me up on the stage.  He says, "He's gonna play 'St. Thomas' for us."  And so I get up and hear, now this is a hardcore jazz crowd like I mean Dizzy [Dizzy Gillespie] has been swinging you know like the whole night you so here this kid comes up eleven years old and you can hear rumblings in the crowd like, "Oh we don't really wanna hear a kid, we're here to see Dizzy," you can hear.  Nobody's really saying anything but you can hear the rumblings.  And so he looks over to me and turns to his right, he give me a signal, "Go ahead."  And I'm like but there's nobody playing, there's nobody playing.  "Go ahead."  So I start (humming) and the band comes in on the bridge, (humming) and then they put the little Afro Cuban thing klink, klink it was, it was magical, it was magical.  And that was one of those moments that I think, when I think about it in retrospect was totally consistent with how I would manage to move from point to point to point to point in search of you know in reaching and excelling to achieve my goals you know.  Taking advantage of opportunities that you may have an expectation or not but taking advantage of the opportunity puts you in the right frame of mind to, to, to reap benefits from it and being at that show the weekend before and going up to the owner and asking if I could perform and coming back and following through to come back the next time and having the strong support from my mother [Anana Kambon] also was invaluable and that was a story you know that when I told so many people this story you know but it's definitely a story that I would feel, that I feel defines the path that, that I've taken you know.
Story_ID: 509095
Speaker 1: Yeah, what a story, that's a feeling of being surrounded at a young age by adults and pushed into your--you know, helped along into what you really wanna do.  What a story of generosity on the part of Dizzy Gillespie (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh definitely and, and it happened, you know that growing up in Baltimore [Maryland], there's a lot of talent in, in Baltimore.  There's a lot of undiscovered talent in Baltimore.  A lot of people who really don't have the outlets to really express their talent and to get it out to a wider, wider audience and I was fortunate early on that even if it was for exposure alone to be exposed, to be able to sit down you know with the Modern Jazz Quartet and talk with John Lewis and, and you know and talk with, you know, Ahmad Jamal and, and [HistoryMaker] McCoy Tyner and later on Betty Carter and you know just all of these great people, Pat Metheny and Jaco [Jaco Pastorius], Jack Pastorius who was a mentor and just all of these amazing jazz greats and influential people that, that I made a connection with not just through music, music was a way for us to become introduced to one another but to be connected with the, with the person you know and, and so that you know when I think of the path that I'm, I'm taking, I think of the connection that I made with with these people.  Well the first time that I met Dizzy or played with Dizzy was amazing.  The second time was even more amazing because he was--that was when he performed at Blues Alley [Baltimore, Maryland] like a couple years later when I was thirteen and I drove down with my mother [Anana Kambon] to Blues Alley and at that time I wanted to see him to play 'A Night in Tunisia' for him you know and it was, it was amazing.  It was just me at the piano.  He came out and sat right at the piano.  I mean you know just talking about this is when you think that we don't have these greats around anymore I mean it's, it's so potent because I--it's as if I can remember the exact day like remember the lighting, remember that it was dark, remember where he was standing, remember how I was sitting, remember how I felt, remember all of these things and it's probably because of that feeling that I always find it important that our youth are expo- have the opportunity for exposure also.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So when you look back on it do you think if it had not been for your mother [Anana Kambon] shepherding you to these, these clubs, would you have had that experience?
Speaker 2: Definitely not.  I mean and I think that's important to note too you know I mean without any support system, I mean you can't do anything alone.
Speaker 1: As you said there are many people that have talented children.  They say that's nice baby you know but they don't take them to the club or they can't take 'em to the art gallery or can't take them to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly or don't have the resources or and I think you know it's, it's I would say my mother was definitely the, the leader.  I would definitely say that my family also was a support system.  It was the family that, you know, if my mother wasn't available because you know keep in mind she was a single parent, my [maternal] grandmother [Yolanda Proctor] was there to pick up the slack you know my mother led the way but family was definitely there to, to come in when, when they were called upon and when we needed them.
Story_ID: 509097
Speaker 1: Now did your association with Ms. Odell Wilson and her school continue over the years I mean through--
Speaker 2: Well when I was seven, eight years old, I decided to go to start studying at Peabody Conservatory [Peabody Conservatory of Music; Peabody Institute, Baltimore, Maryland], Peabody preparatory and which was they had teachers from the conservatory teaching at the preparatory and basically the premise for that is I wanted to really focus on my, more of my classical technique and Peabody I mean was the place, the place to go and so I started studying and classical and more intense study in classical music and over the years it was more specifically on music of South America or composers from South America I mean I did a lot of music but I really gravitated towards music of South America; the composers, the rhythms of that.
Speaker 1: It seemed like it's a well from just a little bit of what I heard that I recognize as your music today before we started, that seems to be I mean is that still a big influence on what you do the South America sounds.
Speaker 2: Well fortunately just recently I had an opportunity to revisit that part of my musical palette you know.  Before my music you know was pretty much from classical, jazz or (unclear) or hip hop that's you know I was always looking for an opportunity to get--have an opportunity to express that side of me.  You know there really has a strong affinity to Latin music and the culture and so recently I had an opportunity with 'La Corona' the film that I composed the music for recently.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay we'll catch up to that one later but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 509098
Speaker 1: Okay so now in school, and so you went to regular middle school [Fallstaff Middle School; Fallstaff Elementary/Middle School, Baltimore, Maryland], but St. Paul School [St. Paul's School, Brooklandville, Maryland], is that a special school?
Speaker 2: It's a private, private school (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Private school okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, based in Lutherville, Lutherville, Maryland [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay so you had to--it was a trip every day to get there?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you have to go by yourself or did somebody take you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah you know sometimes that when family would kick in you know I would get a ride you know and but that was a far trek I mean sometimes I would have to take the bus and you know you would take the bus and then you would walk for like a quarter of a mile you know to the school because it was on the top of a hill you know.  Yeah so it was, it was definitely a trek and I was eager to, to go to a different school that was--that would give me a new experience because I had been in public school, I had a strong network of friends and, and kids that I was comfortable with but I wanted to push the envelope, you know, a little bit.  My mother [Anana Kambon] felt the same way.  Wanted there to be a different kind of challenge and it was a challenge.  Being at St. Paul's was a serious challenge because for me that was the first time that I had ever been--or had contact or close contact with you know these kids who, who grew up living this wealthy lifestyle and their values, a lot of them, their values were a little bit different you know.  So here I am catching the bus to school and some kids are driving Lamborghinis to school (laughter) you know and it was serious, it was--
Speaker 1: So would you say it was kind of culture shock there or not a shock but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No it wasn't a shock a culture shock because you know I'd grown up you know, I wouldn't say it was a culture shock, I think what was a little bit different is I think that was my first exposure to racism or feeling like yeah to feeling racism and it was a little bit different because there's an area of Baltimore [Maryland] called--darn, what is it called?  Hampden [Baltimore, Maryland], Hampden.  It's very, you get, it's very segregated there too and black people don't really go to that area, that's not where you go you know.  But that was it was a little bit different.  It was like the far end of the spectrum you know you had that in Hampden and then you had this.  It was like, that was I'm not sure it was a shock, shock isn't the right word, but it was definitely a learning, it was definitely a learning process, you know, for me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Were there any other black students there?
Speaker 2: There were.  It was very limited.  There were probably about ten of us and you talking about four classes, probably about eighty kids in each class and there were about ten, eleven of us.  It was an all-boys school also.
Speaker 1: Okay, any black teachers?
Speaker 2: One.  One um-hm.  So it was probably one of the--it was an amazing learning experience for me you know getting introduced to kind of the all-boys network even though these are kids you know but the mentality you know getting introduced to how people just think, you know, different people think you know because it was a lot different coming from a public school but there was I would say it was different, it was definitely different um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay now I guess the instruction is different but you're saying the culture was different too, the things that people are thinking about.
Speaker 2: Yeah the culture, yeah the culture and, and the teaching yeah it was a lot different (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 509099
Speaker 1: So you got like a basically a foundation of classical piano there or was it in jazz (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well we're talking about two different schools.  St. Paul's [St. Paul's School, Brooklandville, Maryland] is, is academic school--
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: --Peabody Conservatory [Peabody Conservatory of Music; Peabody Institute, Baltimore, Maryland] was the music school.
Speaker 1: Okay so you were going to both of them at the same time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was going to both schools at the same time.
Speaker 1: At the same time all right.
Speaker 2: From the days of Ms. Odell Wilson, I was always going to regular school and music school, regular school, music school so.
Speaker 1: Okay I got you.  So you didn't, you know, yeah Peabody stretching the musical capacity and St. I mean St. Paul is stretching your academic capacity.
Speaker 2: I would say, I would say so.
Speaker 1: Now were you involved in high school clubs and that sort of thing or you have like what was your social and extracurricular life like at that school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was in student council, I was the president of the student council, from state to the national level.  You know I was the state treasurer for the, the Maryland student council organization [Maryland Association of Student Councils], participated in you know student council like I said all the way to the national level.  I was president of the black student union, I did organizing, I mean I did canvasing, you know, canvasing for, for our delegates and senators, did my cross country, did wrestling, did--had a pretty I mean did all of the things that kids do you know.
Story_ID: 509100
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah was there any particular mentor you know that developed during your high school days [at St. Paul's School, Brooklandville, Maryland] or mentors?
Speaker 2: During my high school days, I had three mentors.  Definitely my piano teacher who was integral, you know, for a lot of reasons that I still you know find out today.  There was a guy by the name of Stu Gardner who really was a person who introduced me to film music and introduced me to writing music for film.  He was a composer for 'The Cosby Show' and worked with Cosby [Bill Cosby] continues to work with Cosby and then the third person, who was the third person?  Somebody I was thinking of just now, Jack Pastorius who is, who is a mentor.  Jaco Pastorius is his dad [sic.] who has since passed.  But during high school, I really became more active in the club scenes in Baltimore [Maryland] you know from in the whole metropolitan area and Jack Pastorius saw me at this little club called--this little bar called King of France [King of France Tavern] in Annapolis [Maryland] and I was playing and I was playing it was an interesting dynamic because I was playing this whole set, well not set but these couple of tunes with this band all by ear like they were, they were playing some new tunes that they had composed or whatever and I was playing them by, by ear, listening to the changes as they play and okay going with them you know and improvising and going with them.  And he came up to me afterwards and he said, "Hey man you know what's your name?  You play amazing there."  He's like, "How long you been you know playing with this group?"  "I just played with them tonight."  That's the beginning.  We hit it off and because of Jaco's relationship with Pat Metheny and they were really tight and before he passed, and Pat Metheny was, at that time, was a composer that really influenced me and really inspired me.  Keith Jarrett, a lot of composers that but those two in particular that really did something and really changed the whole way that I heard music at that time.  But Jack was always, he was always supportive, always eager for me to get up to New York [New York] as much as possible, introduce me to a wealth of musicians Hiram Bullock and you know Kenwood Dennard and Oscar Fernandez [sic. Oscar Hernandez] and I mean just all of these amazing players that I'd grown up as a kid you know as a jazz player just really enjoying you know and being influenced by.  And those were I would say those were three people that during those years definitely influenced, influenced me.
Story_ID: 509101
Speaker 1: So would your mother [Anana Kambon] take you up to New York [New York] or would you go with some of these guys to New York to?
Speaker 2: I catch the train.
Speaker 1: Just catch a train and go (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Catch the train yeah only three hours, three and a half hours catch the train you know and yeah um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So by this time did you, did you know enough of the musicians where you could go where they were playing and sit in and I mean and?
Speaker 2: Yeah I mean I would, I would always you know call beforehand.  And you know Jack [Jack Pastorius] I mean he really took me under his wing you know so I would always stay with him and you know we would just, we would just go, go to--I would usually go out there for a specific event you know.  Go out there for a specific event, hang out.  I had family that lived in New York also but yeah I mean I would drive, I would drive you know I had a--my mother's amazing, I mean she really is you know to really support because she got it.  She, she understood that the dynamic in Baltimore [Maryland] and understood that if this was something that I really wanted to do, the main thing aside from just working on your skill was to have exposure to be exposed to things.
