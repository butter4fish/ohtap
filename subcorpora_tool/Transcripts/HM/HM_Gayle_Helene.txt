Story_ID: 365205
Speaker 1: I want to ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Jacob Gayle, Sr.] side, and we start with the mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Marietta Spiller Dabney Gayle.  Marietta is M-A-R-I-E-T-T-A, Spiller, S-P-I-L-L-E-R, Dabney, D-A-B-N-E-Y, Gayle [Marietta Dabney Gayle].
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Richmond, Virginia, December 7th, 1942 [sic. 1922].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about her side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: Not very far.  She had a brother [Oliver Britt], there were two of them in the family.  Her parents divorced very early.  I think she was about two years old when her parents divorced, so she doesn't, didn't know a lot about her family side and really didn't know her father very well, Mr. Dabney.  I know a little bit about her mother's [Elizabeth Black Britt] side, her grandmother, who had a sister that I knew that lived in, in the Buffalo [New York] area, but not much more than that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's no stories passed down in the family about--?
Speaker 2: Not really.  My mother was raised by her stepfather.
Speaker 1: In Buffalo [New York]?
Speaker 2: In Lackawanna [New York] outside of Buffalo.  L-A-C-K-A-W-A-N-N-A.
Speaker 1: As in 'Lackawanna Blues'?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so she was raised by her mother and her stepfather's Smith Britt, and that was really the father that she knew and grew up with.  Her mother was a beautician and was a woman very active in the black community in Lackawanna.  Lackawanna was a steel town and mother was a beautician and very involved with NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and her church work and some of those sort of things, but that's, that's about as far back.  There wasn't a lot about her, her mother's history.  Her mother, her mother's mother name was Marietta Black.  So my mother was named for her, for her grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it'd be your great-grandmother, Miss Marietta Black?  No stories about the South or anything later on?
Speaker 2: Not a lot because she left when she was two and her, my sense is that my grandmother probably didn't have really happy memories, with the divorce and everything else I think she kind of cut ties pretty much with much of her, her previous life and when she moved up to Lackawanna, that became their life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they have relatives already up in Lackawanna do you know?
Speaker 2: Her sister was there in the Lackawanna area (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: So.
Story_ID: 365206
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Marietta Dabney Gayle] talk about growing up in Lackawanna [New York]?
Speaker 2: Well she talked, yeah, she talked about it some.  My mother and her brother [Oliver Britt] who was a dentist in Buffalo [New York], were both very gifted students.  My mother was very studious and also very, was really kind of a student leader.  She was involved in the debate society and a variety of different activities growing up and I get the feeling that she was just a very involved student, won all of the different prizes and very involved in her community and her church.  She was very involved in the Baptist church there that my grandmother [Elizabeth Black Britt] was a part of.
Speaker 1: Now had, did your grandmother had a chance to go to college and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, my grandmother didn't go to college, but she sent both my mother and her brother to college, my, my uncle was a dentist, my mother was a social worker. So they both had advanced degrees
Speaker 1: Yeah, where did your mother go?
Speaker 2: My mother went to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], and again, was a very gifted student and did extremely well, was also her college queen.  She was voted Miss Fisk, I think it was her last year in college and according to her and some of her friends at that time, she was the first dark skin Miss Fisk that they'd ever had.  She then went on to Columbia University [New York, New York] and got a master's degree in social work.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.  Now you say your mother was born in '42 [1942]?
Speaker 2: Sorry, '22 [1922].
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  That makes more sense now, 'cause I was thinking, I said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Twenty-two [1922], yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 365207
Speaker 1: Well, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Jacob, J-A-C-O-B, Astor Gayle, Sr., A-S-T-O-R [Jacob Gayle, Sr.].
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: May 20th, 1917.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: Alabama.  Actually I'd have to get the name of the, I think its Fort, it was Greene County, Alabama.  There is a city and I'm blanking on it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was he raised there too (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) See I should have talked to my brothers, I should have talked to my brothers [Jacob Gayle, Jr. and Geoffrey Gayle] and sisters [Alana Gayle and Karalenne Gayle] before I did this interview.  They remember everything.  He was raised there until high school and then he came up to Buffalo [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What do you know about your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: From what I know, his parents [Rosa Saulsberry Gayle and Edward Gayle] were not very educated, primarily farmers, rural people, had ten, ten children, all of them ultimately left Alabama and came up to the Buffalo area.  They were all dead by the time I was born, so I never met his parents.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he ever talk about growing up in Alabama and what it was like?
Speaker 2: He didn't talk about it a lot.  Neither of my parents talked a lot about life before that.  You know, I just get the sense that they had a fairly, very close family, and very humble beginnings and all of them, as I said, eventually migrated north.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your father go to school?
Speaker 2: My father went to college.  He never finished college.  He was a businessman.  He started a small business.  He did a variety of different businesses and then eventually opened his own business, a beauty and barber supply company in the, kind of the heart of the Buffalo black community.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he never really had any stories of growing up that he told or anything that?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he serve in the war?
Speaker 2: He did, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He served in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: During World War II [WWII]?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did he serve overseas, or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he did go overseas.  He was in Europe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Do you have any stores from his service?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Neither of my parents talked very much about their early years, and maybe we just didn't ask enough questions.
Speaker 1: Do you have any story about, is there a story passed down as to how they met, how they got together?
Speaker 2: Yes, here is where I should have talked to my brothers and sisters, they're much better historians than I am.  Through some friends, though some mutual friends that I'm forgetting exactly which friends, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they met in Buffalo?
Speaker 2: Right, they met in Buffalo, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right.
Story_ID: 365208
Speaker 1: Can you talk a little bit about their personalities and who do you think you take after?
Speaker 2: Well, I think people say I take after my mother [Marietta Dabney Gayle] the most.  My mother was an extremely strong and forceful personality, brilliant, very analytic mind, very, very outgoing, outspoken and determined individual.  My father [Jacob Gayle, Sr.] was in many ways kind of a counterbalance.  He was a very gentle man, very kind person, and really bright, but hadn't had the advantage of some of the education that my mother had had.  And was just somebody who always thought about other people and other people's needs and concerns.  It was very, when we were kids, every Sunday after church we would visit the older people in the church who were sick and shut-in and, you know, you just, even in his business, some people actually criticized him for not being as good a businessman as he could have been because he was always giving things away and, you know, I think he used his business as much for a way of doing good and service to the community.  He was a decent businessman, but he was definitely probably more kind-hearted and thinking about other people's needs perhaps than a cold-hearted business approach.  So it's really very soft-hearted individual.  Both really wonderful people I think.  For all of us, we feel like we got a real strong grounding in values and sense of caring about the world and other people as a result of both of them, my mother more from an activist prospective.  She was very community oriented, and very engaged in social causes.  My father probably more from the standpoint of just kind of one-on-one doing good for people.
Speaker 1: Do you think your mother was inspired by her mother [Elizabeth Black Britt] in terms of being involved in NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and all that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so, I mean she came from that sort of a background.  Her mother was very involved in community activities, so I think that's something that she grew up with.
Story_ID: 365209
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: I have four, two older sisters [Alana Gayle and Karalenne Gayle], two younger brothers [Jacob Gayle, Jr. and Geoffrey Gayle].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory I have is when I was two and a half and I can't remember this, or people told me this, but when I was two and a half, I, we had some guests in my house and we, I just remember running around the house saying, "I'm two and a half, I'm two and a half," feeling real proud of the fact that that was kind of a landmark in some way.  My other earliest childhood memory was, or more distinctive memory, I'm sure there were some in between, but I was probably about five years old or so, me and my sisters were all taking ballet class and the teacher asked my name and my sister, my older sister answered for me, and I got violently mad with her for speaking out for me as opposed to me being able to give my own name and we laugh about it because up to this day, when I think about it, I still get mad at her and say, "Why did you think you had to speak for me (laughter)?"  So, you know, I think it's an indication of the fact that I always felt that I should speak for myself, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)Yeah, I think--
Story_ID: 365210
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, we had an interesting kind of childhood in the sense that we were, we lived for the first thirteen years of my life in a suburb outside of Buffalo [New York], Lancaster, New York, which was a, at that time, kind of semi-suburban, almost rural environment that was a strip of black families living on one street, maybe about ten black families in a town that was otherwise totally white.  And my parents had moved from Buffalo to, to Lancaster because they wanted us to have a better educational experience, but we had the mix between living in Lancaster and going to school out there, but, but having kind of our social circle in the Buffalo community.  That's where my father's [Jacob Gayle, Sr.] church was, where we went to church. That's where his, his business was. And so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: Well, we went to two.  My mother's [Marietta Dabney Gayle] church was Lancaster Presbyterian [Lancaster Presbyterian Church, Lancaster, New York], which was an almost all white church.  My father's church was the, it's changed names, Lord's Memorial United Church of Christ [ph.].  And so we went to both of those churches.  So we really did have kind of almost a split experience: on one hand living in this all-white suburban environment, and then having the experience of black Buffalo, more from my father's side and my father's business, you know.  So, I guess in terms of sights and smells and sounds, you know, I think about the, the multiple different worlds that we kind of lived between.  On one hand, this strip of Lancaster that was black families who had chosen to kind of have a slightly different experience.  A school [Court Street Elementary School, Lancaster, New York], where I was always the only black child in my class, and then a weekend experience that was Buffalo, black Buffalo, both experienced in my father's store and church and kind of going between those different worlds where on one, during the week I was sometimes the odd kid out, and then on the weekends also in some ways the odd kid out because we were these suburban kids coming in to the Buffalo environment.  I remember one of my earlier childhood members, memories, also thinking that my father was white because he was very light skinned and we were at church one day, it was probably one of my earliest recollections of racial differences, we were at church and I asked him, remember asking him in the car, "Why as a white man did he go to this black church?" And he looked at me and said, "What are you talking about? I'm not white (laughter)."
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: I don't know, somewhere, you know, probably five, six, seven.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, it's always interesting when kids first try to figure out what race is, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right.
Story_ID: 365211
Speaker 1: Where did you go to grade school?
Speaker 2: In Lancaster [New York], I'm trying to remember the name of the street that was named after a street. Well, I think, Court Street Elementary School [Lancaster, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I loved school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have any favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a teacher, in fact, I hear from her from time to time.  Her name was Miss Lucarella [ph.] and she was, I was probably in fifth or sixth grade, maybe sixth grade teacher, maybe earlier, I forget, but anyway every time she sees an article about me or something, she'll send me a little note.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The school mostly a white school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I was always the only black kid in my class.
Speaker 1: The only?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's interesting.  Well, how did you feel about that when, when you were in school?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, you know, it was uncomfortable at times.  For the most part it was what I knew so it wasn't, you know, I think for the most part, it just was my experience.  I think as I got older and as children became more aware of race, you know, there were more uncomfortable times and as I got into pre-teen and teen years, you know, I think it became more uncomfortable, and ultimately our parents [Marietta Dabney Gayle and Jacob Gayle, Sr.] decided to move back into Buffalo [New York] so that we had a more balanced experience and didn't have some of the experiences that would become more difficult as we got older and the social environment and issues changed.  You know, I can think of kids feeling my hair and saying how wooly my hair was and, you know, things like that, but, you know, for the most part, I was the smart black girl in their class and kids, you know, I had a nice family and because there weren't many black people, I think we didn't feel the pressure of racism that I think comes when there are numbers and we were, you know, we were, we were the Gayle family.  We were this one black family that was there.  All the kids were smart. All the kids, we were all good students, good kids, so I think we weren't challenged in that way and people just accepted that we were there.  But again, as you get older and the issues of attraction and getting towards that dating age, I think things started changing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your parents actually made a conscious decision to move back to Buffalo (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it was mixed, yeah, it was a conscious decision.  My parents also divorced and so it was partly because of change in our family dynamics as well as the fact that, you know, I think they, particularly my mother started realizing that as we were getting older, having this all-white experience probably wasn't necessarily the best for us and that getting into environments where we had more diversity and more exposure to African American kids would be helpful for us.
Story_ID: 365212
Speaker 1: So was music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Not really, no.
Speaker 1: Or did, was radio or television?
Speaker 2: Not so much, you know, my mother [Marietta Dabney Gayle] was very strict.  She didn't let us watch a lot of shows.  She said we couldn't watch, I think at that time, 'Batman' was first coming on and she said we couldn't watch 'Batman' because it was too violent and she was afraid we'd pick up violent, she didn't want us to watch 'The Three Stooges' 'cause she thought that we'd become stooges like they were.  So she was pretty, she was pretty strict about it.  As time went on, she did ease up a little bit and we'd watch more. I, I just was never a big television watcher.  I liked to read, I, you know, we were involved in Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America] and Brownies and dance classes and, we did all play musical instruments.  It wasn't as if it was a big part of growing up, but I played the piano. I think I played the guitar for a little while, so, they tried to make sure we had a lot of other activities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have favorite books?
Speaker 2: I don't, can't remember favorite books, I mean, I think, little, as girls we probably read things like 'Little Women' [Louisa May Alcott] and whatever, and, you know, my parents and particularly my mother tried to expose us a lot to black history, so as I got older, I really enjoyed reading books like Nat Turner, about Nat Turner and, you know, some of the history that was I think in our lives lacking because we were in this very white environments are really, and you know at a certain age, got very interested in reading books about black history, but I can't think of a particular favorite book. I think I went to the usual 'Nancy Drew' [Carolyn Keene] and the kind of the, whatever were the period books of our childhood.
Story_ID: 365213
Speaker 1: Okay. You did get some black history and, and you're exposed to some of that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no.  My parents were pretty deliberate about understanding that given the environment we were in, they wanted to make sure that we really did understand who we were and who our, you know, our history, and so, you know, she [Gayle's mother, Marietta Dabney Gayle] made reading certain books almost mandatory and we would discuss them at the dinner table, and yeah, really again because she was very involved in, in some of these issues that were going on, around at our, during those years, civil rights and Black Power movement and the rest, and we got pretty steeped in a lot of that.
Speaker 1: Now was she, was she involved in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], or what groups were, did she?
Speaker 2: She did more local community groups. I don't remember her, my father [Jacob Gayle, Sr.] was a NAACP, lifetime NAACP member.  I can't remember if my mother was, but she was more, she'd get involved in whatever was going on at the time.  I remember she, the 1963 King march [March on Washington], she was, she didn't go, but she was involved and, it was '63 [1963], right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: She was involved in whatever Buffalo [New York] was doing to prepare for that, the tent city--
Speaker 1: In '68 [1968], the Resurrection City?
Speaker 2: Resurrection City.  She got involved in some of the community activities that were involved, she didn't go herself, but yeah, she was just kind of always, whatever was the event at the time she would get, you know, quite involved in helping to support.
Story_ID: 365214
Speaker 1: We were talking about school, I guess and growing up.  So, did you have an aptitude for science when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I had a general aptitude for school, you know, I was just a good all-around student, so--
Speaker 1: So it wasn't a burning drive?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, I didn't go into medicine because I was just fired up by science.  I went into medicine because it was a way of helping people, a way of making a contribution to society.  I thought about a lot of different things.  I thought about being, I started out in sociology, then went on to psychology, thought about law, but then my sister had already decided to go to law school, so I wanted to do something different than she was doing.  And then I was going to do psychology and do a clinical training in clinical psychology and I realized to do a Ph.D. in psychology took the same amount of time as it took to do medicine, I figured why not do medicine because that would give me a broader range of skills and give me something that was probably more flexible, so it was really more, I knew I was going to do something that I thought would give back to the community and then it was a matter of what did think would optimize my choices.
Speaker 1: When you were a little kid, did you have any idea of what you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, I didn't decide to go to medicine until I was in my last year of college [Barnard College, New York, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so no I, I just went through the whole cycle of different options.
Story_ID: 365215
Speaker 1: When you were thirteen you all moved back to Buffalo [New York], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Into the city?  And what, now did you stay at Court Street School [Court Street Elementary School, Lancaster, New York] when you were in Lancaster [New York], or did you?
Speaker 2: Went to Court Street School then I went to Lancaster Middle School [Lancaster, New York] for the first year, I think, for one year maybe, and then I went to Woodlawn Junior High School in Buffalo.
Speaker 1: Okay. How was Buffalo different from where you were, I mean was there a real big difference?
Speaker 2: Well it was a big difference because it was my first experience in an all-black environment, educational environment, so Woodlawn, I went from being the only black student in my class in the middle school in Lancaster, to being the only, to be in a all-black environment at Woodlawn Junior High School.  And, you know, I had better, probably better preparation than most of the students, and you know, got me into a little bit of trouble 'cause people saw me as this kind of perfect student who spoke funny and dressed better than other people and, you know, used to get in fights a lot and, it was a, the first year was a difficult transition in many ways, so.
Speaker 1: Did you make any friends?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I made friends, yeah, I did--I did make friends, you know, I think after, after being there a while, you know, I think I make friends easily, so I think after being there a while and after I proved myself and beat up a couple of girls and showed I could hold my own, you know, I did okay.
Story_ID: 365216
Speaker 1: Now I read in the bio, we had that you were part of a black student organization.  Was this in college or in high school?
Speaker 2: High school.
Speaker 1: High school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well tell us about it.  What was it?
Speaker 2: Well after I left--
Speaker 1: What was the name of the high school first?
Speaker 2: Well, after I left Woodlawn Junior High School [Buffalo, New York], I went, where I graduated first in my class there, I got the, this award, Jesse Ketchum Award, which was the highest, student finishing with the highest score or whatever, highest grade average, and went to Bennett High School [Buffalo, New York], at that time was considered the best high school in Buffalo [New York], had the honors classes and all.
Speaker 1: Now was that like an integrated school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, integrated school, probably at that time maybe 25 percent black, 25 to 30 percent black.
Speaker 1: Kind of like a magnet school or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  It was both a neighborhood school, and so the neighborhood that it was in was a predominately white neighborhood, but it was also an honors school, magnet school, so it, if you had the right address you could send your kids to that school from other parts of Buffalo, and so it was a mixed school.  So I got very involved in student activities.  I was both in the student government and also the black student union.  I think, I think I was president of the black student union if I remember correctly.  And we got, you know, we got very involved in the issues of our day.  At that time, it was less of the civil rights and more Black Power movement and some of the African Liberation Movement issues and also trying to look at how we as black students exerted ourselves there.
Speaker 1: This was about 1970, I guess.
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968].
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight [1968]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968].  I think I was in high school from, I was in high school from '69 [1969] to '72 [1972].  I graduated in '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 365217
Speaker 1: Now you were in high school when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed, right?
Speaker 2: Wasn't he in '68 [1968]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh no, in grade, in middle school I guess, yeah, yeah.  Tell us about the March on Washington and your mother [Marietta Dabney Gayle] being involved in preparing for that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And when Dr. King was killed, can you remember what you were doing or what the family did?
Speaker 2: I, I don't remember distinctly.  You know Buffalo [New York] had some riots during that time after Martin Luther King, and I remember the, you know, the Buffalo riots and my father's [Jacob Gayle, Sr.] store was one of the stores that didn't' get broken into 'cause he, you know, stores would put up signs if they were black-owned or not so that people would pass by, so we didn't have the, we didn't have that problem of people looting his store.  I don't remember what I was doing on the exact day and moment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But there were riots in Buffalo and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 365218
Speaker 1: What were they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't mention another thing early on that I had a serious car accident when I was about eleven, which meant that I was out of school for about six months at home getting home tutoring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is when you were still in Lancaster [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I was in hospital in Buffalo [New York] for about three months and then went back to Lancaster and was at home for about three months, getting tutored at home.
Speaker 1: Okay, well what happened?  Can you tell us what, you know what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, I was riding my bicycle and was getting ready to cross back to the street to my house and our, the house--the street that we lived on, because it was kind of a semi-rural area, was a street that people go pretty fast and it's not, not a city, not a city street so cars, kind of a main, it was a main thoroughfare and so cars come pretty quickly and I miscalculated the speed of the car that, I saw an oncoming car, but I didn't--miscalculated the speed, thought I could get across, and kind of didn't get across.  So I had a major fracture.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, that's a, you spend that much time recuperating, that was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it took you about a year to get--
Speaker 2: Yes, well, you know, it's six months out totally, and then kind of back at it, but it did mean that I never, that (background noise)--
Speaker 1: Pause, I'm guessing?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 1: Oh, it must have been just--It did mean that for much of my growing up years I didn't do much in the way of athletics.

Speaker 1: So what were the issues that the black students had?
Speaker 2: I think one, wanting to make sure that we had, well we tried, one to have more black teachers, more courses that included black history, and more say in student, say in the school issues in general, so, and I think we also just used it as an opportunity to talk about issues of the time and things that we could do, both inside of the school [Bennett High School, Buffalo, New York] and outside of the school, so.
Story_ID: 365220
Speaker 1: So in high school [Bennett High School, Buffalo, New York] were there any teachers or people in high school that were mentors or, or special?
Speaker 2: Our history teacher, Mrs. Anderson [ph.], she was one of the only African American teachers.  She was the wife of a minister in Buffalo [New York] who had a very large and prominent church, but she was the one who really kind of looked out for the African American students and was kind of a real, just mentor and friend to all of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were in the student government, black student union.  Do you have a pretty good social life in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I was very, I had a gang of kids that we hung out with and, you know, had a lot of friends.
Speaker 1: Okay, now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Went to a lot of parties.
Story_ID: 365221
Speaker 1: Did you, how did you, when you were on the verge of graduation [from Bennett High School, Buffalo, New York], like how did you decide what college you were going to go to?
Speaker 2: Well, I graduated a year early so I graduated after three years and had kind of just realized, I hadn't planned it, but realized I had enough courses to graduate.  I wanted to have a chance to get out and be independent.  Our home situation was also a little precarious and so there, wanted to have the opportunity to get out on my own.  My mother [Marietta Dabney Gayle] also had severe mental illness and we were living with her at the time and this was at the height of the time when she was probably at, having some of her most difficult times, so home was pretty tough.
Speaker 1: So your father [Jacob Gayle, Sr.], they split up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I told you when we were thirteen that was when we moved into Buffalo [New York], that was part of the reason that we moved, 'cause they, they divorced around then, and so, you know, it was tough in general over that period of time when we were living only with my mother 'cause her illness had gotten worse over time.  And so I wanted to get out, get on my own and really hadn't planned it, so I ended up going for the first two years to a school that my sister was at 'cause it was easy, it had a simple application.  I didn't have to take too many tests, and that was in, outside of Cleveland [Ohio], a school called Baldwin Wallace [Baldwin-Wallace College; Baldwin Wallace University, Berea, Ohio].  But I got there and really didn't feel particularly challenged and also had a boyfriend who was in New York City [New York, New York] that I wanted to be closer to at the time.  So then I transferred to Barnard College [New York, New York], Columbia University [New York, New York], and just wanted a different experience, wanted the experience of living in New York, a school that I thought might be a little more challenging and so, I transferred and that's where I graduated from.
Story_ID: 365222
Speaker 1: Now when you were at Barnard College [New York, New York], I've read that you heard a lecture about the control of smallpox.
Speaker 2: No that wasn't Barnard, that was when I was in medical school [University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine; Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's later, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Ok. All right. Ok, so at Barnard College you majored in sociology, and, or psychology?
Speaker 2: I was a psychology major so I graduated in psychology.
Speaker 1: What's the, okay.  Were there any teachers that stand out at Barnard College?
Speaker 2: There was, but I wish I could remember his name.  He was one of my psychology professors.  Well there were two, one was, was African American who was really great and I'm blanking on his name, but, and the other was a guy, his name was Peter Balsam [Peter D. Balsam], who I did my psych, a lot of psychology classes with and I also did a lab rotation with him, but--there was a woman, I'm blanking on her name, Inez Reid [Inez Smith Reid] who was actually a history professor.  Do you know her?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And she was kind of, even though history wasn't my field, she was kind of the mentor for a lot of the African American women, so she would have us over to her apartment, which wasn't very far from Barnard, and just somebody who kind of gave us a little big sisterly kind of attention.
Story_ID: 365223
Speaker 1: You already told us that you, rather than pursue a Ph.D. in psychology, you decided to go to medical school--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So how did you choose Penn [University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine; Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Well, I went, since I hadn't planned to do medicine, I still had some courses to take so I went to a post-baccalaureate premedical program at Connecticut College [New London, Connecticut] for a year to finish my pre-med courses and they, it was a particular program that focused on minority students who were, who needed the preparation for post-baccalaureate, so--
Speaker 1: This is about '77 [1977], '76 [1976], '77 [1977]?
Speaker 2: Seventy-six [1976].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So they had different schools that had people come and speak and there was a couple that came and spoke from Penn, just seemed, I just, they were a very interesting couple, and Penn sounded like a great school and, you know, school with a great reputation, Ivy League school, and so that became my first choice.  I applied to a lot of different schools, got into a lot of schools, but Penn was the one that I just thought would be interesting.  They had a real strong recruitment of minority students at that time, and so, just seemed like a good place to be.  They also had a very, at that time, a very flexible curriculum and one that allowed you to start taking your clinical years early, earlier than most schools did and I knew that I was more likely to be focused on the practice of medicine than, than research, so I wanted a school where I could kind of early on get started in clinical experience, so for a variety of reasons, Penn just seemed like a great mix.
Story_ID: 365224
Speaker 1: You had a year of preparation for medical school, so it wasn't like a big shock or anything, did you like medical school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I loved it, loved it.  It was a great experience, met a lot of interesting people, and Penn [University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine; Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was, definitely met my expectations as a school that allowed you to be flexible in what you did.  I was able to accelerate my courses and finish a year early in medical school so that I could do a Masters in Public Health as well, so I was able to combine those two degrees.  There was relative to other schools in its category, more minority students and so we had a good group of folks who were able to, we did, you know, kind of form the same sort of a black student or minority student coalition where we brought a lot of speakers to, to the campus and, you know, got very involved in the Student National Medical Association, the student league of--student arm of the NMA [National Medical Association], and I ended up being their national president in my last year of medical school, so, you know, it was a good experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what speakers did you bring to campus?  Did, I mean--
Speaker 2: I wish I could remember.  You know, a variety of different, some of whom were not necessarily named speakers, people from the community, you know, we tried to get people who were either physicians who were doing things that we thought were innovative or people who were involved in kind of community politics in the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] area, so a range of things and we just tried also to be a support for each other on campus.
Story_ID: 365225
Speaker 1: So what happened after, now did you, you pursued at Ph.D. at, there too?
Speaker 2: MPH, Masters in Public Health.
Speaker 1: Okay, MPH, okay, right.  Masters in Public Health.  Okay, so that when you went to Johns Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.  So I did that during what would have been my fourth year medical school, so I took my four years of medical school [at University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine; Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and kind of was able to accelerate and do that in three years and then take my fourth year at, at Johns Hopkins to do the public health training.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so this path, now you chose to get involved in public health too because you wanted to actually touch people's lives and make a difference on some level on a different, in a political kind of a way.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think, you know, for me, public health is kind of the interface between medicine, politics and society, and, because I had always been very interested in doing medicine more from the standpoint of addressing social justice and inequity issues, public health is really the opportunity to work on health at a population level.  And it deals a lot with many of the societal factors that cause inequities in health, and so for me it was a chance of mixing my interest in medicine with a blend of a kind of the social drivers for poor health and health inequity.
Story_ID: 365226
Speaker 1: Now at that time would you say you were keenly aware of some of the health disparities in the black community and what the causes were?
Speaker 2: In a general sense, you know, this is when I heard the smallpox talk when I was, my brother was graduating from college and I went to his college graduation that was my, I guess that was in my last year, or my third year, what was ended up being my last year of medical school [University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine; Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and I'd been thinking about public health because I had this general notion of, of the fact that it kind of was an area where you could make a huge impact on, on populations, and then I heard this man [Donald A. Henderson] who had been the leader, one of the leaders of the smallpox eradication campaign and it kind of, for me, crystalized my thinking that this was a way that you could tangibly impact large numbers of peoples' lives, eradicate a disease like we did with smallpox or, you know, really change the course of something in a major way as opposed to doing one-by-one patient care where a lot of times what you're doing is putting band aids on for what are really larger systemic issues.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what I hear you saying and correct me if I'm wrong, is that somebody's got to organize a campaign to deal with disease, you know, to do a certain diseases.  It's not enough just to treat 'em as an individual, as individuals coming in who are sick.  It's better to, to try to hit with a organized hammer.
Speaker 2: Well, I think what you do in public health as opposed to taking care of individuals, you take care of populations, so the same things you do with individuals, you do with populations, so you look at, you know, you're able to look at what are the reasons why one population has more, is impacted more by hypertension, HIV [human immunodeficiency virus], tuberculosis, you know, low birth weight, or whatever the issue is, and look at what does it take to change that for populations.  A lot of times that means changing policies.  It may mean, you know, putting in systems that didn't exist.  It may mean doing campaigns, but it's really looking at what are the reasons why populations of people are more likely to be hit by a disease or have a less good health in disease like infant mortality or death rates or birth rates, or whatever, and how do you look at what are the issues that influence that, and a lot of times those things aren't necessarily just the virus or the, you know, the infection, or the toxin, it has as much to do with how societies organize or don't organize to make sure that some people have access to the things that cause good health.  I mean it could be as simple as the fact that we have bad grocery stores in poor neighborhoods so that obesity and poor nutrition is more likely in poor communities, and so I mean public health looks at all of those factors and not just, you know, X diseases caused by X germ.
Speaker 1: Okay, so for instance, coal miners keep getting black lungs because they're coal miners?
Speaker 2: Right, and so as opposed to being the person who looks at a coal miner and says that person has a particular disease state, let me give them the medicine, public health says these people are at risk because the conditions within the coal mines are making them sick.  What do we do to change the conditions in the coal mine?
Speaker 1: Okay.  And sometimes that's a struggle, isn't it? I mean in terms of trying to change--
Speaker 2: Change policies, and that's why I say public health really is the interface between medicine and politics and society because in order to make a difference for those coal miners, you may have to get legislation passed in [U.S.] Congress that will affect the conditions that they're, they're living under.  So, you know, I think those, that's why for me public health is a, was always a real good blend for my interests because it does marry changing societal factors that cause poor health as well as looking at what's the immediate cause.
Story_ID: 365227
Speaker 1: How is this Dr. Henderson [Donald A. Henderson] able to dramatize that for you with the smallpox story?
Speaker 2: Well, smallpox was all about a big campaign.  I mean smallpox was people coming together and realizing that in order to stamp out this disease, it wasn't treating individuals one at a time for a disease once they got it, it was really looking at how do you prevent people from getting it altogether and mobilizing the World Health Organization Centers for Disease Control [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia] and other organizations to actually get teams of people out there to make sure that people got vaccinated, one of the most effective ways of preventing the spread of viral infections, and mount a campaign to do that.  So, in this, in the case of smallpox, it wasn't that you necessarily needed to change laws in society, but was, it did mean that you had to mobilize systems in order to vaccinate everybody who was at risk for smallpox in order to ultimately stop the further spread.
Story_ID: 365228
Speaker 1: What happened at Johns Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland]?  I mean you were there for how long?
Speaker 2: I went there for a year to do a Masters in Public Health.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, all right, I was confused I thought you, I thought you said you received one at Penn [University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine; Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], but I--
Speaker 2: No, I went to Hopkins to get my--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What I, at Penn I did my medical school and finished a year early so that I could go to Hopkins.  I was really at Penn and at Hopkins at the same time.  I was, you know, I'd gotten my two degrees the same year.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  Now I'm straight on it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's confusing because sometimes when you look at the chronology, it doesn't make sense, but, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so after Johns Hopkins, is that when you--
Speaker 2: Then I went to CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: No, then I went to my residency, sorry, then I did my pediatric training.
Speaker 1: And that was where?
Speaker 2: At the Children's hospital [Children's National Medical Center] in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you were there for how long?
Speaker 2: Three years.
Speaker 1: Three years, okay, now that's something.  What, what did you learn there then?
Speaker 2: How do take care of children.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) What you learn as pediatric resident, yeah.  So everything, so you do three years, that's the training for becoming a pediatrician, you do three years of rotation.  Everything from taking care of children, outpatient clinics, well baby care to taking care of children in the most intensive situations, so it's the whole experience that you get during specialization training.
Speaker 1: What hospital did you work out of?
Speaker 2: Children's hospital.
Speaker 1: Children's hospital, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, that brings us to 1984, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that's Center for Disease Control (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Then I went to CDC.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us about the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Well I went there because I'd finished my pediatric training and I wasn't sure, you know, I'd done the master's [degree] and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm sorry, we have to change tape.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 365229
Speaker 1: So CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, I had done pediatrics, but had done the public health and wasn't sure whether I wanted to stay in clinical practice or go into public health and how I wanted to use that, so the CDC has a two-year training program in public health called the Epidemic Intelligence Service [EIS] that gives you two years of hands-on public health experience with the CDC and it's one of the, it's the program that probably has led to the largest number of public health and epidemiologists in the country.  So, when I finished my residency [at Children's National Medical Center, Washington, D.C.], I applied for the EIS program and was luckily accepted and went to CDC in '84 [1984] and I thought I would go for two years and probably go and maybe go and work for a large NGO [non-governmental organization] like the one that I now work for [Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere; CARE, Atlanta, Georgia] and do international public health because I really, I knew that I wanted to do work in the international arena, and so went there and when I first went to CDC, you do for this EIS program, you kind of do a match experience where you go and you interview in the different areas of CDC.  They interview you, you make a list of choices that you want to go to, they make a list of the people that they like.  They rank you, you rank them and then they do some kind of computer match.  So when I was going through my discussions with the different divisions that I was interested in, I look at a variety of different programs all areas that had some pediatric relevance having the pediatric background and also international significance, and I ended up deciding to rank highest and was ranked highest by the nutrition program, which allowed me to work on issues of malnutrition in children in the United States, as well as internationally.
Story_ID: 365230
Speaker 1: Interestingly, at the time when I came, which was 1984, three years after HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] had first been described, I was, had a passing interest in HIV.  At that time, pediatric HIV had not been very visible so it wasn't something that I had been involved in in my training, but I asked people about, you know, whether HIV would be a good thing to do my EIS [Epidemic Intelligence Service] years in and most people said, "Stay away from it, it's just a political disease and it's not that important and it's gonna be gone soon anyway," so I kind of, you know, didn't think too much about HIV at the time and went ahead and did the nutrition and worked on issues of malnutrition in children (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Let me stop you, pause.  What do they mean by political disease (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Well, it was highly political.  You know it was a disease that had a lot of, you know, because it was occurring in gay men and injection drug users, you know, it was very politicized.  There were a lot of, you know, just politics involved and people said, you know, stay away from it 'cause you'll just get broiled--embroiled in a bunch of politics around, you know, gays and drug users. And, you know, issues of morality, and all the issues that are involved in, you know, working with marginalized populations that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well was the sense then from the physicians that you were talking to that it was gonna stay in a small, I mean, it wasn't gonna--they thought it was gonna stay right there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well that's what I said. I mean that they--people, you know, that, people said, you know, this is something that's gonna be gone.  They compared it to like Legionnaires' disease which CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia] had, had been involved with, you know, big, an outbreak confined to a certain group of people, lot of visibility, lot of hype, and then it will be gone, and so go and deal with something that has longer term relevance.  So, you know, for me it was, it was partly that, but it was also just, you know, again, since I had been in pediatrics where HIV had not yet really taken a hold, it wasn't as much in my consciousness at the time and so I focused on nutrition and looked at issues of low birth weight, malnutrition, did a lot of work in Africa as well as work here in the United States focusing on those issues.  After that, I just, you know, I really enjoyed my experience at the CDC and so took an additional year in a preventive medicine residency, so it was another additional residency to get further training in public health and preventive medicine and I did that in our group that focused, the CDC group that focused on specifically issues of childhood mortality in Africa and I worked a lot on childhood, child survival issues, diarrhea and the things that are the main causes of children in Africa--diarrheal diseases, measles, malaria.  I did a year doing a lot of work focused on that, and then just, and then those, both the EIS and the preventive medicine program are short-term programs and so I had to make the decision after that, did I wanna stay at CDC and seek permanent employment, or did I wanna go and do something else, and by that time, it was clear that HIV was an important issue, and was, in fact, probably gonna be the defining public health issue of our day, and so I elected to interview with the HIV group and started out as a staff epidemiologist in the HIV program.  It was called the AIDS program then.
Speaker 2: So it was about 1987 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Eighty-seven [1987], yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 365231
Speaker 1: So I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well what--so you, you traveled to Africa when you were with IES?
Speaker 1: In the EIS program [Epidemic Intelligence Service], yeah.
Speaker 2: EIS.
Speaker 1: And in my preventive medicine residency.
Speaker 2: Was that your first trip to Africa?
Speaker 1: No, I had been to Africa in 1977, right 1977, yeah, between my post, that post-baccalaureate program [at Connecticut College, New London, Connecticut] and before I went to medical school [University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine; Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], so the summer before medical school, I went to Africa on a program called Crossroads Africa [Operation Crossroads Africa].
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Did you serve in some kind of medical capacity there when you went with Crossroads?
Speaker 1: No, because I had been to, it was the year, summer before medical school, so I hadn't done any medical training.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well they had people volunteering, clinics and all kind of things in Crossroads.  That's why I asked.
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, I did, we built a school.  Yeah, I went to Togo in West Africa and we did a project building a school.
Speaker 2: Okay, now where did you go with CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia] when you first went over?
Speaker 1: I went to Burkina Faso, Burundi, Ivory Coast, forgetting what were some of the early countries I went to.  Maybe--
Speaker 2: But the diseases you were dealing with weren't necessarily, they had nothing to do with AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] or those--?
Speaker 1: Not, not at that time.  In the first three years it was all malnutrition, diarrhea, malaria.
Speaker 2: Diarrhea huge--
Speaker 1: I went to Swaziland, yeah.
Speaker 2: And there's a huge famine in Ethiopia around that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't do Ethiopia (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sudan--
Speaker 1: We were working on the, the famine and drought in West Africa, in the Sahel area, so we were doing a nutrition assessment that touched Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah that was a horrible, I mean I remember that was really a big deal.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Ethiopian one was the very, very bad one.  The one in West Africa wasn't as severe, but its chronic, it's seasonal, and, you know, they have these droughts that come.
Speaker 2: The desert is spreading?
Speaker 1: Right, right, right, yeah.
Story_ID: 365232
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, let's go back to, we were in '87 [1987] now, right?
Speaker 2: Right, and so that was when I joined the HI--the AIDS program.  I started out working on adolescent AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] issues, pediatric and adolescent AIDS issues and started some of the first programs that looked at, at risk for HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] among the adolescent population that hadn't yet really been a big focus because a lot of, a lot of the focus was on either adults or on children with mother to child transmission, but not as much focus yet on the adult, on the adolescent population, so we started some of the early studies looking at some of the population, particularly in New York City [New York, New York] where adolescent HIV was, had, had not surprisingly given the rates of HIV in New York in general.  That's where the highest rates were.  And then did a fair amount of work in pediatric HIV, particularly in a project that we had in, in what was then Zaire [Democratic Republic of the Congo]. We had a major research center there and then in Ivory Coast we had another research center and then I ultimately went from working on adolescent AIDS to running the international AIDS research portfolio for CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia], and increasingly just took on a variety of different roles within CDC on HIV.  During that time I also went for a couple of years to the [U.S.] Agency for International Development.  I went on loan to USAID and ran their AIDS portfolio, in the early '90s [1990s].  And when David Satcher [HistoryMaker Dr. David Satcher] was appointed CDC director, he asked me to come back to CDC from my loan to USAID to run the CDC Washington [D.C.] office which is a liaison office between Atlanta [Georgia] and the rest of the federal government.
Speaker 1: So that was about 1992?
Speaker 2: I think that was maybe '93 [1993].
Speaker 1: Ninety-three [1993]?
Speaker 2: Forgetting exactly.  It would be in my bio, in my CV [curriculum vitae], but, so I did that for a year and then Dr. Satcher decided to do a major reorganization of the AIDS work at CDC because prior to that time, it was pretty fragmented throughout CDC and what he did was to call for reorganization that integrated the HIV programs throughout CDC and asked me to come and do, oversee that reorganization, and ultimately asked me to be the first director of the new center that was created.  That was the Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention [National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention], and, at that time, it was the largest center that CDC had and it was one of the second largest reorganizations that they had up to that point.  There hadn't been no African Americans who headed a center at CDC so I was the first center director, African American center director at CDC and the second woman to run a center at CDC.
Story_ID: 365233
Speaker 1: And so I did that for six and a half years, and then was asked by the Gates Foundation [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, Washington] to come and help when they decided to really begin a focus on global health, and particularly to focus on HIV [human immunodeficiency virus], which became their highest priority.  I was recruited to the Gates Foundation to start their work on, to really start a focus and kind of accelerate their development of their work on HIV, and so I went there in 2001.  Actually for the first couple of years, I was actually on loan from CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia] 'cause I hadn't finished my twenty-year obligation that I had to CDC.  By that time, I was far enough along that I wanted to finish the full twenty-year career that I could get as a commissioned officer, one of these systems where if you don't stay twenty years, you lose everything, but if you stay twenty years, you qualify for, for a pension.  So I was committed at that point to continuing and finishing the twenty-years, so the Gates Foundation was able to work out an arrangement where I finished my last three of that twenty years at the foundation.  Then I stayed for a couple of years, then got asked to consider this position and came here [Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere; CARE, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Well, this is all, you know, that covers all the dates (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 365234
Speaker 1: Let's go back maybe and look at some of the substance here (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: With the early, well, from the mid-'80s [1980s], I guess on, as AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] began to grow, the black community, as we were talking off camera, a lot of mythology and a lot of conspiracy theories, you know, started sprouting up about what it was and who created it.  Did you have to deal with that kind of mythology and stuff at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot.  And one of the things both because I was one of the few African Americans working on HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] at CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia] at the time, and, you know, the time that I actually for a period of time, was the acting assistant director for minority HIV, so that was my portfolio for a while.  I did a lot working on HIV in the African American community, and did a lot of speaking to community groups and did a lot of testifying in [U.S.] Congress and, you know, a lot of contact with public on the issue.  And that was, you know, one of the things we battled all the time and particularly coming from the federal government, people mistrusted the motives, wanted to know why were we so, why were we spreading all this hype about AIDS in the black community, and, you know, there was kind of a mix between people who criticized CDC for not telling people earlier, and then others who criticized CDC for blaming or putting one more bit of bad news about the black community.  So you were kind of always between a rock and a hard place in terms of how do you walk that tightrope. And you know many, many times, for me it was a very difficult emotional experience because you're often in the position where people are accusing you of being, you know, part of a conspiracy or siding with the enemy, and so, you know, I think it's one of the things though that I think gave me or helped me develop the ability to understand how do you, how do you break down some of those suspicions, and how, how do you as somebody who was working on the "inside" still maintained your relationship and sense of trust for those on the outside, you know, and I think it's a delicate balance, but, you know, I think over time I feel good about the fact that I was able to really build some strong ties between CDC and the African American community.  One of the things I'm most proud of is having worked with the Congressional Black Caucus to get some of the special legislation that allowed CDC to directly fund minority communities on HIV and AIDS and to really bring money into African American and Hispanic and other minority communities, but particularly African American and Hispanic who are disproportionally impacted by HIV, and really get money into the hands of, of groups, community groups, groups at the grass roots level to really start mobilizing efforts in HIV.
Story_ID: 365235
Speaker 1: I want to walk over some of these myths. Assess some of them in a sense and just give us what's really going on here.  When AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] first came out, they saw it as, the hype was, well, it's a disease of gay, white men, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Then black people start getting it.  They say well drug addicts, you know, are getting it and that's why.  Then they said well where did it come from?  So one of them says it comes from Africa, you know, then somebody said it came from Haiti, you know, and so is there, is there any sense of the origin of AIDS and the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it's pretty clear that it is one of many diseases that crosses from one species to another and this case it crossed from the monkey species to the human population.  There's a virus, the simian immunodeficiency virus that is very similar to HIV [human immunodeficiency virus], the human immunodeficiency virus, and like so many viruses that jump from animal to human, to humans because of close contact and because the virus can eventually mutate, you know, viruses mutate.  They can change their forms and continually over time adapt from being in one species to another, and so this is just the case of natural selection and ultimately what a virus that started out in monkeys and chimps being able to cross over and adapt itself to the human host.  It happens in nature.  HIV is not an exception, but I think it's what, for many people, was the first time they had heard about a virus that skips from one species to another so it sounded far-fetched.  It's not far-fetched.  We have diseases like that that happen, cowpox and smallpox, you know, you have diseases that jump from one species to another because you have close enough contact that it could ultimately adapt.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a argument for evolution I think that people miss.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: That's something boy.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Then there's a myth that women can't get it since they are not gay and they're not gonna be, you know, but then, you know, unless they are drug users, they can't get it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and unfortunately, women are at greater risk of any sexually transmitted disease just because of their biology and often also because women aren't as likely to be able to control sexual interactions. So women are oftentimes put at risk and not because they put themselves at multiple risk, but because their partner has.  So women, when it's heterosexually spread, women are more at risk than men are for HIV and that's why now 50 percent of new HIV infections around the world are occurring in women.  In Africa, it's over 60 percent of new infections are occurring in women.
Story_ID: 365236
Speaker 1: I think I read somewhere that worldwide of say ten million cases of AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome], five million are in Africa, or over--
Speaker 2: Well, Africa is the, over 75 percent of all HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] and AIDS cases, so yeah, Africa is way disproportionally affected (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is worse than that.  When you say most of the new cases of AIDS are black women here in this country, right?
Speaker 2: Not most of them, but the rate of increase is great.  About a third of new HIV infections are occurring in women so, and that's been increasing over time, so increasingly more and more African American women are affected by HIV.  But of women, most of them are African American, so if you look at women who are infected with HIV, about 75 percent are among African American women.
Speaker 1: And what's the reason for this, basically?
Speaker 2: Why it's hitting the African American community?  Well, you know, I think there's multiple reasons.  One, because for so long we did deny that it was issue in our community.  Two, because unfortunately, disease does discriminate and it does discriminate based on class, race, lack of access to health and health services because other issues that fuel HIV are more prominent, prevalent in the black community like other sexually transmitted diseases.  If you have gonorrhea or syphilis, or another sexually-transmitted disease, chlamydia, whatever, you're more likely to get HIV if you're exposed to it so the fact that we have higher STD [sexually transmitted disease] rates mean that you're, it also helps to increase our acquisition of HIV--drug use in our, in the African American communities, linked to it.  And also, I think, increasingly people are recognizing that because same sex behavior is so taboo in our country, in our community and we don't want to talk about it, there are a lot of men who have sex with other men, but who maintain relationships with women as well, and so they're at high risk and they bring that risk to the women that they sleep with as well.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's been really big the last couple of years, I mean on the discussion about it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: Books are being written.  So basically it's a, it's an educational project, but we need resources and more education, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Well, it's education, but education alone is never enough.  I mean you can tell people information.  You know, you can tell somebody to stop smoking, do they stop smoking?  You can tell people to eat a healthier diet, do they eat a healthier diet?  You can tell people to, you know, stop having sex with multiple partners, you know, so it takes more than that.  It takes reinforcing it, it takes giving people incentives.  It means giving people services.  It means changing the way we think about sex and sexuality.  It means having an open dialogue about the way we view same-sex behavior.  It means getting drug treatment into our community for those who need it, treatment for other sexually-transmitted diseases, getting people to know their status.  In this country, a quarter to a third of people who are infected with HIV don't even know it, and so they can continue to spread.  So it's all of those things combined that reinforce the information that people get.  So, yes, they need information, but they need all of these other things that can ultimately make a difference in changing behavior.
Speaker 1: Has the, has the spread of AIDS in the black community stabilized to a certain degree, or is it still just going up?
Speaker 2: It's, it's, well rates of new infection, the number of new infections is more or less stable in this country.  About forty thousand new infections every year, but the proportionate African American make out of that has increased over time.  So, we make up now about 50 percent of new infections and about of a decade or so ago we were, we were about 25 percent of new infections.  So that's gone up.  And then the rate of women, including African American women, has gone up over time.
Story_ID: 365237
Speaker 1: So right now, we're not really winning this.  I mean we're fighting it, but we're not really--
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And I think that the, while we've done a lot to extend access to treatment and more people who have HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] are, are receiving treatment, we haven't kept our focus on prevention as much as we should have, and so once you stop funding prevention programs and once you are no longer willing to particularly focus on communities of greatest risk, then the virus can spread.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you see that as being like the policy of our current administration [President George Walker Bush administration]?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, you know, I think it, this administration has had a increasingly more of a focus on global AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome], HIV which is what I worked on for the last ten or so years, so I'm happy that there's been increase on, on the global HIV, which is after all where HIV is having its greatest impact.  On the other hand, I think there has been less focus on HIV domestically over the last few years, and on the, on the prevention side because it is necessary to talk about issues that are tough, issues of sexuality, issues of drug use and things that oftentimes do have political controversy to them, I think that this has been a period of time where people have been less willing to engage and use resources to talk about the issues that affect people at greatest risk.  Now there has been a great focus on things like abstinence for instance, which, you know, for younger people and children is probably what we want to focus on, but for people who are at greatest risk, those who are already sexually active or at particularly high risk, gay men, injection drug users, et cetera, I think there has been less than a focus on those populations.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There's a, well there's a AIDS pandemic in East Africa now.
Speaker 2: Well the biggest focus is really in Southern Africa and Southern Africa where the rates are extremely high, countries like Swaziland, Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa where rates are 20 percent or more in the adult population.  In Botswana, rates are up to 30 percent in the adult population, so Swaziland the same, 30, 35 percent of adults, one in three adults infected with HIV.  So rates are extremely high in Southern Africa.
Story_ID: 365238
Speaker 1: The AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] crisis in Africa and in this country is sometimes overwhelming for people to think about, and most people aren't doing anything about it anyway, but they're just thinking about it, about--the news is depressing.  When you hear Thabo Mbeki doesn't even believe it exist, I mean the strange approaches that people have.  Is there, are we winning on any front whatsoever with some of the, and AIDS is just on top of a lot of diseases that used to devastate the globe and are still out there doing it, so are we, are there any, what are the victories in public health worldwide?
Speaker 2: Well I think we're making progress on three different fronts, but I think we also need to recognize that this is, you know, not to be cliche, but this is a marathon, not a sprint.  I mean this really is something that is going to demand our commitment for many more decades before we really turn this around, and that's just the reality.  And I think the sooner we face that, the less we keep looking for quick fixes and, and quick solutions and recognize that this is something that we have just got to realize we need a long-term commitment.  But we are making progress on, on, you know, three or four fronts.  First of all, we do know a lot more about what it takes to prevent the spread of HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] and we're developing new tools to do that.  So while we don't have a vaccine, there's a lot more focus on developing a vaccine.  We know a lot more about the virus.  There's a lot of progress on that front.  It's also a lot more progress being made on focusing on new prevention tools and particularly things that will give women the ability to protect themselves from HIV since that's a, you know, continues to be a growing concern and a growing part of the epidemic, so vaginal products like a microbicide, or things that women would be able to use to protect themselves, there's a lot of research going on and a lot of hope that within the next five to seven years, we might have a product that women can use to protect themselves.  A lot of research going into looking at how do you use the current drugs that we have in a preventive fashion and there's a lot of reason to believe that you could take some of the antiretroviral drugs in a preventative sense and keep you from getting HIV.  So I think there's a lot of focus on that.  A lot more, we have a lot more drugs today than we ever did before.  They make a big difference.  We finally, you know, in the last decade now, have drugs that keep people alive for many years and keep them more or less symptom free, and so hospital sections, whole sections in hospitals have been able to be closed in this country because of the new drugs where people now can go back to more or less normal lives, still with a chronic, complicated disease, but being able to live their lives at a much more normal fashion than a decade or so ago when having HIV was essentially a death sentence and people began to think about how to get ready to die as opposed to how to get ready to live.  So it's really made a big difference in this country and growing focus on getting access to drugs in Africa and Asia in the Americas, in poor parts of the world where the disease is having its greatest impact.  And, and, you know, again, then we know a lot more about what it takes to, to prevent this spread and if you can get the right resources together, get the right motivation and the will, we have countries like Uganda, like Thailand, and increasingly other countries around the world that are either turning the tide around or keeping the rates very, very low.  So we know a lot more about what it takes.  We've seen it in this country.  We went from a hundred thousand new infections every year to now forty thousand.  Well, it's still unacceptably low, but we did a lot to turn that around by communities getting together, mobilizing, getting information out, changing behaviors. We know that it can be done.  So, I think there's a lot of reason for hope, but it means we gotta be hopeful because we know what we can do, but we also know that we have to put the resources and the commitment behind that to do it.
Story_ID: 365239
Speaker 1: How is it to-now, you've been in charge of these huge budgets?  Well, they look huge to me anyway, at the Centers for Disease Control [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia] and with the Gates Foundation [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, Washington], did you, I mean you were trained as a physician, I mean, are you, are you comfortable handling all, well I guess you are, you've done it, but how do you get used to handling all that, those kind of resources?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you do it with a team, you know.  My role in the positions I've had as the leader of a team or leader of an organization, is really to make sure that I have the right members on the team that I can work with a group of people who have a variety of different skills, and put--make sure that I make the best use of all those skills, so I always have people who understand management and finance and budgets better than, more than I do, but my role is to really think about, you know, how do we make the most strategic use of the resources we have?  Where are the needs the greatest?  Where are the areas that, given the organizations I'm working in, what's our particular niche?  CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] was focusing on prevention and developing public health approaches to prevention. At the Gates Foundation, we did a lot of work on developing new tools that would aid the mission of prevention, you know, and so in looking at what's the mission of the organization, what's our niche and how do we put the resources that we have to the best use to make a difference and have an impact on, on HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] and the other issues that I've focused on, TB [tuberculosis], STDs [sexually transmitted diseases], reproductive health, so it's never just me.
Story_ID: 365240
Speaker 1: Is there any particular city in the country or state where they're got it right?  Where they really understand what to do about that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I think, you know, the country, the places in this country that have been hit the hardest are the ones who have learned the lessons the most.  I think New York and New York City [New York, New York] have, where HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] has had such a impact for so long, has made great strides.  They've been in many ways very innovative in the work that they've done.  California clearly, particularly for gay men in the Northern California area where HIV was hitting so hard, communities mobilized, but, you know, again, I think across the board on the prevention front, we've let our guard down in many ways.  You can't stop at having one generation learn the lessons and change behavior because every generation that comes along that's sexually active, we need to make sure that they have the right tools to change behavior, maintain safe behavior or don't start risky your behavior to begin with.
Story_ID: 365241
Speaker 1: Do you have a sense that we're coming to a cure for AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome]?
Speaker 2: Well I don't know that a cure is what, you know, generally is the approach to viruses.  Most viral diseases are handled by vaccines, and so the focus is really on can we get a vaccine that will prevent the spread of HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] or at least prevent HIV from developing to AIDS once somebody actually is infected.  We'll probably continue to have better and better medications that might approximate a cure, but cures tend not to be what we do with viruses.  We never, and we never cured the common cold or the flu.  You know you take a flu shot for a flu or measles or, you know, any of the viral diseases that you get.  Vaccines tend to be the way that we are most able to--
Speaker 1: Come to think of it, there's not a cold shot now, actually.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  We treat the symptoms, you know.  So maybe we might get to the point where we can cure a viral disease, but vaccines tend to be what are most effective in, in controlling viruses.
Story_ID: 365242
Speaker 1: You were saying when we were off camera that when you were at the Gates Foundation [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, Washington], you met, including the Gateses, people that had a lot of money, who seemed to understand the importance of dealing with this issue.
Speaker 2: Well, I think there's a whole new group of very wealthy people, individuals, who have a real sense of social obligation.  Ted Turner was perhaps the first one who started this whole trend when he made the commitment to give a billion dollars to the UN [United Nations] system and challenged other wealthy individuals to follow his lead.  Bill [Bill Gates] and Melinda Gates, also very early in their philanthropy, they now have the wealth of Warren Buffett added to their--to their foundation.  But the Dells [Michael Dell and Susan Lieberman Dell], maker of the computers, the Googles, the young guys who started Google [Larry Page and Sergey Brin], there's example after example now of people who have amassed great wealth over the last few years who also have a real sense that that wealth should be shared with, with others to find solutions to some of the greatest problems that face humankind.
Story_ID: 365243
Speaker 1: Now what are your goals with CARE [Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere; CARE, Atlanta, Georgia]?  Now you just started in the spring, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I began, and I started CARE, been there six months now.  CARE, as you know, started out sixty, now sixty-one years ago as the organization that brought us the CARE package.
Speaker 1: Yeah, as a result, they were trying to alleviate the suffering after World War II [WWII] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) World War II.  The particularly famine relief and so the CARE package was primarily nutrition and other basic first aid and other things that people needed post World War II and, you know, it was a real, it was one of the very, very early examples of U.S. reaching out to other parts of the world to show the generosity of American people, and I think the CARE package in many ways was a very tangible symbol of us reaching out and saying to the rest of the world that we cared.  And, you know CARE has evolved from there to now a focus more on global issues related to the poorest of the poor with a mission to really work to reduce global poverty.  So now I've expanded way beyond the health issues, but really focusing on the issues that brought me into health to begin with.  The issues that are the drivers of inequity in our society and around the world.  So CARE is involved in seventy-some countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, with a real focus both on disaster and emergency relief, so CARE was one of the main organizations providing relief after the tsunami [2004 Indian Ocean tsunami] or after the Pakistan earthquake, so in major disasters, floods in Haiti, so we work around the world in disaster relief, but most of our resources now go into long-term sustainable development and looking at ways that we can help individuals lift themselves out of poverty around the word, both through providing basic services like health, nutrition, agriculture, education, access to micro credit, and loans to start small businesses.  But also focusing on the underlying causes of poverty like gender and equality.  How do we empower women? Because we know that if you make a difference in women's lives, you don't only change that woman's life, but you also change her family and her community, and so women are an extremely effective way to have an impact on poverty, and women make up the largest proportion of people who are poor around the world.  So a lot of our focus is on, how do you really give women the tools that they need to change their lives and the lives of their families? But we also work on issues everywhere from how do you work with people to develop their communities and make their governments accountable?  How do you help people to understand how to exercise their civic rights within a society so that they can be better citizens and they can learn how to participate in a democracy?  So we work on both the immediate causes of poverty and the immediate consequences of poverty, but also work on issues that help to change people status in their societies.
Story_ID: 365244
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I hope that as, you know I think basic things, you know, we need to improve and insist on better education for our community.  I still think that education is key.  It's the cornerstone.  It's what all of our parents told us, that if you get a good education, it's the best way out of, to get, to improve your life options.  And we still have abysmal education for our children in this country, and the divide is growing even wider.  So I hope for better education.  I hope for better economic options and opportunities.  We've got to be willing to, and demand access to parts of our economic, our economic system that we've been kept out of, like Wall Street, and you know, I think, economic independence is an incredibly important part of, you know, moving forward.  But I also hope that we continue to, as a community, give back.  I see far too many people not feeling a connectedness to the black community and giving back to the community and as they succeed in life, not looking at how can we continue to make a difference, and that we don't lock ourselves into, don't limit ourselves and limit our options for ourselves.  I think oftentimes we are too willing to be caught in a box that says this is, this is who we are and this is the limits of who we are, and so, you know, I'm thrilled when I see young black people who want to be astrophysicists or who want to, as you were talking about somebody you interviewed out in I forgot where you said--
Speaker 1: North Dakota.
Speaker 2: North Dakota.  You know we ought to take full advantage of whatever opportunities there are for us and not feel limited by what, what somebody else has defined as what you can do because you're black.  And so, what I hope for the black community is endless opportunity and taking advantage of all opportunities, but not forgetting who we are and not forgetting where we came from.
Story_ID: 365245
Speaker 1: Dealing with crises, especially with this AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] crisis in this country, and on the continent of Africa, how do you see our relationship with the continent of Africa, just briefly?  I know you can talk more (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I don't know if I want to talk about it in the context of AIDS per se, you know.  I guess I have valued my closeness to Africa through my work.  I think that it's giving me a real appreciation not only of Africa, but of the world.  It's given me an appreciation of being a global citizen, and I think by understanding Africa, we do understand who we are better and put in context our experience and realize that we do come from the people who started humanity.  On the other hand, we are African American.  Our experience is very much defined by being part of the American experience and so you know, while I think the, there is a huge benefit to understanding and knowing Africa more and learning more about Africa, and I wish every African American could visit and have some of the rich experiences that I've had by my opportunity to get to know Africa, I think we also need to realize that our experience is different and unique by having had the four hundred plus years of being part of the American experience as well.
Story_ID: 365246
Speaker 1: And when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Not, there's not much that I would do differently.  I, you know, I just feel very fortunate to have had an incredible life that's allowed me to have experiences that range from speaking to people in the most dire poverty and, and difficult circumstances to meeting with heads of states around the world.  You know I've had a rich experience and I've been blessed to have a career that allows me to make a difference in people's life, and that's all I ever really wanted to do with my life, is to use my life.  I feel very fortunate.  I feel like I came from a family that gave me a lot, gave me a good grounding and valued achievement and education and I want to use that.  I want to use that, you know, for as long as I possibly can to make a difference in the lives of people around the world, so I feel fortunate.  I've got wonderful friends, I have a full life.  I have fun and so there's not a lot that I can say that I regret.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe I should have thought about saving money a little bit earlier in life.  I don't, I don't, I never, I didn't choose a lucrative path, but you know, that's all right too.
Story_ID: 365247
Speaker 1: What would you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I don't think about legacy.  I, you know, I guess I just am more focused on what I'm doing at the present time, you know.  I hope that my legacy would be of a person who tried to make a difference and did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there anything that I haven't asked you that we need to raise before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Don't think so.
Speaker 1: Last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I think it's the same.  I guess I want to be remembered as somebody who tried to make a difference and did on the largest number of people's lives as possible.  And, hopefully, able to show that I made a tangible difference in the lives of those who suffer the most.
Speaker 1: All right.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: And also hope that I've been a good friend, a good friend, a good aunt, a good sister, and you know, to the people who have meant a lot to me and who have supported me over time.  I hope that I've been able to also do the same for them.
