Speaker 2: The full name is Dianne, no middle name, D-I-A-N-N-E, last name is Wilkerson, W-I-L-K-E-R-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Where were you born and when were you born?
Speaker 2: I, I was born in my grandmother's [Leslie Lee Campbell] house in May of 1955 [May 2, 1955], and at rural Pine Bluff, Arkansas.
Story_ID: 20256
Speaker 1: And your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Leslie Lee Campbell.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your grandmother.  Is she paternal grandmother?
Speaker 2: Maternal grandmother.
Speaker 1: Maternal grandmother.
Speaker 2: You know, it, it, it's, this year, in fact, has marked a milestone for me in terms of my relationship with my grandmother because I was, in fact, the last of the Wilkerson siblings, born in Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas.  Part of the reason why that occurred is, my mother [Ethel Mae Campbell Wilkerson] and father [Nathaniel Wilkerson, Sr.] both were from Pine Bluff, and that's where their parents lived in a time when blacks were not welcome at the hospital, which is, you know, people are kind of aghast when I tell them cause they think that that's something that happened a hundred years ago, but, but I, I was born in my grandmother's house, birthed by a midwife literally on the kitchen.  And I, you know, I've heard that story many, many, many times.  My mom and dad left Arkansas shortly after and came to visit my father's older brother in Springfield, Massachusetts.  And my mother got pregnant with my sister and was planning to get on a train and go back to Pine Bluff to deliver her.  And my sister came early.  She didn't make it.  My sister was born in the hospital in Springfield because in fifty--in the '50s [1950s], they weren't delivering children at home in Springfield, Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that sister's name was?
Speaker 2: Evelyn.
Speaker 1: Evelyn, okay.
Speaker 2: And so that my sister, Evelyn, was born in the hospital in Springfield, and my mother, I think, kind of figured this, this is not a bad thing.  I mean you actually--I get to lay here and I also get to rest.  I don't have to get up and go (unclear) outside.  And so all the rest of my siblings were born in Springfield, Massachusetts, in a hospital I might add.  And my, so, so because I was the last of the siblings born in, in my grandmother's home, it was a special and a transition, both in the family and in my relationship with her, my grandmother was a very, very strong woman.  She, she went into, one of my favorite stories about her, she went in, she went into the rest home in 1990 because my grandfather [Cherokee Campbell] was disabled, and just didn't want to--he just, he just decided one day, as the story is, is told, that he didn't feel like walking anymore.  And apparently, for two or three years my grandmother had been carrying him from bed to the living room everyday.  And my mother was talking to her on the phone and said something doesn't sound right; went to see her, and she had lost all this weight.  And immediately, mother said, this is not gonna work.  So he went into the nursing home on the condition that my grandmother went with him.  So when she went, it wasn't because she was ailing or an invalid.  She went because he wouldn't go without her.  And she lived in that same nursing home from 1990 until August of 2004.  She passed away.  Now, the, the, the relevance of, of that date is that four--five days earlier, on the twenty-eighth of July in an address to literally the nation, if not the world, at the Democratic National Convention, I, her--you know, this granddaughter from Pine Bluff, Arkansas got a chance to speak at the convention and talked about my grandmother.  And five days later, she passed away.  And so I, I feel like she at least, she at least lives long enough to see that happen, something that I can imagine, that she would never have imagined nor would I.  But it was, it was a special moment for me to talk about her because so many people see me in Massachusetts and can't really picture this, and a country, country girl (laughs), that was like born, born, you know, birthed by a midwife.  And for the five, six years of my life, I, I lived on a farm with chickens and pigs and--that we fed and, and an outhouse.
Story_ID: 20257
Speaker 1: What was your grandfather's name?  Tell me about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: My grandfather, and we all called him--and I'll tell you.  It's so funny, and we never knew his real name.  We all called him Cherokee.  And he was full blown, full blown, six feet, five, very tall and proud man, didn't say much at all.  We only got to visit them--I left when I was six, and we got to visit in summertime.  My mother [Ethel Mae Campbell Wilkerson] would literally pack us all up in a station wagon and we would drive to Pine Bluff, Arkansas for a summer vacation.  So none of us, you know, city kids thought that that was a good, that was a vacation to go live in a place that they had a outhouse and no inside plumbing (laughs).  So it was an adventure, it was an adventure.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Cherokee.
Speaker 1: Oh, Cherokee, Cherokee, yeah.
Speaker 2: Campbell.
Speaker 1: And he passed when?
Speaker 2: In 1993.
Story_ID: 20258
Speaker 1: What was your mother's name and where was she born, and when?
Speaker 2: My mother [Ethel Mae Campbell Wilkerson], born in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, Ethel Mae--yeah, everybody had a middle name, apparently, except, except me because I'm very happy that I didn't get a middle name because if I had had one, it undoubtedly would have been a doozey of a middle name because that was really the, just the practice of my family.  So for some reason, I was spared a middle name.  But my mom was from Pine Bluff, as was my father [Nathaniel Wilkerson, Sr.].  And she was born in 1935, and actually is, is now relocated from Massachusetts, brought all of her kids to Massachusetts and just in the last two years has relocated to Atlanta [Georgia].  So she lives, she's living in the South again.  My, my parents divorced when we were young.  My father actually is still in Springfield, Massachusetts and retired about, oh, seven, eight years ago; is one of the most incredible [Boston] Red Sox [professional baseball team] fans that I, I've ever known, probably one of the most incredible Red Sox fans ever born, lives for the season, needless to say, literally, was in heaven this entire season and is still pinching himself at the reality that they, that his team--.
Speaker 1: Did what they did.
Speaker 2: (laughs) won the World Series.
Speaker 1: Coming back to your mother for just a minute, she was retired from what work or occupation?
Speaker 2: My mother worked for the MBTA [Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority] in, in Massachusetts, a toll collector, in fact.  And this was one of many different things.  Well, one of the, one of the, the, the shared memories.  All of my sisters and brothers will tell you that pretty, pretty much the same thing about my mother.  She, as I said, as a single parent, just believed in work.  So she worked.  She worked all the time.  Much of the conversations that we had with her growing up were with her in a reclining position.  We would talk to her when we left in the morning.  She would be coming in from the third shift, and she would be, you know, in the bed.  And so we talked to her as she was just laying down, and we were getting dressed to go to school.  Much of our permission and parent, permission slips she signed, she signed them (laughs) laying down in the bed.  And she went from third shift to second, second shift.  And she just worked.  And, you know, the interesting thing about it is that we, you know, for, for us, that's what we knew.  And, and my mom worked herself so hard, you know, she, she would, she'd, she'd get sick from exhaustion and, and have to stop.  We were on welfare for that time.  As soon as she was well, she'd go back to work.  And so when people talk about welfare and the purpose in the twenty-first century, I always--that was my notion, that it was supposed to be there for people when, for temporary periods when they, when they needed it most, and not something that people kind of signed up for life, because that was the lesson that we learned.  She, her whole focus was making that we, you know, got--went to school.  My mom, nor my dad, in their, in their lifetime, because they were farmers and farmers' children, had more than a sixth grade education.  My mother actually ended up going back to get her GED [General Educational Development test for high school equivalency] after I graduated from college, which was well into the, the 1970s.  But she did it.  But she was a factory worker, as was my dad who worked in maintenance, worked in kitchens.  He was a cook, one of the most incredible bakers ever.
Story_ID: 20259
Speaker 1: I mean your father's name, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Nathaniel.
Speaker 1: Nathaniel.
Speaker 2: Wilkerson, Senior, Nathaniel Wilkerson, Sr.  And so both my parents, I'm blessed to have--both my parents are still living and both (unclear) good health.
Speaker 1: What about your father's, your father's parents?
Speaker 2: My fa--my father's parents, my, my father's mother outlived my grandmother--my grand, my paternal grandfather by almost forty years, which is pretty significant.  It's a long time.  He died in the 1950s and early, early 1950s, and she died in the early 1900--19, 1990s, I'm sorry.  And she was in her nineties.  So actually both of my grandmothers were in their nineties when they passed, ninety-three and then my, my maternal grandmother, ninety-three and my--my paternal grandmother, ninety-three.  My maternal grandmother [Leslie Lee Campbell] was ninety-four when she passed away in August 2004.  So, the, the history is the women in my family live long, long lives (laughs).
Story_ID: 20260
Speaker 1: Have there been any stories or legends or songs that have been handed down to you and your brothers and sisters from your parents, through the grandparents?
Speaker 2: You know--yeah, I--you know, most of the, most of the, the stories that we got and that we were told as children and even growing up about, by my mother [Ethel Mae Campbell Wilkerson], my father [Nathaniel Wilkerson, Sr.] or relatives were about the family's existence in rural Arkansas in the early, you know, 1900s and I would have to say that nearly every one of those stories, you know, was, was, was violent, was about the degradation, was about the tragedy, was about slavery and then the remnants of slavery.  It was about the second-class citizenship in which blacks lived during the time both of my parents grew up.  You know, when I say they got not even sixth grade education, it wasn't cause they just didn't feel like it.  That wasn't an option that was available to them.  They had to work, the boys and the girls had to work.  My father and my mother had very opposite places in their relative, in their respective families.  My mother was the oldest of four children and my father was the baby boy, number fifteen of sixteen children.  And it was a very different dynamic.  So I had uncles from my father's side that were older than my grandmother from my mother's mother.  It was a very unusual situation, but because people at that time had such large families, it was not unusual for them to span generations in, in the ages.  So my father as the baby brother, and there were sixteen, sixteen siblings, three daughters and thirteen boys.  And my father was the, was the baby, number fifteen of sixteen.  I have one aunt who was younger than my father.  And so I guess to some extent you would say that he was protected from much of what they endured, and not because they kept, they shielded him.  It's because they removed him.  That, that was how my parents came to live in Massachusetts.  There's two of my father's older brothers [William and Albert Wilkerson] who spent time in prison for what was a pretty, and a common, you know, racial incidents.  What was uncommon about it was that they lived.  But they did.  They lived long enough to serve their time and move their families.
Story_ID: 20261
Speaker 1: Why did they [Wilkerson's family] come to Springfield [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: I do know.  I, I--they came to Springfield because it was the farthest place they could get away from Arkansas on the train.  My father [Nathaniel Wilkerson, Sr.] had two older brothers, one, and we call Uncle Bill, William [Wilkerson].  He was a minister, and another uncle, Uncle Albert [Wilkerson].  And they both, those were the two older brothers who had spent time in prison for a story which I'll share with you.  And when they got out, they just said, "We're leaving."  My Uncle Albert went to California, which I think was just as far west as he could get.  My Uncle Bill went to Springfield, Massachusetts which was as far east as he could get, up north.  And it was--neither one of their, their travels was a common migration for blacks leaving the South.  I mean you kind of went straight up.  You, maybe you'd go to Illinois or Detroit [Michigan] or Indiana, but it was pretty unheard of for them to go from Arkansas to Massachusetts or Arkansas to Oakland, California, but that is where they went.  And I had an opportunity to meet my Uncle Albert for the first time in 1979, my first year in law school.  I had come to Boston [Massachusetts] to go to law school, got involved in the [National] Black Law Students Association [NBLSA], and in the fall of '79 [1979]--I had entered in '78 [1978], the national conference was in Oakland.  And so I talked to my father, and he, you know, he said, "You, you have an uncle there," and I said, "I, I want to meet him."  I had never seen him because he vowed never to return to Arkansas when he left.  And he never did.  And so when I went to Oakland, I had a chance to, to--it was a few machinations I had to go through, but I had a chance to meet him, and it was, it was almost ghostly for me because when, I'll never forget, when he answered the door, he was just a little, just a little shorter version, a spitting image of my father.  And he talked a little bit about that experience.  And so it was the first and only time that I got to see him.  My Uncle Bill, as I said, we, we went to Springfield with him, he was much older than my father and took my father and my mother [Ethel Mae Campbell Wilkerson].  And at that time, they had four children, and brought us to, to Springfield with him.  And that's where we stayed.  My Uncle Bill was a minister.  He, he worked for Hood Ice Cream, I'll never forget that.  So one of the fun--we always had ice cream.  We always had ice cream whenever we went to see him.
Speaker 1: How old were you now when you came to Springfield?
Speaker 2: Five.
Speaker 1: Five years old.
Speaker 2: Five, I was five years--.
Speaker 1: In, what, 1960 then?
Speaker 2: 1960.
Story_ID: 20262
Speaker 1: What is your earliest, farthest back memory of your childhood in Arkansas?  What's the farthest back thing you can remember about your childhood--?
Speaker 2: I can--.
Speaker 1: --in Pine Bluff [Arkansas]?
Speaker 2: I, I remember, you know what, the first thing I, I remember the leaving.  I remember the leaving.  I remember the train.
Speaker 1: What was that like?  How'd you feel?
Speaker 2: I, just, just I couldn't imagine what it is that we were gonna be doing that was taking so long, you know.  It's not like, and we didn't, we didn't have automobiles either that we rode in Pine Bluff.  So this one, the whole experience was just foreign and new and somewhat, and I won't say scary, I think more exciting, like, cause I had no idea where we were going.  And it was nothing my mother [Ethel Mae Campbell Wilkerson] and father [Nathaniel Wilkerson, Sr.] could tell us about it because they didn't know either.  They just knew we were leaving Arkansas, and Uncle Bill [William Wilkerson] thought this was a good idea.  And my mother [sic, father] as I said, was the baby boy, and he went.
Speaker 1: At age three and four, what do you remember about Pine Bluff, in Arkansas?
Speaker 2: I don't remember much of anything.  You know, and one thing that we do talk about because we all have this in common is, is the chickens, because that was our front yard.  So we played with them.  The pigs were in the back.  The chickens were in the front.  And, and I remember, well, I would say probably the only childhood incident I re--experience I remember in Pine Bluff was of the chickens because we would taunt the chickens.  And the chickens would pluck us, you know, the chicken would pluck--my big, my oldest brother had a, a mark on his forehead from the chickens.  My second oldest brother had one, and I have one (laughs) from the chickens.  They didn't appreciate us picking on them.  But it was the, it was the story, the, the--my uncle, my two uncles were growing up, you know, in, in Pine Bluff at a time when, in the 1900s, it's not--I'm not talking about two hundred years ago--in the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s] when it was against the local ordinance for blacks to drive on the road at the same time as whites.  And, and the rule was that if that happened, you were supposed to pull off to the side of the road and let them pass.  My, these two uncles, Uncle Bill and Uncle Albert [Wilkerson] apparently, on this, some particular day--and I don't think it was every explained to us if it was conscious or it just, you know, happened.  They didn't see, but they ended up on the road passing in their, you know, buggy, jeep when a car with three white men who were driving and, and needless to say, they didn't, they didn't pull off to the side of the road, a confrontation ensued.  It was pretty common at that time because people were farming and hunting that, you know, they carried guns.  You know, and they had in the, in the car, both of those parties.  And the--there were words exchanged.  The gentleman in the car passing, when he passed my uncle, stopped and there was gunfire, shots exchanged.  And the--two of the three white men ended up dead, and my, both my uncles survived, were arrested and it is really part of the, the story of, of Pine Bluff, again, that, having been there recently this past summer, no one was able to explain to us how they lived.  But a big part of it is that they happened to get connected with a very young, very aggressive and extremely bright and well-educated attorney, Wiley Branton, who has his own place in, in the history, the legal books in this country in the law and jurisprudence, represented them.  But they--and the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was, was involved.  I knew none of this, by the way, in this level of detail, before, you know, years later I got involved in the NAACP.  But they were, they were jailed in the, in the local jail and then eventually had to be moved because the town's people, the [Ku Klux] Klan, in particular, pretty much ruled the day at the point where they tried to burn it down because they wanted them hung.  They did spend time in prison, were released.  And eventually one of them was re-indicted and brought back.  They, probably a total of about ten, fifteen years.  No one's ever explained to me to this day why they weren't executed.  I don't think that they know because that would be the expected end of the story in rural Arkansas in the 1930s and '40s [1940s].  But it didn't happen.  And those were the same two uncles who, once they were able to get themselves free of, of the, the legal system, left and vowed never to return.  Uncle Albert never did come back.  Uncle Bill, of course, would come back and forth and visit his mother, my grandmother and his, his siblings on a regular, on a regular basis until he passed away in 1980.  But he passed away in Springfield, Massachusetts.  But that, but that's the most vivid in a long and sort of detailed story, that I remember about Pine Bluff is that they wanted to be gone.  It was a, we, you know, we lived in a shotgun shack.  I, I, I've seen the house.  I didn't remember it as a child, but I, we would go back, and we visited the house that we lived in.  And my parents and I think my uncles were just afraid that if we stayed, that one day, you know, the Klan would come and then shoot up the house, and that we'd all be dead.  And so we left and came to Massachusetts.
Story_ID: 20263
Speaker 1: You've told us about your mother [Ethel Mae Campbell Wilkerson], your father [Nathaniel Wilkerson, Sr.], your grandparents [Leslie Lee Campbell and Cherokee Campbell], your uncles [William and Albert Wilkerson], some of your siblings.  Of all those relatives, as you think about where you are now, what you've accomplished, is there a particular relative who was very influential and inspiring to you as you were a youngster?  Did any of them give you any special direction?
Speaker 2: You know--.
Speaker 1: I'm sure they all did, but does anyone stand out in your mind that?
Speaker 2: No, you know, I, I guess that was, it's, I mean I, I, I couldn't, I couldn't say, I couldn't pick one.  But, but part of, part of that is because of what has been a constant reality for me in my entire life that I, you know, I remember, for example, the first-grade teacher, the third-grade teacher, and I almost, I almost felt, to some extent, and I still do, that my life has been a series of, of pass-offs, and I say that in a most positive and supportive way, that I had mentors I never met, heroes that I modeled my life after, that I never met, but also a whole series of people who were just gonna come into my life at a particular time and, and it seemed just the right moment, you know.  I remember a conversation like yesterday that I had with my first-grade teacher.  I remember Ms. Chagrew (ph.), my kindergarten teacher and what she told me about my, my penmanship.  I'm, I'm left handed and it, they fought so hard to, to change it, you know.  And she finally just decided to leave me alone because I was literally torturing myself.  I was writing upside down to make it look like I was writing with, with my right hand, and I wasn't.
Story_ID: 20264
Speaker 1: You start elementary school immediately upon your arrival in Springfield [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Within a year, yeah, I started kindergarten.
Speaker 1: The following year?
Speaker 2: I started kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Of that year, that--?
Speaker 2: The, the end of, early '60 [1960], In the fall of 1960.
Speaker 1: You started kindergarten in Springfield?
Speaker 2: I started kindergarten.
Speaker 1: What school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Homer Street--I'm sorry, Carew Street School, and I remember, Mr. Donahue was the principal, who later became the superintendent of, of schools for, in Springfield, Massachusetts.  And I, I remember just kind of standing up there looking, first day of school, looking at this man who looked like a giant to me, but I, I loved it from the day I walked in that building, absolutely, positively loved it.  I remember, for example, I, I remember, I was, I was in a, a mixed first and second grade class.  So I was in the second grade in 1963, I remember the day my teacher came up to me--actually, we would go home for lunch.  And I had gone home for lunch when my mother [Ethel Mae Campbell Wilkerson] was absolutely distraught, sat, sitting glued to the black and white T.V. and, and that was when I learned that the President [John F. Kennedy] had been killed.  I didn't (unclear), I didn't know, I won't say assassinate cause that wasn't a word that meant anything to me, but I knew the President was, was dead, not like I knew him personally, but I knew that whatever this meant, my mother was distraught, and she couldn't wait to get us out of the house and kind of back to school.  So we left and went back to school after lunch.  And my teacher clearly had found out as well because she asked, she, she told us that she wanted us to sit, and she needed quiet, and to put our heads down.  And we sat there, and we all had our heads down, and she came over and she tapped me on the shoulder, and she said, "Come up to my desk."  And I went up to her desk, Ms. Milne, M-I-L-N-E, I'll never forget her.  And she said, "Dianne, do you know what happened today?"  And I said, "Yes, Ms. Milne."  And she said, "What?"  And I said, I told her.  I said, "The President was, was killed," or "The President is dead."  And she said, "That's right.  You can go back to your seat."  She didn't, she didn't want to talk about it.  She--well, I'm not sure I could have engaged her in conversation.  She didn't say anything other than that.  And, and I didn't know what that meant at the time.  I mean later on I, I, I concluded, I think that she just needed to say that to somebody, to tell--and I, it was just me.  But she called me up to her desk. in the fall of 1960.
Speaker 1: You started kindergarten in Springfield?
Speaker 2: I started kindergarten.
Story_ID: 20265
Speaker 1: What other memories do you have of your elementary school, school days?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know, all, all of my (pauses) I want to think about it before I make this statement.  Well, let me say it this way, I loved school.  For me coming from a family where, it, it was just so large.  And my house, it was always so busy.  And it was very difficult to get focused attention or even, I say, a quiet corner or a moment to do the things that I enjoyed most, the reading.  I mean it was, you can imagine, I mean there were, there were eight of us at least at that point and four later.  But there was something about the whole notion of just learning.  I, I just, I loved it.  I loved--I learned to read early.  You know, people all, a lot now about important it is, reading to children when they're young and not--that, that just, my mother [Ethel Mae Campbell Wilkerson] wasn't able to do that.  Number one, I couldn't even imagine how she would have been reading to eight different, but it just, it didn't happen.  And so, from the time I started in, in, in kindergarten--there was no pre-school at that time, I just loved this thing that they called the learning.  I mean I loved the reading.  I remember in first grade [at Carew Street School, Springfield, Massachusetts], this was before, even before the, the year before President [John F.] Kennedy was killed, in the first grade when my teacher used to go--and remember, teacher used to go on their coffee breaks.  They'd go to the teacher's lounge.  It was, everybody understood, we never were allowed to go in there.  Nobody knew what they did in there, but they'd go to the teacher's lounge.  My teacher used to, two or three times a week, take me into the teacher's lounge, sit me--I have, sit me in this big chair, of course, it was probably no bigger than this one I'm sitting in, but for me, it was like a throne, and give me the Springfield daily newspapers and have me read different articles to the teachers because they marveled that I could read, not that I learned before I got there because I didn't.  I learned when I got to school and I learned quickly.  And so all of, you know, really, all of my, my memories about school were just, were, were, were positive.  They, it would, it was good.  It was the place where, you know, I could, I could read about things that I, I had, I would never, thought I would never get to visit or I could read about things I'd never get to do, opened up a whole new world for me.  I remember, you know, books like 'Death Be Not Proud,' [by John J. Gunther], I mean the things that--I don't know.  And people, and I was able, you know, I was able to do it without being considered a nerd (laughs), which was also very important.  But that's because, you know, I had siblings, and we did that stuff.  I mean I loved the running.  I ran track.  I loved the outside.  I loved to play and all the stuff that we did.  And, but, but there was just this thing about the learning that always intrigued me.  And, and I realized early on that I, I had, that I was blessed cause I really do consider it a blessing.  I appreciated early on that, how different siblings, people growing up in the same household can be, and you could have five siblings and have five different interests, five totally different personalities.  But I, I was pretty resolved early on that, what mine was and what I, what I do remember that was important to me then and still now is my, it's almost like my brothers and sisters, although we never talked, figured that out.  We never talked about it.  They would do the dishes for me when my mother wasn't there so that I could go and sit and read, you know, let her go read.  And so I actually wanted to do that stuff along--a lot farther along in my life than my sister, any of my sisters and brothers.  And my mother didn't really know that I was not doing the dishes and doing the sweeping because they protected me.  And it was like, "We don't like that stuff, but if you want to do that stuff, that's okay."
Speaker 1: Did you like mathematics and scientific stuff too?
Speaker 2: I liked it.  I was a math major when I went to college.  But I ended up saving my--I, I switched my major, but I went to college as a math major.  Your whole (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: At this young age with this academic interests, did you have any notions about what you wanted to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: I had absolutely no idea.
Story_ID: 20266
Speaker 1: Now, you stayed in elementary school through grade six or through grade eight?
Speaker 2: Six, through six.
Speaker 1: Through six.
Speaker 2: Through six, left and went--in fact, we moved, I left Homer Street School--I mean Carew Street School [Springfield, Massachusetts] and for some part of my childhood, for two years, we, I went to Homer Street School [Springfield, Massachusetts], another school in Springfield.  Again, it was always, it always a positive experience for me.  So I didn't have like what they call start-up time.  If you drop me in the classroom, I would figure out what going on within a few days, and I'd be fine.
Speaker 1: Did they have advance classes for you?
Speaker 2: Not in elementary school we didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not in elementary school.
Speaker 1: What about the middle school?
Speaker 2: But what happened is that in the fifth grade, we, the summer before--end of the fifth grade, the summer before the sixth grade, we, like so many other families in the city of Springfield, got a letter in the mail in 1969 saying, "Next year your child, your children will not be going to the school, like, you know, there around the corner," and that we were assigned to--what for me was Samuel Bowles Elementary School [Springfield, Massachusetts].  And it was the beginning of what I came to learn years later, and I mean years later when I came to Boston [Massachusetts], of what we call busing.  It, the sole--for me, it was such a unique experience for us and in Spring--growing up in Springfield because I never appreciated in 1968, '67 [1967], '66 [1966] that we were in the same state as Boston.  We were in the part, what they called Pioneer Valley, and it was much closer to Hartford, Connecticut, and that was really kind of like our capital.  It would be years before I ever came to this place called Boston.
Speaker 1: Was your elementary school predominantly black then?
Speaker 2: It was until I got that letter.  And then we went to what was called Samuel Bowles Elementary School in East Springfield, and that's where I finished my sixth grade.  And of the student, you know, K--kindergarten through sixth grade, there were probably ten, total, black children and at least half of them were, were, were Wilkersons.  They were my siblings.  I was in the sixth grade.  I had a sister in the fifth grade.  I had a sister in the fourth grade, had a brother in the third grade, and a brother in the first grade.  And it was really for me, my first jolt of the, and appreciation of this notion of class and privilege because in Springfield, I, you know, although all of the children weren't black, but the black and white children never presented, at least to me, in a way where I was discerning different gaps, you know, in class.  Not, you couldn't tell from how anybody dressed.  It could have been.  I'm sure (unclear) may have been, but you didn't tell.  And, but that sixth grade experience was the first time that I, that I got this notion. That's what it said in my letter, (unclear) they got a Racial Imbalance Act of 1966 or '7 [1967], whatever it was, we--but it didn't, it didn't, it wasn't, there was no discussion.  There was no meetings.  There was no panic.  There was no screaming.  There was no yelling.  There was no community meeting.  There was no outrage.  What it was, was my mother [Ethel Mae Campbell Wilkerson] saying, "You're going to that corner now."
Story_ID: 20267
Speaker 1: So when you got to this new school [Samuel Bowles School, Springfield, Massachusetts], what was it like?  What happened?  How do you remember that?
Speaker 2: It was, it was different, well, clearly different in the composition of the students.  And I thought different in the, the kind of work they were doing.  It was different in the kind of activities they were doing.  I mean we did field trips, don't get me wrong, and my kindergarten through fifth grade, but--.
Speaker 1: But it was different in what way?
Speaker 2: The--.
Speaker 1: Was it more expansive for you or--(unclear) (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: More opportunities?
Speaker 2: More opportunities.  It seemed to me, it seemed to me, even for somebody who knew math, that they were talking about a different kind of math, you know.  And I picked it up, but, but it was, it was a lot about math and science.  It was a lot of, of--there was a lot more information and curriculum in what we were doing.  And that, the, the kinds of books we were reading seemed to kind of be much more advanced, if you will.  I'm not even saying new, I'm saying advanced.  And for me, it was, and we kind of took it all in stride.  We took a bus trip to New York.  Mind you, I'd never been to Boston [Massachusetts].  I took a bus trip to New York for a day, went to a play.  I remember that, and, and, and so on the whole, what, what happened, was happening to me is that the, the student were fine.  We never, we--there was no conflict between the students.  And the only, the only thing I can remember about some of the teachers, is not that they treated us differently with any disdain, but they treated us differently almost--they were marveling at the fact that I could read.  They were marveling at the fact that I could spell.  They marveled at the fact that I did know math, and the part of the math I didn't know, when they told me what I needed to know, then I knew it.  And so it, it was like, it was without a hitch, you know, I--it was, there was nothing that was, that was negative or different or traumatic, and well, negative or traumatic, it was just different.  But I was there for a year.  My sister, my siblings under me were there for, for a few more years than, than I.  But, but I remember the year.  You know, I remember the year between the fifth and sixth grade and when my parent--my mother got that letter and said, pursuant to the Act, the Racial Imbalance Act of 1965 and '66 [1966], you know, you are hereby assigned to Samuel Bowles Elementary School in East Springfield, Massachusetts.
Story_ID: 20268
Speaker 1: Tell me more about the street that you grew up on.  Where did live in Springfield [Massachusetts] at this time?  What is your neighborhood like?  Who are your neighbors?
Speaker 2: We lived in, actually, when we moved to Springfield, we started off in, and I guess there are reasons, for reasons I'm not quite sure, these things stick in the back of my mind, but we lived at 2699 Columbus Avenue, which, of course, I'd come to find another Columbus Avenue later, later on in my life in Boston [Massachusetts].  But 2699 Columbus Avenue, which was across the street from the railroad tracks and some time around--we left in, it was one, we left there.  I lived in a two family house.  We left there because of urban renewal.  I-95 in Springfield right now cuts through in the North end of the city in the neighborhood that, that we called home.  And when we left the North end, we, we moved up to, what is called Winchester Square, or now, more, (unclear) sometimes Mason Square.  That was the community where black people lived.  And when I say Latino people, for the most part the only Latino people I knew were Puerto Ricans.  There were no, not--no other ethnic populations of Hispanics.  And so it was a very diverse community, white, black, Puerto Rican, very little memory and knowledge about any kind of racial strife.  And part of what made watching the television, black and white T.V., and seeing these pictures of, you know, ugly contorted faces of adults and little children, you know, and the faces behind the school buses and, is that I couldn't imagine, you know, as a junior high school student [at Forest Park Middle School, Springfield, Massachusetts] or even early on in my high school experience, just couldn't figure out what those kids possibly could have done to make them so mad.  And no one ever explained it, and we just never talked about it, never talked about it.  I remember, all I remember was they said, Boston [Massachusetts], and again, I didn't appreciate, at the time, not yet, not until very shortly before I came to Boston, that that place that I was watching on T.V., that seemed like another country to me, was literally out the front door that I was sitting at the end of the turnpike, in the same state that I was sitting in.  You could not have convinced that that was in the same state cause it was such an incredibly and totally different response to what, what was going on.  But it was, you know, I, I went to junior high school in, at Forest Park Junior High in the Forest Park section of the city, which again, that was very much considered probably like a, the suburban part of, of, of Springfield.  And I will tell you, it, again, part of the whole busing experience, and it was new for them, well, again, we didn't have strife.  What we had was more student conflict.  And you remember now, we're in the '60s [1960s], and we're talking, we're watching T.V., where, you know, this is the war.  This is student unrest, and my own notion of it is that we wanted, we wanted to have black speakers come to the school every once in a while.  I mean that was as difficult and as tough as it got.  We wanted to have a bus because we were walking that one point six miles.  We were walking back and forth, but I also got a real dose of kind of this experience that, for the first and only time in my, in my matriculation in school from kindergarten through college, where I was uncom--a little uncomfortable that my friends and the people that I was walking back and forth to school with might know that I was smart.  And it bothered me because I just wanted them, not any, based on anything they said, but I think this was more in my mind.  I just wanted them to, to, to be okay with me.  Now, junior high school was the first time for me that we were divided by levels, they said.  So, you know, you go to seventh grade, it was seven one through seven ten.  Eighth grade, eight one through eight ten; ninth grade, nine one through nine ten.  And everybody kind of got a sense on what that meant.  And, as I said, the more I think about it, the more I'm confident it wasn't my friends issues cause they never said.  It was just like we'll meet in the cafeteria, and we all came from whatever classes we were in.  But I, from seventh grade and the eighth grade, the ninth grade, spent my three years in junior high school in seven two and eight two and in nine two.  And my friends kind of let me do what I had to do, and at some point, there were things that they would say to me, and by the time we got to ninth grade that made me understand that they thought this was kind of neat, that I was in the, in, in nine two, and that, that I was, in some respects, representing all of them in nine two.  And so I, I, I guess I got much more comfortable with it. But I would, I would certainly admit, I was, I was coasting and trying to hide that reality for the first two years of my junior high school experience and really into the ninth grade before I realized that, knowing was it not theirs, but they were actually were kind of excited about the fact that somebody that they knew was in the, the, the lower divisions.
Story_ID: 20269
Speaker 1: Are there any teachers at the junior high school [Forest Park Middle School, Springfield, Massachusetts] that were particularly influential in your development in the grades seven to nine?  (unclear).
Speaker 2: You know, I would say, with short answers, yes.  I remember my, my--I remember the Spanish teacher.  I remember principals.  I mean I, I, I always, I just always, I could have this notion that I mentioned earlier that this kind of, this trade-off that there were people that almost like sent me from grade to grade and they would pass me on to the next one.  And somebody would have made--somebody had made a call and said, "Watch out for her.  She does well, and don't let her tell you different."  And, you know, it was just, I was blessed in that regard because I can't ever remember a year in my matriculation when I didn't feel like I was being supported by, by my teachers.  And it was, it was, that was a good thing because I, like I said, I ate it up.  I just, I just loved it, I just, I loved the learning.  And I think it's more because, it's, it's much because I love the learning.  It's because I, I hated the not knowing.  I didn't like the feeling that there were people around me who knew more about things than I did.
Speaker 1: During this time, during elementary and junior high school, coming back to your home life and your family life, were there any special family events that took place within your family every year?  Special holidays and things that were traditional with you and your family as you grew up through these years?
Speaker 2: You know, I would say Christmas was always a big thing.  And not, not because there were, you know, not because of lots of presents, but just more the celebration of that season, of what it was, really, the non-commercial part of it because when I say, "big thing", believe me, I don't mean loads and loads and loads of gifts.  Remember my mom [Ethel Mae Campbell Wilkerson] was my mom.  My dad [Nathaniel Wilkerson, Sr.] was, was, was there at times and at times he was not.  So it wasn't all about the hoards of presents.  It was about the excitement of that season, you know, the snow, the, the, the religious reality of what that meant, the birth of Christ.  I mean we, we--I, I re--you know, I remember that we were just always together at that time of the year.  When we did our annual, like I said, our annual trek to Arkansas, which by the way, for most of my sisters and brothers, we dreaded it.  We just--.
Speaker 1: But there was an annual--?
Speaker 2: We dreaded it.
Speaker 1: --trek in the summer?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We dreaded it.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Because my grandmother [Leslie Lee Campbell] did not have in-house plumbing, and we were very, very much kind of, city kids by then. (laughs)
Story_ID: 20270
Speaker 1: So what'd you do while you were?  How long did you stay with your grandmother [Leslie Lee Campbell]?
Speaker 2: We would stay two or three weeks at a time.  And, and we would, we would, we would be pressing my mom [Ethel Mae Campbell Wilkerson] to visit.  We liked to visit people, and we particularly like to visit people that we knew had inside plumbing and-or air conditioning, which was also a luxury at the time.  We had one aunt who had air conditioning.  So we'd just go and sit in her house.  We wouldn't want to move. (laughs)  But it was, all of our traveling, when we first, in Pine Bluff [Arkansas], you know, circled around who had indoor plumbing and, and the bathroom.  But again, we did it, we did on, regularly, and my mom, and my mother would drive, and it was, it was a, it was--actually, when you think about a (unclear), it was a crazy thing to do because she was the only one who could drive.  She did not like stopping.  She liked to get in the car, and she'd go.  And we'd stop to go to the restrooms, but, you know, no overnight.  I mean it's a good twenty, twenty-four hour drive.  And she would insist that she was gonna drive.  And my mother would, would be, she would be falling asleep.  And so my sisters and brothers couldn't stay awake either.  So I always rode in the front seat with her.  It was my job to look at her and talk to her for the whole time, not that I was hired or directed by my sisters and brothers, but I self-appointed.  I'm saying, "Somebody's got to be awake, and if you guys are crazy enough to go back there and sleep, I'm, then I'm staying awake."  And so I'd talk to her, I'd yell to her and if I saw her getting drowsy, I would, I would poke one of my sisters and brothers and say, "Don't you have to go to the bathroom?"  So we would we stop, but, yeah, those, those were the, those were the things.  But I, I, I would say that, that the whole, the, it, it wasn't, it wasn't, it was not, given the reality of my parents' educational attainment, it wasn't a situation where they were in a position to sit, you know, and read and do math and all those kinds of things with me.  And I, you know, I don't--to me, that's not an embarrassing thing.  That's the reality for so many of the people in my generation, that transitional generation from the South, and I, you know, to those who came up North in search for a better education for their children.  I do think that, that the, the, that the environment for school was particularly designed and inviting for me because it was all about the encouragement of the things that I had wanted to do, and that was to learn.

Speaker 1: Let me ask you about church.  In your growing up years, did going to church and church life play a roll with you and your family in Spring--in Springfield [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: For my, for my dad [Nathaniel Wilkerson, Sr.].  When I say my dad, my dad was always a member, a deacon.  So we went, we, we were baptized in, in the Baptist church early on through my dad, through my father's affiliation.  For my mom [Ethel Mae Campbell Wilkerson], it was not that important.  For, we, we--and when we weren't with, with my dad, we would go.  The kids would go.  We went to, I remember we used to, we would go to Salvation Army Church.  They had a church in Springfield, only because, not that we looked in the book and said, Salvation Army, but because they had an after school programs, and we went to their--went to the after school programs.  And they would say, "By the way, we have church on Sunday."  And so it was a, you know, a, praying to the same God so it really didn't matter to us.  And, and so I have, you know, for me, now, I'm a Baptist.  So I go, I'm back to Baptist church, but I, that's where I was baptized.

Speaker 1: Before your, your high school days, reflecting back, what sights, sounds or smells remind you of your growing up in Springfield [Massachusetts]?  What sights, sounds or smells remind you of your growing up years?
Speaker 2: I'll start with the smells.  The smells that remind me of my, my growing up are peach cobbler, chitterlings, and baking cakes, cakes baking.  Those are, those are what I--all of my smells are associated with very positive things.  I don't have any negative smells, in memories at all.  They were all around something that was very, was a very pleasant, very pleasant.  Sights, I'd have to say, the school buildings, you know.  I, I remember every school, (unclear) remember, I remember every school.  When I go back to Springfield now, I go, I, for some reason, I go and check.  I want to check to see how, whether my high school is still okay.  Like, I know, you know, I, I will go by the Homer Street School [Springfield, Massachusetts], Carew Street School [Springfield, Massachusetts].  It's not open any more, but I, I, I remember those places because so much of my time, and the positive time in my childhood was spent in, in, in school buildings.
Speaker 1: You said that your smell is related to foods.  What is your favorite food today?
Speaker 2: Roast chicken and dressing.
Story_ID: 20273
Speaker 1: Let's get to high school.  What high school did you go to?
Speaker 2: I went to High School of Commerce [Springfield, Massachusetts], which is a college prep--it's actually weird.  It's college prep, slash stenography focused, also in Springfield, and I, I would have a contin--just much more stories about high school, but one of the continuing things for me is, again, those teachers, you know.  And I, I'd leave one in junior high school, and I would find them, you know, in, in high school.  Ms. Kane, who was my English teacher, who I remember, I was rem--I remember her vividly.  Ms. Hogan was my Spanish teacher, who seemed to, you know, literally, kind of just put her hand on, on me and push, prod, all, all in the right place, about the things that I should do, and what I should be doing and was just incredibly supportive.  I, I was in--by high school, had gotten over, actually, it started right around the ninth grade, this whole thing that I have about, I had about--I shared for seventh and eighth grade about not wanting too many people to know that I actually knew things.  And so pretty much over, getting over it by the ninth grade.  By the tenth grade I was just, it was, it, I was an avid, I mean was an avid learner.  I wasn't very bold and, and, an admitted student.  I, I, I liked the, I, I, I liked it.  I liked to talk about it.  It was important to me to do well.  It was important to me to, to make honor roll.  Those are the kinds of things that I figured early on that I--and part, part of it needed to do because I knew I wanted to go to college.  I still had not figured out what to do, quite yet, what to do, but I knew I wanted to go to college, and I knew that I had pay for it.  And I knew that my mother [Ethel Mae Campbell Wilkerson] was not in a situation to write a check for me to go to college.  So I knew that, I knew that much.  So what that meant to me from, what I got from my guidance counselors where the best way, my best bet was, scholarships.  And how I got the scholarship was gonna be through my study.  So, so that's what I did.  I, I ran track, I played basketball.  I mean I was the, I was an athlete.  I was, you know, lettered in four, four sports.
Story_ID: 20274
Speaker 1: Did you have after-school jobs and summer jobs to  begin to earn money for college?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  Some of the most funny, awful--.
Speaker 1: What did you do after school?  What kind of jobs you have?
Speaker 2: I picked cauliflower.  It's, it's weird, in, in western Massachusetts and--.
Speaker 1: And that would be what season?
Speaker 2: In the fall, actually, in the fall.  It's a, it's fall.  It is--.
Speaker 1: Did you like that?
Speaker 2: It was, it was one of the nastiest, nastiest exercises you ever want, I mean people talk about picking tobacco, cauliflower literally comes out of the ground.  And you have to dig into the ground to pull the roots out.  So it's not on a stalk.  You have to dig it out, you know.  You got to shovel it out, and usually, we see it nice, white and pristine in the grocery store.
Speaker 1: I want to do a quick detour here and this leads to a human interest kind of story, obviously, you didn't like summer?
Speaker 2: Un-unh.
Speaker 1: Because of going to Pine Bluff [Arkansas].
Speaker 2: Un-unh.  I only liked summer when I got into the, you know, high school [High School of Commerce, Springfield, Massachusetts] cause summer meant I could work.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the fall, well, you had to work and pick cauliflower.  Today, what is your favorite season?
Speaker 2: Definitely summer.
Story_ID: 20275
Speaker 1: You continue to thrive academically in, in a learning situation at the high school [High School of Commerce, Springfield, Massachusetts].  And you're thinking about college, making plans about how you're gonna get there.  What did you decide in your senior year, where were you gonna go and how you were gonna get there?  What, what critical decisions did you make?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was interesting because the, well, the, the teachers, and I said, I still have specifically, I can remember the names of my teachers in some very key--like I said, Ms. Hogan was my Spanish teacher, Ms. Kane my English teacher and whose home room I was in, were extremely supportive.  But guidance counselors on the other hand, were, were not.  And I, I think, I think that it had much to do with stereotyping even more than racism.  And by that I mean stereotyping about the things that women are supposed to do.  So despite the fact that I had been there, you know, was, was, was on the honor roll, made honor roll every semester that I was in high school, not only did I--and I did my, you know, geometry and calculus, but I also did stenography cause that, to me, it was, I wanted, just I want to know, and wanting to know, to have support, have fallback.  It was a skill set to me that I thought had value.  So I learned to do shorthand as well as I learned to do calculus and, and geometry.  And so my, so the guidance counselors were not, even, even given that record, in terms of the class, still didn't seem to be sold on this college notion.  And, in fact, at least once one said to me that because I was so good at the stenography that I should consider going straight from high school, you know, to work in a good secretarial position like Mass [Massachusetts] Mutual Insurance Company which was then, and probably still is now, one of the largest employers in, in Springfield, if not Western Massachusetts.  I also at that time--so I'm through ninth grade, through, through, through tenth grade and eleventh grade, I had my first, I had my son, my first, my oldest son when I was just a senior in high school.  I was not married.  It was one, it was a very interesting time for me because I'm in my senior year.  I had completed all of the required courses for graduation.  He was actually born in March, and we finished in May, but the, both the courses for graduation and the work that was to be used to calculate ranking was done and over.  Yet, the, my high school, my guidance counselor told me in no uncertain terms that she not only did not, did not want me to be there to complete the year, but I, I actually left the school after, at the Christmas break in 1972 and went to--I actually, I don't know that they particularly cared if I went anywhere, but I went to an alternative high school which ironically enough, was run by Boston [Massachusetts]--by Springfield Public Schools very, very early on in, in, in this time where it wasn't even an acknowledgment or an accommodation.  You know, the girls just disappeared.  But I went to Page, it was Page Academy [Springfield, Massachusetts] and was there for two months, did my work so that I would not lose any, any rank or step in, in graduation.  And when I, when, when I came back, and I was gone for two months, the first response was that I was not going to be able to graduate with my class.  Of course, my mother [Ethel Mae Campbell Wilkerson], even though she was not particularly learned in the details of academics, she had a gut sense about process.  And this was not acceptable to her.  So, and needless to say, after much discussion and debate, back between my high school and the school department, I went back and, and I did graduate.  In fact, I, I graduated in June with my classmates, a very large class for, for high school classes.  There were six hundred and seventy--six hundred and sixty students.  And I graduated number nine in the class.  And I had applied to college for, for--and, and filled out the financial aid forms.  In fact, I remember filling out all the financial aid forms in the fall of '72 [1972], when we had to submit them.  And I just brought them to my mother to sign.  So she'd give me information, but I filled out the form, and all she did was sign the paper.  And so my counselor who, who--Gladys Madura, I, I remember her name, who had been less than supportive of the concept of me going to college, was quite stunned when I not only came back and showed her an acceptance letter from American International College [Springfield, Massachusetts], but I also showed her my scholarship letter in which I was granted a four-year math scholarship, conditioned upon my maintaining, not my grades, but not only was I going to college, but I was going college on a scholarship.
Speaker 1: Was that full tuition?
Speaker 2: That was full tuition.
Story_ID: 20276
Speaker 1: I was, well, what, I, I was married right, the year after I graduated from high school and before I started college [at American International College, Springfield, Massachusetts].  So I didn't take a break.  So I married in August [1973], and I started college in Aug--at the end of the month in August.  And, but I went to, I went to college on an academic scholarship.  And I maintained that scholarship for, for the whole term.  I say the whole term because it actually took me five years instead of the four.  But, but I, I graduated from college, having borrowed the sum total of six hundred dollars.  And that was really the stretch right at the end of, of the four years.  But I was able to maintain my, my GPA [grade point average] and all, but I didn't end up a math major.  I, I was in the first graduating class of Public Administration majors because it was a new major that was created while I was matriculating.
Speaker 2: So you changed, you switched from Mathematics to Public Administration?
Speaker 1: I actually switched from Mathematics to English to Political Science to Public Administration.  And the--.
Speaker 2: All in four years?
Speaker 1: All in four years.
Speaker 2: Why did you keep switching?
Speaker 1: Well, because I was literally the, the, the, the math--it's just cause I decided I didn't like it, that that was really not what I wanted to do.  And I, and I went to English because I figured that that would be helpful and appropriate no matter what I decided to do.  And literally, in the end of that second year, beginning of the third year, they, they at least created, started the dialogue about the creation of a public administration major.  And, for me, again, I'm like, I liked to know how things are supposed to work.  I like to know--I liked information.  I liked this whole notion of service, the public service.  And so I hadn't quite said I knew what I was gonna do, but that, at least had my blood and juices and flowing.  I, I wanted to do that.  So the only reason that I needed to be the political science major for that one year interim because I, I was clear in understanding that much of that major requirement was going to be part of the public administration requirement.  And so I would be able to just transfer and would have already completed much of that, the management and political science combination, economics.  And they had, they both offered that, and so that really was just a kind of stop-gap, getting to the public administration.  And it was, that combination of political science and service, government work, not, not elected politics.  That was, again, still a foreign, totally foreign concept to me.  It wasn't what I was thinking of doing, wanted to do.  I worked through, through high school, through much of my college curriculum, part time, but I worked, you know.  It was work assignment or part-time work I picked, as I said, started in high school, picked cauliflower.  I picked tobacco.  I was a daycare assistant.  I worked, drove a school bus for, you know, in the mornings.  Whatever, and, and whatever it was that I needed to do, I could do it because I understood all of it was, any of it was temporary.  And it's just part of--you know, I say that now, I mean you can do anything for a few minutes if it's, if it's leading you to something bigger and better that you see yourself doing later.  And so I had my share of very interesting grunt and grudge work. (laughs)

Speaker 1: So your first son was a year old when you entered American International College [Springfield, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: He was born in March, and, of '73 [1973], and I started school in August of '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Right, you have another son who was born?
Speaker 2: He was born a year later.  Actually, he was born in August of '74 [1974], so he, he was born--actually, he was born in the middle of August--the fifteenth, and again, started school in September.  But I was still in, in a place where I was--my family was there.  And so we didn't have the kind of challenges around which daycare because it was which sister, which brother, which uncle, you know.  And it was a, a major kind of universal schedule and coordination to figure out from day-to-day where they were gonna be.  But that's how it worked for me.  And--.
Speaker 1: Very briefly, it's important to know about your family.  How old are your sons today and where are they are and what are they doing?
Speaker 2: My oldest son is thirty-one years old, is a sales associate for the 'Boston Globe' [newspaper].  My younger who is thirty is a special investigator for the district attorney for Suffolk County [Massachusetts].  So they're doing all right.  They're both here.  They've stayed, you know, stayed in--went away to school themselves and came back and stayed in Boston [Massachusetts], and are probably gonna be here for the foreseeable future anyway.
Speaker 1: We'll talk about the grandchildren later.  So and you went through, raised your family, finished AIC [American International College], public administration.
Speaker 2: Took a year off, had some, some really serious health issues, and that is between my second and third year, I was diagnosed epileptic and really had to, I had to stop to figure out how to get that under control.  And so I took one year off, and I was stir crazy--I just, I was, "I got to go back to school.  I want to go back to school," but it was also the time which I was separated, you know, talked with my family.  And they said, you know, you, you, you need to finish.  You need to finish school.  And so back I went and was able to, able to do that and maintain my scholarship.  And that was really, you know, 1977, '78 [1978] is when I'd say for the first time, I began to focus on, on this place that we call Boston, that I now call home in appreciating that it was, in fact, that, that city that they used to talk about, that they were talking about in those black and white news clips that I saw, with all the busing and the angry people and (unclear) and contorted faces.  And so I decided as a senior in college that I wanted to go to law school.  And for me it was, there were two things, the continuation of this notion of learning and learning as much as I could about how things were supposed to be working, having a very clear an profound sense of, of injustice, although I don't believe that that's what I called it because I'm not sure I understood, grasped that word, but that things were just not the way I thought they were supposed to be for the people around me.  And the third reason as that I realized that I was not going to be able to support a, you know, two little boys, but growing boys on a salary based on an undergrad degree.  I had a Bachelors of Science, but still, you know, I was--my family was absolutely, and friends were absolutely ecstatic because I got an offer from J. C. Penney's [department store] to enter their management trainee course at $9900 in 1978.  And I would say, yeah, it was a lot of money, but I, I did some math on that.  And the way I figured is if I was able to double my salary in five years, which would be a pretty aggressive goal by any means, that I would be under twenty thousand dollars in five years and just didn't see how that was going to get me to a place where I could provide the kind of things that I needed and wanted too for my children.  So I said, I, look I have to get a graduate degree.
Story_ID: 20278
Speaker 1: So, so I, I decided on law school and decided I wanted to go to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And in the fall of '77 [1977] got a notice in the student union, Black Student Union in college that the, there was gonna be a job fair at, in Boston, at Boston College Law School [Newton, Massachusetts].  And I called from the office to find out if Howard was gonna have a representative here.  And they told me "Yes."  So I got a friend of mine to agree to drive down here with me, and--for the Law Day in, in October of 1977.
Speaker 2: So you were interested in Howard [University] Law School at the time?
Speaker 1: Only, only (with emphasis).
Speaker 2: All right, then what happened?
Speaker 1: I got to the campus, and the first thing that I saw was this big imposing man on the, on lawn, who introduced himself as the dean of the law school [Richard G. Huber].  I thought that was very weird, that a dean would be standing out in the law school welcoming visitors to his school.  But, okay, remember that.  Then I go into the building, and they have all these people, these young--students, black students who were hosting this Law Day.  And as I began to talk to them, many of them were, if not most, were from Boston College Law School.  And I was both impressed and intrigued.  I met two women in the first hours here, both of whom were single mothers who were matriculating at the law school.  They had a, a luncheon program, and this young man who was, in my opinion, just a very incredible and dynamic speaker, who they introduced as the president of the Black Law Students Association, gave the luncheon address.  And his name was Charles Ogletree, and I was basically sold, you know, on, on Boston, on B.C. [Boston College] Law School because of the students and the dean.  I talked to the recruiter from B.C.  I never made it to the table for, for Howard [University Law School], never applied any other place but B.C.  And that's kind of how it all began, coming to see Howard, Howard's recruiter and ended up talking and then convinced to apply to B.C. Law School.
Speaker 2: Tell me about how many years, was that three years in law school?
Speaker 1: Three years.
Story_ID: 20279
Speaker 1: Briefly tell me about that experience.  What was it like being a black female in--?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it started, it started in, you know, this is 1978, and like I said, I, I now know that I want to be a lawyer.  And the reason that I had decided I want to do this is because I saw this woman on television speaking.  And all I remember about the description of her is that they said she was a lawyer.  Now, it turned out it was a whole more than that.  It was [U.S.] Congresswoman, Barbara Jordan, but I heard lawyer, and I thought that the reason that she spoke like that, and that she was so impressive was because she was a lawyer.  And so I decided that's what I want to do.  So when I was planning, it wasn't I want to be a Congress--I want to be a lawyer, cause I thought a lawyer, then I can, I can be standing in this congressional well talking like this woman called Barbara Jordan.  And she became my instant hero when I watched her deliver the speech at, you know, the Democratic [political party] National Convention.  And I, I was--I had seen her earlier, a few years earlier in the Watergate hearings, but just briefly, and I didn't--that was not the, the point that had the impact on me.  It definitely was, it was that speech at the convention, the night she was the keynote speaker.  And so I was gonna be, I was gonna be a lawyer.  And what happened is, several months after--that was in October.  In March or April of 1978, I'm just very close to graduating, I get a call.  I was in the student union one day, from B.C. [Boston College] Law School [Newton, Massachusetts].  And they said, this is, this is Dean, Dean [Richard G.] Huber is on the phone.  And I remember this is the man that I met on the lawn that day.  And I take the phone call, and he basically is calling to tell me that they were prepared to extend an offer of acceptance for me for Boston College Law School, but because I had not had any real experience, not life experience or, or even real clear knowledge about the law, that he thought that it would be a good idea for me to apply to this program called CLEO, Council on Legal Educational Opportunity.  And, in fact, B.C. Law School was hosting the program.  It's a six-week, pre-law institute, an intensive, intensive, pre-law institute, and that if I would agree to come to the six-week pre-law institute, that he would guarantee me a place in the class of 1981, and for as long as I was able to stay there and maintain a, at least a B average, that, that my tuition would be covered if I completed the program.  So that was a, that was a no-brainer because I actually had no idea how to, I had no, no ability to pay and wasn't really hot on the idea that I was borrow money to go to law school cause ten thousand dollars was like a million dollars to me, and I didn't like the idea that I would owe anybody that kind of money.  So, so I packed up, you know, talked to my family, arranged for my sons to stay in, in Springfield [Massachusetts].  And I came to Boston [Massachusetts] for that six weeks to pre-law institute.  It was the most fascinating, incredible experience for me.  And I was so excited by the ending that I was ready.  I'm like, "If this is what this is gonna be about, I know that I'm gonna enjoy it."  And I did.  People look at me like I'm nuts.  I'll tell them that law school, I loved it.  I loved the learning, I loved the challenge, I loved the experience.  I met people for the first time in my life, sat in classrooms with people cause it wasn't really like this at coll--in college, who had never, I mean I didn't really appreciate that you could grow up in this country, live till you're twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine and be in, in an environment where you never sat next black people before.  And I met them, and I met students who were free in sharing of that reality with us.  I had a, a teacher, again, almost from the first week, second week I got there, who just connected with me, right away, Sanford [N.] Katz.  He asked a question one day in consti--in property, in property, and he, and I answered it.  And at the end of the class, he called me over.  And he said, "I'm very curious.  Where did you go to school?"  And I said, you know, "American International College [Springfield, Massachusetts]."  And he said, "No, I don't mean this school, school!"  I said, "In Springfield."  And he said, "Public school?"  I said, "Yeah, public school."  And he said, "That's interesting."  And I, I don't know what all of that meant except from then on out, he really, he looked after me.  I had a work study job with him that first summer after law school.  He was a, he is a noted, noted author and expert on family law.
Speaker 1: Sanford?
Speaker 2: Katz.  K-A-T-Z.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: And, and children and family law.  But that was my experience and, and for, for law school.
Story_ID: 20280
Speaker 1: I just, I loved the, the learning and the knowledge, and I think part of the re-reality for me and why it worked is because, unlike some of my classmates, who came there, you know, came there carefree, I had two children who had come to Bost--come to Boston [Massachusetts] with me, who started pre-kindergarten and kindergarten as I was starting law school.  And so there were just things that had to be done, and if I as not disciplined, it wasn't going to work.  So, and as they went off to school, I dropped them at the school, at the school in the morning in Brighton [neighborhood in Boston], and I would go to Newton [Massachusetts], Chestnut Hill [neighborhood in Boston], study, pick them up.  Most of the days, we'd bring them back, I'd bring them back to the library.  We'd study until dinner time.  I'd come home, give them dinner, and work with them on their homework, put them to bed and I would go back to study.  And it became very much a routine.  So I was never able or I never allowed myself to get behind because I knew I would not be able to catch up on this.  And it worked.  I think that the school piece worked, and again, it became almost a haven for me because I--although I, although I received many warnings, many earnings, I mean people who would feel my forehead in Springfield [Massachusetts], when I told them I was coming to Boston.  And I got the looks, I got the stares, are you crazy?  Whatever you do, don't go to South Boston.  Just whatever you do, don't go to South Boston.  And that's where I was, it was stuck in my head.  I didn't know a single soul here.  I had a friend, one of my classmates from college, who, who knew someone who lived here.  And he asked her if she would just kind of look out for me.  But I, it wasn't like we were coming to family.  I knew no one here.  And it was, it was a--it was culture shock for me, aside from the just the, being in classrooms.  Out of the school environment, and, you know, traveling through Chestnut, Cleveland Circle and living in Brighton was absolute culture shock for me.  The level of hostility, I was not prepared for.  Why?  Because as far as I knew I was in the same state as when I, when I'd left.  The people looked pretty much the same, and I knew I was not in South Boston, which is the one place everybody told me not to go.  So I'm thinking in Brighton.  So what's, what's wrong with this picture.  But it, it was, it was a very, very, it was a very hostile experience the first year.
Speaker 2: But you were determined to be a lawyer, and you got your degree in 1981, J--J.D. degree?
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Story_ID: 20281
Speaker 1: What came next then?  Now, you have the--?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you have that, that summer, studying for the bar exam.  I actually, I didn't have any money.  I had been, I had received an offer to clerk in the Massachusetts Appeals Court, much of it, this experience for me early on was all new.  I, I faked a lot like I knew what this was about, but I really didn't.  And I would pull people over, and they would tell me, you know, you understand, this is really big stuff, I mean, you know, this is really, this is really important.  I, I learned, you know, in this process, that there had not been a, an African American female law clerk in the Massachusetts Appeals Court ever.  And so I was going, I was going in the fall of '81 [1981] as the first.  And the interesting thing is that because I wasn't, you know, we graduated in June.  I wasn't starting my work, cause you start on the school schedule when you do clerkships.  You--I wasn't starting until September, and the bar exam was in July, but I didn't have any money.  So my initial plan was, I was going to work, go to work in September and study for that February exam.  But as I thought about it, and decided that I didn't have anything to lose.  I wasn't going to work until September.  So, but I would create my own exam study process and apply to take the bar exam because I, I could not afford a bar review course.  And, you know, I suspect and, and in retrospect, I, I--since I do know, that had I really been aggressive, I probably would have and could have found somewhere which, that would have provided that support for me, but didn't.  And I think also I was not really comfortable in telling anybody that, that I was not gonna take a bar exam course because I didn't have any money.  So what I told people is I would wait until February, thinking I'd start work in September.  But I decided to do it, and so what I did was literally, to take my course books from various classes and try to read them over the summer.  And this has got to be like the craziest plan, of course, known to man, but this is what I did.  And I figured I had absolutely nothing to lose.  So I started, and I would be on this routine; kids would go to school, and then they finished school in June.  They'd go to class--I mean they'd go to day, day and daycare.  So I continued to send them to daycare.  And every single day, ten o'clock.  I'd go.  I'd sit at the desk.  I'd turn this little alarm clock on, and I would just start reading.  So I'd read till they came home.  I'd take my break, we'd do the dinner--same routine, do the dinner.  They'd go to bed.  I would go back to reading.  And I went through this for the whole, June, middle of July--and I had friends who were taking bar exam courses, who would come once a week and just study with me, kind of talk about what they had learned in their bar review.  And then midway through, from June to the end of July for the exam, there was a practice exam for people who took the course at B.U. [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts].  And so we kind of cooked up this plan that I would sneak in and take the practice exam, which is exactly what I did.  I snuck in to B.U., took the practice exam.  They grade it.  I took it with me, and I used that for the rest of the time between the, early July and end of July when it was time for the exam.  And I took it and kind of sat like everybody else and waited.  So time goes by and the one thing that I remember about that, that I will never forget is I woke the morning of the bar exam and Hynes had just opened, I--we took our exam at the Hynes Convention Center.  And it was all this hype about Princess Diana [Frances Spencer] and Charles [Prince of Wales] getting married, and I knew they were getting married on the day, same day as the bar exam and we talked about this a lot, talked about it a lot.  So I had my alarm set.  I had somebody that was calling me, just to make sure I didn't oversleep.  You know, you go through all this anxiety.  So the morning of the exam, I wake up and click on my T.V. and the first thing I see is Princess Diana walking down the aisle in the cathedral.  I almost lost it because I didn't really connect the time difference.  So I even knew that they were getting married like at 10:00 o'clock in the morning.  And so when I saw her, of course, my first thought is, I've slept through the alarm.  I, I missed the phone call, and I've missed the exam.  And it took me about fifteen minutes to get my bearings, to realize that that was London [England, United Kingdom] time, and that it was okay (laughs).  I was--.
Speaker 1: When did you receive notice that you got, passed the bar, when, when did you--?
Speaker 2: In November.
Speaker 1: In November.
Speaker 2: The week before Thanksgiving.
Speaker 1: And that's November of?
Speaker 2: Of nine--of '81 [1981].
Story_ID: 20282
Speaker 1: So you've passed the bar.  What came next?
Speaker 2: Passed the bar and I'm now in my, in my clerkship, well, what came as complete and total relief, cause I was prepared.  I was prepared to take it over again.  I really thought of that as an exercise, the first time I did it.  And so needless to say, I was ecstatic.  It was done, it was over, and I was on the phone calling, but anyway I--so I did my, my year in the Appeals Court, and towards the end of that term--cause it's a one-year appointment, got a call from, literally, upstairs, the counsel for the Supreme Judicial Court was looking to hire a deputy counsel and had, I had referred by one of the Justices in the Appeals Court.  And that was when I actually spent my second year out of law school as the deputy counsel to the Supreme Judicial Court.  And it was one of those things, again, where I think, I think for the first time then, not when I went to the Appeals Court, but when I went to the SJC [Supreme Judicial Court], and I began to think about this whole issue of pioneering in a way that was very different for me because I always, I mean I thought of the pioneers.  I mean Barbara Jordan was a pioneer to me.  Patricia Harris was a pioneer to me in terms of the, the women.  I--there, there was not a black female attorney in Western Massachusetts so I never met one until I came to Boston [Massachusetts] to go to law school.  There was not a licensed black, female attorney in the entire western part of the state.  So when I talk about the role models and, and being in a situation where some of them to me and live, and I could touch them, and some of them were people I saw in 'Jet' magazine and that I saw on T.V.  So, but by the time I got to the SJC, I accepted the position, it is when the conversations, I began to appreciate talking with people about this, that now, I--and I only had two jobs, you know, post-law school.  I had been a clerk in the Appeals Court and I found myself in a position where, you know, learning that there had not, there had never been an African American law clerk in our Massachusetts Appeals Court.  So now I'm at the Supreme Judicial Court, the highest court in the land, and obviously, the old--it's the oldest Supreme Judicial Court.  In fact, our Supreme Court of the United States is modeled is after the SJC and, as the deputy counsel, and, and there had never been a black female deputy counsel in the SJC.  And I, I do think that second year is when this whole issue, the reality of the pioneering began to hit me because neither one of those opportunities were, were, were enticing to me because I wanted to be some place where I would be the first.  That, that--I don't know.  I would think for most people that--well, I would like to think that that's not the motivating factor.  It certainly wasn't for me.  It happened to be that I chose a profession where there had not been many opportunities and so much of anything that we were going to do would put most of us in that category, at least I thought so.  And then when I had to get real with it, people say, no, Dianne, no, that's, don't, don't try to minimize the importance and relevance of, of what this means.  And so I had to do some adjusting.  And then I spent a year in the SJC.  It was an incredible experience, and left there after that one-year appointment, and went into, went to work for a Boston office of a New York law firm.  And I practiced there for two years, and it was an experience that I probably would not have had, had I gone straight from law school, cause there were no law firms grabbing up the black law students.  There just weren't, no matter how well you did, and I did pretty well in law school.  So I, I do feel like I had been, become acceptable to them, having spent that year in the Appeals Court and then the year at the SJC.  And I, I was there for two years, and it was, it--as it always seems to happen, around the time where I was getting anxious and just thinking, I'm not sure that I want to do this, you know, this seventy, eighty hour associate work, and the children--boys are getting older, and I want to be able to watch them closer.  My family was, I had some family here by then.  But, but I got a call one day.  Actually, it was, went off to--in 1985, I went to Kenya in July for the United Nations Conference on the Deca--Decade of Women.  And while I was in Kenya, I got a call from my, one of the partners in the law firm, Rudy Pierce.
Story_ID: 20283
Speaker 1: Give me the name of the law firm that worked--?
Speaker 2: It's LeBoeuf, Livey and MacRae--LeBoeuf, Lamb, Livey [now Greene] and MacRae.  It's a New York law firm.  They had like three or four hundred attorneys, you know, around the country.  But again, no black, female associates in all of the seven offices around the country.
Speaker 1: Rudy Pierce was there?
Speaker 2: Rudy left the bench and came to LeBoeuf.  He left the bench a year early in 19--end, around end of '84 [1984].  And that's the law firm he came to.  He came as a partner, and so I got to work with him.  But I was really feeling that anxiety again.  I said, I, I want to do something different; went off to Kenya, and while I was there, I got the call from Rudy saying that, informing me that Governor [Michael S.] Dukakis had called.  His office, he had called and talked to Rudy about the fact that they were looking for legal counsel, assistant legal counsel.  And I knew that I'm friends or anything.  I just happened--I lived for a short time in Brookline [Massachusetts] and was a member of the Brookline Democratic Committee.  And so I'd met him, and that's all I can say is that I met, not we were friends.  But he would, he remembered enough to call and ask for me.  And so I, I told, I told Rudy that I would, I'd love to talk to him about it, and, and that I would be back.  I came back from Kenya.  I had the conversation with them, I talked with Governor Dukakis.  And that was in July, and in September of 1985, I went to work, I came to work back--I came to the State House to work as the assistant legal counsel for Michael Dukakis.  And, you know, I, I stayed here in that capacity for two--almost three years, and it was, again, you know, the way it came to me, it was the governor looking for a legal counsel.  For a whole host of reasons, it offered me an--I liked, again, I have a degree, a Bachelors of Science in Public Administration.  So the notion of government service, working in government was particularly exciting to me.  And so I came back.  I, I get here, and when I accepted the job, conversation start all over again.  And this is when it began to, I would say, to get eerie to me.  And I, by that I mean, I've now only had four jobs, and that's not a lot.  I mean so--cause two of them are clerkships.  I mean the Appeals Court and then the SJC [Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court] counsel, which is pretty prestigious, but it, you know, it's a year.  And then I went to work at this law firm.  And now, I'm coming to work for Governor Dukakis in '85 [1985], and in, and in four years, I've had four jobs, all of which, in, in all of which I, I was the first African American female, you know, at, at every one of them.  And I'll tell you.  It began to get eerie to me.  And the reason is because you, honestly could not even imagine how no like me it would be to kind of sit down and plot out things to do in which I could be the first.  It just was not--I don't even know how to do that.  And, and so I, I, I took advantage of every moment and opportunity that was presented to me.  I, I learned a lot, you know, this mix between politics and the law.  And I had, in 1987, the Governor decided, that was the year he decided he was going to run for president.  As a member of the senior staff, it was clear to me that the expectation was that we would be traveling with them, and I think it was an appropriate expectation.  I just knew I couldn't do that because I had the two children, the two boys, and they're, you know, now in junior high school.  And I, I needed, I needed to be there, and was not in a position.  So it was a good time for me to leave.  I, I, I left the Governor's office and went to a law firm of [Murtha, Cullina,] Roche, Carens and DeGiacomo, and--in 1987, and, and I stayed there until 1992 in December when I left to be sworn into the [Massachusetts State] Senate.  But in that five-year period, a lot of things happened, and this is even to the time with the Governor and into Roche Carens.  You know, I, I, I got involved with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] as a member of the housing committee.  In fact, I chaired the committee, was able to use some of my legal training in an area and a passion that I loved around housing.  And, and, and so this whole theme, early on, of, of equity and justice and equity and justice and equity and justice, which was part of the motivating themes for me in my life, this, this search, that it's--we got to be able to do this better, that, that things are not working the way they're supposed to be for people.  And to the extent that there was anything that I could in using the, the blessings that God had given to me to make things better, make things more fair for people, then I would do that.  And it was a, there were some exciting times.  It was some, often hairy times because it was Boston [Massachusetts], and Boston is a very live city where advo-, advocacy is an art; politics is a sport, and that often those two, those things collide in a way that is designed to leave no one standing.  But I went to Roche, Carens, who also, by the way, supported the, the, the work, the pro bono work that we did.  So I was able to continue my--.
Speaker 1: With the NAA--?
Speaker 2: With the NAACP.
Story_ID: 20284
Speaker 1: In addition to the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] involvement and taking over the NAACP case against HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] and the Boston Housing Authority, what else happened between the time you went to work for the law firm and your decision to run and become the first African American woman to be elected to the Massachusetts State Senate?  What else happened to get you to run?  What happened during that, those three years?
Speaker 2: You know, more of the same.  This whole issue, and I'd say, as briefly as I could, could in the order in which it occurred.  I became a chair of the Housing Committee of the NAACP.  And in that capacity was, was given to revive a case that had been filed early on, in the late '70s [1970s] around housing and HUD and discrimination, charging that HUD had continually pumped money, tens of millions of dollars of money into the City of Boston [Massachusetts], that HUD knew--because of the many complaints by the NAACP and black and other residents of color, that HUD was using that money in a way that they were not able to access the benefit of those federal dollars.  But HUD did nothing.  Wild imagination, you know, of a pretty brilliant attorney called [Thomas] Tom Atkins, who had filed this case years before, and it had been no case like that in the country that would hold HUD responsible for not monitoring the use of the dollars that they'd give to cities and towns.  But he did it.  And we were given a notice by the judge.  We either had to prosecute the case or it was going to be dismissed.  And so we picked it up where, through a host of incredible resources, I think, and support by people from across the city, some quiet and some not, some public and some not so public, the case was, in fact, revived.  We went before the court in 1986, '85 [1985], '86 [1986] and were ordered to mediation.  We tried mediation for two years, and HUD took the position going in and took--and maintained the position going out that they had nothing to mediate because they had done nothing wrong.  So we were, at the end of that time, went back into court and told the judge, look, we tried, but they won't, they won't cooperate.  And so in 1989, some four years later, the U.S. District Court issued an opinion, which was sweeping and broad in, in its ruling, found HUD, HUD derelict in its duty of monitoring the dollars, ordered a host of, of remedies, most of which, by the way, were proactive, around actions that they should stop in the future.  There was one directive that the--HUD had to move immediately to ensure that the City of Boston adopted enforcement laws in their fair housing enforcement policy that had some real teeth in it because they called our, our bill at the time, our ordinance at the time, a paper tiger that mandates were flaunting at will, and that the discrimina--housing discrimination was rampant in the city and particularly problematic because they also found a severe housing crisis at the time.  And so we, and so we were able to, and with that ruling, after a judgment was ordered, HUD then calls us and says, we'd like to talk about a, about a, an agreement.  And, you know, we said, we said, why should we, why should we talk to you about an agreement?  We, we won the case.  And what they said was, yeah, you don't have--there's no, there are no resources.  We have an opportunity here to really put some resources to it.  Now, clearly, HUD, what HUD didn't want was that ruling on the books.  And coming on the back of a, an additional or a sister case that we had filed through the Boston branch in 1987, two years earlier, which charged our local housing authority with discrimination and steering and steering families of color away from vacant units in white neighborhoods when they sometimes were, were maintained in homeless shelters while there were hundreds of units vacant in neighborhoods in which they would not, they refused to place them.  So that case, because the city was aware that this HUD case was matriculating through this process and that we were doing very well and likely to win, but nobody what we would win, the city settled that case with us in eighteen months.  And it became, in 1987, through that settlement, the first of its kind in the United States where a housing authority was, was, was found guilty of discrimination, and the remedy was cash and resources to individual victims.  We developed a class.  There were nineteen hundred people in that class, black, Hispanic and Asian.
Speaker 1: And nothing on the books.
Speaker 2: And every single one of them that we could find received five thousand dollars.  It was unheard of.  But we did that.  And it really changed the whole face of how public housing assignments were done in the City of Boston.  And so right after that we go into mediation with HUD on a ruling that we had won in the court in theory, but not--and principle, but, but had an opportunity to trade it for resources.  And so we did.  We went to the table.  We negotiated a consent decree which was made public in, in January 1991.  And the irony is, is that it also happened to coincide with the very date on which I, I became a partner in, in the law firm at [Murtha, Cullina,] Roche, Carens [and DeGiacomo].  And, in part, of note because I don't think most people believed that it was possible for black, blacks to--for a black to practice law in Boston, and particularly female, in, in a law firm and become a partner without doing criminal work.
Speaker 1: So you're telling me that here's another first?  You were the first--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was the first.
Speaker 1: --African American woman to be a partner in a major law firm in the City of Boston.
Speaker 2: In Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: In Massachusetts, all right.
Speaker 2: In Massachusetts.
Story_ID: 20285
Speaker 1: You made a decision to move from being a lawyer to being a lawmaker.
Speaker 2: Very much connected to that case that I was just talking about.  You know, one of the things that the court directed is that the state, that, that the state legislature, that HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] had to--the City of Boston had to petition the state legislature through its home rule petition, to adopt a enforcement mechanism for its Fair Housing Act.  That was in 1989.  Now, we tried through '89 [1989].  We tried through '90 [1990].  I, I worked along side the city and a state senator who I believed, at least publicly indicated support for what we were trying to do.  We, we waited through 1990.  We waited through 1991, and we're now three years into, and we have no movement.  The, there's no enforcement.  And we're still in a housing crisis.  Discrimination in housing was still running rampant in the city, and it was out of absolute, sheer frustration that I decided, after complaining to so many people who kept saying to me, you know, well, if you don't like the job he's doing, why don't you do it?  If you don't' like the job he's doing, why don't you do it?  And I'd always say, I can't do that, I can't do that.  Why?  Well, I have children.  My children are in school.  Well, in 1992, both my sons graduated from high school, and were set to graduate.  And so literally, one of my very close friends and advisors threw that back in my face and said, you know, you, you got to get another excuse because they're, they're not gonna be here.  And they, they knew that they were both going to school in the South.  And I had to come to grips with that, you know, having processed in my own mind what I thought was important characteristics that one should have to serve as elected official.  And having to acknowledge going through that checklist that, that I, that I, I fit those.  And don't get me wrong, it's not about self (unclear), I fought it.  I wanted not to do it.  I wanted not to do it.  And I'll tell people, I really, I feel like I was, I felt like I was literally recruited.  There's nothing wrong with that, and that I had run out of reasons to say no.  But I also, I guess in the back of my mind, understood then that this was all part of this continuum for me, that--and, and I saw it as an opportunity, once I decided in 1992--my last conversation that sealed the deal for me was I had with my, with my sons, were both seniors in, in high school at the time.  And I sat them down, and I talked with them in February of that year, and I said, you know, I'm thinking about this.  There are many people that, that I know and respect who think I should do it, but it really wasn't in my cards.  I hadn't really planned on being a state senator or running for office, but there's something intriguing about it, and I really believe that we need to--we can get this done.  We can, we can get this done.  We can get this bill passed, and, and in addition to that, it was a presidential year.  And all the presidential candidates are talking about welfare reform.  And I said, guess what?  What about if we actually had somebody in the senate, in this debate, who was on welfare and was not embarrassed to say that and could offer a perspective on this, that others may not have.  And my sons both said to me, let us think about it.  They literally got up and went out of the room, came back, less than an hour and said, we just have one question.  Why would you wait until we get ready to leave to do this?  And I was, at that point, I'm smiling and thinking, oh, my goodness.  I'm, I thought I was doing the best thing in my sacrifice because I didn't want to do it while they were there.  And they basically said, now, we're gonna miss all the fun.  And that was really it for me.  And I decided I'm, I'm in it.  And so I decided to run.
Story_ID: 20286
Speaker 1: So you mount a campaign?
Speaker 2: Mount a campaign.
Speaker 1: And you run in the fall of?
Speaker 2: 1992.  And it was clear to me that having worked and served in the capacity as counsel for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], as a branch, and certainly as chair of the Housing Committee was an enormous advantage because the one thing that I did have that most other candidates would not have had in that situation, is a relationship with the community.  So you're running against an incumbent, you want to step, but what do you know?  Who are you?  Well, I, I had developed a relationship with so many of the people who are in the very community that I was now running for Senate to serve.
Speaker 1: Who did you run against?  Do you have--?
Speaker 2: I ran against a twelve-year incumbent, Bill Owens, who had served in the seat for, for twelve years prior to my coming in or actually, had, had, had gone back and forth.  There was almost a, kind of like the family rivalry.  There had only been two gentlemen who had ever served in the seat, representing the Second Suffolk District that I, I, I now serve.  But I ran and tried very hard to just, to stay focused on what this was about, the issues.  It was about the issues and what I thought I could do and what I thought I could bring.  It was a nasty, nasty campaign.  And it was the first real lesson and what I learned and have stuck to from the, from--to this day, and, and affirmed my belief in, in the goodness of people, is that people don't like nasty.  They didn't like nasty.  And so the more that we were able to ignore the nastiest, the, the better it went, the better advantage it created.  And so needless to say, it was something of a shocker.  I, I was pretty confident that, that I, I had something to offer that I believed people wanted, and that I would win.  I would be lying if I ever suggested that I believed that I would win by winning every single precinct.  I, that, that, that was never in, that was not in my cards.  It was not in my wildest imagination.  It was not on my long list.  It was not on my short list, but, in fact, that is exactly what, what happened.  And there're fifty-eight precincts in, in the district, and we won an average of two to one in fifty-eight precincts.
Speaker 1: So you've been now a state senator for how many years or terms?
Speaker 2: Just completed twelve years in December.  So in January this year, 2005, I started my seventh term.  I would add, having run unopposed in the fall of 2004, which is a good feeling.
Story_ID: 20287
Speaker 1: What have been your major accomplishments as a State Senator today?  What would you consider to be the highlights of your accomplishments?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I'm gonna start with the most recent, and not because it's most recent am I starting with it.  I'm starting with this one because it's the most special of all of the things that I've been able to do here, some of which still astound me, and I pinch myself when I think--actually get to file laws that people then abound by, when you actually influence, you know, the, the decisions and have your name, you know, kind of on a book and owning an issue that's important to your constituents.  But, but without question, there have been many--I would say, again, most of the major legislation that I've been involved in has been kind of the, the first.  Like, we have--Massachusetts is the only state in the nation, seven years out, that has a Community Reinvestment Act [CRA] for insurance industry.  And we talk about it for banks, but we don't have insurance.  That, I filed that bill in 1997.  And what happened is that the insurance industry came to us as a legislature looking for a tax break.  I happened to be the chair of the insurance committee at the time, and said, I don't think we should give it away for nothing, and was able to convince the leadership here that an exchange of a Community Reinvestment Commitment was an appropriate trade-off because the insurance industry, even then, was becoming more and more like banks and financial institutions and less and less, just insurance.  And so it was passed in 1997, and to this day, in 2005, remains the only state in the nation that has a Community Reinvestment Act for insurance.  I would say the racial and gender profiling bill that I filed and was passed, became law in 2001, not because it's anything unique, because there were fourteen states that had one at the time, much of it out of result of what we learned around the racial profiling, state troopers in Maryland, Ohio and New Jersey, up and down ninety-five, but because of all of the states that have adopted such bills, that ours is the most comprehensive, and, in fact, the most detailed along the follow through.  We are now in the second phrase, having had the analysis done and having had our attorney general, our secretary of public safety issue rulings that has put almost three quarters of the cities and towns in Massachusetts on watch.  The reports were pretty, pretty clear and vivid that something was going on, something (unclear) (coughing in background) was going on in our cities and towns.  We have three hundred and fifty one cities and town and over two hundred and twenty of them are on the watch list which means they're now obligated to do elevated reporting.  They have to report, and they record every single stop.  We also record stops on gender, as well as race.  And so I'm very proud of that.  I'm very proud of the fact that, that we were, that we were able to, to secure passage of a law in Massachusetts that mandates insurance companies provide prescription coverage for women for birth control pills, you know, and, and up until 2001, it was the only prescription drug not automatically covered by our state insurers because it was optional because most of the people who make the decisions are men.  And so it was easier to get coverage for sterilization and, in respects, even, even abortion, but not for birth control pills.  And so, it was a major fight, believe it or not, a major fight, but we were able to do that and make the case.  And, and we just went through the passage of legislation in 2005 for the most comprehensive public construction reform in thirty years.  And I chaired the commission.  The legislation passed unanimously in the House, unanimously in the Senate.  People are still scratching their heads trying to figure out what happened.  In the same month, we passed the preda--the Anti-Predatory [Mortgage] Lending Bill, very important to me.  And if there's one thing that runs, runs throughout every major and minor piece of legislation that I have ever been involved in, it is this notion of this incessant search for equity and justice.  And I, I came to do what I could and to try to use my talent and opportunity to level the playing field.  And so the last one is the one that I was talking about which we just, was just signed into law in December of 2004, is the Wrongful Conviction Compensation Bill, probably affects less people than all of the other bills and important ones I've talked about.  But it is the most special to me because it represents dead on what this whole issue about equalizing and leveling the playing field is all about.  We have twenty-two men in Massachusetts who have been released from, from prison, having been convicted of crimes which we now know they did not commit in the last five years, twenty-two of them.  Of the twenty-two, nineteen of them are African American and seventeen of the twenty-two lived, at the time of their conviction, in Suffolk County, the, the--in the county that I now reside.  And so it's, it's the one that's the most special because I know most of them.  They're my constituents.  They walk about this community, having given up seventeen years of their life.  One gentleman spent thirty years in jail, ten years, and we, for the first time will have an opportunity for them to be compensated for the wrong that was done to them.
Story_ID: 20288
Speaker 1: Senator Wilkerson, let's talk about gay marriage because the, a Massachusetts court actually threw that back to the legislature, okay.  And it's been a very difficult and, and very sensitive and troublesome issue for all of us.  And you have taken a very strong position on gay marriage.  Tell us where that is now in the Massachusetts legislature and courts and what your position has been and why you've taken the position that you've taken?
Speaker 2: Now, last, actually, November of, in November of 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, which I, I worked in, in 1982, issued a ruling stating that the Massachusetts Constitution does not ban the rights of people of the same sex to marry.  And we've, we've read the document.  We looked high and low.  We can't find anything in here that says that they can't do this.  And so what they did is said if, if you think it should be different, you have to change it because your Constitution does not have any language that can be interpreted as banning it.  And so many people, you know, were initially riled at the court, as a bunch of heathens, what are they doing?  They've ruled that gay--they, they didn't rule that gays could marry.  They ruled that our Constitution does not prohibit, and if we wanted to prohibit, then we had to take affirmative steps to do it because the current language of our Constitution simply does not allow it, a position, by the way, that I absolutely agree with in my, some limited experience in terms of legal knowledge and constitutional interpretation, support--I support their interpretation of our Constitution.  Now, people may not like it, but I'm saying, I can't change the language.  That's, it says what it says.  And again, if you think it should be different, you change it.  And so they basically gave to the legislature the direction and authority, push, impetus to do so, and said, if you want to ban it, if it's your intention to ban it, then you have to take the affirmative steps to do that.  And then you do it by amending your Constitution.  And, and the process was begun in 2004, and early in 2004 to do that.  We convened the first of what would be two necessary constitutional conventions, in which the legislature, it joined together in session between, where the House and the Senate would have to vote by a majority for a constitutional amendment to effectuate the intent, if it's the intent of the legislation, the legislature to ban gay marriage.  And you have to do it in two consecutive sessions.  So we'd have to do it in the 2003, 2004, which we took up in 2004.  And then we'd have to do it, raise it again in 2005, 2006, two-year legislative session.  And my position, at least for me, was not a struggle to, in deliberation.  And some would say oversimplification, but for me, it was pretty basic.  Number one, I started this in 1992 with the premise that I would respect and protect the rights of every one of my varied constituents without disrespecting the rights of any.  And that's been the measure.  And for the most part, I've been able to do that.  We've had some skirmishes, but clearly none as major as this where we had such drastic and stark positions having been taken by different con--constituency groups.  And I have, I have been on record of being in total support of the Supreme Judicial Court's interpretation and against the notion that we ought to put discriminatory language in our constitution to ban, for the specific intent to ban gay marriage.  Why?  Because when you start it, you can't stop.  What, what we've spent our lives, and certainly for me in my professional life, I've spent using every fiber of my being, trying to rid our society of discrimination, and, and, and injustice.  And on, in evening a playing field, you can't rationalize it by saying it's okay to discriminate against some and not the other.  And some have taken issue with my likening this battle to civil rights.  And I would say that it's a stretch to say that, but what I, what I have been clear is this, that I would not ever be in a situation where I would use the privilege extended to me to serve in a legislative body, deciding laws that would be put up, imposed upon others, but would have them do something that I would not want done to me.  That's, that's my simple test.  And so the civil rights perspective for me was drawn in through that, through that mirror.  My family changed their life course.  I ended up in Massachusetts because my family ran from the Ku Klux Klan and discrimination.  Now, if some people are offended at that analogy, then they'll have to be defended [offended] cause my test was pretty simple.  I would not walk into the body and vote in the affirmative to send people, whoever they are, to the place of degradation and discrimination and being treated as less than a human being when my own family ran from that, and ran to get away from it.  So, as a human being, as a Christian, it is not something that I could rationalize in my heart and or, or in my head.  And I will--that, that is my position on it.  And I, I--many--offended some, you know, black members, particularly members of the clergy in my own community.  But it was one of those things that I just resolved early on that we would just have to agree to disagree because on this one, there're just, there isn't a middle ground.  You can't be almost equal.  That's one of the lessons of, and lessons I learned, you know, coming out of that South, that you can't be almost equal.  And, and equal--ob--obtaining equality for the sole purpose of being in the position to make others inequal seemed such a contradiction to me.  It's not me.  I cannot do it.  I won't do it for as long as I am here.

Speaker 1: What other things would you like to add to this interview that I haven't asked you about, that you think are important too?
Speaker 2: I guess one of the message, one of the questions that I would get often that, that I used to kind of ponder and, and now, I would offer it when, if I'm not asked, is, you know, what would you tell, you know, what would you tell the young person?  What would you say?  Do you have any advice?  Do you have any direction?  You have any, any thoughts, and, and there's one message that I do think that we, not only should be communicating, but we should be repeating it as often as we can, and the importance of the connection that we have as black people to our history, to one another, and sometimes find ourselves when--living it even we did, we didn't know it.  I was an adult, full-fledged adult before I learned most of what I know about my people, about my blackness, that I only wish as, as, as arrogant and proud as I already was as a child, that had I known this, I probably would have dangerous, had I known as much as I know now.  And one in particular is, is this notion that one person can make a difference.  We have to talk about the world of young people, children in, in the era that we all throw around this word called Civil Rights Movement in order to make this real to young people in the twenty-first century.  Had it not been for them, there would be no such thing, you know.  We tend to think that we, we've always had cell phones, two-ways, you know, the, the--what's the, fax machines, computers; had someone ask me the, a couple of weeks ago, what kind of video games did you play with when you were a little girl?  Not did you have them, what kind did you have?  And it really was sobering to me because it's that question, you know, it's that, did they have cars when you were a child that we used to ask, and it would (laughs) offend.  I, I--the reality is we didn't have them, and yet, we mastered a movement that was built on the most infantile of community that was ever known, and that is the legs and the feet of young, black students, some sixth, seventh and eighth graders in the South, and, you know, whenever [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] rolled into town and wanted Mrs. Jones to know that they were gonna have a church meeting in their church, at the local church, it was those sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth graders on their heels that ran around and knocked on Mrs. Jones and Mr. Smith's door and, and would, and could fill a church overnight.  And it's part of that, that legacy and that greatness that, in the shadow of all of that energy and sacrifice that, that I sit, that you sit, that we sit here today.  And we have to tell the story.  It's not even enough to say, we can't ever forget.  You can't forget something you never knew, and we have been completely derelict in our duty to tell that whole story.  It is a painful one, but out of that pain is such magnificence that it, it is, it is a proud and, and rightful ending to at least one of those chapters.  And I think that we've got to tell that whole story to be able to write some more chapters as magnificent as those that we've had.
Story_ID: 20290
Speaker 1: One of your responsibilities as a State Senator in Massachusetts is to serve on a number of Senate or general court committees.  And you're presenting serving on, I believe seven committees?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you are chairing the State Administration Committee.  What does that involve?  What does that, what do you do as the chair of that committee?
Speaker 2: Well, that means that we have jurisdiction over all of the matters, the subject matter within.  For us, it is all of the state properties, all of the state assets, the leases, the buildings, whether it's the Big Dig, the convention center, the, our role in Foxboro Stadium [sic, Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts] which is, of course, the home of the, the Super Bowl champs, New England Patriots and yet to be again, Super Bowl champs, God willing.  We, we have jurisdiction over, it used to--formerly MDC [Massachusetts Department of Conservation], now DCR [Department of Conservation and Recreation], public pools, skating rinks.  We have jurisdiction over all matters related to public construction which is, in the contest in which I presided over the commission and then legislation that was recently passed to restructure and reform public construction in Massachusetts for the first time in thirty years.  We are moving into another phase of this commission, of the Committee on State Administration.  It has been rewritten and so just yesterday, I was appointed the chair of what is called, what will be called the State Adminstration and Regulatory Oversight Committee.  And by that, in addition to the other matters, we will have jurisdiction over the monitoring of the regulatory, entire regulatory system that is set in place by the Executive Branch once we pass laws.  If we passed a law that says we have, there is a mandate for insurance companies to provide prescription drugs for birth control pills for women.  We're the agency that would monitor that, whether it's the division of insurance, the department of public health, creates, and probably, it's a whole series of regulations.  We have regulations around safe driver, around auto insurance, around professional licenser, and we leave it to the Executive Branch.  There has been a meeting of the minds among the leadership between the House and the Senate that we need to review the regulatory scheme that has been set up by the Executive Branch to determine the degree to which it is consistent with what the legislature intended.  I, I think it's going to be an incredible effort because we hear from people every day, the frustration with the regulatory system that we have.  And I think for the first time, we're actually gonna be empowered to do something about it.  So I'm excited about this new, new, the new task and endeavor and think it will allow me to continue to write, you know, more, more chapters, I think, in, in this book.

Speaker 1: You have served the Seventh Suffolk District--.
Speaker 2: Second Suffolk.
Speaker 1: --which is eighty, ninety percent black.
Speaker 2: No, not any more.
Speaker 1: No.  Well, okay, there's been a change, but let me, what I wanted to get to is this.  In 2001, there was a redistricting--.
Speaker 2: That's right, you're absolutely right.
Speaker 1: And your area of representation was expanded or enlarged and you now represent parts or all of Beacon Hill and Back Bay [Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Part of all that.  You know, I, one of the most exciting challenges that, that I had an opportunity to participate in, in the, in 2000, in early 2000, in the early twenty-first century I should say, is that as a member of the Senate Committee on Redistricting, I have three issues of importance that I laid out when I came to the Senate in '93 [1993].  One was to see, to live to see the disposition and the development of Boston state Hospital grounds, almost two hundred acres that had stood fallow for almost twenty-five years.  The second was to, to visit some equity and justice in our auto insurance rating system in Massachusetts.  And then the third was to, to live to see the creation of a second majority, people of color Senate district in Massachusetts.  I, I represented for the first ten years I was here, the only such crafted district of the forty Senate districts in Massachusetts.  And as a result, had been here as the only sitting African American, only person of color for ten or the twelve years that I was, that I was here.  And, and so in the redistricting process, we reconfigured what was called the Second Suffolk District, gave up some part of it and took on some other part of it.  It was, of all of the senate districts, the most drastic change was in population and configuration.  So I went from 78 percent, people of color, you're right, and it was almost 80 percent, to 55 percent.  So what I gave up ended up in a second senatorial district in Boston that is now 62 percent people of color and clearly presents an opportunity to the extent that that community can be organized to effectuate it, to elect a person of color, if that is their choosing, to represent them in the State Senate.  So in the process of doing that, I have taken on all of Chinatown, all of the Back Bay, all of Jamaica Plain, all of Roxbury, but much of Beacon Hill, probably three quarters of Beacon Hill, Copley, Prudential, and given up, probably 40 percent of Mattapan and Dorchester, which were overwhelmingly people of color.  So it, what, what has happened is, it has changed some of the focus even for, for the work that I do and I think broadened it and also increased the challenge because in that configuration, I now have both a larger, you know, this, Roxbury, which is overwhelmingly black and Jamaica Plain and the South End which are very residential and changing communities.  And part of that change is a gay and lesbian community, that is the largest member of permanent residents, registered voters in any Senate district in Massachusetts is in mine.  And so believe it makes for an interesting day-to-day reality for me.  But what has been my measure will continue to be the measure going forward, and that is, to respect and protect the rights of each one of my different and diverse constituencies without disrespecting the rights of any.  And that's the measure that's been the standard, and I think the only reason it works is because I don't, cause I'm not wavering from that, even when some people may differ, that you're gonna be able to tell me that in order to protect my interest, you have to go and disrespect theirs.

Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way you've lived your life?
Speaker 2: That if I change any of the things that didn't turn out the way that I would have liked to, but I have to change all of the things that did.  And so I leave it alone.  What it means is that I don't worry.  I don't do a whole lot of second guessing because it all is a part of a whole story and a whole continuum.  I, I think that for, for me, it's been a, almost quick sided, you know, there're just--I would defy anyone to suggest to me that they had this notion when I was born on my grandma's [Leslie Lee Campbell] kitchen table, that this is where I would end up.  Yet, here I am.  And, and, but I, I tell young people this story all the time.  I, I went to school.  I went to--and we had this thing called assembly every week, every Friday we'd go in the auditorium and somebody would come and speak to us.  And I was a good student.  I attended school, as you know, but I will tell you, I can't remember a single thing that anybody said for me for three years.  And I think the reason that I don't is because I don't think anybody envisioned that I was sitting in that audience.  So when I talk to young people, what I say is, that because I was there and no one knew, I assume there's another me and then some.  So when I speak to young people, and whenever there's more than two, I assume that there's a future president.  It may not even be a president of the Untied States.  It may be of another country.  I'll assume that there's some doctor in that audience who's gonna find a cure to an illness that has confounded us all.  I, I, you know, I assume there's, there's an NBA [National Basketball Association] star, but I'll assume there's a scientist.  I'll assume that there is someone who is going to kick the top of this business community in the business world.  And so I, the, the only thing that I know is that there no scientific instrument for us to determine which one it is.  We've done many things in life, but that's one we can't do.  So we have to treat every single one as if they could be the one.  And if we do that, we avoid a whole lot of the unnecessary need to put people in boxes, cause we do things, we have, we really don't know where they're gonna be.  So we have to treat everyone like they could be at the top of the mountain.  But why?  Because this little girl from Pine Bluff, Arkansas was sitting in that audience paying close attention, and never--no one ever told me that the first African American female senator could be sitting in this audience, but I was there.

Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?  What do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: That I made decisions and lived my life based on this compass of equity and justice for all; didn't always like, kind of hit the mark, but that, that was--that's, that was the guide.  And, and I think in, as, in a general sense, I think how I do it, what them to remember is that I, I, I take it all as part of this life experience, the good and the bad.  And you have to do that, that I want them to know, as I think people do know, which is why I have been so blessed with the level of support, that there are so many other things that I could be doing, and I chose to do this cause this is what I want to do.  I believe this is what I'm supposed to be doing.
Speaker 1: Nothing lasts forever.  You probably will not be State Senator forever--.
Speaker 2: Hope not (laughs).
Speaker 1: Well, where do you see yourself beyond this?  What would you like to do that you haven't done, outside of elective politics?
Speaker 2: You mean aside from being the commissioner of the NBA [National Basketball Association]? (laughs)
Speaker 1: Yeah, (unclear).
Speaker 2: For starters, the one, like goal I've always--hey, David Stern never played basketball (unclear).  Well, why not?  At least I played basketball.  So anyway, and I'm very serious about that.  But, here's--you know, and this part of the evolution where I am now, and the point where I can, I'm comfortable talking out loud about it because I couldn't think of any reason why, any reason not to.  I, I think that, I am convinced that public service is, is, is the thing.  You know, many people live their life and never quite find what works for them.  And they work every day in jobs they hate.  I've been in that situation, but I know so many people who are.  So I, I appreciate, and I'm very clear of the blessings that have been bestowed upon me.  I am a public service zealot.  This is what works, this works for me.  I love being able to use what I know to make things better for other people.

Speaker 1: Well, I work them early.  This is my grandson on the left, Cornell Devon Mills, Jr. and on the right, Kendall.  His, they're first cousins, and, as you can see, they're wear, they're wearing campaign t-shirts during election season in 2002.  And they're on their break, apparently, had a cook-out that day.  I can see.  He's got his cheeseburger.

Speaker 1: To my knowledge, this is the first and only photo that has ever been taken of the three individuals who have served in the [Massachusetts] State Senate, representing the Second Suffolk District because it, in fact, is, was created in 1974.  So just thirty, thirty years, thirty-one years old.  And left is Senator Bill Owens who was the senator representing the Second Suffolk District for twelve of those years.  I am in the middle and have twelve of those years, and pretty much the balance would be, would have been Senate, Senator Royal Bolling, Sr. who has since deceased.  So we took this picture in, just in time.  It, it's one of the most special to me because this is the first and only time all three of the former senators who have held this seat, present and former, have ever been photographed together.  Senator Owens and Senator Bolling had, for the first twenty years that this district existed, something of a rivalry where they would kind of run, and one would win.  And so they, they called it the 'Hatfield-McCoy', literally, the first, Roxbury [Massachusetts]'s first dynasty or, or literal race between two individuals.  They're both, very big supporters and friends of mine and, in 2000.

Speaker 1: The interesting gentleman on the left is Aaron Feuerstein, and that name may sound familiar to many people because he's the owner of Malden Mills [textile company], one of the largest employers in, on the South Shore in Massachusetts and the mill was burned, it burned--was burned down by fire about ten years ago.  And Mr. Feuerstein is something of a hero because he had insurance, could have closed the doors and walked away, and he decided to rebuild and actually went further into debt than he originally had to, to rebuild the mall so that people could continue to, to be employed there.  I was presenting an award to him, along with the chair of the gala committee, Goodwill-Morgan Memorial [Morgan Memorial Goodwill Industries].
Speaker 2: Year?
Speaker 1: 1999.

Speaker 1: This is actually a photo taken a year before--in 2003 in Washington, D.C. at a fundraiser for a senatorial--there were three Senate, women candidates.  [U.S.] Senator [Mary] Landrieu from Louisiana is on the left, and she was actually the honoree.  Former President William Jefferson Clinton was the guest speaker, and then Senator Larkin--Harkin, I'm sorry, [U.S.] Senator [Thomas] Harkin is, is next to, standing next to me.  And then a former classmate, law school classmate of mine, Steven Wright, a partner in the firm, Holland and Knight, who was one of the firms hosting this event.  I actually had had a chance to talk with Sen--with President Clinton at some length because we both hail from the great State of Arkansas, he from Hope and me from Pine Bluff.

Speaker 1: All of the individuals in, in this photo served as board members of the [Boston, Massachusetts] Empowerment Zone Board including--that night actually the director of HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] was there, and in support.  We've done some, an incredible amount of work.  One of the most proud of the accomplishments we have had in the zone is we just, in this last year opened the Hampton Inn which was, which is the largest economic development project in any empowerment zone.  It happened to be only the thirty-ninth black-owned hotel out of some forty-seven thousand hotels in the United States of America in the middle of Roxbury [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: And that's you over on the right, correct?
Speaker 1: Yep, that's me.
Speaker 2: All right, in the red.
Speaker 1: In the red.  Could you tell that's my favorite color? (laughs)

Speaker 1: [Joseph] Joe Feaster who's a former president of the Boston Branch NAACP and I were at an event that was honoring, and the gentleman with the red flower is none other than [Thomas] Tom Atkins, a former general counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, national NAACP.  Tom Atkins, many don't know, got his start here in Boston [Massachusetts] as a lawyer, and then was the first African American elected to a citywide, city council position in Boston's history.  He is a well respected attorney.  I had spoken to him many, many years on the phone when I took over the chairmanship of the Housing Committee at the Boston Branch NAACP, and I considered that an individual honor.  Next to Mr. Atkins is Phyllis Feaster, Joe Feaster's wife, and next to she is a former city councilor, city council from Roxbury [neighborhood in Boston], Gareth Saunders.  And I don't know who the gentleman is on the far right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Year?
Speaker 1: Oh, this had to be 1997.

Speaker 1: Brenda Butler Hamlett was, is standing next to the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, [U.S. Congressman from Maryland] Elijah Cummings, who was our guest speaker that night.  And Brenda told her story about her experience, her heart transplant.  She actually died in, in 2000 after a second transplant, but lived almost ten, almost ten years after the original.  (Unclear) I actually had the privilege--I spoke to her, she was being reeled into the operating room, the night she had her transplant.  She, she had the nerve to call me and say, "I'm on my way.  They found one for me, I'll call you when I get out!"
