Speaker 1: Okay.  And where are we at the present Time?
Speaker 2: Chicago, Illinois, 1900 S. Michigan Ave., is the address.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  Now before we go into depth, there are five light-weight questions that we always ask that only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They are sort of a warm-up.  The first question is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is probably liver and onions, hard to believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color is probably chartreuse.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year is summer, August.

Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No.  That's  my--I say "no".
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they leave it at that.  I've learned that's very valuable.
Speaker 1: It's a place to start.
Speaker 2: Just say no and no explanation and people get it.
Speaker 1: It's a good place to start, even if the answer is yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  (laughing)
Speaker 1: All right--
Speaker 2: You can always change your mind and then the person is so happy.
Story_ID: 39640
Speaker 1: --Okay, well, I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, separately, and then we'll try to put them together.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Florence Watkins, F-L-O-R-E-N-C-E, surname is W-A-T-K-I-N-S.
Speaker 1: Now is this her maiden name or her married name?
Speaker 2: That was her married name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, her maiden name is Hartley, H-A-R-T-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is--she's been dead for so many years, I'm embarrassed, but November 20, 1921.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Alabama.  In a small town called Greenville.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family.  First of all how far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: Only to my mother.  So she grew up in a small town, Greenville.  She had five siblings.  My grandmother was a maid and her name was Gussie Hartley, and my grandfather just was like a handyman, but he probably--I mean if he had been born today, I think would have been an artist.  He was very artistic, but he was like an outside artist, and I think that they didn't appreciate his work back then, but--
Speaker 1: Now, what kind of art did he do?  I mean, did he decorate things he worked on?
Speaker 2: --It was paintings and it was whittling and stuff like that, you know, it was like outside artists, you see the crazy stuff that they could do and you just go, I would never do anything like that, that's not art.  But you look at it today--today they appreciate that kind of work, so.
Speaker 1: Is that what they call today naive art?
Speaker 2: Naive art, yeah.  So untrained--
Speaker 1: The House of Blues is full of examples.
Speaker 2: Full of it, yeah, yeah.  It used to be you could just give it away.  You can find a lot of it in the South.  I mean you couldn't even give it away, but now it's, you know, hundreds of thousands.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Certain people went to the South and collected it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, for a little bit of money.  And then they came here and sold it for hundreds of thousands, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  Yes, it's a big ticket item now.  So he did this kind of art.  Do you remember any particular pieces?
Speaker 2: No, because I don't think the family really appreciated it, you know, we would talk about it, but we didn't really appreciate it.  I mean, we were just as guilty.  And I think back now, oh, I should have saved a piece, but you know, no one appreciated it, no one.  He just liked doing it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: His name--he just had initials, C.B., didn't really have a name.
Speaker 1: So the C.B. didn't stand for anything?
Speaker 2: Didn't stand for anything.  That was just his name, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, this is not unusual.  We've interviewed other people whose relatives had--
Speaker 2: Just initials?
Speaker 1: --Just initials.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I went to school with people like that.  So--
Speaker 2: So, my grandparents had five kids, they were all--they all became middleclass and two moved north and the rest stayed south.
Speaker 1: Now, as far as you know, I mean, does your mother's side of the family have any other locus of activity other than Greenville, Alabama.  There not from, okay?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So you can't be traced back to any other, as far as anybody knows?
Speaker 2: Uh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Would you assume that they were there since the emancipation?
Speaker 2: I would assume so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So then deep roots right there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In Greenville?
Speaker 2: And both, actually, my mother's family and my father's family, very small, not a lot of relatives at all.  Just a small family.
Story_ID: 39641
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your grandfather's a handyman and what did your grandmother do?
Speaker 2: She was a maid.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did they live in the town of Greenville [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: They lived in a town, they lived in a black part of town.  It was probably sort of--I would say it was a well off part of town.  They had a big house with a screened-in porch and everybody had chickens in the back.  I remember the neighbor across the street had a hog that they slaughtered and I remember the squealing.  I'll never forget that, the squealing of that hog being slaughtered.  But--and the kids who stayed in that neighborhood built nice houses in the neighborhood.  So it was--actually, it was an idyllic place to grow up.  But if you wanted to do something different, you had to leave.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So where is Greenville in Alabama?
Speaker 2: Greenville is close to Montgomery.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's probably the closest, biggest city.
Story_ID: 39642
Speaker 1: All right.  So your mother went to school there in Greenville?
Speaker 2: She went to school there and then she started college in--a college in Montgomery, I can't remember the name of it.  And then she met my dad.
Speaker 1: Alabama State, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: It could have been, yeah.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: I think that's the only one in Montgomery, only black school.  It would have been segregation when she went to school there.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it would be that.
Speaker 2: So she met--I don't know where she met my dad.  I feel so bad because they both died at age 72 and like--it's like, "wait" I didn't ask you the questions I needed to ask, so but she met my father and they got married and they--they got married, and my dad was in the air force, and they got married in Honolulu.
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to get back to him, but what was your mother going to school to be?
Speaker 2: A nurse, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, did she finish?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't finish.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So getting married just kind of side-tracked her from that?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Not that getting married is a side track, but it's important to raise a family.  Okay, but she never went back?
Speaker 2: Never went back, uh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she have any stories of growing up.  She grew up.  You were born in '54 (1954)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: She was growing up during the height of segregation.
Speaker 2: She hated the South.  She's a very strong-willed, very opinionated, very political and the South was probably not a good place for her.  And I mean she loved my dad but it probably was an escape too.  My dad was in the military, so he was going to live all over the place, so it was an escape for her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so this is when you were born, it's like two years before the Montgomery Bus Boycott?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So things are probably at their worst, in some ways.
Speaker 2: Yeah, at their worst, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 39643
Speaker 1: Well, let's go to your father's side and then we'll get back to your mother.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name was William Edward Watkins.  W-i-l-l-I-A-M, E-D-W-A-R-D, W-A-T-K-I-N-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My dad was born September 8th.  He was probably born 1920.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: In Birmingham, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And once again, what do you know about your father's side of the family.  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: Just to my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Marie Watkins.
Speaker 1: Now, what did she do?
Speaker 2: She was also a maid.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she lived in Birmingham?
Speaker 2: She lived in Birmingham, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  What about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: He died.  We didn't know him.
Speaker 1: Now did your grandmother have a job with the same people for a long period of time or did she have different jobs?
Speaker 2: I believe she worked for the same people.  She didn't really talk about it a whole lot.  And she was a quiet, reserved woman.  I would say we didn't really know her that well.  We would go down there for the summers to visit, but it wasn't like visiting my maternal grandmother, where the town was small and the maternal grandmother was more nurturing and lots of cousins were there.  When we would go see my paternal grandmother, just me and my sister, so it was very quiet, very stiff, very formal, probably wanted to leave in a couple of days.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That was--had your grandmother had a chance--did she have a chance to go to school, herself?
Speaker 2: My grandmother?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So did she pass down any stories to you about what life was like in Birmingham?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't.  She wasn't a talker, nope.
Speaker 1: Now, what about your dad?
Speaker 2: Describe my dad?
Speaker 1: In terms of what kind of stories did he tell about growing up?
Speaker 2: My dad--I don't think either one of my parents really talked about their childhood a whole lot.  They were kind of like forward-looking people, they wanted to--and they got out of the South before, you know, havoc happened.  And so my dad had sort of a military mentality.  He's just--quiet guy.
Story_ID: 39644
Speaker 1: Assume he went to school, and finished school--
Speaker 2: High school.
Speaker 1: --to be able to go the air force?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he finished high school.
Speaker 1: Do you know which one he came out of in Birmingham?
Speaker 2: Parker.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you have to pass a test to go to the air force, I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now this is interesting too, because the air force--they had just like admitted black pilots during World War II, so does he have a story about being--was he a Tuskegee Airman?
Speaker 2: No, he was a mechanic--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --So.  And he probably did some other things too.  I'm not quite sure what he did in the air force.  He went to Alaska for several years by himself and it had to be quiet, he never spoke about it no matter how many times we asked, even when he had Alzheimer's and we were asking, "what did you do in Alaska, Dad?"  He still kept that a secret.
Speaker 1: So you think it was a top secret mission?
Speaker 2: I think it was a top secret mission, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Because U.S., that was the time of the cold war.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And there were secret missions.
Speaker 2: I mean he didn't tell me, my sister or my mother, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was he career air force?
Speaker 2: Career, yeah.
Story_ID: 39645
Speaker 1: All right.  Is there a story about how your parents met?  They lived in Montgomery, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I don't know how they met.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But they did meet there?
Speaker 2: They met there.  I think they got married pretty quickly.  Because I think my dad [William Watkins] was being shipped to Honolulu site, I think.  He went there first and then my mother [Florence Watkins] followed him.  And then they got married.
Speaker 1: About what year were they married?
Speaker 2: Geez.  So they might have been married like 1950, around there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their gifts, their talents, how they look, how they walk, talk, how they interact with people, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think I take after my mother.  She had-- strong willed, political, big mouth, said what she wanted to say, couldn't push her around.  If she was going to get in trouble, she was going to get in trouble.  Hot tempered.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: But kind, too and thoughtful.  But the strength I got from--I mean my dad had a quiet strength, but he wasn't, because he was in the military, he couldn't be as boisterous as my mother was, but both my sister and I are very strong-willed.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  Now, is it just you and your sister?
Speaker 2: Just me and my sister, yeah.
Speaker 1: And who's the oldest?
Speaker 2: I'm the eldest, yeah.
Speaker 1: You were born in 1954.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, and she was in '56 (1956), yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Two years' later.  All right.  Is there a story about why--I think we kind of have a hint as to why they left Alabama, but was there a story about how it was done or how they--
Speaker 2: No.  I bet that my dad just needed to--he wanted a job, he wanted a career and the air force was starting to hire African Americans, so you know, that was a good opportunity.  And there was a good job for a family man, I mean, he was family oriented.  My mother came from a family that was family oriented.  It was perfect, actually, for the two of them, when you think about it, yeah.
Story_ID: 39646
Speaker 1: All right.  Why Madison, Wisconsin?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was while--we ended up there.  We actually lived all over.  I lived--until I was six, I lived in Clovis, New Mexico and then we moved to Bangor, Maine, and then we moved to Germany and then that was about the time that my mother--that my dad [William Watkins] was going to retire and my mom [Florence Watkins] said, well the girls have to go to a good college, and so she was really smart that way, so she researched good colleges and she just decided that she liked University of Wisconsin Madison and that's where we were going to go to college.  Well, when we moved to Madison, I was in the seventh grade, but she had decided that that's where we were going to go to college.  And so that was my dad's last--that's where he was last stationed, was--there's a air force base there called Truax and so that was a deliberate move on--based on my mother's desires.  Smart, I think.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  How do you spell that air force base?
Speaker 2: T-R-A-U-X.  T-R-U-A-X.
Speaker 1: T-R-U-A-X.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, Truax, yeah.
Speaker 1: Truax, okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: So, when you think about it, we lived in, basically, non-black environments.  You know, like New Mexico was Hispanic, of course.  But then we just--we lived in a lot of non-black environments.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were definitely the minority?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  It teaches you strength.  It teaches you how to be alone and to survive.
Story_ID: 39647
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I take it the white people in the air force didn't really--
Speaker 2: No, actually.  I think it was probably a good experiment for the air force, I mean, you had to behave.  You couldn't be--when we were growing up, I mean, you couldn't be crazy.  You couldn't be a crazy racist and be in the air force, so I never felt afraid or--I just felt natural in the air force.  I didn't have to act differently, or you know I just felt natural.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it wasn't a racist environment.  I mean overtly was it?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: There was like a tension or something.
Speaker 2: No.  There was no tension.
Speaker 1: No tension, okay.
Speaker 2: No.  There wasn't any tension, uh-uh, uh-uh.
Speaker 1: Well, you said that you kind of felt alone.
Speaker 2: Well, you can feel alone, I mean, you can walk into--even today, you know, the job that I can do, I can go to a meeting, and I go, "God" I'm the only black person in here again.  And everyone can be friendly, but you still feel alone.  I mean you don't see your face across the table.
Speaker 1: Okay. So it's not as comfortable as it could be?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's not as comfortable as it could be.
Speaker 1: But it's not necessarily tense.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.  And also because everybody else was in the air force, it teaches you how to make friends really quickly, because if you don't make friends really quickly, you're not going to have any friends.  So you will make friends with just about anybody in order to have a friend.  So.
Speaker 1: Is that something you kind of learned as you were--
Speaker 2: Growing up, yeah.  And my sister's [Pamela Wilder] the same way.  I mean, people, I think, marvel at we'll just talk to anybody.  But I think it was the air force upbringing.  I mean you were moving every three to four years so you had to--you had to find a new set of friends.
Speaker 1: --Okay, all right--
Speaker 2: That's a skill you didn't think you were--you would get, but you do get it, you know.  Teaches you how not to be shy and-
Story_ID: 39648
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you start school in Clovis [Clovis, New Mexico]?
Speaker 2: Started, yeah, first through third grade, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Clovis, New Mexico.  So were there any special teachers or anything in Clovis that you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I think my first teacher was--my first teacher was Miss Travis, and probably she was a really good teacher.  I think she had faith in me and I remember her as being very strict and firm.  But I think I learned a lot and it was memorable.  I mean she was a memorable teacher.  And so, you know, she's pretty good.
Story_ID: 39649
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you go from--now were you interested in writing at all as a young--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was always a big reader.  From the very beginning, I just would like to read a lot, and I would--my mother [Florence Watkins] says I would get in trouble every morning because I'd be late getting ready for school because I was reading some book, or I was reading some magazine or I was reading some comic strip, I was just--I was just always--I always enjoyed reading.  So, and I think I got that--my parents got the newspaper so I would watch them read the newspaper and then I'd get the comics and sprawl out on the floor and pretend like I could read, but I was probably just looking at the pictures and making up--making up my own story.  Or we would get like the Sears catalog or the Penny's catalog and, you know, like flip through that and make up a story about the people who were in the catalog or the furniture, you know, fantasy stuff in your head, yeah.
Speaker 1: I read that your mother read to you a lot.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  She liked to read, I mean she liked to read.  I don't recall her reading to us a lot, but it's just a habit that we picked up.  I mean she liked to read, so we read.  My dad read the newspaper every day, so we read the newspaper.  My dad would listen to talk radio and the TV--the radio, so we'd listened to talk radio.  It's just, you know, whatever habits your parents have, you just sort of pick up.  But they didn't force us to read, we just liked to read.  So they didn't force us to read, but they'd take us to the library all the time.  And they insisted that we get good grades.  They paid attention to our education and who our teachers were and so.  And they'd buy us books, yeah.
Story_ID: 39650
Speaker 1: So they went from Clovis [New Mexico] to Bangor, Maine?
Speaker 2: To Bangor, Maine, for one year.  And that was lonely.  I don't know.  I think Bangor might be lonely anyway.  Maine was just a lot of snow, and it was just a lot of snow, and when we were in New Mexico, I remember if it got before--if it got below--if it got 60 degrees, you could wear pants to school.  So we would wear pants to school, and we moved to Bangor, Maine, and it was like 100 inches of snow.  We had just moved there, and it's 100 inches of snow and my mom sent us to school in pants.  And they sent us back home because you couldn't wear pants--girls couldn't wear pants to school.  They had to wear dresses or skirts.  And my mom--I remember--well that is the craziest thing I ever heard of.  That makes no sense, but.  So she sent us back to school with pants under a skirt, yeah.
Story_ID: 39651
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what part of Germany did you go to?
Speaker 2: We lived in Darmstadt, Germany.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: D-A-R-M-S-T-A-D-T.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how long were you there?
Speaker 2: So we were there for about three years.  And it was really interesting.  We did a lot of stuff in Germany.  We'd go to castles every weekend, we'd go to street fairs, we'd drive around Germany, we'd go to cheese festivals, I mean, there's a lot to do there and we'd do it.  And my mom and dad both had, you know, lots of German friends and--so actually it was a good experience.  We learned a little bit of German and then, you know, you come back to the states, and they don't offer foreign language in schools, so you forget it instantly.
Story_ID: 39652
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, you're still kind of focusing on literature, reading?
Speaker 2: Yeah, still there.  I mean in languages, probably, you know, Nancy Drew books, I started reading probably there.  My mom [Florence Watkins] would read these magazines, they were like true confession, they were like romance novels, and then I would start reading those and get in big trouble, cause I was not supposed to be reading those.  But, you know, I'd read anything I get--I'd read the cornflakes box, I would just--I was just a reader.
Story_ID: 39653
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, let me just ask you this question before we go any further.  We always ask people, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: In my entire life?  Let's see, sights.  Well, I remember, you know, the castles in Germany, the dampness inside those castles, like, I would think, my God, where's the heat at in here?  I remember sleeping under down blankets for the first time in Germany, because I don't--for some reason--when we would go on trips, they didn't really have heat, so we'd sleep on down blankets.  I remember playing in my grandmother's [Gussie Hartley] front yard and going to the corner store and having to go to a back window, and it drove my mother [Florence Watkins] crazy cause you couldn't go to the front of the store.  We had to go to the like--now I know it was the colored window.  I remember, you know, like my grandmother's voice calling all the grandchildren in a loving way.
Story_ID: 39654
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, okay.  Now Wisconsin is one of the more German of the states.  So you mentioned cheese festival, I said, oh, oh.
Speaker 2: I know it sort of blended right in.
Speaker 1: Cheese fest in Germany, now you come back to the beer. Now you described--
Speaker 2: And the Bocks.  It's like we never left, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Exactly.  So was it very similar when you think about it?
Speaker 2: Now when I think about it, probably outside of Madison [Wisconsin], it might have been like that, but Madison was a college town and so, Madison, college town, very liberal, people came from all over, so it had a little bit of an international flavor to it, it has a lot more now, but it had a little bit of an international flavor to it, so it was--it was actually kind of more cosmopolitan--
Speaker 1: Okay, I could see--
Speaker 2: --Than you would--than you would think, yeah.  So actually, it was a nice town to live in, grow up in, people were very accepting, you didn't see, I mean, Wisconsin is really a white state, but I wasn't going to get any kind of racism in Madison--
Speaker 1: --Okay--
Speaker 2: --Probably got more opportunities.
Speaker 1: --So, you arrive there, what, in '68 (1968)?
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight (1968), yeah.
Speaker 1: Now this is a dramatic year in U.S. history.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I think I read somewhere where you said your mother [Florence Watkins] had cried four times in life when you were growing up--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Once when President Kennedy [President John F. Kennedy]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Once when Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And when Nixon was elected.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I think she cried the hardest then.  She--I just couldn't--man, oh, man, who is this guy?
Speaker 1: But Dr. King, you know, was killed, I guess, the year you arrived, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're in school, now, in Madison.  Now, were you in an integrated school in Madison?
Speaker 2: No. Madison is basically--no Madison is basically all white, no.  I think there was me and the Raines girls, Steven Blue and his sister, that would be it.
Speaker 1: Okay, just a handful of other black students?
Speaker 2: Just a handful, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you going to a school that was associated with the air force base there, or--
Speaker 2: No, it was Madison Public School.
Speaker 1: --Okay, okay.  So do you remember much about that day when King was assassinated?
Speaker 2: I just--I don't remember his really being assassinated.  What I remember more is my parents were traumatized, and I had never seen them like that.  So, I think that's what I remember the most is my world--I had never seen my parents [Florence Watkins and William Watkins] like that before, and I didn't know what to do about it.  I mean, there was wailing in the house and--so it was a hard day for me because my mom, especially, was so sad and depressed, I mean, she got depressed too.  So that's what I remember the most.
Story_ID: 39655
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was school like?  What was the name of your school in Madison [Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: My junior high was school was Gompers and then my high school was East Side High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So basically I would say that I got a good education in both schools.  I was involved and all kinds of extracurricular activities.  But I was still the only one.  I'm still the only black person involved in all these things, so I--
Speaker 1: What kind of things were you involved in?
Speaker 2: --Let's see, like in French Club, I went to Badger Girl State, which is a--you go to the University for a week for kids who are smart, so you go to the University of Wisconsin for a week and see what it's like to be on campus.  So I went for, I can't remember what summer it was, so I went for one week during one summer, and my roommate was this white girl from Northern Wisconsin, and she had never seen a black person before or been next to one before.  So she saw me and she burst into tears, and so I'm looking at her and I'm shocked and the sponsors of the program were shocked, they don't know what to do.  Yeah, they're just at their wits end and so this girl never stops crying until they finally called her parents to say that you have to come get her.  This isn't gonna work out.  And they came and got her and took her away.  I mean, so basically I wasn't upset or anything, I was just like really perplexed, I mean, like really, you gonna start, really you're gonna cry?  So I didn't' see it as--I was just perplexed.
Speaker 1: I can't imagine that either--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, she just never stopped crying.  So I would have situations like that in my life, like I would be on homecoming court, because I was popular in school, but I would be--but I didn't have a date because there was no interracial, although Madison was a good place to live, there was still--I mean, there was any interracial dating.  There was but not in high school.  I mean, the black guys were dating white girls.  But so, I'm on homecoming court, but like no date.  So that's a little odd, right.  I should have been offended, but I wasn't offended.  (unclear)  I'm still on the court, what am I going to do.  What are you going to do about that?  And so, cheerleading and you know.  I was involved in a lot of stuff like--I was a good student.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were you on the National Honor Society, or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think I was.  No.  I wasn't.  I know I wasn't.
Speaker 1: But you were a good student though?
Speaker 2: I was a good student, yeah.  Well liked by teachers and, you know, on the student council, all that stuff.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Badger Girl State is really important.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's really important, so.  Not everybody gets a chance to do that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So.  Like Bill Clinton was in the Boys State of Arkansas--
Speaker 2: Oh, was he?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Went to the White House--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on a trip.  Did you all get a chance to go to the--did the Badger Girl State go to the state house or something or to the White House?
Speaker 2: We did go to the White House, but the Capital is right there, so you know, I had seen all that stuff.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Madison is the Capital.
Speaker 2: But I saw, I mean, like the campus is huge, so I saw the entire campus, like, I mean--the ag [agriculture] department, I wouldn't see that except--because of Badger Girl State.  So you get to see the whole campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: All the disciplines.
Story_ID: 39656
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, were there any special teachers or mentors in high school?
Speaker 2: I had--no, not really, but we had a crew of people who came from Chicago [Illinois] and sort of taught us--and taught the small group of black kids about African American History.  So we had Conrad Worrill, who's still sort of an activist in Chicago now.  And I remember the lady, her first name was Hazel, was it Hazel Brown?
Speaker 1: I don't know--
Speaker 2: It was Conrad, Hazel--
Speaker 1: I know Conrad.  But Hazel--
Speaker 2: --And, and--
Speaker 1: Okay, Hazel?
Speaker 2: --Yeah and Zack Cooper.  So they went--
Speaker 1: Hazel Gray?
Speaker 2: --Maybe it's Hazel Gray?
Speaker 1: She's an older lady?
Speaker 2: No.  She's very beautiful, though. I remember she was so beautiful and so exotic, and she had like this beautiful afro.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Conrad, Hazel and then--
Speaker 2: And Zack.  Zackary Cooper.
Speaker 1: --Okay.
Speaker 2: And they would come down, and they were very patient, and they were good teachers and basically, they just supplemented our education.  We weren't getting that, those, you know, African American topics in the school I was going to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is in high school?
Speaker 2: That was in high school, yeah.  And I don't think there was a fight about, well, you can't come down and teach these kids how to be revolutionaries, and I think they were, you know, they probably were a little bit revolutionary, yeah.  And the three of them--we had a little newspaper, and they really encouraged me to write, like, I was a reporter for that newspaper, and they were real encouraging, you know, and probably the reason--probably the reason why I am where I am today.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In what sense?  What was it that they did?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember I wrote something about something.  And they couldn't believe that I wrote that.  And they were did you really write that?  And so, you know, I just thought I was just writing, but they were impressed with it.  And I'm thinking, maybe I ought to be a journalist.  So that's what happened.
Speaker 1: Had you ever thought about that prior to that time?
Speaker 2: No.  Never thought about it, uh-uh.
Story_ID: 39657
Speaker 1: What was your career aspiration?  Had you formulated one at that point?
Speaker 2: No.  I knew I was just going to college, I mean, I just knew that I had no choice, that my parents [Florence Watkins and William Watkins] just knew that my sister [Pamela Wilder] and I were going to college.  There was not going to be any discussion.  There wasn't even going to be any discussion about, well, maybe I can go to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  No.  They had picked out Wisconsin [University of Madison-Wisconsin], you know.  My sister-in-law used to be dean of freshman at Stanford, and I went to go visit her, and I'm like, you know, if I had seen Stanford, I wouldn't have never had gone to Madison, but too late.  And back then kids were--families weren't doing the college trips, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So did you have any counseling about college?
Speaker 2: Not that I can remember, no.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: My teachers were very supportive, and you know and I was probably on a college track, but no, no.
Speaker 1: --No real counseling?
Speaker 2: No counseling.
Speaker 1: So what year was it that you graduated?
Speaker 2: In high school?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: '72 (1972).
Speaker 1: 1972, okay.  So this is--
Speaker 2: That was the beginning of everything.
Speaker 1: That's when your mother cried because of the election of [President] Richard Nixon.  Okay.  And this is the beginning of everything?
Speaker 2: It was the beginning.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know they were--when we were in high school, we would watch Walter Cronkite and we would watch the local news and go, oh, my God, there's a protest going on.  We're going to go down there, and we would go down there and protest and never felt any fear.  We were just--that's just what we did.  And our parents never held us back, you know.  Everybody did that.  That's what everybody did.
Speaker 1: Interesting.  Now, if I'm not mistaken, it was at the University of Wisconsin where they burnt the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] building to the ground?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And there was a bomb.  Yeah, the math building, yeah.
Speaker 1: That was sort of serious protesting.
Speaker 2: I mean, I think, now I think, what were my parents thinking?  But they would just say be home by eleven, yeah.  Now, I'm thinking what, really.  And they were watching the news too, but--good thing.
Speaker 1: It's interesting.  Wisconsin was like a real activist anti-war school, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Madison was, yeah, uh-huh, yeah.
Story_ID: 39658
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, at the University of Wisconsin [Madison Wisconsin], did you check off journalism as your major?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started off right away.
Speaker 1: What was that department like, I mean, did you feel like you had made the right choice?
Speaker 2: I felt like I did my studies.  Like did I make any friends in the journalism department, no.  It's still a lonely life.  I'm still living a lonely life.  So, no, I didn't make any friends in the journalism department.  I had one really good professor who really believed in me, MaryAnn Yodelis.  And she was a former nun, but she's such a good instructor, and actually she believed in a lot of the kids.
Speaker 1: Her last name was Yodela?
Speaker 2: Yodelis.  I think it's Y-O-D-E-L-I-S, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--so, you know, it's just like I always did what I had to do and just moved on.  I didn't make any, any friends in my department.  I mean, I had--I joined a sorority, Sigma Gamma Rho.  But even that was a little--was a little odd.
Speaker 1: Now is that a social sorority?
Speaker 2: That was social, and also you would do community service work too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Sigma Gamma Rho, now is that African American?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a small one.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard of them, I think.  It's a male Sigma too, a fraternity.  I'm not sure what the other group's letters are.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I found out that I joined and then, you know, I'm not really a sorority girl.  So that was--I'm not really a joiner and I don't like when you exclude people.  I found that out afterwards.  And so then, you know, I sort of realized I joined and then I realized that people could be excluded for stupid reasons, and I didn't like that, and that's probably where my mom's personality kicks in too.  So I didn't hang around.  I didn't stick with the sorority life, it wasn't--it excludes a lot of people, and that bothered me.
Story_ID: 39659
Speaker 1: All right.  So, well, now, how was your social life in college?
Speaker 2: I was a studier.  So I studied.  I mean I would go out on Friday and Saturday night, but basically, I studied.  I saw a lot of people flunk out of school because they didn't study. So I'd go to the library all the time.  So, social life, you know, it was okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now did you work over the summers?  Did you get any internships with newspapers in the summertime?
Speaker 2: I worked for the Cardinal [The Daily Cardinal, University of Wisconsin-Madison].  That was a liberal newspaper on campus. And my internship was at--it was in La Crosse, Wisconsin.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was the paper's name?
Speaker 2: I think it was La Crosse Tribune.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it's sort of near Minnesota.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you moved to La Crosse in the summertime?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember any memorable stories from those days?
Speaker 2: In La Crosse?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I remember being called, you know, it was a good internship, but I remembered being called colored and nigger in La Crosse, and I'm sure there are no black folks in La Crosse.  So those two things stand out.
Speaker 1: Is this like in the field during reporting work?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you know, I was called that, but I wouldn't say I had a bad time in La Crosse.
Story_ID: 39660
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were just off camera talking about the attitudes of La Crosse, Wisconsin, you know, maybe other rural Wisconsin communities.  They really don't see a lot of black people or anybody else, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So you think it just kind of fuels a fear or something?
Speaker 2: I really didn't think it was fear.  I just think it was just what they knew, what they had heard.  I don't think it was fear.  I didn't feel afraid.
Speaker 1: Well, now you, but, I'm talking about them?
Speaker 2: Them?
Speaker 1: Were they afraid of you or you know?
Speaker 2: Were they afraid of me, no.  I think it just comes out of their mouth.
Story_ID: 39661
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So did any of your internships result in any jobs upon graduation?
Speaker 2: Probably, the La Crosse job.  Actually the La Crosse job.  I had graduated from college then I went to Racine, Wisconsin.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about graduation first.  Was there anything special about graduation, did you graduate with honors?
Speaker 2: Graduation was so big, it was just like--cause Madison [University of Wisconsin-Madison] is so big that it took half a day.  I didn't really want to go.  But it was like such a big deal for my parents that I had graduated from a really good college and so I had to go, but, oh, God, it just took all day.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't really care for big ceremonies.
Speaker 1: This is in '76 (1976)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So I don't remember much about graduation.  I just remember it took all day.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is 1976.  Was your mother happier that Nixon [President Richard Nixon] was out of office?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was thrilled, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now this is the first year of the Jimmy Carter Administration in '76 (1976)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I really liked [President] Jimmy Carter.  I actually went to a luncheon where he was there.  And I just really--I really like him.
Speaker 1: Did you work for him?
Speaker 2: No.  It was just a luncheon.  He met with the editorial board.
Story_ID: 39662
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you graduated what were your prospects?  Were they all in Racine [Wisconsin]?  Was there a job in Racine?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, in journalism, you have to work in some small towns before you graduate to a bigger newspaper.  So, Racine was there.  It was close to Chicago [Illinois].  So, you know, it's a mid-size Wisconsin newspaper, it was a good job to land.
Speaker 1: So what's the name of the paper?
Speaker 2: It's Racine Journal Times, but the locals all called it the Racine Urinal Times.  Yeah, everybody hates their local newspaper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's like, okay.
Speaker 1: So, what was it like, were you the first black reporter they ever had or had someone preceded you?
Speaker 2: No.  I think I was the first black reporter there.  But we were all young, so, you know, it was a different generation, so we were all really good friends and they had a--my--she's my best friend to this day, Geeta Jensen--Sharma, Geeta Sharma-Jensen, and she's Indian.  So they had a black and an Indian and other young whites, and we still have probably like bi-annual parties--picnics in the summer.  We still get together.  So, you know, we became good friends, we're all good friends.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you start the summer of '76 (1976)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did start--
Speaker 2: No.  I probably started like the fall.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  So what position did you start at?
Speaker 2: County--in covering the county.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so you had a pretty good place to start.  It's under a lot of people, in the bigger papers, they start writing obituaries and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  Well, county isn't so good, it's like (making sounds pointing to head).  It's boring, I mean it's county budgets, it's you know, I wouldn't say covering the county, any county is a dream job.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it's county commission meetings?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So I started county and then I went to--and then I did police and then I did education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any significant stories that you remember coming out of there?
Speaker 2: No.  It was just a small town.  You know, small town makes big news out of little bitty issues.  So, no, not really, uh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you were there at the Racine Wisconsin Journal Times--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --For what?
Speaker 2: I think four or five years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was there any individual or person or staff member at the journal that helped you try to mentor you?
Speaker 2: It's editing, Chuck Edwards.  He really helped all the young people.  But you know we were such--we were all young and we helped each other and we all wanted to get ahead and you know we'd read each other's stories and give each other feature ideas and, yeah, it was a helping--it was sort of like, you know that movie "The Big Chill," we were just all journalism-focused.  We all wanted to get ahead.  We all kind of wanted to--we had a really good time at that paper, but our goal was to move on.
Story_ID: 39663
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when did you first get wind of a chance to move on?
Speaker 2: I had gone to a feature writing conference in St. Louis [Missouri].  This is what happened.  I had tried--I had applied at the Tribune and I met with the managing editor, and he's this cocky guy, and he said, oh, well you're not good enough to come to the Chicago Tribune.  And I'm like, well watch me.  And so I went to this feature's conference and the feature's editor, Akoki Dushon(ph) and her deputy, Mary Kinovel(ph), were both there.  And, you know, we're at a conference and you talk and bring up issues and discuss stuff and I think they just paid attention to me, and they offered me a job.  So, you know, if you go through one door and it shuts--it closes, you know, you go through another door, which is what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they recruited you and this is another person?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was good enough.
Speaker 1: So this is 1980 what?
Speaker 2: Eighty-three (1983) when I came in, yeah. So, yeah, I was good enough.
Story_ID: 39664
Speaker 1: Okay.  Eighty-three (1983) was a big year in Chicago [Illinois], with the election of Harold Washington.  Did you come in before the election or afterwards?
Speaker 2: It was after the election.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was after, cause I was watching.  I couldn't believe it.  I went like, I couldn't believe the campaigning, it was--it was the most bizarre thing I'd ever seen, so it was after.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you mean before then, right, because you were watching the campaign?
Speaker 2: Right, right, it was.  No.  I came after he was elected mayor.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you couldn't believe the activities?
Speaker 2: The activities, yeah.  I was like, reading all about it in Wisconsin.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So this is national news?
Speaker 2: It was huge, yeah.
Speaker 1: Have any impressions of Harold Washington as a politician?
Speaker 2: Oh, I thought he was such a fantastic politician.  And I thought he was kind, and he was so smart.  That guy had a vocabulary like you couldn't believe.  And I remember he would say something and I remember the reporters would come back in the newsroom and they had never heard the word before.  They were, just like, okay, what is this word that he just said, it sounds like, and then they'd try and look it up, I mean, no one ever heard this word before.  But I think he had like a fantastic vocabulary, which is just really impressive, you know.  And he used it, you know, when he really wanted to stick it to you.  You know, I don't know what he just said.  Yeah.  I thought he was a good mayor, I thought he--I thought he was really on the cusp of moving the city forward.  I don't know how he stood the attacks that were made against him.  I mean, he was a strong man.  The personal attacks made against him.  He was a good mayor, you know, and I think he was turning people around so that the whole city was going to vote for him.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: He really did in '87 (1987).
Speaker 2: He did.  Yeah, yeah.  He was impressive, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you come in.  You weren't here before he was in office?
Speaker 2: I followed it.
Speaker 1: I wonder if the attitudes that the papers changed any because of his election, you know, I mean, I know the television media was in shock, you could see it on their faces on TV.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think they were in shock.  I think they were always in shock, to this day.
Speaker 1: So do you think the Tribune staff was kind of like in shock too because of it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  I think they're in shock with Obama [President Barack Obama].
Story_ID: 39665
Speaker 1: Okay.  So who were some of the other African Americans on staff when you joined the Tribune [Chicago Tribune]?
Speaker 2: Right now or when I was there?
Speaker 1: No.  When you joined in '83 (1983)?
Speaker 2: It's so interesting, like in '83 (1983) they had a much larger African American staff than they do today, which is amazing to me.  I just cannot believe that, but, it's a fact.  So back then it was Monroe Anderson and George Curry and Nat Shepard and like Michelle Norris and Gracie Lawson and Brenda Butler and Darlene Glanton(ph) and really good journalists.  It was just a pleasure to work with all of them, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's quite a group that you just named.  Was Clarence Page still there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Clarence was still there. And Leanita was--she was--and Ruby Scott, you know.  And Leanita was just--and these people had big jobs too, you know.  So you could be impressed by that and if you needed mentoring, you know, you had someone who had been through the trenches and had a great job and could explain things to you and so, it was really easy--it was great to work there, yeah.  So Leanita McClain it was just before she had committed suicide.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Do you have any thoughts about that?  I know it kind of shook a lot of people up.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I didn't really know her that well, but it shook--I think it shook up the entire newsroom.  I think she had like lots of white friends and, I'm not sure what was in her note.  But I think she struggled with being the "it" black girl.  I mean that was hard for her.  And I think she probably questioned some of her friendships with whites at the paper, but you know, depression--I can't explain it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Her suicide is--you would see it as--
Speaker 2: Probably related to depression.
Speaker 1: --Right, rather than a situation.
Speaker 2: Than a situation, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There's been so much speculation about it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 39666
Speaker 1: So, what was your job, initially, at the Tribune?
Speaker 2: Well, I first started out as a copy editor for Tempo, which was the Tribune's main feature section.  And then I probably stayed there for about a year.  And then I became an assistant food editor, which I really loved, cause it taught me how to cook better and it elevated my palate and I helped co-write a cook book and, you know, you learn about food.  It's a field I wouldn't otherwise have gotten into.  So that was a good part of, you know, food photography and meeting with chefs and finding out about different spices and different ethnic foods and so that was, I mean, you learn a lot that way.  So that was good.  And then I moved over--and then I became editor of the style section, which was sort of like the fashion section.
Story_ID: 39667
Speaker 1: Okay.  I want to slow down and go back to some of this, and just ask you like what was it like, I mean, is there a memorable story from being assistant food editor?
Speaker 2: God, I ate at so many good restaurants.  I mean like four-star, five-star restaurants.  It was  almost--it almost puts you at a disadvantage, because your palate--it raises your palate to a level it really shouldn't be at, cause it's like, oh, man, I used to like (unclear) I ate at McDonald's everyday when I was at college and now, you know, I cannot eat at McDonald's anymore.  So, I mean, and you learn things, like what wine goes with what food, I mean, it was--it was just a really good learning experience, how to cook in the kitchen, how to use a knife.
Speaker 1: So it's interesting to me that you--was there a prerequisite for having that job?  So, you didn't have to know about food before you took the job is what I'm asking?
Speaker 2: No.  You just have to know how to edit.  So, I should be able to like edit a sports story.  You know when I worked at the Wisconsin State Journal too.  I forgot about that.  I worked in the sports department.  That's the one good thing about newspapers is they can pluck you and put you in any area and you can see if you like it or you hate it, and you get to know that you're not going to stay there forever, unless you're on punishment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you did work for the Wisconsin State Journal when you were in college?
Speaker 2: When I was in college, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was it a summer job?
Speaker 2: It was during the school year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Sports editor, right?
Speaker 2: Just working in the sports department like agate, scores, little bitty sports stories.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's when I knew I didn't want to work in the sports department ever again.
Speaker 1: But you liked the food.  Now, you say you were just doing--so you were the--you just edited the food stories?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, and I, yeah.  And you make assignments and you go to restaurants to figure what the trends are, you know, you have wine-tastings, you have beer-tastings, you have product tastings, so.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite restaurant in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Oh, back then, geez.  Can't remember, we would go out all the time.  It was hard to, I mean, I was lucky to eat at the top restaurants in Chicago, like the Everest Room, and now I can't even remember them.  So I was just lucky, you know.  This was the beginning of like Rich Melman had started to open a lot of restaurants and so he would give like--
Speaker 1: Let us Entertain You and R.J. Grunts.
Speaker 2: --Yeah, great big parties and yeah, yeah.  It was in the '80s (1980s) and so, you know, the wine was flowing the champagne was flowing, you know. You'd have like really expensive dinners and lunches.  It was just a good experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, how long did you do that, as food editor, before you went to style?
Speaker 2: Well, I was assistant food editor.  So, I don't know, I must have been there like four or five years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Six years, something like that.
Speaker 1: That's a lot of good food.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was, yeah, lot of pounds.  (laughing)
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you didn't have a favorite restaurant, as such?
Speaker 2: Not that I can recall, no.
Speaker 1: Now was there, on the other side, was there a downside?
Speaker 2: Too much food.  Yeah, I mean, it's like--it's like--it's really like pace yourself to not eat everything.  So that was the downside, couldn't eat it all.
Speaker 1: I think this is kind of when people were discovering Chicago-style pizza?
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's one of our contributions.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, I hated that deep dish.  Too much dough.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is, all right--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was the beginning of like--it was actually the beginning of wood-burning oven pizzas and it was really when the term "foodie" started and people weren't afraid to just--people would experiment in how they ate and people started going to all the ethnic restaurants around the city, so.
Story_ID: 39668
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're there, I guess, about 1989 or '90 (1990) in the style section?
Speaker 2: No, the style section was like in the mid '80s (1980s), or something like that.
Speaker 1: Mid-eighties (1980s), okay, all right, so '86 (1986), or '87 (1987)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, maybe something like that.
Speaker 1: All right.  So were you the editor of style?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh,
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is you're moving up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm moving up, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So what were your responsibilities as an editor of style?
Speaker 2: Editor of style, you know, I'd plan the fashion cover, little short features, lifestyle features, you do the fashion spreads, you work with models, you do high-end travel pieces, so it was sort of like a magazine.  You'd do high-end travel pieces, you'd do first person, you'd have a first person piece, you'd have a celebrity piece, you know, you'd send writers to cover the shows in New York [New York] and Milan [Italy] and Paris [France] and decide what the trends are going to be, you know, for the next season.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So certain people in the fashion community and the travel community that you would touch base with and find out what the trends are?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, you get together, you'd talk, you sort of like--and the designers sort of tell you what the trend is going to be and the stores kind of know what the--you know the buyers and the department stores sort of decide what the trend is going to be and somehow you all get together and you just figure it out that emerald green is going to be the color of the year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there an aspect to doing that that shapes fashion, I mean, fashion trends.
Speaker 2: I mean, I probably think the designers did it.  You know, whatever it was that they were showing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you all basically reflected what the designers were doing?
Speaker 2: Right.  Just write about it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how long did you do that?
Speaker 2: Probably like four or five years.  I didn't really like--I didn't really like covering fashion.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so this takes us into the '90s (1990s)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the '90s (1990s).
Speaker 1: So is the next job the editorial board?
Speaker 2: No, the next job was, I edit the home section--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Home design.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you just look at mainly interior--interior design, architecture, you know, product, same as style, except it's home design.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Same approach to it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you like that better?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was nice, yeah, yeah.  People were much nicer, the fashion industry, back-biting.
Story_ID: 39669
Speaker 1: Now, were you married by this time?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I got married in--I think I got married in '86 (1986).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us how you met your husband?
Speaker 2: I met my husband [Stephen Lythcott] at Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison].  He was in law school and I was in J-school and then he graduated and went to--got a job in Chicago [Illinois], and I couldn't get a job here and so I took the job in Racine and we just sort of commuted.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you all were together a long time, actually before you got married?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, he was a lawyer and I think he was head of the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No.  I think he was like deputy, or something, deputy.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is Stephen--
Speaker 2: --Lythcott, yeah.
Story_ID: 39670
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Is the editorial page next?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that's next.
Speaker 1: And what happened?  I've never understood how they choose the editorial board and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, Don Wycliff was the editor then and Howard--he was the editor of the editorial page and Howard Tyner was the editor of the paper.  And you know, I think--I was just always--I never shut up, I always open my mouth.  If I had a issue about something then I would talk about it.  And I actually think that's how I got the job.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay--
Speaker 2: Just by being me and, you know, I respect people and I respect authority if I think you deserve it.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  So this is what year?
Speaker 2: I think that was '92 (1992), I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Nineteen Ninety-two.  This coincides with another election year.  (unclear) [President] Bill Clinton.
Speaker 2: Bill Clinton, yeah.
Story_ID: 39671
Speaker 1: Kind of explain, how is an editorial staff formed and whose assigned to do what, how does it work?
Speaker 2: Well, so the editorials in the paper are supposed to be the history of what the Tribune [Chicago Tribune] thinks about a certain issue.  So, and the Tribune has a history that we have to pay attention to.  So, and the editorials are--are right of center, basically.
Speaker 1: So that's a conscious decision by the Tribune?
Speaker 2: By the Tribune.  I mean it's just--it's the history of the Tribune.  So you can't be inconsistent in your editorials.  So you can't say I like cheese today and I hate cheese the next day.  You sort of have to be consistent, because that's what readers expect and that's just the philosophy of the newspaper.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's basically--
Speaker 2: But occasionally we'll change things, you know, like we went against death row and we endorsed Obama [Barack Obama], so--and when we do, when we change it--when we get out of step, it makes a whole lot of news.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Just for the sake of history, the Tribune's an old paper.  It goes back to the time when Republicans were a lot more moderate than they are today, as a party.  And being right of center in those days wasn't as right as it is today.  And so I don't--
Speaker 2: Well, I think the Tribune editorials are moderate GOP [Republican Party].  I don't think they're--I'm not a Republican.  So I think that the editorials that are written are fairly moderate.  They're not Tea-Partyish.
Speaker 1: --Right.  That's what I was trying to say, that the center has shifted.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the center has shifted, yeah.  But I think we're still old school.  There's still old school Republican, which is moderate.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Illinois history of politicians like Charles Percy and Dirksen [Everett Dirksen], people like that, is a little bit different too, nationally in some ways, too.  Okay, so with this historical perspective and the editorial board like makes its opinion, you know, rooted in this historical--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So when I first started the job, I thought, oh my gosh, I'm going to come in, we're going to sit at the table and we're going to write an editorial based on how we voted.  Well, we don't really vote, you know.  You just sort of like discuss a issue and it's based on what past editorials have said, you know.  So it's not really a democracy and you don't really raise your hand and okay, five for and ten against, you know it's not like that.
Speaker 1: Is there ever a sense of turning the tide where there's a you know, there's a policy that the Tribune has held for many years and then somebody--
Speaker 2: When we said that death row should be abolished, I mean that was a long difficult discussion.  When we--twice when we went in for the Obama endorsement, that was a long difficult discussion.  Whenever we discuss abortion, it's very tense and long and heated discussion.  There are certain issues that are--that we discuss very thoroughly and that everyone has an opinion about and we try and keep it very cordial, because we have to work with each other the minute we walk out of that room.  So we try and be cordial.  We don't yell and scream like they do on TV.  When we have guests come in, they're surprised that we don't yell and scream.  Well, we're colleagues, we're professionals and we're like family, and so we've got to work with each other.  So we don't yell and scream.  Occasionally that'll happen, can't help it, but typically, we don't.
Speaker 1: I was just thinking (unclear) they never do it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Occasionally it'll happen, yeah.  And then you know, you go back and apologize.
Story_ID: 39672
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the death penalty issue, was that one of the more contentious issues discussed?
Speaker 2: Well, I would, if I can recall it correctly, most of us were against the death penalty.  But there are some who are for it, you know, and you know and to them they had good reasons, you know.  There was one colleague and he had a relative who had been murdered.  And I can see that you can't--I mean, if I had had a relative who had been murdered, maybe I would think differently about the death penalty, I don't know, but he wanted to keep it, he still wants to keep it.  Yeah, that's his decision.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But in terms of the dynamic of discussion, what do you think was the most contentious issue or what were some of the more contentious issues discussed?
Speaker 2: Well, it was definitely Obama [President Barack Obama] and abortion.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What position did the Tribune take on abortion?
Speaker 2: We haven't really taken a position on abortion.  It's just each issue, like third trimester abortions, we're against that.  It depends on what the issue is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Would it be something specific like a proposed piece of legislation--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Or something--
Speaker 2: Exactly, yeah.
Story_ID: 39673
Speaker 1: --Okay.  All right.  So were you surprised, you know, when the Tribune [Chicago Tribune] endorsed [President] Barack Obama for president?
Speaker 2: I was so happy.  I just couldn't believe it.  And I had sort of, I thought, well, maybe we're not going to do it.  And I shouldn't be disappointed because, you know, the paper always endorses a Republican for president, but I was amazed.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay--
Speaker 2: I think, probably if Sarah Palin had been a better candidate, it might have been closer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You think she kind of just blew it out of the water?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I think at first they thought the race had changed when Sarah Palin was nominated, but as the election went on, I think they had to change their mind.
Speaker 1: So they thought it changed for the--
Speaker 2: For the best for McCain [John McCain], yeah, yeah.  That McCain had made a really smart move.  Because McCain, I mean, when he came in, he came in earlier that year and he came in by himself.  He just sort of wasn't the candidate that everybody was looking at, you know, he didn't have secret service.  He just came in by himself and he had one assistant and so we thought that he wasn't part of the ballgame anymore, and you know then when he won the primaries and he had selected Sarah Palin, a woman--
Speaker 1: --So.  I think it may be kind of hidden here.  What you're actually saying is that John McCain actually comes to the editorial board of the Tribune and sits down with it?
Speaker 2: --Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  And I suppose [President] Barack Obama did the same thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he did.
Speaker 1: All right.  And then they discuss the issues and try to convince the board to support them?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is really important, who the Tribune endorses or the Sun Times endorses.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah.  I think the Sun Times [Chicago Sun-Times] normally endorses, used to, it doesn't do endorsements anymore.  But the Sun Times would normally endorse a Democrat and, you know, the Tribune wouldn't.  So, for us to like--we lost a lot of subscribers.  You always lose subscribers when you endorse somebody who they don't like, you know, and then they'll re-subscribe.
Story_ID: 39674
Speaker 1: --All right.  So what are the different roles, you know, that are played on the editorial board?
Speaker 2: Well, there's twelve people on the editorial board and we have the editor, editorial page editor, the deputy editor and then we have a crew of writers and then we have the letters editor and the commentary page editor, which is me.  And then we have three columnists who are on board.
Speaker 1: Okay that write on behalf of the Tribune [Chicago Tribune]?
Speaker 2: That write, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, they can have their own opinion?
Speaker 2: The columnists can have their own opinion, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But whoever writes the editorial that comes from the Tribune, itself, has to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, has to be--the editorial page editor decides the tone that it's gonna take, and you know if you're a writer, if you have a--all of the editorial writers have a beat, like they can cover environment or they can cover the courts or business or county and local government.  So they sort of know the direction they should take, the tone they should take.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So somebody even chooses the cartoon.  Does the editorial page--
Speaker 2: That person is also independent.
Speaker 1: --Okay, the cartoon, okay?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They don't have to agree with what the editorials are.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I noticed that in papers.  Sometimes the cartoon doesn't agree with the editorials.
Speaker 2: It doesn't agree, and they don't have to, yeah, they're independent.
Speaker 1: So, I read there were sixteen different cartoons that the Tribune draws from?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we have our cartoonist on staff, Scott Stantis and then he's basically conservative and then we choose syndicated cartoonist.  And over the years they're getting fewer and fewer.  I mean fewer and fewer papers are hiring cartoonists.  So it's sort of like a dying breed.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Why is that, you suppose?
Speaker 2: They're expensive.  They're expensive.  They make huge salaries.  So that was an issue and probably the internet and newspapers weigh, you know, writing, cartoonists, photographers, I mean, they weigh all those things.
Speaker 1: Okay, because the press is under some pressure now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, fewer and fewer people--papers will want a cartoonist.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there's a letter's page editor and are you often confused for the letter's editor?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They don't know the difference between the op-ed and the letterer--a letter.  A letter is really short, you know, like three or four paragraphs.  Four is a lot.  And op-eds are discussing issue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are they in response--
Speaker 2: No.  It cannot be in response.
Speaker 1: --So it can't be in response to what the--
Speaker 2: No.  That's what letterers are for.  Letterers are for--are in response to something that appeared in the paper.  And op-eds are just about an issue, so it can be about school closing or it can be about rape in prisons or, you know, just whatever the hot topic of the day is.  Or it can be about--I've run pieces where a girl had a face full of piercings, and she wrote about why she pierced her face, and the reaction--she was a waitress too.  And the reaction people had to her piercings and--so that was a good first person.  And then I've run pieces from kids, this one girl had a--she was a smart girl, but she had a learning disability.  So, she had to really study and struggle.  She struggled in her studies to get good grades.  And so she wrote about what it was like to have a learning disability or a piece about--from a mom who had a child who had Down syndrome and what that was like.  And then I get the experts and the politicians and the college professors.
Story_ID: 39675
Speaker 1: --Okay.  Now I read that every day that you come in, I mean, you got--your phone is lit up.
Speaker 2: Lit up, yeah.  They're manned.
Speaker 1: It could be anybody calling during the day.
Speaker 2: It could be anybody, yeah.
Speaker 1: I think you said anybody from Mia Farrow to Julian Bond?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah or Muammar Gaddafi.  I'm like, really. (laughing)  I ran a piece by him.  Yeah, I just never know who wants to write an op-ed.  I mean sometimes I'll--people will hire ghost writers and it reads like it's from a ghost writer.
Speaker 1: So you don't want it ghost written?
Speaker 2: I don't care if it's ghost written 'cause not everybody can write but you have to, I think, write like the person.  I had a piece--a ghost-written piece from Muhammad Ali.  Well, we've all heard Muhammad Ali speak and this piece was so academic that I mean nobody would believe that he wrote it, you know.  So, you have to pay attention to stuff like that, yeah.  It has to be believable.  And then you know Mia Farrow wrote a piece for me and it was the first time she had ever written an op-ed and she called on the phone and I'm like oh my gosh, is this really her.  I mean you want to respond like that.  But she wrote her piece, I can't remember what it was about.  But it was something on--she felt really passionate about.  Oh, it was about something to do with the Olympics, anyway.
Story_ID: 39676
Speaker 1: Okay.  So an op-ed, you have, so people write an opinion and they submit it to the editor of the Tribune [Chicago Tribune], being you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you review that opinion?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I read everything.  I get about 150 a day.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: You have to read through them and sort them out because you can only have like, like pick--
Speaker 2: --Maybe pick--I can use like two a day.  Yeah, so, you know, you can tell by the second paragraph if--sometimes you have to read to the third paragraph, if it's any good.  Sometimes like if you don't get to the point by the third paragraph then the reader's just going to read on--I mean, they're not going to waste their time.  You know, people have a finite number of hours and, so they're not going to meander through a newspaper piece, you know.  It has to be really compelling.  And I think that's what most people don't do, is they don't make those first few paragraphs really compelling.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you look for that first of all.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is somebody going to read this?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Will somebody read this, yeah.  And then you have to look at the topic.  I mean, so if you--I think that people should assume like, let's say like the bombing in Boston.  So, all of our columnists are going to write about that.  So if you really want to get in the paper, you won't write about the bombing in Boston, because every columnist is going to cover that, so--from every angle.  So, unless you're like a true expert, it's likely that your piece won't be published.  So you know I'd take another topic.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you ever have a good day where you may get four good ones?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Then it's really hard, yeah.
Speaker 1: Does that mean you cast two of them out, never to be--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have to tell people like I'll accept a piece and then--I was just looking at--this guy just called me the other day and he says, when are you going to run my piece, but then Sara Paretsky, she writes the detective novels.  He said, "She wrote a piece and you kicked mine out."  And I did.  I remember that day.  He did do a good piece and it had a time element to it, so I couldn't--I couldn't run his piece.
Speaker 1: Now, if it doesn't have a time element can you save it for another day?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do save it.  And sometimes, you know, I'll save it for an entire year.  You know, it's still good the next year.  And I'll just ask them, you know.  I'll save it and I'll probably remember it, but please call me in case I don't.  But, yeah, we call those evergreens.  You can just keep them forever.  And you know Christmas comes around every year, Halloween comes around every year, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So pieces like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But something about an election or something that's going to happen within a certain period of time you can't hold them?
Speaker 2: I can't, no.  And you know I get lots of pieces from politicians that are basically puff pieces.  They're patting themselves on the back or they're trying to push some legislation that they are sponsoring and you know that's not the point of the page.  So I have to turn them down.
Story_ID: 39677
Speaker 1: Now, you have been accused of being a conservative, a liberal, a communist, you know, all kinds of things.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's so funny, yeah.  And my job is to run pieces from all sides.  I mean, and not get sensitive, you know, and that's my job.
Speaker 1: Sounds like that would be hard to do?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is sometimes.  Yeah, it is sometimes.  Sometimes, you know, like a topic that's dear to my heart.  I'll have to run a piece that's anti that topic, you know.  It kills me.  But it's supposed to be a page of voices and so I have to make it a page of voices and I think that you should know what the other side is thinking too.  You can't just keep your head buried in the sand, you have to read every side, you know.  People will call--you know, coming in the morning and people will be so mad at something Clarence Page wrote and I'm like, well, don't read him, you know, read something else, but.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you pick a piece that's you know opposite of your own views, is it criteria that, you know makes some good points--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Or has a strong argument?
Speaker 2: Has to be strong argument, good point, good writing, yeah, all those things, to the point, you know.
Story_ID: 39678
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  You were saying earlier that the Tribune [Chicago Tribune] actually pays for these phenomenal kind of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, some people, I mean, we pay $150.  But a lot of newspapers don't pay, and some newspapers pay more than we do.  And writers will shop their pieces around, you know, so.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  And there's a way that--I was looking online there are ways to submit to you and other papers, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's so funny when I first started out I used to get like, my mail was like this (indicating how high), huge amount of mail.  And now, if I get--now it's all email, you know.  And if I get like--maybe I'll get like two op-eds a week through the mail, snail mail.  And I just got one today, and the guy was, I don't remember his name, but he was a former politician and he was eighty three years old.  So when I get an op-ed through the mail, I know the guy is about, or the woman is about eighty three years old.  Yeah, the people that still use snail mail are older.  Most of the op-ed writers are male.  It's really hard to get female op-ed writers who don't write about sending my kid to kindergarten for the first time or sending my kid off to college.  Women tend to write about domestic issues.  So there's only so many of those that you can run.  I have a hard time finding strong female op-ed writers.  Not just me, I think other op-ed editors have that problem too.
Story_ID: 39679
Speaker 1: So if I was writing an op-ed and targeting the Tribune [Chicago Tribune] with my op-ed, what advice would you give me, or anyone doing that?
Speaker 2: It would have to be a strong issue.  You just have to really think it out.  I should know what point you're going to make by the third paragraph.  We call that the nut graph.  The writing should be bright, it should be crisp, make your point, don't meander, know what you're talking about, be authoritative.  It's hard to write an op-ed, actually.  And don't use the pronoun I, because nobody cares.  You know, unless you're really important, unless you're, you know, a celebrity or [President] Barack Obama, nobody cares what you think.  They don't care what I think.  That's the mistake a lot of people make as--they start out a piece "I think," and it sounds harsh, but nobody cares.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.  That's it, cold hard facts.
Speaker 2: Cold hard facts.  And when I tell people that they, you know, when they think about it, then they really get it, you know.  And there's a way to write a piece without using that pronoun, you know.  You can tell a story and not use the word, "I."  So just tell the story, you know.  A woman wrote about taking care of her mother who had Alzheimer's and how difficult that was.  So, and she never used the pronoun "I."  It can be done, but it's hard.  It's harder to do it that way.  And it's also--people always think like the suggested link for op-eds is like 800 words, so people always like I write to 800 words.  Well, sometimes 400 words tells the story, you know, and people will love you for that, so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  A person with a strong opinion, I would guess would well over count it?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.  And a lot of people who do satire.  A satire actually can be a problem.  You have to be really good at satire 'cause people don't get it a lot.  So satire is iffy just because it's just hard to execute and people who write humorous pieces, I mean, they tell you joke, after joke, after joke and it's like, yeah, but you told that joke before, you know, it's not funny anymore, so.  Humorous and satire pieces are also difficult to pull off.
Story_ID: 39680
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I've read in the material we have that you--that the Tribune [Chicago Tribune] was--I know one fellow wrote an article in regards to something and he wrote that regards to the fundamental Christians controlling Texas school books, and a fellow named Stone [Jeff Stone], I think, replied and he implied that the Tribune met and colluded to, you know, publish this particular article that offended him on Easter Sunday, I think it was.
Speaker 2: HHHHh He's saying that's Jeff Stone?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right.  Yeah, Jeff Stone wrote it.
Speaker 2: I never met that guy in my life.  Yeah, he's a professor at the University of Chicago [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  And I use his pieces occasionally.  He writes for a lot of publications.  That's just an untruth.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the implication was that the Tribune was colluding to--
Speaker 2: No.  We don't collude.
Speaker 1: --Offend the--you know, right.
Speaker 2: We don't collude.
Speaker 1: And I think your response was that you made that decision.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's funny how people think there's a conspiracy going on.  There's no--there's not a conspiracy.  You know, we do the best job that we can do every day.  But there's no collusion and there's not a conspiracy.  And I think sometimes people just get upset when we don't run their pieces and take it personally.  And I get that, but you know, there's a limited number of space in the paper, and you don't know what's in front of me when I'm doing my job every day, so.
Story_ID: 39681
Speaker 1: But who are you accountable to?  Are you ever pulled by the higher up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You know I sort of appreciate that, you know, because I don't want to be responsible by myself.  I want people to watch my back. You know 'cause I can miss a lot of things.  So my boss is the editorial page editor.  And I think that most times he likes the pieces that I will select, but sometimes there's a problem with the piece, that you need another set of eyes, you always need another set of eyes on the story.  So, you know, he's a set of eyes, the copy desk has another set of eyes and there are plenty of days when I've had to pull a piece, because I'm like, whoa, I didn't see that hole or I didn't see that problem.
Speaker 1: --The typical problem would be something that's just not true or something?
Speaker 2: It doesn't make--it's just--like there's a fact that like the premise is wrong, like the entire premise of the piece is wrong, that when you sit and because you work so fast, when you sit and think about it, you're like yeah but this, this and this.  Like I had to pull a piece the other day cause the premise of it was wrong.  He was talking about Illinois needed a good scandal.  They had the Anthony Weiner scandal and the Eliot Spitzer scandal, and I forget who else, and he said Illinois just needed a good scandal for the summer and then, maybe not for the summer, but it needed a good scandal.  And so then I was--it was well written and everything, and then I thought, I put it in and then start thinking about it, no, then a colleague said, well, what about Rod Blagojevich and what about Todd Stroger and then he'd go, oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Jessie Jackson, Jr.
Speaker 2: Jessie Jackson, Jr. that was mentioned, yeah, yeah.  So, you know, sometimes you get a brain drain as an editor and you just--and I appreciate people saying, oh, don't put that in the paper, because you don't want to do a big correction the next morning, you know, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a good example.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I can see how that--you can think of a lot on here.
Speaker 2: Yeah. There's like land mines all over the place, and you know, you've got to catch them.  And we fact-check everything.  I mean some people just think they can just write off the top of their head, and you call them up and say, "Well, where did you get that piece of information?"  "Well, it's just, I just think that."  Well, you know, you got to have an original source, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  If I was to write a piece about President [Barack] Obama being born in Kenya and being a Muslim--
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: It wouldn't--
Speaker 2: --No.  Not gonna happen, uh-uh.  There's no proof.  Even if Donald Trump wrote it, there's no proof, you know. Yeah, I just won't let people--you can't say crazy stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You're entitled to your opinion--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --But you can't just say crazy--
Speaker 2: You just can't.
Speaker 1: --Unsupported--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it has to be fact-checked, yeah.  And so maybe that's where they say that there's a cabal, you know, because we try and check every single thing.

Speaker 1: Okay.  I realize that the Tribune [Chicago Tribune], though, considered by many African Americans who read a lot as being the most literate of the two papers, even though that's true, not a lot of African--I mean proportionately, a large section of the community does not necessarily read the Tribune--
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: --As opposed to the Sun Times [Chicago Sun-Times]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --And Defender and whatever else.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --What's the feedback been from the African American community, as far as the Tribune, and how has the Tribune regard the African American community?
Speaker 2: I think more African Americans read the Sun Times, even though it's become a lot more conservative.  They don't see that it's become more conservative, but if you read it over the years, it is more conservative.  I don't know if there's much--it's true, there's you know, more African Americans read the Sun Times, it's true.  There's nothing, I mean, I can't--that's a fact.  I don't know if you can change habit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Does it impact or influence some policy of the Tribune in any way, in terms of how they regard the African American community as being important to address, you know, issues in the community?  Is it a tendency for anyone to say, well, black people don't read it anyway?
Speaker 2: No.  They never say it, uh-uh, uh-uh.  I think we should have more African American reporters.  I think we should have more, yeah.  But no, everybody's a professional.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, that's part of the professional ethic?
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah.  In fact, I think, they really cover the black community, a portion of the black community well. I think if you had more black reporters though, that, I think we cover the crime part well, but the everyday life of African Americans who are involved in crimes, I don't think we do such a good job.
Speaker 1: Do you think that this is a problem that's endemic to white media, basically?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I mean, even when I was--I remember when I was editing the style section, even when it went down to the models, the art director would pick out this model and say, "Oh, she's so beautiful."  And she was pretty.  And he would think that she was a black model.  Well, his idea of a beautiful black woman and my idea of a beautiful black woman were completely different.  Mine was much darker.  And his was much lighter.  And we would fight like cats and dogs to get a brown-skin model in there, and they would talk about the lights and, you know, I mean crazy stuff like--what do you mean the lights.  But you have to fight for little bitty things like that, you know.  Not just black--let's get a black model, you know, who's darker.  So, that's why you need more black reporters and more black editors.
Story_ID: 39683
Speaker 1: Well.  What is your next move, you think, or do you--
Speaker 2: I am fifty-nine years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm looking at the rocking chair.
Speaker 1: Well, that's not so old, it's the new forty nine, you know.
Speaker 2: No.  I hope it's fifty-nine.  So my next move?  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, assuming there is a move.  You're thinking what would like to do that you have not done so far.  Maybe I should put it like that?
Speaker 2: What would I like to do that I haven't done so far.  I've done almost everything at the paper that I want to do, you know.  I think I'm in my twilight years.  But I--maybe I'll write a series of children's books.  I don't see that out there.  It drives me nuts, you know.  There should be a series and there isn't.  It bothers me, cause how you gonna get kids to read and they can't read a good book that looks like them, so that drives me nuts.  Or, you know, maybe I'll teach elementary school, something like that.  I think I'd be good.
Speaker 1: Well, now, I'm not just saying this.  I think you're a good writer from what I read.  I mean these little snippets, there's not a whole lot, you know, but I read is well done.  Have you considered writing--well children's books would be great.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I just want to write a series of young adults--for young adults, girls.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, I could see you doing that.  What would your themes be before I go to the next question?  That just occurred to me.
Speaker 2: What would my what?
Speaker 1: Your themes be for young adults?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know I haven't--it just popped into my mind Saturday night.  So, I don't know what the themes would be, but it'd be--it'd be a series, you know, maybe a detective series or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think the author of the Nancy Drew--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --stories, was a journalist (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It'd be something about everyday life--
Speaker 1: --She was a journalist out of Toledo [Ohio].
Speaker 2: --Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Something out of everyday life in the community?
Speaker 2: In the community, yeah.  And it would be gentle, I mean, I think, that a lot of the books now are just like hard living books and this would be a gentle series.
Story_ID: 39684
Speaker 1: Now, you actually live in the African American community, which is not true with every black person who becomes a professional--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Of status, or who achieves what you have. Is there a reason why?  I mean, it's funny to ask somebody why they're living in the black community.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know 'cause people always say, why don't you live on the North Side?  And I want to say, that is so racist.  I can't believe you.  What is wrong with the South Side [Chicago, Illinois]?  So I have that fight, you know, often, where at the newspaper where they would just say the South Side.  This happened on the South Side.  Well, where on the South Side?  The South Side is huge.  Where did it happen on--I can't stand to watch TV news where they say, murder happened on the South Side.  That tells me nothing, because the South Side is huge, where on the South Side?  My neighborhood is like, it has a suburban setting and nothing ever happens there, but it's still on the South Side.  So I live there because--I moved there because I was making a commitment to black folks.  And so I love my neighborhood, I love the residential areas, but it is getting harder, it is changing, and I can't figure out why.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's been a particular rough couple of years for Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I mean I live in a community called West Chesterfield [Chicago, Illinois].  It's a very tight-knit community.  We have an association, we pay dues, we meet once a month, we clean up the community, we throw Christmas parties, we bought a house and turned it into a community house and we're really committed to saving our community, but we can see changes over the years, more litter.  It was a older community, so people are dying and leaving their homes to their kids and their kids aren't keeping it up and we have renters who, like will barbecue on the front or just do things in the front yard that we would prefer you do in the back yard.  It's just--the tenor is just changing, and we're trying to stop it.
Story_ID: 39685
Speaker 1: That leads to a question we always ask and that is what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I hope that we can stop this shooting.  I just don't know why it's okay for us to kill each other.  I hope that we start to hold our politicians accountable.  I mean, it's like crickets out there.  Stop electing them to office if they're not doing anything, if they're not bettering your life, if you feel like you're living in a tale of two cities and we're living in the bad city, I guarantee.  We're living in the bad city.  We just don't hold our politicians accountable, and we ought to start.
Story_ID: 39686
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there anything major that you would do differently if you could go back and change something?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  I've lived the life I was supposed to live.  And it was an enjoyable life, it was an easy life.  So, I wouldn't do anything differently, but because I'm a journalist, there's a lot of things that I can't do, can't get involved in politics, so the minute I retire, I am gonna join so many organizations.  I can't put like stickers on my car, signs in my window, I'm gonna do all that stuff.  I'm gonna be very political, send money to everybody.  I'm going to make a difference.
Story_ID: 39687
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And what today would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: I tried to be a good mentor to the young kids who came in to do good journalism.  And it was hard for them, it's a hard field, and I'm not sure that it's a comfortable field for everybody.  So I sort of feel a little sad for them that they have to struggle so hard to prove themselves, and they're just as worthy.
Story_ID: 39688
Speaker 1: You said earlier, when we began, when you started at the Tribune [Chicago Tribune], there were more African Americans in key positions than there are today?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So is that what you were alluding to?
Speaker 2: Not key positions.  There haven't been a whole lot in--well, there have been--not in the key, real, decision-making positions, but there have been a lot of mid-range managers, but the real key positions, no.  We have groups who come in to observe page-one meetings and since I've been at the Tribune since 1983, they always say, "There's not a lot of diversity in this meeting."  And there's not, and there should be.
Story_ID: 39689
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you were telling me, before we got started, I was asking you about NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists], things like the Maynard Institute, what value do they have, do you think?
Speaker 2: You know, I went to the Maynard Institute and NABJ, and personally for me, I'm not a good fit for those groups, cause I'm a bit of a rebel, I do what I want to do, I don't kiss up, so I'm not a good fit with those--I'm not a joiner.  Not just those groups, but anything, I'm not a joiner.  I just do it by myself.  This is how Marcia feels, she's going to do it this way.
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean--
Speaker 2: Like I went to the Maynard Institute and they were--and I just was not a good fit, I mean, they just wanted me to--I felt like they wanted me to get along to just get along, and I'm not going to do that.
Speaker 1: --Do you have any, I guess, major critique of what they do or NABJ?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that it probably benefited some people, but I think I've done okay by opening my mouth.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that implies that there's advice from them that you should not open your mouth?
Speaker 2: I sort of thought that, yeah.  Yeah, I sort of got that impression.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I've never been in neither one, so.  I'm listening to you, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I sort of got that impression.  I mean, one example, I remember they said like if I'm at the airport and my boss was there and he needed a ride home, and he lived in the completely opposite direction from me, that I would give him a ride home.  And I'm like, no, he makes enough money, he could take a cab.  You know, I just won't do that.
Speaker 1: So that was advice at the Maynard Institute?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That didn't go over well.  My response didn't go over well.  But I'm like they make a lot of money, yeah.  He can get home.  Yeah, I don't know--it just, yeah.  Sometimes I think it can be window dressing like they'll send you to these programs for minorities and then you go and then nothing ever happens when you return to the work place, I mean, you're still where you are.
Speaker 1: You think maybe a lot of indignation is expressed and that's about it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  They send you to get training, but then nothing ever happens.
Story_ID: 39690
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell us about your family.  You were married, and you don't have any children?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And your husband [Stephen Lythcott] passed, right, about ten years ago?
Speaker 2: No, I think it's twenty years ago, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right, '94 (1994), right.  Well, tell us about him?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was very smart.  He was a lawyer, Labor.  He was a very smart person.
Speaker 1: Labor lawyer?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh.  But he did a lot of civil rights stuff too.  So, he belonged to ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] and he helped--like when he died I remember people saying that he had helped them from--he had saved their house from foreclosure, or he had helped somebody get out of jail or you know he did a lot that I didn't really know about.  So I think he was a thoughtful person, generous person with his time.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Did you not want children or was that a decision not to have them or what?
Speaker 2: We just didn't have them, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: But I have like so many God children.  It's like I'm sick of 'em.  So, I have lots of kids in my life, you know, they're now young adults, yeah, my sister's [Pamela Wilder] son, you know my nephew, so.
Story_ID: 39691
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, well the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I have to tell you that I'm a very realistic person.  And I think that I am this little bitty tiny spot on this earth, and I just like kept the wheels going, but I really don't think I'm going to be remembered.  I'm going to be remembered by my friends and family and that's most important to me.  I don't think like that, sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's nothing to be sorry about.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: All right.
