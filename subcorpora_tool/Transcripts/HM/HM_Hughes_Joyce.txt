Speaker 1: I am Joyce Anne Hughes.  Joyce is J-O-Y-C-E, and Anne is spelled with an E so it's A-N-N-E, and Hughes is like Howard Hughes without his money, H-U-G-H-E-S, and actually I was born in Gadsden, Alabama, February 7, 1940.
Speaker 2: Now also I need to have you state today's date. The date today is--
Speaker 1: The 30th.  Okay.  Today is August 30--no, 2001.  August 30, 2001.
Speaker 2: And we're at the offices--or the offices of the HistoryMakers.
Speaker 1: We're at the offices of the HistoryMakers, 1900 South Michigan [Avenue] in Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 2: And can you give your profession?
Speaker 1: I'm a law professor, lawyer by training but a professor.

Speaker 1: I'd like to know what your favorite food is.
Speaker 2: That is a question I really can't answer, and I'll tell you why.  After having had three strokes, I now eat very bland food, and I don't eat a lot of variety because I need to watch my diet so I just eat because I have to eat so I really--none of it's really favorite, I guess.  Well, okay, salmon.  I mean, of the dishes that I have to eat, salmon is probably it.
Speaker 1: Did you like salmon before you were on a restricted diet?
Speaker 2: I didn't eat it much. So yeah, I mean now it's something I may have for dinner once a week.
Speaker 1: Yeah, can I have you--can I have your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Do you mean a favorite color to wear, or a favorite color to look at?
Speaker 1: Whatever.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, I like yellow, but my sister [Toni Hughes], my deceased sister, was very glamorous, and she did my colors, which is to tell you what you should wear, and yellow is not a color I should wear, but as far as a color I like, it's yellow.
Speaker 1: And your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Fall.  I always have loved fall.
Speaker 1: We're right into that. Your favorite vacation destination.
Speaker 2: I really don't have one, partly because I'm really not a person that takes vacations so I couldn't even say.
Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Oh, I say "interesting" all the time, primarily because I think it is noncommittal, but my family just goes up the wall because I use it so often so "interesting" is the one I use all the time.
Speaker 1: That's interesting, but why would--that's interesting--why is that noncommittal to you?
Speaker 2: Because if someone tells you about something, if you would say that's fantastic, that's wonderful, that communicates what you believe about it or you could say that's horrible.  If you say it's interesting, it could be either one of those.  It's just something--"interesting" is it captures your interest.  It's something that holds your attention, but you're not saying whether its holds your attention where you're gonna have a smile on your face or where you're gonna have a frown on your face so that's why I say interesting is noncommittal.
Story_ID: 8615
Speaker 1: I'd like you to talk about your father.  Give his name.  Then you tell us what he--what kind of person he was and what you know about his background.
Speaker 2: Well, my father was Solomon Hughes Senior, and I think the most important thing to me is my father was a professional golfer back in the days when blacks could not be members of the PGA [Professional Golfers Association].  Consequently, he played on what was then called the Chitlin Circuit, but they used the term Chitlin Circuit for every venue where blacks only played, whether it's entertainment or what, so he played with the UGA.  It was called United Golf Association, but the most significant thing to me is that my father made the decision to leave Alabama where he worked at a country club, where he could play golf year round, and travel straight north to Minnesota, where it was cold and he couldn't play golf year round, in order to give his children opportunities, and so that's always stuck with me, and when my father was dying, he said he had no regrets because he had seen his children vindicate his trip to Minnesota.  Now there are two of us who were born in Alabama, and two more children were born in Minnesota.  My father was a man of few words, but a person who--I don't even like that phrase do the right thing.  What do I wanna use?  I wanna use a phrase like he was a person of substance, I guess would, you know--but I thought of my mother and father very much as a team.  I mean he was the kind of a man who did what he had to do to provide for his children, and he was a man who did not have a lot of education, but he was very wise in the world and, you know, prompted his kids and was happy when my mother went back and got her degree and told her she needed to go on for her master's and stuff.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Did he--since he was a man of few words, did he talk a lot or at all about his growing up?  'Cause he was from Gadsden [Alabama], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was from Gadsden.  No.  Not at all.  The only time I recall is when my brother [Solomon Hughes, Jr.] was a youngster, and he had got all this new football equipment, I mean just everything--the shoulder pads, the shoes and this, and my brother was a speed skater.  He had specially made skates and all that, and so my brother asked my dad about--"Well, did you have this stuff when you were little," and my dad sort of looked at him and said, "Well, of course not." I mean, and then obviously I look back at his growing up and realize--I mean it was a totally different kind of situation so no he didn't, but he never ever talked about his family.
Speaker 1: How about his family?  Did you grow up around his family?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't.
Speaker 1: No you didn't.
Speaker 2: No.  The only--his brother, though.  After his brother got out of the service--his brother was drafted during World War II in Alabama.  When the war was over, his brother did not want to go back to Alabama, and he came to Minnesota and lived with us so yes, I grew up with his brother in the house as well so there was my father and his brother, but they were two very different people.
Speaker 1: So you didn't know your grandparents. Did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: None, none.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's 'cause you knew okay, I was--how did you know dates and everything?
Speaker 2: Oh because I went--I went to the trouble to find out about it. And I made for the family a history that gave all these dates.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I was impressed--we don't get that very often.
Speaker 2: Well, see, I also tried to go back as far as possible, and you know what's interesting is you see there is no birth certificate or death certificate of my father's father, my grandfather, and at first I thought it was totally because the state of Alabama didn't care about African Americans and so had never recorded it.  Most of this information came out of the family Bibles, but I wrote to the Records of Vital Statistics in Alabama to try to get information, and there were no records.  However, someone searched the U.S. Census for 1910 and gave me the page where my father's family is listed, and in 1910 my father was two years old so he was listed with his parents and his parents' parents, and so the only--that was the first time I saw a name and where they were from, but that's as far back as we can go.  We can go back a little bit further with my mother's [Bessie Mae Hughes] parents, but actually my mother's mother died before she even got married so I never knew my grandparents.
Story_ID: 8616
Speaker 1: Let's go to your mother and her parents and what you know about--what you know about her.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, my mother [Bessie Mae Hughes] is eighty-nine years old.  She'll be ninety soon, and she's still alive, and she was called the little tiger.  My mother is under five feet.  Now she has osteoporosis, but she was always small so she's been--right now she's under five feet, but Mother doesn't take any stuff from anybody, believes that you should always stand up for your rights, and so I think I acquired from my parents what I call roots and wings.  Someone said that the only lasting bequest parents give to their children are roots and wings.  From my father I got the wings because, for example, when I went to Yugoslavia, he flew from Minneapolis [Minnesota] to Chicago [Illinois] to meet me and to wave me off the plane when I went to Yugoslavia, and so he was glad to see me go try that.  Mother, on the other hand, provided the roots for this family, and we were to always stick together as a family because actually, when you think about it, it was just them up in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  We were this little tiny nuclear family, and all the relatives were back in Alabama so that we came here with no relatives.  We were just up there, but Mother's a feisty person and does not allow anybody, as she calls it, to walk over her.  She went back to college and got her B.A. degree at age fifty-nine because she had been a teacher in Alabama when you could teach with virtually no formal training beyond high school, although she had two years of college in Alabama, came to Minnesota, and was a stay-at-home mom until her kids were almost all grown, and then went back to college and finished her degree, and got her degree at age eighty-nine [sic] so I think that kind of tells you what kind of person she is, that--just a very strong-willed, determined--and even now today, she wants her children to do things just so.  You've got to look just right, and if I come and visit her and she'll say, "That's not a good color for you.  Don't wear that color," or "I don't like that color lipstick.  You've gotta change the color of the lipstick," or "Your hair is a little too short.  It's gotta be a little bit longer," so she wants everything just so for her children.
Speaker 1: I see that parents never change.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did she share with you any of her growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, but what I got from that is that she resented the fact that she grew up in a black community that didn't have things.  For example, she would talk about when electricity was available, they did not put it in the black community, and so for many years they didn't have any electricity, and she said when they finally got electricity, that they sat around and looked at the lights as their entertainment.  It was just a marvel to see these lights on.  She also talked about the fact that there was not a black school for high school in Rosedale, Alabama, which is where she grew up, and she had to move to Birmingham [Alabama] and live with a friend of her mother's in order to go to high school so she always ranted and raved about any kind of detrimental things to black people.  What I remember most about her, and I think it actually says a lot about me, is in the second grade--now what's so stupid about this is that people oftentimes talk about, oh, I remember being a child in the cradle, and I remember this when I was real young.  I have no recollection of very many things when I was little, but this I do.  I always liked school, but at one point I decided I wasn't gonna go to school.  I was sick, and I kept playing telling my mother, "I'm sick, I can't go," I can't this, and finally my older sister told her "Well, Mother, you know what happened to her," because she was a person who would tell things, and Toni said "Mother, a teacher hit her over the head with a ruler."  Once my mother found that out, she got me out of bed the next morning and said, "Get dressed.  We're going to school."  We went to school.  She marched me up to my classroom, went in and told me, "Now you go in that desk, and you sit down and take your seat."  She called the teacher out and said, "You find somebody else to take care of these kids 'cause you and I are going to the principal's office."  Now obviously I was not there, but what I got from that is that my mother would always stand up for me, and what she suggested is that nobody was to hit her kids over the head and even more so because the reason that I got hit over the head was I couldn't sing the scales.  Now I still can't carry a tune.  I don't, and Mother took that as them deciding that all black people gotta have rhythm, and, you know, she had a child that couldn't sing a tune, couldn't sing the scales, and I guess remembering that from second grade is--and I think all children need to know that there is an adult who will stand up for you, and that has stayed with me all these years, and Mother will always stand up for her children.
Story_ID: 8617
Speaker 1: Now do you know how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Well, that's an interesting story.  Not exactly, but what I do know about it is that my mother [Bessie Mae Hughes] was a schoolteacher in Gadsden, Alabama, and in those years schoolteachers couldn't date.  I mean, they really couldn't go out and be--I remember that Mother was very upset because my father [Solomon Hughes, Sr.] had won some golf tournament, and he was kind of the talk of Gadsden [Alabama], and there was this big party, and he asked her to go, and she couldn't go, and she was just, you know, very upset about the fact that he went to this party and that she couldn't go to the party, but I believe they met because she played the piano, and she was playing some song someplace, and he came over to her and asked her about the name of the song and asked about the sheet music for it, and somehow he got her the sheet music, and after that they were together, but they got married on--at the time when, as she said, he still called her Miss Cunningham then and that he went to her father's house to ask for her hand, you know, and said "Well, Miss Cunningham and I would like to get married."  It really was those old, older days, right.
Story_ID: 8618
Speaker 1: Now do you know how your father [Solomon Hughes, Sr.] got involved with golf? I mean even though he--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what was fascinating? I mean it's--it seems now the game is so popular, but I mean--.
Speaker 2: Yes. Well, he actually was working at the Gadsden [Alabama] Country Club caddying and doing all that and apparently--now I don't really know what year this was, but there was a white guy who had won the Southwestern PGA [Professional Golf Association] several years, and apparently he recognized the natural talent my father had, and he encouraged him, and there was a day where the caddies could play on the country club course.  I think it was on Monday nights they could play there so he started playing golf when he was working there, but my dad started working there very young, you know, because his father died when he was like eight or ten years old, yeah, and so he started working to take care of the family, and the one thing I remember about that is that my mother remembers how he and his brother--that is who was my uncle and the person who lived with us--how they took care of their mother, and she was talking about how they always made sure that their mother was okay, and she remembered that very, very specifically.
Speaker 1: So do you think--you think he just--he had a natural talent, you don't know what attracted him to the game?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 8619
Speaker 1: Let's go--I just want to have the names of your siblings in order.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And where you fit in.
Speaker 2: The first-born child was Amelia Antoinette, whom we call Toni, and Toni was born September 1938, and she just died October 30, 2000, and I was the second-born child, and both Toni and I were born in Gadsden, Alabama.  Then my parents went to Minnesota when I was about three, and my younger sister who is actually six years younger than I was born in Minnesota.  That's Shirley Jean Hughes, and then my brother was also born in Minnesota.  He's twelve years younger than I, and he is Solomon Hughes Junior, known as Soli S-O-L-I.  Now you should know that all three of the girls were married at one point, but all of us had our maiden name restored legally when we got divorced so we are all Hugheses.
Speaker 1: Now that's cute--it was like get the man out!
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I was the one who started it.
Speaker 1: You did?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, because I wasn't married that long.  I was only married for about four years and also married to someone who's name was fairly common, but so I--you know, when I got divorced, I wanted my maiden name restored, and then my older sister was married for many, many years, and when she got divorced, she said she was gonna do that, and I reminded her well, but you have two children, you know, and their name is different, and I'm not sure that you'd wanna do it.  She said "Oh, no, I'm still gonna do it," and her children, you know, never had a problem with it, and then my younger sister also was married about fifteen years, but she decided to resume her maiden name, and I guess because I started them all.
Story_ID: 8620
Speaker 1: You don't have any memories before three--you don't have memories of Gadsden [Alabama].
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: So you don't even remember arriving in Minneapolis [Minnesota].
Speaker 2: No.  That's what I found fascinating.  The only memory I have is when my mother [Bessie Mae Hughes] marched me up to Greeley Elementary School, and one other memory from a child, and that's when my sister Shirley [Hughes] was born.  I remember running down the hill to get home because the new--my mother and the new baby were coming home, but beyond that, I really don't have recollections from childhood.
Speaker 1: Tell me though, what was family life like?
Speaker 2: Well--.
Speaker 1: Because it's really--there were three girls for a long time.
Speaker 2: Yes, right. Actually Mother saw it more as if there were three families or two families.  In one sense there's two because there were the Alabama-born and the Minnesota-born.  In another it was three because it was the Alabama-born girls, the Minnesota-born one girl, and then the boy, and so they were all different.  What was very clear, it was very structured, and my mother--when I look back on it now, I think she was a taskmaster, but in growing up I never felt deprived.  I mean, you know, I had hours, and there were things you had to do.  We always ate together as a family, and you know--well, Mother always set the table, and we always ate together.  In fact, when I was little, people said "Well, you're being so formal."  I never thought of it as being formal because that's the way we always ate.  There was no--my mother said I'm not running a hotel so we don't run in and out and just catch something on the run and go.  Then because Mother was a stay-at-home mom, she was active in the PTA [Parent Teacher Association] and active in our education throughout.  I actually don't have recollection of childhood other than--but I was always a very serious person, and so I suspect that when people say oh, I remember playing and whatever, what I remember from childhood is also partly what I was told, and what I was told is that you were always with your nose in a book so I mean I probably was, but I don't remember that.  I also don't remember from childhood, because this was before TV, that on Sundays we sat around the dining room table and listened to the radio, and it was 'The Lone Ranger' and 'The Shadow'.  That was our entertainment before TV came, and then I guess it was what--the late '50s [1950s] when TV came to being, but we also didn't sit and watch TV all the time as kids do now, I guess.  I don't know whether it was because we there wasn't anything on or we couldn't watch it, but I just don't remember watching TV a lot when I was a kid.
Story_ID: 8621
Speaker 1: What got them there?
Speaker 2: Oh,why did they go to Minnesota?  Well, that's a very interesting story.  Now I just found out about it myself because someone was writing a little story about my father [Solomon Hughes, Sr.] as a professional golfer.  They actually ended up in Minnesota because my father knew he was going to leave Alabama, and he went to various places and looked around, but he had a friend who was in Minnesota, and the friend told him "Well, Minnesota is a liberal state.  You can come up to Minnesota, and I'm sure you can be a pro at one of the country clubs or at one of the city golf courses."  Well, you know, when my dad got there, my mother [Bessie Mae Hughes] said yeah, they could play in the public course, but they couldn't even go in to get a drink of water in the clubhouse so things were not what they thought they were gonna be, what my dad thought they were gonna be in Minnesota, but nonetheless it was partly that.  In addition, someone told him, and this is when I was three years old, but someone told him when he said he wanted to go to a place where his kids could go play in the public parks and could have all the advantages that there were to other kids, someone told him that the University of Minnesota [Minneapolis, Minnesota] had a fine university where state residents could go to, and so he went to Minnesota, and actually I always felt that my father was vindicated because I am the only one who actually got one of my degrees from the University of Minnesota 'cause I finally went there for law school, but you know, all of us went to other colleges, but nonetheless it was partly that.  You know I'm three years old, and he's thinking about what kind of education his kids might have, and I think that partly brought them to Minnesota, but it was a big leap because we also did never went back to Alabama for family reunions, from what I understand people talking about these family reunions.  We never did any of that.  We talked on the phone sometimes to relatives, and I remember my father's sister would always say put those kids on the phone with her southern accent.  I wanna hear them talk, and of course, we were not aware that we were talking quote northern to her, but she wanted to hear these kids with this way of talking.  Now one little digression.  Last night was the orientation dinner at Northwestern [University] Law School [Chicago, Illinois], and I sat next to a young man, and he said to me yes ma'am, no ma'am, and I turned to him and I said "Where are you from?"  It turns out he was from Virginia, and I said "Well, you know, when I was growing up, my mother was very clear about you had to address older people yes ma'am, no ma'am or yes sir, no sir", because that wasn't that the kind of modality in Minnesota.  I mean, you know people say "Yeah" and "Huh", and she would not allow us to do that so when this young man said that to me, it just triggered in me a memory of my mother training us as to how we were address people.
Story_ID: 8622
Speaker 1: I remember in law school [University of Minnesota Law School, Minneapolis, Minnesota] I had a friend who was from New York.  He was Jewish, and I said, "Well you know, I live in the black community," and I took him home with me once, and he laughed, and he said--oh, I think I said "I live in what some people might consider a ghetto," and he said "No, no, no.  You don't know what a ghetto is." Because first of all in Minnesota it was mostly single-family homes, and what was quote the black community really had a great deal of white people.  As I grew up in Minnesota, the black population of the entire state was probably less than 1 percent, and when I went to elementary school, for example, my mother [Bessie Mae Hughes] could see the playground of the school out of her back kitchen window, and she said I could always tell when my two girls were out playing at recess because they were the only two black spots on that playground. So when I'm growing up, the neighborhood would be quote a black community but not like you'd consider elsewhere.  Even now, you know, where my mother still lives in the same area, I mean on her block I would suspect that 50 percent of the people on her block are Caucasian so it's a different kind of black community, but what I felt was great about it was this.  Because of the size--and it was both Minneapolis, St. Paul [Minnesota], and those are the Twin Cities--because of the size, the kind of rigid pecking order that I discovered in large cities or cities with large black populations didn't exist. So if you were the bus driver, you would be at the same kind of events where the doctor or the lawyer went and so there was not this kind of a pecking order that I discovered existed in places that were huge, and I like that.
Story_ID: 8623
Speaker 1: You said you were a reader and a serious, you know, well-behaved person.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What else was--made up--sort of the young Joyce Hughes? I mean, were you introspective? Were you--.
Speaker 2: I was introspective.  I suppose all people just have some natural attributes, but it may be, and I've thought about this in thinking about my sister.  My sister and I were dressed as twins when we were little girls and treated as twins because there was very little difference in our ages, and when we were very young, we did look quite alike.  Now you need to know that she was still a size six when she died, and I haven't seen size six for a long time, and she would never let her hair be gray so there was clearly as we got older a lot of changes, but Toni [Hughes] was very gregarious and bubbly and outgoing, and I guess a good story is my mother [Bessie Mae Hughes] insisted that we always do things together, and so when we were teenagers and could go to house parties, we could go together, but I remember once specifically.  It was in the summer because we could still be out on the porch, and we got to the house party, and there was a porch with a swing, and Toni said to me, "Now you sit on the swing and don't move", and so I could not go inside where the party was going on because she considered me kind of a stick in the mud, and what's even more unusual, I sat there on the swing throughout the whole party.  I mean I didn't know what was going on 'cause she was the one who had all the friends, and also in those years we frequently, though, had what they were called jumps.  A house party in those years were called jumps.  My mother allowed Toni to give jumps because her theory was if the jump was at our house, her daughters didn't have to ever leave home so--and she could supervise. But at one point, I decided well, if Toni is always giving jumps, I should give a jump, but when it came time for the guest list, the only people I had to invite were, in fact, Toni's friends.
Story_ID: 8624
Speaker 1: What was influencing you though? Was--were books mainly influencing you? Or was it church, was it someone in the community, or your parents?
Speaker 2: I'm sure it was my mother [Bessie Mae Hughes] when I was younger, and then I'll tell you what probably influenced me to go to law school.  I recall very specifically that my mother taught during Black History--at that time it was month, not a week, Black History Month--or Black History Week, I guess. It's a month now. But she was appalled  that the schools, of course, in Minnesota didn't know anything about Black History Week, didn't know anything about the history of the black soul. So back in those days they had these old mimeograph things.  They looked like purple jelly, and Mother would burn off these things on purple jelly, and when Toni [Hughes] and I would come home from school, she'd sit us down and teach class again so the schoolteacher in her was still teaching, and she made sure that we knew about the history of our own people, and I think that, you know, probably helped spur me on.  As far as going to--well, we didn't get going to college.  I don't know.  I think probably indirectly it was just--my mother always made it clear that she expected her daughters to go to college.
Story_ID: 8625
Speaker 1: So you were really a very nuclear family.
Speaker 2: Very.
Speaker 1: Okay, very.
Speaker 2: A little tiny nuclear family.  I mean, yeah.  That's it, and my mother [Bessie Mae Hughes] was not a person who socialized a lot, you know, didn't have people coming out to her house.  No.  Her whole focus were her children.
Speaker 1: Now tell me the schools you went to--elementary and, you know--.
Speaker 2: Well, I went--when we started out, when we first came to Minnesota, I went to Greeley Elementary school, and then I got skipped a grade, and I think the skipping of the grade probably came just a year before we--I then went to Warrington Elementary School and from Warrington to Bryant Junior High School, and then to Central High School.  Now I suspect that none of these schools exist now.  I know Central doesn't exist anymore.  My junior high school doesn't exist anymore, and I'm sure that Warrington Elementary school is not there either 'cause it was right next door to Bryant.  As a matter of fact, now that I think about it, no, it is not there.  I can remember not seeing it there so these schools don't even exist any more in Minneapolis [Minnesota], but that's where I went, and when I went to school--when Toni [Hughes] and I went to school, this is before they had built the freeway.  Like many other communities, the decision about where the placement of the community cuts off what was an integrated community and made it more a black community, and the schools, therefore, changed also so that when my younger sister and brother came along, there were obviously a lot more black kids in the schools and some black teachers, and the community probably became more black, but I--when I say that, you have to look at in the context again in Minnesota because a black community doesn't mean that that entire block 'cause one block even is gonna be all black.  That just doesn't exist, you know, in Minnesota.
Story_ID: 8626
Speaker 1: Where you aware of 'Brown v. Board of Education' and such thing?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Because you were fourteen at that point.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I mean, as a child, we always read 'Ebony' magazine.  Oh, yeah, and so 'Ebony', you know, always kept you up with what was going on, and back then it always would tell you about significant people, and so I mean I read about Constance Baker Motley, and people like that were heroes and heroines.  You read all about that kind of stuff, and I think my mother [Bessie Mae Hughes] also trained us very much.  She said you don't you let anybody walk all over you.  You demand your rights, and probably one of my first jobs was with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] so I mean I think I was probably aware of all that.  Now I'm not sure that it had anything to do with my going to college.  I have to think back about college, but I know clearly law school that 'Brown' and Constance Baker Motley and what Thurgood Marshall had done, you know, were in the back of my head as I went to law school.  College, on the other hand, I think what happened, I was in a college prep English course in high school, and that teacher talked to me about Carleton College [Northfield, Minnesota] because that's where she had gone, but actually the reason I probably ended up going to Carleton College had more to do with something that was called NSSFNS.  What NSSFNS was was National Scholarship Service and Fund For Negro Students, and what they did was to take promising Negroes--we were Negroes then--take promising Negro kids and consider the various colleges where they ought to go.  Well, NSSFNS suggested that I should go to Radcliffe [College, Cambridge, Massachusetts] so they sent someone from Radcliffe out to interview me, and I remember at the time--this really sticks with me.  This woman, this blonde woman with long hair tossing her hair around, and her whole attitude so infuriated me that the idea that I would go to a place like Radcliffe so turned me off that I think that maybe why I ended up going to Carleton rather than going to some of the East Coast schools that they thought I should go to, but I'm not even sure.  I guess from all I can remember is that it was just clear that I go to college.  I'm not sure that anything specific was said.  Now what was different, though, was after finishing college, when I decided I wanted to go to law school, now that kind of threw both my parents for a loop 'cause that's not something they were pushing me toward.  It was--you know, my mother was--oh, great that you finished college, and see, as a matter of fact, my older sister [Toni Hughes] had dropped out of college and had gotten married, and so her daughter actually was--there was only twenty years difference between them so as it turned out, I actually graduated from--I was the first of their children to graduate from college 'cause I graduated before my older sister so after college and I spent a year in Spain on a Fulbright [scholarship], law school was not within their scope, but college apparently always was 'cause I don't have any specific recollection of you will go to college.  It was just like, you know, it was known that you were gonna go.

Speaker 1: I'm just wondering if you could describe you know, what sounds and smells you associate--.
Speaker 2: I can't associate any sounds--well, unless you're talking about music because--
Speaker 1: Any, 'cause--.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You have to remember that I grew up in a time--this was right before, you know, Elvis [Presley] came to be, and what was interesting is people didn't realize that there were all these black musicians that were playing the same songs that Elvis took and made famous so I do remember very specifically 'Lawdy Miss Clawdy'.  Now let me tell you about this record Lawdy Miss Clawdy.  These were back when there were little 45 [rpm] singles, and I can't even remember the lyrics of 'Lawdy Miss Clawdy', but my mother [Bessie Mae Hughes] said those were lyrics we were not to listen to, and we had 45s and we had 78s.  My mother took a 78 record, put it in the oven, melted it, and then made it into a vase.  I never--have you ever--I mean, you take those records, and you can mold them, and she molded it into a vase like you will not play that record in this house, but the songs I remember is like I remember 'Lawdy Miss Clawdy' specifically because Mother said it had some lyrics that we were not to listen to, and to this day I don't know what they were because you couldn't tell what the lyrics were in that music in those days, but when Elvis became popular and started singing all these songs, I'd already heard all these songs because these were the songs that the black groups were singing, and Elvis just took them, and he became popular because people didn't particularly want anybody to follow the black groups.  The Coasters, the Platters and the--you know, were all very important when I was growing up.  As far as smells, fried chicken on Sunday.
Story_ID: 8628
Speaker 1: Was there any teacher in high school that influenced you at all? Or, I mean--you said that the one--.
Speaker 2: Just the one.
Speaker 1: The one that went to Carleton [College, Northfield, Minnesota].
Speaker 2: Right.  The one that went to Carleton.  Well, I think in a negative way my homeroom teacher influenced me.  I wanted to take shop because actually I scored very high on an aptitude test for mechanical, and I recall that they came and told me there was something wrong with my test, and I said "Well, what's wrong with it? " What was wrong with it, they said, is somehow it clearly had to have been scored erroneously because girls were not supposed to score high on mechanical.  In addition, the homeroom teacher taught shop.  I wanted to take shop, and he said "Oh no, girls cannot take shop."  Girls had to take home economics, and so probably as a teenager and being forced into things and not allowing--not being allowed to do what I thought I had a talent for in a negative way probably influenced me, and in a--in fact, a lot of it was negative.  When I went to college, I had a whole different attitude about what it was I intended to be.  Shall I tell you about that?  Okay.  I wanted to major in government and international relations, and I, not knowing anything, decided I wanted to be an ambassador.  One of the great things about this college is that they would bring forward people in various occupations to talk to students, and so someone from the State Department came and talked about things, and I raised my hand and asked them questions, and the response was kind of like--it was so obvious.  Well, of course, the United States would not send a black woman to represent it because I'm also - remember when I went to this college, I was the only black woman, black person on campus, and so they didn't even expect me to be there, and so it was like--oh, that's kind of what I thought I could do.  In addition, the head of the department of government and international relations would not allow women to major except with his permission, and a senior woman told me that she had gotten his permission, but it was just awful and don't even try to buck the system of majoring.  When you think about it now, you think that the college was complicit in that also by allowing a professor to require women to have to pass his litmus test before women--because it was just for women, but at any rate--I kind of forgotten what I started on.  I think the negative motivation--because getting upset about not being able to take shop, the not being able to do what I wanted to do in college, probably helped spur me on as a--you know, you're not gonna--you're gonna close one door.  Well, I'm gonna find another door.
Speaker 1: Now did you--when you go to Carleton, had you been to visit before?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So you go sight unseen.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: How far is it from--?
Speaker 2: It's about forty to sixty miles from Minneapolis [Minnesota], but here's how I got to Carleton also.  NSSFNS [National Scholarship Service and Fund for Negro Students] had this list of schools.  Most of the schools were out in the East Coast.  The only school that it had in the Midwest for me was Carleton, and 'cause Carleton is in northern Minnesota, and, you know, at one time Carleton had the reputation of being the Harvard of the Midwest or whatever so another very marvelous thing happened, though.  After I had been admitted to Carleton, I went to some gathering and there met a black man who said he was a student at Carleton, and I was so dumbfounded, and he therefore told me a lot about Carleton.  This was the second black person to graduate from that college.  He was from St. Paul [Minnesota], and he told me various things.  Now one of the things that he helped  to tell me which was very interesting, obviously I had scholarships, but I also had to work, and they'd give you your work assignments, and when I first got my work assignments, it was to be a waitress, and I wrote back and said oh, no, I will not be a waitress, I mean, because part of my mother's [Bessie Mae Hughes] thing is that, you know, you will not go to this school as an African American woman and wait on these white students, and so I said no, I will not be a waitress, and they kept trying to tell me that that's a coveted job because you--for an hour, you don't really work an hour.  Whenever the meal's over, it's over whereas if you have a job in the library, for example, which I said I wanted, you work that entire hour.  Well, this student also helped me to understand what being a waiter or waitress was, and the other thing I liked about the college is you--during those years, you couldn't have any cars.  Nobody knew who was wealthy and who was not on that campus so that was great.
Speaker 1: Now how does this experience form you, in many ways?
Speaker 2: Because you've existed out of a nucleus environment--I mean you have existed in a nucleus environment, and you're thrown into this environment. And I consider college very much an acculturation process. And this is still--this is like 19--?
Speaker 1: I went to college in 1957, September 1957.  No, I think my growing up was very good in the sense that it helped me to survive by relying upon myself.  I mean, I didn't need a whole lot of people around me, and I do know that I did call my mother, though, the first year and said, "Mother, I can't stay at this college.  I wanna go to Howard [University, Washington, D.C]." And my mother said "But if you leave, they'll think that you did not have the intellectual capacity to make it."  So I stayed and I excelled so it's partly, you know, you have to do it to quote show people, but more importantly I think this kind of nuclear family situation has helped me to look internally for my guidepost, and so even now, even at this stage in my life I'm in an environment where there are not people around who are like me so I have to rely upon myself.
Speaker 2: Now you had--so you go there to study government--was it government and international relations?
Speaker 1: That's what I wanted to do, major in, right.
Speaker 2: Right. But you had this professor who was like, that's not exactly what you should be doing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So are you redirected at that time?
Speaker 1: Well, no one redirected me and actually because I was just a freshman, and one of the things about that college, you don't have to declare your major until you're a junior so--but at that point I realized that what I planned to major in, 'cause I am what my younger sister calls a long forward planner, I'd already thought about it.  I decided I'd have to find something else, and so then I decided that I'd either do--that I'd probably be an English major, but once I found that the requirements to be an English major as opposed to being a Spanish major, I chose to be a Spanish major because being a Spanish major was essentially the same thing.  It was a literature major but in another language, and the requirements were less, and therefore you could take a broader range of things outside your major which is why I chose to be a Spanish major.
Speaker 2: Now were you fascinated at all with Spanish culture, or that was just--.
Speaker 1: I don't think it was Spanish culture per se, but when I look back on it now, and I did spend a year abroad after college on the Fulbright [scholarship] in Spain, I think it was the idea of searching for something that was different than the norm in the United States.
Speaker 2: Now you go--so you do very well. You do very well at Carleton.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 8629
Speaker 1: Explain how the Fulbright [scholarship] came about.
Speaker 2: Well, I actually don't know.  I mean, I just applied for it, and what was great about it in retrospect, but also kind of fascinating, I applied for the Fulbright as well as for another program which is called the Smith-Mundt Act which was not as well known, but it provided the same kind of scholarships if you wanted to go to Latin America, and I applied to go to Venezuela, and I received the Smith-Mundt Act Scholarship to go to Venezuela, but I also received the Fulbright to go to Spain, and people said "Well, how come you ended up going to Spain?"  Oddly enough, it was because Spain was ruled by a dictator.  Now if you think about it, if you're an American student, it's actually safer for you to be in a country that's ruled by a dictator than to go to a place like Venezuela that was having coups and uproars and revolutions every other week it seemed. So the idea was go to Spain, and actually in Spain the Guardia Civil was on almost every corner, and probably--I mean, for my one year there, then they didn't bother me.
Speaker 1: Now how did that experince change your life in some respects? You know, traveling, this is once again, you know--.
Speaker 2: I think it helped me get in touch with the idea that there is more to life than, you know, getting an A on something.  My recollection that still stays with me from Spain was the first time that I was there, and they eat dinner late there, and that after dinner the idea was everybody goes on a walk.  Well, the 'paseo', I think, as they call it--I wanted to walk so fast, and I couldn't do it.  I mean literally I could not walk fast because the streets were full of people, but they were strolling, and all of a sudden it hit me that my entire American rush, rush, rush orientation was like to move fast from A to B, but when you go out to just stroll after dinner, you're not going anyplace. You're just strolling and relaxing and meeting people, and that stuck with me.  The other thing I liked about Spain, but I think that's also part of what growing up not in a super-wealthy environment is that people used everything there.  I mean they even mended nylons.  I mean I was just so amazed to go to a place where you would take--if a nylon had a run in it, you'd take it to a place where they would mend it so that was interesting, but, of course, you know, I'm from a age and from an environment where you never threw away anything that's useful so--but I also noticed that was not just something that a black family would do, that this was a cultural thing, and I learned that in Spain.
Story_ID: 8630
Speaker 1: What makes you decide to go to law school? What--I mean what--you said that you had, you know, before--.
Speaker 2: Again I think it was anger.  The anger was this.  At Carleton [College, Northfield, Minnesota] in those years, and I don't think they do this anymore, but in those years recruiters would come to Carleton and interview you about the various things you were interested in, and so I had mentioned to the dean of students--well, first of all, every graduating senior has an interview with the dean of students, and the dean of students wants to know anything you've ever thought about being, including anything you've ever played at, and I remember in the conversation, and this was a woman also.  In the conversation with her I said "Oh, well, once I thought about being a lawyer," and she said "Yes, but you haven't signed up to talk to any law schools that come here." And I said "Yes, but you didn't ask me whether I wanted to do it now.  You asked me what I ever played at and thought about as a child."  She sent me a note, though, thereafter and said the recruiter from Columbia Law School [New York, New York] is coming, and she had made an appointment for me to meet that recruiter and be there.  I remember it said be there so I showed up.  When I went into this interview with this man, he so incensed me that I decided I was going to law school because the one thing he told me was that well, it'd be unlikely that they would admit me to law school because I was a woman, and yet I was graduating Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude so I mean it wasn't a question of my having the credentials, and I was like "I don't understand why you would not admit me 'cause I'm a woman."  "Well, you'll just get married and have babies," and I said "No, no, no.  You don't seem to understand.  That is not my mission in life, and that is not a decision that you ought to make."  He says "Well, we might consider it," and I said "What about financial aid?"  He says "Oh, we certainly wouldn't spend our money on you." And I remember that that made an impact on me because, of course, I didn't have the resources to pay for law school myself without some assistance, but at the same time the University of Minnesota [Law School, Minneapolis, Minnesota] had developed the Carleton Scholarship at the University of Minnesota Law School because they were at the point of trying to encourage Carleton students to come to that law school, and I received the Carleton Scholarship for the University of Minnesota Law School, and more importantly once I got the Fulbright [scholarship] thereafter, they told me go take the Fulbright and come to law school after your year in Spain so they--once I got that kind of encouragement from them, I said oh, great.  That's just what I'll do.
Speaker 1: Now--.
Speaker 2: Now I'll tell you one other thing about why I stayed in law school because after the first year in law school, I thought oh, I don't think I really wanna do this so I went from Minneapolis to Chicago [Illinois] to interview with the president of United Airlines to determine whether or not I could be a stewardess, and I will never forget that interview because this man--first of all, it was rather strange to me that to decide whether or not you're gonna be a stewardess, you interview with the president of the airline? And then the man basically communicated he had to determine whether or not I was smart enough to be a stewardess, but I remember thinking to myself I have just completed the first year of law school, and this man is trying to decide whether or not I have the smarts to be a stewardess?  Well, they were trying to decide who was gonna be their first black stewardess.  Remember in those years they didn't have any black stewardesses so for them it was a big issue, but for me that was a great interview because I was like no, no, no, I'm going back to law school.  I mean if this guy thinks I can't be a stewardess--I'm not smart enough to be a stewardess, I'm going back to law school.
Speaker 1: Now I have--I wanted to ask you a question though about your parents and your decision to go because I detected earlier that they were--that was a surprise thing.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And that there may have been some discussion about why you were doing it. Is that not correct? Or they--.
Speaker 2: There wasn't any discussion.  I think I just came and announced that's what I was going to do, and they both were like.
Speaker 1: Had you been admitted by that time?
Speaker 2: I think I might have been.  What actually--what I had really initially thought I was gonna do was to go to graduate school and get a master's degree in library science and be a librarian.  Oh, yeah, that's what was on my agenda until this issue came up that about law school and I got the Carleton Scholarship to the University of Minnesota Law School.  Yes, and I remember telling my parents I've decided I'm going to law school, and then the Fulbright came almost thereafter, and that's when I had to communicate with the law school, and I said well, I'm going to do the Fulbright, and then I'm gonna come back and go to law school, and I remember my mother [Bessie Mae Hughes] just said "Well, we thought your getting the B.A. degree was just--didn't have any idea that you'd go to law school, and what are you going to do with being a lawyer?"  It just wasn't in their consciousness.  Now I will say this about my parents and my entire family.  They have been supportive of whatever I want to do.  I mean I've just been very fortunate to be in a family that I've had all kinds of support.
Story_ID: 8631
Speaker 1: I should tell you about working for the--oh, sorry--working about NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]. About yeah, being an activist. Can I tell you now?
Speaker 2: Of course, yeah. Now when is--give me a time frame.
Speaker 1: The timeframe was 1961 right after I got out of college before I went off to Spain.  My summer job for that summer was to work for the Youth and College Division of the NAACP.  All the people working for the Youth and College Division in the various regions around the country were introduced to the press at press conference at the annual meeting of the NAACP in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and all of us were lined up in a row.  It happened that I was at the end of the line, and so they'd introduce this guy who led the wait-in here, this girl who lead the pray-in there, this person who lead the read-in at such and such a library.  They came to me, and I never will forget it because the person presenting us had a long pause, and he looked down, and he looked up, and he said finally "Well, she just graduated from college," and that was the end of the press conference.  It was like I had done nothing significant but just graduate from college, and so in a sense you'd have to say no, I was not an activist in the same sense that other people were, but when you think about what we had to do, my sticking it out there for four years in that college was a quote civil rights action, and indeed I just recently said to a gentlemen who asked about my father [Solomon Hughes, Sr.,].  When my father sent in an application to play in the St. Paul Open, he knew he would not be accepted, even though he was a professional golfer because of the PGA [Professional Golfers Association] policy of the whites only, and he said, "Well, that wasn't a planned civil rights action." And I said "Yes, but you have to understand whenever somebody black pushes the envelope, it's a civil rights action."  We're so accustomed to thinking about [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] and Rosa Parks, but I'm sure you find that when many of the people you are talking to, they've taken those steps in their own individual lives.
Story_ID: 8632
Speaker 1: Now so law school--was it, was it hard to get used to, or were you like--now were you--you weren't living at home though.
Speaker 2: No.  No.  I lived in an apartment near the university campus [University of Minnesota Law School], but it was in Minneapolis [Minnesota] so I could go home on the weekends.
Speaker 1: So was it--was it--what was that--I mean--?
Speaker 2: It was awful.  Yeah, if you want to know the real truth, it was awful.
Speaker 1: How many women? You were the only black. You were the first one to--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I was the first black, but ten women started with me.  Three of us graduated.  Ten women, and what's fascinating about that is when I graduated, one of the professors said to me, "We have been trying to get you for the whole three years and we never could." And when you think about that, it also tells you what kind of intestinal fortitude you need because when a professor is trying to quote get a student, that's ridiculous, but I disliked law school intensely, and I think it's fascinating as I tell people that I'm now a law professor myself because I vowed I would never set foot in law school again once I graduated.  In addition, you know, the conversations, I remember people discussing the [Ossian] Sweet case.  I don't know if you remember that case of a guy in Detroit [Michigan] where a mob--he moved into an integrated or a white neighborhood.  A mob surrounded his house, and he shot out in the mob, not aiming at anybody, but somebody got killed, and the class discussion was well, he didn't need to be there anyway.  Why would he move into a white neighborhood anyway?  And I remember those kind of discussions, and it was in criminal law, and things like that, you know, made an impact on me as a student, but yeah, I did well, and I got on law review.  I also remember law review very distinctly because again, there was nothing in my background that would tell me that law review was important, and initially I said no, I don't have to be on law review, and I turned it down.  Well, the whole school was in uproar about my turning law review down, and I got called in by professors telling me that I couldn't do that.  I had to serve on law review since I made it on grades.  Well, in retrospect now, I'm very glad they convinced me it was something I had to do because I wouldn't be a law professor now if I hadn't had the law review experience, but at the time I didn't see it as something that I needed.
Speaker 1: But this is sort of--this is phenomenal, I mean really it's pretty phenomenal
Speaker 2: . I don't even think--I think Barack [Obama] was the first--no, he was the first president.
Speaker 1: President, yes, right.
Speaker 2: President of the law review. That's right, he was the first president (unclear). But what--but you make it seem so easy. Most people if they hate things, they're not excelling, necesssarily, so. I mean--I know you felt under siege, but you were--.
Speaker 1: Oh, but remember the timeframe.  See, in that timeframe you had to prove it could to be done by somebody black so I mean that's a powerful motivator, you know, when you must show, and for example, now I have an incredible teaching load, but the point is I'm gonna end up doing it, and I do end up doing well with it, you know, because I cannot--if I were anybody else, and I thought about it.  If I were anybody else, they wouldn't allow this to happen, and if they did, you know, they'd kind of blow it off. But because of who I am, I cannot afford to not deliver each course well.
Speaker 2: But okay, so were there courses that you took to in that whole process? Was there something--did the law intrigue you? I mean, I'm just trying to understand--'cause I'm--.
Speaker 1: No, it was the credential.
Speaker 2: It was the credential.
Speaker 1: It was the credential.
Speaker 2: Okay, isn't that fascinating. And even when you--now okay, when you became a part of law review, did that part--the process of the writing and the research, did that interest--?
Speaker 1: No.  I detested it also because, you know--and I never will forget the subject I published my student note on--the unitary administration of decedent's intangibles.  Now, you ask yourself, what did the unitary administration of decedent's intangibles have to do with the reality of my life or the reality of black peoples' life in the 1960s?  So I mean obviously it did not engage me, but it was something that I actually had to do and I had to learn how to do.
Speaker 2: Now what was the law school environment like then? Because you know, this is what's striking me is that you're in law school, you know, now there's more activism, but this is more conservative environment to begin with.
Speaker 1: It's almost all white males, I mean, and the white females are having difficulty.  In fact, one image that sticks with me to this day, you know, years, forty years after I got into law school is a white woman running up--there were steps running up the corridor because it was a sloping lecture hall--in tears out of that room because the professor had reduced her to tears, and she never came back.  Another woman committed suicide. So what's fascinating is, when I think about it, I thought well, you know, I guess the training of being black and dealing with adversity obviously prepared me to survive law school whereas these women obviously had the intellectual capacity.  They were admitted to law school, but they could not withstand the pressure, and law school was predominately white males, you know, and I had two friends in law school, though.  I mean one of them was a guy I mentioned.  He was--in fact, I stayed with his parents when I went to New York and worked for a New York law firm one summer.  Bernie Becker was a Jewish guy from the Bronx in New York, and we became friends, and I also was friends with--actually, he was a white male from Minnesota, but basically, you know, law school was another solitary environment, and I don't have a recollection of, you know, good bosom buddies from law school or anything.  It was something I had to do, had to accomplish.
Story_ID: 8633
Speaker 1: Now when you went to New York that summer, was that--'cause you worked at a--what firm did you work at?
Speaker 2: Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison [LLP].
Speaker 1: You worked at--?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: This is 19 what?
Speaker 2: 1964 is when I went there.  It's almost forty years ago.
Speaker 1: That's even amazing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How did you get--?
Speaker 2: Now isn't this amazing, yes.
Speaker 1: I mean how did you get hired?
Speaker 2: Now, here's what's interesting.  There was a fellow in Minnesota, and I'm not sure how I met him, but he was originally from New York, and he knew--he was a lawyer.  He knew people at Paul, Weiss, and he was the one that said to me, "Well, you ought to spend your summer in a firm in New York." And he called up a friend of his and told him to get my resume and to look at it.  I had not met anybody, you know, obviously in Paul, Weiss, but the friend looked at my resume, and they made me an offer.  Now what was fascinating about it is that not only was I an oddity by being a female, they had no other females as summer clerks.  I was an oddity as being black.  They had no other blacks being summer clerks, but I was an oddity because I was from Minnesota because everybody's from the East Coast, and they thought of Minnesota as the wild west.  They kept talking about you're from out west, and I was confused at first 'cause I was like "No, I'm not from out west.  I'm from Minnesota."  To everybody on the East Coast, Minnesota was out west so it was a little difficult in that sense.
Speaker 1: Joyce, people didn't get hired at firms back then, did they?
Speaker 2: They didn't because one of the women in my class tried to get hired at White and Case [LLP] and White and Case was not.  I actually--actually when you think about it now, one has to say that the Lord was placing me in positions because I didn't even understand then at the time.  Yeah.  I mean this man, and I can't even remember how I got to know him, but he was a lawyer, and he's the one that suggested oh, you ought to go to New York and work for summer because actually my initial idea in law school was that I was wanted to go to New York and practice law with a firm.  I mean I didn't know any better.  I mean that's what I thought I would do when I got out of law school, but by getting the clerkship in a sense that sidetracked me, but Paul, Weiss was a little different, but as I said, I stayed with Bernie Becker's parents in the Bronx, and I liked it because I took the subway down to Manhattan to work, and when I'd come back each night, all the women were sitting on their stoops, you know, kind of welcoming me back in the neighborhood at night so that was fascinating.  As I said to someone, it was an experience for me because I had an actual Jewish mother for the summer, although the phrase Jewish mother could be applied to my own mother because all it really means is somebody who is concerned about your welfare, you know.
Speaker 1: I'm still in shock. But anyway.
Speaker 2: But Paul, Weiss, no well--.
Speaker 1: I'm talking--I was in law school--I mean this is--you said 19--.
Speaker 2: 1964 was the--summer of '64 I worked.
Speaker 1: I graduated in '80 [1980]. I mean I'm just saying people were like--they're weird. Okay anyway.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, they came and interviewed you on campus?
Speaker 2: Well, no, no.  Paul, Weiss didn't.  They never interviewed me.  I just sent my resume in.
Speaker 1: But they knew you were black. They had to.
Speaker 2: They had to have because this man--he encouraged me to do it and he knew somebody at Paul, Weiss, and so he must have told them that there's this woman out in Minnesota who's gonna send her resume in, and you ought to consider it, and so I was a summer clerk at Paul, Weiss.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay. Well we'll get over that little shock. I thought you were going to say some like little small, you know, Jewish firm or something. I'm like, I'm trying to figure out. But go on.
Speaker 2: But it was also very good experience, you know, to have had that experience at Paul, Weiss.  I mean it did.  It helped me in a lot of ways.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: It what ways?
Speaker 2: Well, for example, one of the things--I mean this probably doesn't mean anything to anybody who is not a lawyer, but I remember citing a case for a proposition, and the case had been overruled, and I knew that, but I was not citing it for the proposition for which it had been overruled.  Boy, you know, the department just went up in arms because I did not indicate that the case had been overruled on other grounds for a different reason, and so I mean I learned right then and there about the importance about putting down what a case stood for and being very, very precise because I said what's the big deal?  I wasn't citing it for that proposition, and I can't remember what the case was, but it also was a very famous case, I mean, and so my feeling was, I mean, everybody knows this.  Well, everybody doesn't know everything so I learned something that summer.
Speaker 1: Now okay, so you--is that your--after your--.
Speaker 2: Second year.  Right.  Between second and third year.
Story_ID: 8634
Speaker 1: So then what made you decide to clerk then, was that because that's what people on law review do?
Speaker 2: Well--no.  Let me--the clerkship is an amazing story to me.  Posted on the bulletin board was a notice that a federal district court judge [Earl Larson] in Minnesota was looking for a law clerk so I sent my credentials in.  He called me in for an interview.  I had the interview with him, and he hired me.  It wasn't until maybe six months later, not even in that first interview, not even when I first started working for him.  It wasn't until a whole lot of time later I found out he knew my father [Solomon Hughes, Sr.] 'cause he said to me, "Well, how's your father been doing," and I kind of looked at him, you know, strangely.  He said "Well, you know, I played golf with your father."  Okay, so then I felt well, okay.  That's interesting.  I didn't know he knew my father, but it wasn't until maybe ten years later that I found out that when he played golf with my father, he said to my dad--no, my dad said, "I have a daughter who's in law school," and the judge said to my dad, "Well, when she gets out of school, have her come and see me."  My father never mentioned this judge to me ever, and I thought about it later, and I thought about, you know, my father had spent a lot of time around white people.  He played golf with them, but he also, I think, was very astute to know how to get along with people but not necessarily to take for real what they say so he never told me oh, go see this judge, you know.  I've got it planned out for you so again that's why I think sometimes the Lord is in the plan on these things because I applied to the judge never knowing he knew my father, and even after I finished the clerkship, I didn't know it.  It was way later that I found out that the guy had mentioned that to my dad, and my dad said to me later "Well, I guess he was for real," and I was like, you know, "Why wouldn't you have told me that?"  Well, he didn't want me to be disappointed because he didn't, you know--he wasn't sure that that wasn't just, you know, something nice that people say on the golf course so in a sense that clerkship probably happened because he knew my father, but I had the credentials also, and I oftentimes tell people yeah, well, I wouldn't have been his clerk just because he knew my father.  I had to have the credentials, and more importantly I ended up being his clerk not for one year but for two years.  Now the two years happened this way.  I already had a job lined up with the Civil Division of the Justice Department, and that's what I wanted to do 'cause I wanted to be a litigator, and the Vietnam War was going on at the time, and they lifted the deferments that clerks for federal judges normally received, and so my replacement no longer could keep his deferment, and the judge said to me, "Will you stay with me for another year," and I therefore did that, gave up my job in the Civil Division of the U.S. Justice Department, but it also shows you how contacts helps.  Before I wrote the Justice Department and said I'm not gonna take the job, I advised one of the other women who graduated with me whose husband had been transferred to [Washington] D.C. to do his residency at Walter Reed Hospital that she ought to try to get the job with the Department of Justice that I was going to relinquish, and she did, but it's also interesting, and I remember her so vividly because we both were on law review together, and the law review banquet was held at a club that did not admit Jews or blacks.  She was Jewish, and we both talked about the law review banquet and whether we were going, and I said, "Well, I've decided I'm going, but I am not going to the back door.  I'm going in the front, and they are going to allow me in."  So I remember going to that law review.  I'm not that social so it's not, you know, a banquet I would have necessarily gone to, but I wanted to go just because I was a member of the law review, and I was gonna go to that banquet at this place that did not allow black folk into it.
Story_ID: 8635
Speaker 1: When you graduated, was that a big deal? Was your family and everything thereat your law school graduation?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. That was a big deal for you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but the University of Minnesota [Law School, Minneapolis, Minnesota], and the University of Minnesota is a Big Ten school.  It's a huge school, and, you know, I had graduated as an undergraduate from a college that had 2000 people so that was very important.  Well, when you graduate from law school, you're in--you know, you're with thousands of people who are graduating, but yes, my parents were there, but--(nods for yes).
Story_ID: 8636
Speaker 1: I have another question before we get away from your father [Solomon Hughes, Sr.]. How--what job was he--was he playing golf?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  He had menial jobs.
Speaker 1: He had menial jobs, but he's on the golf course.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, but because he was such an excellent golfer, and I'm gonna tell you a little story now.  Because he was such an excellent golfer, people oftentimes called my dad to play golf with them, and so probably he played golf with the judge [Earl Larson] at the judge's private club.  Now to really understand this, let me tell you a story about my younger sister [Shirley Hughes].  She is senior vice president of a corporation, and the guy who chose her himself told the story and gave a dinner when she became, and it was held at the country club, a private country club in Minneapolis [Minnesota], and he talked about how our families had been intertwined.  He went to the same college [Carleton College, Northfield, Minnesota] I did.  My older sister [Toni Hughes] modeled for his aunt and uncle who sold coats or something like that, and Shirley worked for him so he said it's interesting that this dinner is being held at a country club where my father--and he knew my father or knew of him--could not have even been a member, but he often played there because he was such a good golfer.  People always called him to play here and there and elsewhere so Daddy played with all these people all the time, but yeah, he had menial jobs.
Speaker 1: Okay. Only in Minneapolis. You know what I'm saying, that access--he had access through golf. Which is a--is more--is a more elitist, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, very much an elitist thing, right.
Speaker 1: Right. And that's a different thing. You know, my father gave me a book on black golfers, but the guy had research but was all over the place, and he, you know, he said it was hard to find documentation about a lot of things because the records he had to rely on were the black press only.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, there's a book on it.  Charlie Sifford, who is a person I met as a child who my dad knew, Charlie Sifford wrote a book called 'I Just Want to Play'.  Charlie Sifford was one of the first black people to get into the PGA [Professional Golfers Association].  By the time the PGA opened up, however, he was in the Senior Tour, I mean, so he would be senior.  The PGA allowed--finally allowed my father and Ted Rhodes to play in a tournament in St. Paul [Minnesota] because people made such a big deal about it, but the guy who was writing this article about my father, I think, made a good point.  His article kind of ended with by the time things finally began to open up, though, Daddy was actually past his prime in terms of age, you know, and he had done what he had to do to take care of his family so golf was--if the time period had been different, he would have been a professional golfer.  I mean, he would have made his living doing that.
Speaker 1: So do you know how he met Charlie Sifford?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, all the black golfers knew each other in those days, and you know, there was a Joe Louis Tournament, and I think that they would meet each other at--playing on the golf on the black circuit 'cause there was a United Golfers Association, and Daddy won the Joe Louis Tournament, and Ted Rhodes won it, and Daddy and Ted would go back and forth about who would win the tournament.
Story_ID: 8637
Speaker 1: Your clerkship, did you like it?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  Fantastic experience because this judge [Earl Larson] allowed you to do the research and come back to him and tell him what you would do before he would tell you what he would do, you see, so a lot of judges would say I'm gonna decide X.  Now go find something to support it.  No, he never did that.  He would say you research it, and you write it, and you tell me how you would come out so you had the experience of trying to figure out how you would do something, and the most telling point to this is that this judge spent--he was a district court judge, but he spent time sitting on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals by designation, and he was assigned to write opinions on his panel.  One of those opinions, though--the panel decided what the decision was gonna be, but he was assigned to write it, and so I would write the first draft, but I was having a lot of trouble with it, and he was--very rarely had to push me about anything.  He said, you know, where's this draft you're.  I said--finally I said you know what?  The decision is just all wrong.  I mean part of the reason I can't write it is that it's decided wrong.  This judge called up the other two judges on that panel, and they discussed the matter, and they changed their opinion.  Now I think that I'm saying not so much to say that I was that great.  It speaks to the quality of the man, you see, because he was willing then to look at it very carefully, read all my research, and say I think we really should come out a different way, and call the other judges, and they had a conference about how they should come out on that case.
Speaker 1: Well that experience made you start to love the law, would you think?
Speaker 2: I like the intellectual challenge of the law.  I wouldn't call myself a lover of the law in the sense that--because almost anything can be justified, and I've oftentimes suggested to students.  I mean the law is not some brooding presence sitting out there that you just go and pluck from a tree, like an apple from a tree so I wouldn't--the law can be utilized to oppress people and has been, and so I wouldn't say that I love the law.  It's that it does provide a challenging intellectual experience.
Speaker 1: Did you work while you were there on any seminal cases, things that, you know, were important? And what kind--was he--he was handling all kinds of cases?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  He's a federal judge, and actually during those years, he didn't have as many criminal cases as federal judges now.  Nowadays, federal judges, almost 50 percent of their docket is criminal.  No, one of the most exciting cases he handled was called the salt cases.  What the salt cases were, were interdistrict cases where the states of Minnesota, Michigan, Iowa, I think Indiana, about five different states brought an antitrust suit for treble damages against the manufactures of rock salt.  They used the rock salt for deicing purposes.  When you lived in the North, you understand that salt gets put on the streets.  Well, this was early in the game where they would consolidate cases and have one judge try these multidistrict cases so the rock salt cases were very significant and also very complicated because you could not have a meeting of council in the judge's chambers.  You met in the courtroom, I mean, because there were so many lawyers for all the rock salt companies and all these different states, and that compelled a lot of my attention.  Yes, I recall those rock salt cases.  They were treble damage cases, and they did at the time involve some new issues on antitrust law and to what extent you could use decisions in criminal matters for a civil case seeking treble damages on antitrust.
Story_ID: 8638
Speaker 1: Were there any civil rights cases that you were involved in?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But there probably weren't very many coming out of your district either--I mean as a--I'm sorry, as a law clerk.
Speaker 2: It was subsequent to the time I was a law clerk.  There was a case dealing with education, and it wasn't educational segregation per se but something like it, but it was after my time as a law clerk, but no, none of the cases.  Well, the only case--I guess some people would call it civil rights.  I mean if you were--if your sexual orientation is different, you'd call it a civil rights case.  This was a case dealing with a prosecution for selling material that had male nudes in it, and you know, back then--and I felt sorry for some of the people that had to get on to the stand.  I mean they were gay.  They were gay men, but you know, back then they were always in the closet, you know, but they had to get on the stand and, you know, and talk about that they'd ordered this material, and there was one videotape that was shown in the courtroom.  You know, what bothers me--I find this most interesting.  A judge's secretary was like oh!  I mean I had all these boxes of exhibits in my office, and she acted as if those magazines were gonna jump out and grab her or something.  I mean she was aah!  You know, but they were just male nudes, and I thought it was funny.  In fact, someone said well, you lucked out because the prosecution is for male nudes rather than female nudes and this is a female clerk. And so the other thing, too, was I was the first female clerk in that entire district so when I became a clerk, I was not only the first black clerk but the first female clerk ever that any judge in that Minnesota district ever had, and actually to this day there has never been another black clerk in the Federal District in Minnesota.  Isn't that awful?  I mean yeah.  I just couldn't believe it when somebody told me that.
Speaker 1: But, so was your experience all sort of like, magical during that--I mean you didn't have--were people like--?
Speaker 2: My clerkship was okay, you know, but it was primarily a tribute to the judge [Earl Larson] because, you know, at one point, the judge had--I never will forget this also.  The judge had called some lawyers in to his office for chambers, and he wanted me to sit in on it so--and he introduced me to the lawyers who were handling the case, and some point came up and he said "Well, Joyce has researched that, and she can tell you about it."  Those lawyers did not want to hear from me at all.  I mean I never will forget it.  I mean they were very clear that they didn't want to hear me tell them about the product, the research, and I said to myself well, it's a tribute to the judge that he wasn't trying to play off that he knew all this, and he said, you know, she's the one that did the research, and this is what the research shows, and she can tell you about the research.  I never will forget that.
Speaker 1: What was his ethnic background?
Speaker 2: He was probably Scandinavian, you know, because he's from Minnesota.  His name was Larson, and so, you know--as a matter of fact, when I taught in Minnesota, I had so many people in my class who were Larson, Nelson, Olson.  When I came to here, I was just amazed at the names because in Minnesota, Scandinavian is the predominant ethnic background so I'm sure that he was some Scandinavian, Swedish, or Norwegian, or whatever.  I don't know which.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you clerk for two years.
Speaker 2: Yes, 'cause I was going to go the extra one, and then.
Speaker 1: Do you think it's just--did you enjoy it?
Speaker 2: Oh, I did.  Totally enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: So it was not like you were held captive or anything.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no.  I really enjoyed it.  No. Not me.  He asked if I'd do it.  Oh, yes.  I liked it, but what I think was telling about it, do you know that I sent out letters to all these law firms after I finished my clerkship, and almost none of them had the courtesy to even reply to the letters.  The law firm I went with [Howard, LeFevere, Lefler, and Hamilton, LLP] was a small law firm where a guy who had been a clerk for one of the other judges had gone to, and I interviewed with that firm, but also it shows you again connections.  One of the senior partners had actually graduated from Carleton College [Northfield, Minnesota] where I went, and he remembered coming back to football games at that college and seeing me out on the field as a cheerleader.  Can you believe that?  And he says "Oh, I remember."  Well, of course, he couldn't help but remember the one black girl out there being a cheerleader.
Story_ID: 8639
Speaker 1: I can't believe that you were a cheerleader. That doesn't even fit your like--your--.
Speaker 2: No, but I'll tell you why.
Speaker 1: That doesn't fit your profile!
Speaker 2: And this again is a tribute to my sister Toni [Hughes].  When we were in high school, obviously all the cheerleaders were Caucasian, but she tried out for cheerleading, and Toni tried out for cheerleading one year, and she didn't make it.  The next year she said to me, "You're gonna try out for cheerleading," and she coached me and coached me.  I tried out for cheerleading as a high school student, and I made it.  Well, you're right.  Cheerleading was not me.  It was her.  I also was on the teen boards of department stores, but that was Toni.  I mean she was--so between my mother [Bessie Mae Hughes] and my older sister, our whole life was about pushing the envelope, and so it really didn't fit me to be the person on the teen boards and stuff, but she tried, and she didn't make it so she pushed me, and so by the time I got to college, I had been a cheerleader in high school so I just tried out for cheerleading in college.
Story_ID: 8640
Speaker 1: Now the firm [Howard, LeFevere, Lefler and Hamilton LLP], how is that experience for you--to start with the firm?
Speaker 2: Well, the firm experience was actually very good.  I'll tell you.
Speaker 1: This is what year?
Speaker 2: I went to the firm in 1967.  I recall, though, that I said to the firm when I talked to them and the departments, I said, "Well, what I want to know is what your reaction is going to be when one of your clients says 'I don't want that black girl handling any of my matters.'" And the oldest man in the firm--the firm had his name, started with his name--and he said, "Then we don't need the client."  Now that tells you again you're talking about somebody had had a very, very unbelievable experience, and so clearly when you run into people like this--when that man said "Then we don't need the client," that is so unusual for a law firm that's in business to make money to say that you can come and work for us regardless.  Now what they did probably helped, at least the--but they did everything.  They had a general practice, but one of the bedrock parts of the practice was quote municipal law, and municipal law at that time meant that they represented a lot of governmental bodies, including villages and towns that were not big enough to have full-time city attorneys, and therefore I was the prosecutor for one of their villages.  That village now--all of these towns now are suburbs of Minneapolis, but back then, you know, they were small. So now I had two interesting experiences.  Should I tell you about them?  Okay.  One of them when I first went out to the courthouse, and this was west of Minneapolis, and the little swinging gate between where the audience sits and the lawyers sat is actually what's called a bar.  That's what "called to the bar" means, and so I marched in that day and went through a swinging gate, which is through the bar, and the clerk about had apoplexy and told me "Oh, you can't come through there.  You can't come to the bar.  This is just for lawyers." And I said "Well, I am a lawyer, and I'm the prosecutor for the village of Plymouth [Minnesota]."  That poor clerk probably was about to die of a stroke. And then one day the Highway Patrol oftentimes issued tickets for people going through that village, and so you'd meet them for the first time on the day that you're prosecuting that particular little ticket so one day I'm standing at the clerk's office, and a guy who was probably about six feet seven [inches]--I mean he was big, big and dressed in his full law enforcement regalia, you know, a gun and the trappings and all this stuff, and he came in and said, "I'm looking for the prosecutor for the village of Plymouth." And I looked up at him and said, "I'm the prosecutor for the village of Plymouth."  I mean I never will forget the look on this man's face.  Can you imagine this, six feet seven, you know, white police officer looking for the prosecutor, and here's this black woman who says I'm the one who's gonna be handling your case for you. And then my final incident, though, was that we were on trial, and I forgot what the trial was about, but there were two highway patrolmen, and when we broke for lunch, recessed for lunch, I went to lunch with the two highway patrolmen.  Well, we walked into the restaurant, and you could've heard a pin drop in that restaurant, and all eyes in the restaurant followed the three of us, and at first I couldn't figure out what was going on, and then it occurred to me.  Everyone sitting in that restaurant thought that those two police officers had a desperate criminal, and I was so bad that there were two of them needed to keep me in check so I found that very amusing when I went to lunch with the two officers, you know, and they both were big, burly guys.
Speaker 1: That's amazing.
Speaker 2: And one final story, though, about being a--working with the firm. So one of the entities that they represented was a power company that has quasi-governmental authority, and the power company can condemn land for its power lines, and this power company was putting in new transformers all throughout, including northern Minnesota, and so I went to the first hearing that we would have for them to condemn the land.  Now obviously people whose land is being condemned for a power line are upset, but I walk into this courtroom, and the courtroom is filled with people.  Most of them are probably farmers, and you could tell just by the way they looked in their overalls and, you know, large hands, you know.  They looked like farmers, and I proceeded to take care of my business, and the judge was so dumbfounded that the lawyer for this power company was this black woman, he had significant difficulty and then finally just asked me all kinds of questions about me in the middle of this trial, and then what was more interesting is I got back the next day to the office, and the firm had received a letter, and the letter came from one of the people whose land was being condemned and chastised them severely for not having the guts to come out themselves and condemn their land but hiding behinds the skirts of that black woman that you sent out there to condemn our land, but those were interesting experiences.
Speaker 1: How large was the firm?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was only about ten lawyers.
Speaker 1: And they all accepted you, more or less.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Wow, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah the--.
Speaker 1: Now you're not married at this point are you?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is later, okay.
Speaker 2: I got married when I was with the firm.
Speaker 1: Right, right. But during this time was when--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was with the firm for one year and then I got married.
Story_ID: 8641
Speaker 1: And how did you meet your husband then?
Speaker 2: Well, that was totally arranged.  Now remember--arranged in this sense--remember back in those days the black community is very small in Minneapolis [Minnesota], and he had come to Minneapolis to do a residency--he was a physician--to do a residency at a hospital there, and I was a lawyer, and people thought my goodness, we've got this black doctor here, we've got this black lawyer, and they don't know anybody, and they need to be together, and so I mean we were--and he's a nice guy.  Let me say this.  Even though we've been divorced for years, he was my mother's [Bessie Mae Hughes] doctor up until the time he left the medical clinic where he practiced so I mean he was her doctor for twenty years after we got divorced, and as a matter of fact, she just ran into him recently so there--he's always been a good friend, and he's a nice guy, but--. It was basically arranged in the sense that people decided we needed to meet each other, you know, given our backgrounds.
Speaker 1: Now--I can just--okay--.
Speaker 2: And there's one thing that I have to say for him, though, because remember during these years, this is just when women are beginning and--but I had already started practicing law.  I had practiced law for one year.  I had been out of law school for three years, and my diplomas were in the name of Hughes, and I retained the name of Hughes.  Well this was hard for him, obviously, because people would say to him well, I went to see your wife, Miss Hughes, you know.  Obviously that was not his name so I will have to say I do--I give him credit for having, you know, kind of sticking it out, but obviously I'm not cut out to be a doctor's wife.
Speaker 1: I mean this is way before people started not taking on names, you know.
Speaker 2: Right. Well, I also had a big thing with one of the department stores because--well, I had two interesting events.  One is--I'll tell you first about the case.  I appeared in court after I got married, and the lawyer moved to have the action dismissed because the lawyer who signed it signed it incorrectly and did not use her real name, and he then announced to the judge, "Your Honor, this woman just got married.  Her name isn't Hughes so you gotta dismiss this case."  Can you believe it?  I mean--but anyway I still use Hughes regardless, and then I had a credit card with a department store, and they told me I had to have a credit card in my husband's name, you know, because I wanted to keep the same credit card, and I said, "No, no, no, no.  I want a credit card in my name.  This is the card I had.  I'm gonna to keep the card." And they said "Oh, no, no, no.  He's responsible for your debts." And I said, "First of all, he's not responsible for my debts.  I happen to know the law, and I will tell you what.  You try to collect all the things I've charged before we got married," which--and 'cause I had more on my account than I usually have 'cause I'd just gotten married--"So you try to collect from him," and I said "'Cause I'm not gonna pay you a dime on the amount of stuff I charged before I got married, and you see if you can get him to pay or you better ask your lawyers to look at the law."  Well, a week later they said I could have the credit card in my name 'cause they knew I was right, you know.  He was not responsible for the stuff I had charged, but anyway yes.  I was married during the time that I had--a year after I had gone to the law firm [Howard, LeFevere, Lefler and Hamilton, LLP] I then got married.
Speaker 1: But did he ultimately have any troubles with you being a professional, do you think? Because you said "I wasn't a doctor's wife".
Speaker 2: I would suspect so in this sense.  I mean obviously back in those years--it may still be true today.  Most doctors' wives were seen and not heard.  They just were women who looked good on somebody's arm.  They didn't challenge people, and for example, when we'd go out, I mean I'd express my own point of views, get into debates with people.  Well, you weren't supposed to do that as a doctor's wife, and that was not me.  You know, you were supposed to--I had to take a vacation and, you know, go get drapes for the house, and I mean do all these housewifey things. And part of the problem, I think, with the marriage was because he was a very dedicated physician now.  He would come home, eat dinner, and then go back to the hospital, and my point was I have to leave work, come home, and cook dinner, which I did, but I'm going back to my office, too.  Well, you know, I'm supposed to be at home, you know, for whenever he showed up, and that just wasn't about to work.  I mean, you know, he was a busy professional, so was I. And he also--I was also a person who gave--I gave a lot of speeches.  There was a big issue.  I won't even get into the big issue about my taking on a young woman who--Girls' State--who happened to be black.  I was Governor of Minnesota Girls' State when I was in high school so I considered they were using me to say well, see, we're not racist because, you know, we had this black girl who's the governor, you know, back in the '50s [1950s] so he was upset.  I never will remember--never will forget this because I was to go on a TV program, and he went and took something out of my car--I don't know enough about cars--so I couldn't use my car.  I mean I was just--'cause he said "Well, I said that, you know, you couldn't go out today."  I said "Oh, no, no, no.  We're not gonna have that.  I mean you can't tell me that I'm not gonna be able to go out and do this."  And it's true that if I were the traditional doctor's wife, and it was a Sunday, I mean I would have been home Sunday making sure we had the Sunday dinner, but I had committed to be there so.
Story_ID: 8642
Speaker 1: Now why did you end up going from--from--wait a minute. From the one firm, Howard, LeFevere [Lefler and Hamilton, LLP]--
Speaker 2: LeFevere, Lefler and Hamilton to Peterson [and Haltze, LLP].
Speaker 1: To Peterson and--.
Speaker 2: Oh, well that's because I went into teaching. Oh yes, see I got recruited into teaching--when I went into teaching, in order to have a place to wind out my own clients, I was just of counsel at Peterson, Haltze. The other thing though about--.
Speaker 1: But how did--okay, so how did the teaching come about?
Speaker 2: Oh, I got recruited into that totally. Remember this was after the assassination of [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], and law schools all of a sudden discovered that there were black people in this country, and they began to get black students in law schools.  Those students begin to agitate to get black professors. And as is true of many, many other schools, everybody wanted the same person. and so if Joe Blow was at Harvard [Law School], then [University of] Iowa [Law School], [University of] Arizona [Law School]--everybody said okay, we're gonna go get Joe Blow.  Well, why would Joe Blow leave there and go to Iowa or whatever so this school had gone that route, [University of] Minnesota [Law School, Minneapolis, Minnesota], just like all the other schools, and finally they realized oh, we have one of our own graduates who has all of the credentials for teaching. So I was recruited into teaching, and I will say in retrospect now I'm not sure I would have went and done it if I had known what's happened.  The guy who recruited me into teaching, believe it or not, had been dean of the law school when I was a student, but he stepped down after he recruited me so he recruited me.  That was his last year as dean, and then he stepped down, and that's when I had tremendous difficulties, but that's how--. But the other thing I wanna say about Peterson, Haltze and the reason I wanna mention them is because Mr. Haltze just recently died, and his daughter wrote me a note to let me know that, and I thought it's interesting that she still kept up with who I was all these years later.  I'd worked at Peterson, Haltze when I was in law school, and I thought it was great that they gave me the opportunity.  I learned how to dictate, for example.  I mean they took the time to show me how to do a lot of things.  It was just a small firm, and they allowed me to use their place as of counsel as a place to bide down my own personal clients.
Speaker 1: Now Howard, LeFevere--they wouldn't allow you to do that or was it just you were--'cause sometimes you can become of counsel to the firm you've been with.
Speaker 2: It would not have worked as well there.
Speaker 1: Okay did you think that they--well okay.
Speaker 2: Was something about--I mean you could have been recruited and said no.
Speaker 1: Yes, I could have.
Speaker 2: Okay, so what--what--.
Speaker 1: What made me do it?  Oh because again, I believe that you have to do certain things for historical necessity, and I knew--first of all, they were trying to find a man, so I mean I was not their choice because at that time that school had no women. No white women, no green women, no women so they were looking for a male, and they had tried to get black men who were at other law schools, but why were those guys gonna leave big name law schools they were at and come to Minnesota?  So when--and I found this all out obviously--when they came to me, I realized that they were at the point where they were trying to follow through on the commitment that they had made to find a black professor, and so it was incumbent upon me to do it because I was their graduate.  I had the credentials.  They were running all over looking for people who they clearly couldn't get, and it's always convenient for people to say well, we couldn't get, you know, the guy--people call them Jesus appointments so I'm not taking the Lord's name in vain, but they called them Jesus appointments so--we couldn't get Jesus, therefore we could do it.  So part of the reason that I said oh, yes, I will do it to make sure that they would be held to it, and when I came into law teaching, my objective was to help change things and then go back to practice, and I didn't realize, you know, what it was going to be like.
Speaker 2: Well, that answers my question.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 8643
Speaker 1: But this has been a place [University of Minnesota Law School, Minneapolis, Minnesota] clearly, you had already been a star at--I mean in some respects, it was almost a homecoming coming back--or, no. No, not really?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: I mean, I know you didn't like it, but--.
Speaker 2: No, no.  It wasn't a homecoming because remember you're talking about going to join a faculty where I was the first female on that faculty.  They had never had any females and the first black, and essentially what I believe they were looking for was somebody who was black in color but was essentially a white male, and part of the issue was the conflict where I was determined to let them know I am not a white male.  I am a black female.  That's who I am, and that's who I will always be, and I will not change myself or try to change myself into being a white male so.
Speaker 1: So was the first year okay, or did he--no, no no. Because he stepped down.
Speaker 2: Oh, the first year of teaching?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The first year was reasonably okay.  I mean yeah, he was still dean.  Right.
Speaker 1: And what were you teaching?
Speaker 2: I taught evidence which I still teach now.  I taught trial practice.  I taught a course that--trial practice at that time also had an aspect of it that was civil procedure, okay.  I mean it's just a funny course that they had at the time.  I also taught legal profession, which was a required third-year course, and essentially a lot of schools now are doing it, and we have to give that university credit because back then they required students to take what was essentially an ethics course, and so I mean it was an ethics course required of third-year students, and I taught that.
Speaker 1: That's right, because I remember I took one of the first ethics courses back in 19--I think it was--.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah it was after that the schools began to realize, we need to have students take this course. But Minnesota had already decided that, before--you know, way before the trend.
Speaker 1: So now, was it from the very beginning that the faculty start acting up? Because really, it was the student faculty combination that got you--right.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes. I actually don't know about that first year, and part of it may well be because in the first year I did not act like the typical new young faculty member acts, you know.  I'm tenure, and I'm seeking tenure, and remember I was also winding down a private practice.  I was also older because typically people get recruited into law teaching after one year out of school so they haven't had a lot of practical experience.  I had already had two years of a clerkship and four years in a firm so I was a lawyer six years already by the time--so I think my whole demeanor was not like the new young professors, and so I suspect it may well have rubbed people the wrong way the first year, but I was not necessarily conscious of all that.  I mean I was conscious, and one thing that did happen that I remember very specifically--never will forget it--about a faculty person asking me to go to a motel with him, and I was just incensed. And I got those kind of things so I basically kept my distance, you know.  I mean I was who I was, and, you know, I'm not gonna follow.  Every I mean everybody--I remember that everybody went to lunch together at 11:30.  First of all, 11:30 is not when I eat. So I mean I didn't  join the 11:30 lunch, and people made a big issue about that later on, I realized.  At the time I didn't see that as significant, since I don't eat lunch at 11:30.  But once the dean who hired me stepped down, then.
Speaker 1: So then that's the second year.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did it start with the students or you think the students provided an excuse?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think it started with the students, and the faculty was complicit because what happened was the students filed a petition to change the source of grading, but they filed a petition for two sections, the one I taught and the one the white male taught, and the faculty said no, we're not gonna change it, and the students came back in the second semester and asked for a change in my section only, and the faculty entertained that, and so at that point I think yes, the faculty was complicit because all they had to have done was to say we have already considered this issue for both sections.  We're not changing the grading, but once the students decided to leave the white male out and only go after me the faculty said okay.  We'll we'll take a look at it, and that's why I think it was a combination of students and faculty.
Story_ID: 8644
Speaker 1: How did you feel with all the publicity [after becoming a law professor at University of Minnesota Law School, Minneapolis, Minnesota]?
Speaker 2: That's fascinating.  I don't--I recall the one thing that sticks in my mind at the time that I was concerned about is that many of the black students argued they should have hired a black male, and so people were trying to use the student posture and me to have us fighting each other, and I was saying yes, but the students are right.  If you look at the faculty, the faculty is all men.  Why is it that they could not get a black male, you see, 'cause I not only was the first black person on that faculty, I was the first female on that faculty, and one of the difficulties that therefore created is that I had the double jeopardy of being the first female that these guys had to deal with who was supposedly a peer of theirs, as well as the first black person. And then, you know, I think there was also the issue of 'Ebony' came in to do a story, and some other national magazines did stories because it was national news that a white law school has a black woman tenure track professor, and I suspect now in retrospect that people didn't like that, you know.  I mean it was part to me of what one had to do as a black person, you know.  You had to push the envelope so it just goes with the territory, and then you go on about your business, but I think it was significant, and it's even significant today because I started thirty years ago.  We're talking today, fall of 2001, which is thirty years after I started fall 1971, and yet the number of black women tenure track law professors is still only 3 percent of all law professors in the country.  Now women in general make up almost 30 percent of law professors, and so people talk about oh, well, women have done so well.  Yes, but we're talking about white women.  Black women law professors, only 3 percent of the law professors in the country, tenure track.
Story_ID: 8645
Speaker 1: But I want to go back to how you felt when you got depressed like that. Were you sort of on cloud nine?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I mean it's--I guess, I guess for me--.
Speaker 1: Did your family feel vindicated? I mean, this was--remember everyone was pushing the envelope.
Speaker 2: I remember responding to someone who asked the same kind of question that you're asking me now, who asked me then.  I said it's just a historical necessity so I mean it's just a fact.  It's a historical necessity, and given that you're black, I mean it's--you never think that you're gonna be doing something first in 1971, but it's just part of what you have to do so I mean I think they asked me the question how did you feel about the publicity, and what's important is it suggests that you somehow--it helps magnify you.  No, it doesn't magnify you.  I mean I think it's very, very important for someone who is a first to realize that there were people before you who could have done the same thing, and the fact that a black law school had a black woman professor twenty years before proves it.  You see, there was twenty years before there was a black woman who was a law professor, but it was a black school. So, you know, by the time I got to do it, it just meant that the envelope had been pushed, and as I oftentimes tell people, I attribute my position to [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], but the unfortunate thing is that it was his death, not his life.  His death is what caused people to look for students and to look for professors.
Speaker 1: Now were you asked then to do more speaking at that point? I mean you said that you were already speaking quite a bit.
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  Most of my speaking came about because I was on the national board of the National Urban League, and a great deal of the speaking came through that.  I spoke to local chapters of the Urban League all around the country and--.
Speaker 1: Now you were on the national board when Vernon Jordan was--.
Speaker 2: When Vernon Jordan was the executive director.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now when did he get shot? When was he shot?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the date.
Speaker 1: Were you on the board?
Speaker 2: No, I had just gotten off the board, had just gotten off the board so it was probably about '80 [1980].  Actually, you can probably tell when I was on the board of the National Urban League on the vita.
Speaker 1: 70 [1970] to '78 [1978]. That's right.
Speaker 2: '70 to '78.
Speaker 1: '72 to '78.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, so yes, I went on the board then about the same time I went into teaching and was on the board of the National Urban League, and so that was really how I ended up doing so much speaking nationally.  It was the Urban League.
Story_ID: 8646
Speaker 1: Let's describe what happened. You know, just set the stage for what happened--for the inquisition.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is the academic year '71 [1971]-'72 [1972], no, '72 [1972]-'73 [1973], I believe.  In the fall of that year students [at University of Minnesota Law School, Minneapolis, Minnesota] ask that the course in legal professions--let's call it the ethics course because that makes more sense to people--ask that the ethics course be graded pass fail and not have letter grades.  Well, there were two sections of that course.  I taught one, and a white male taught another.  Incidentally, let me tell you what was written about him many years later.  At the time I didn't know that, but someone else wrote that he frequently came to class when he was a little inebriated, but at any rate the faculty said oh, no, this course will be graded like all other courses are graded.  That's the first semester.  By the time we get to the second semester, the students decide to file a petition against me and request pass fail grading, and they say the reason the pass fail grading must be done in my course is because I'm not equipped to teach and because I cancel too many classes, and they added an hour before the hearing the allegation that people were arbitrarily assigned to my section when they really wanted to take the course from the white guy. So the faculty, instead of saying we have already determined this issue last semester, the course will graded as all of the courses, then decided to send it to the grievance committee which held a hearing on the allegations, and not only that, members of the grievance committee met with the students to redraft their petition, and I only found out about that by a fluke.  Again that's why I frequently say divine intervention is there.  It was a total fluke that I found out that a member of the grievance committee was meeting with students to redraft their petition so there was a petition to determine whether I was competent, and that is what incensed me, and even though the conclusion, of course, was quote in my favor, there were two things wrong with it.  It was a wishy-washy conclusion, and two, it never addressed the fundamental issue of treating faculty competency in a grievance hearing, which is unheard of.  The conclusion was wishy-washy in the sense that it said the students had not proven their allegation that I was not competent.  See, it didn't say yes, she's a competent person.  It said well, you haven't given enough proof that she's not competent, which is a totally different issue. So I decided to raise the question with the faculty and demand that they apologize to me, and that is what led to what I call a hearing, which the then dean of the faculty called a special meeting of the faculty. And the result of that nine and a half hour session was a motion was adopted at which the faculty apologized to me for disruption and inconvenience but didn't apologize to me for all the other things. And the other things included my getting notice on a Friday that there will be a grievance committee hearing on a Monday with two allegations and my getting notice one hour before the grievance committee hearing that the students had filed a particular petition against me about class cancellations. And what was so ludicrous is the students had no data about any classes I had canceled, and indeed I was asked for my records on when I had canceled classes so the end result of that was the faculty saying we apologize for the inconvenience and disruption.
Speaker 1: How long a period of time did this occur over?
Speaker 2: Did what occur over?
Speaker 1: The whole process.
Speaker 2: The hearing?
Speaker 1: The challenge.
Speaker 2: Oh, it started in December, and the faculty quote hearing was in June so about six months.
Speaker 1: So it was a whole semester?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was a whole semester. Right. Yes.  The whole semester.
Speaker 1: So this leaves--this is sort of irreparable harm that's happened--there is no--.
Speaker 2: Of course.  Of course.  As a matter of fact, though, I was planning to sue the University of Minnesota, and I had already engaged a couple of lawyers, and one of them said to me, "You are in no physical shape to go through a case against the university at this point.  You need to get some rest before we do this," and that is when I took a visiting professorship, and it was just to rest up preparatory to filing the suit, and then I got an offer to remain at Northwestern [University School of Law, Chicago, Illinois] permanently. So obviously by accepting the Northwestern offer, that then put my case on the back burner.  However, it was not totally lost because a case was filed as a class action by a woman professor against the entire university, not the law school, and persons could file a claim in that class action suit, and I did file a claim, although it really--I got no money, but from my standpoint is if I got a nickel, it was still the matter of vindicating it. So--and that's how I got to Northwestern.
Speaker 1: So who during this time, I mean--someone says, you know, you were in no sort of physical, you know, shape. Who--who is helping you out during this time?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, there is no one on the faculty.  Nobody.  There were students--in fact, the students came to the grievance committee that--the president of the Black Law Students Association came and spoke on my behalf, and there was one woman who ultimately became a law professor, and years later she wrote that--and I'm quoting her--the students behaved like vultures toward Professor Hughes, and I found it by a fluke.  She didn't mention it, but part of what she mentioned was how being a black female professor just put you totally out of the norm, and you didn't even know what was going on.  You were not part of the (unclear), and she was talking about the fact that as a student she knew more what was going on in the school than I ever knew 'cause I was just totally outside the realm.
Speaker 1: Now this was--there were--was this a lot of--was this handled internally within the university, or was this given an publicity outside?
Speaker 2: It was not given any publicity outside.  No.  As a matter of fact, though, the person who was then president of the Minneapolis Urban League came to the hearing, and the dean had a lot of outsiders that he asked to be present, and I requested that a number of outsiders come and sit through the hearing because I believed that they needed to be there too, including someone from the American Association of University Professors, the American Association of Law Schools, many, many other people to sit through this event. And the thing that's so amazing about it to me is that I find it disingenuous to call it a special meeting of the faculty because the way the room was set up is I sat in front on one side.  The then dean sat on the other side, and we faced the faculty that sat out in front of us. So in the essence it was like two combatants facing the jury in front of them and the dean on one side. And I guess now that I'm older I am a little more charitable to the faculty because it's difficult for the faculty when their own dean--they're placed in a position of do they support a fellow faculty member against their own dean.
Story_ID: 8647
Speaker 1: I will say that I ultimately wrote about this [her 1973 conflict with students and faculty at University of Minnesota Law School, Minneapolis, Minnesota], and the person who was dean at the time tried to prevent the University of Michigan Press from publishing the chapter that I wrote about it ['Neither a Whisper Nor a Shout']. And I was required to send a lot of information to the lawyers for the University of Michigan Press who were concerned about being sued for libel, but I had retained a box of material all these years.  I did not even write about it until 1995, twenty, twenty-five years after this happened. This happened in 1973, and so it wasn't until like 1995 or '96 [1996] that I wrote about it, but I had retained a box of materials, and I duplicated all of the stuff and sent it to the lawyers from the University of Michigan Press, and they then gave the okay for me to publish my chapter without a word being changed.
Speaker 2: Now let me ask you--what made you decide to do that? Was it something that you felt you know needed--a story that needed to be told? And I--and I--you know, the title is such a nice--it's sort of--'Neither a Whisper Nor a Shout'.
Speaker 1: Yeah, before I get to tell you why the I think the title is important, actually I wrote the chapter as part of a book ['Rebels in Law: Voices in History of Black Women Lawyers'] where J. Clay Smith, who is a law professor at Howard [University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] was the editor. And I wrote it primarily because he called and said he's putting together a collection of stories of black women lawyers, and he knew I had been the first black woman tenure track professor and thought well, is there a story you'd like to tell. And I suddenly thought, you know, I saved this material all these years, and I probably should do it, but I also wrote it because I believe that the appropriate formulation is something which Andrew Young said.  It is forgive and remember so when something happens, you are to make sure it is remembered, and I wanted the historical record to be out there for future generations to know what happened, and there's also another person who said those who do not know the past are condemned to repeat it so you must know about what happened.
Speaker 2: Now--but the title?
Speaker 1: The title comes from something I thought was very important in a book that someone wrote, and he wrote that frequently people do not listen to what black persons have to say because they are so angry that they shout, and people tune out the shouting or they're so afraid of what they're saying that they're whispering, and it doesn't get caught, and what I want to say is I'm not shouting because enough years have passed, and I have forgiven but remembered, and I'm not afraid to say what I wanna say.  I am just stating the facts so it's like that old TV program--just the facts so it's neither in a whisper nor in a shout. These are just the facts.
Speaker 2: But look at how vulnerable people felt all those years later.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That they tried to stop or have control over the story you wrote.
Speaker 1: Well, what I think fascinating, when the story finally came out, I received a letter from this guy who was the dean at the time and said to me, "Well, I never thought that you were an affirmative action person, and I acknowledge that you had all the credentials, and I was very helpful to you."  Basically he was setting a record for himself as far as I'm concerned, because I believe firmly to this day that that would never have happened to me if the person who was still dean when I was hired was dean at the time.  It also proves how important it is who heads an organization.
Speaker 2: So the--so the--were there ringleaders among the students, and have you ever come across any of them that--?
Speaker 1: Well, I think there was a ringleader in the sense that there was one particular student who helped drum up students to sign a petition against me, and no, I have never run across him since.
Story_ID: 8648
Speaker 1: Now, you did not get blacklisted though. I mean, blackballed or whatever, blackballed. Because, I mean--.
Speaker 2: What does that mean?
Speaker 1: Well you know, a lot of times when you go up against--you weren't, you really didn't go up against--.
Speaker 2: Ah, yes I understand what you're saying. Why is it that Northwestern [University School of Law, Chicago, Illinois] said okay, we'll go ahead and hire this person even though she might be a quote troublemaker?  That is again a tribute to the person who at the time was dean.  Now I want to be very clear.  I'm talking about who was dean then, not the dean now.  The person who was dean then, when he died, someone said at a memorial service for him that he was an advocate of an affirmative action before the phrase affirmative action ever was invented so what it suggests is that he as dean was interested in my coming to Northwestern as a faculty member without paying any attention to all the rumors and the garbage and the whatever, and he was also interested in making sure that Northwestern's faculty was, to use today's phrase, diverse.  There were already on that faculty two black men teaching, one black male as a dean, so in essence people who were just giving lip service will say oh, we got our quote one, but you see at that point in time Northwestern had three black men there already, and I came as a black woman.  In addition, I think it was important who was chair of the appointments committee at this time, and that was the first woman who had been on that faculty, a white woman, but the first woman.  I am the second woman on the faculty at Northwestern Law School.
Speaker 1: So nothing about this experience made you--'cause remember how you say, "I went in to begin, you know, thinking I would practice"--I mean not practice--"I would teach for a couple and then go back to private practice."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So nothing at the time made you just say, "Well this may just not be for me." You know, "I did fine when I was in private practice."
Speaker 2: No.  I think it's just generally probably something that was bred into me is that you do not leave a situation until you have done all you can do with it, and it appeared to me if I had left law teaching, it would have been a concession that they, quote, they won, and I was not gonna let them win.
Speaker 1: Now--so you come out of a horrific experience and Northwestern seems like a very good place at this point, doesn't it?
Speaker 2: I should suggest to you that at Northwestern I am now on my fourth dean, and remember I just said who leads the organization is important so when you said at this point Northwestern is a good place.
Speaker 1: At that time.
Speaker 2: At that time it was.
Speaker 1: At that time.
Speaker 2: At that time it clearly was.  Right.  At that time it was.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. And the courses you're teaching, are they similar to the courses--were you teaching evidence still?
Speaker 2: Evidence is the one course I'm still teaching that I taught when I began.  That's the only one that's the same.  Right.
Speaker 1: Did you take on civil procedures at that time too?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  Civil procedure was something I took on last year because the current dean at Northwestern insisted that I had to do it and added it to my teaching load so that I now teach in one semester what many other faculty teach in the whole year.
Story_ID: 8649
Speaker 1: Was it good being here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, and it wasn't.  It's good in this sense. I was in.
Speaker 1: I mean at the time.  I'm sorry. I'm going back.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yes, it was good because I was here during the time that Harold Washington ran and won as mayor, and I was part of the lawyer's committee for Harold Washington, and he was the first black mayor of Chicago.
Speaker 1: You moved here what year, though?
Speaker 2: 1975.
Speaker 1: 1975, but I mean he ran for mayor in '82 [1982].
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay or '83 [1983].
Speaker 2: So you're asking between '75 and '83?
Speaker 1: I'm trying just to establish.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, between
Speaker 1: I was like--I'm thinking.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  Yeah, between '75 and '82, I mean Chicago was a very different kind of a place for me.  I mean it was a huge big city, and a big black community with all the stratification that entails that I had not been accustomed to.  Chicago was different, but it was also fascinating because when I taught at the University of Minnesota [Law School, Minneapolis, Minnesota], which was after all a state school, and being in a state where the predominant ethnicity is Scandinavian, when I received my class list, I would have many people by the name of Nelson and Olson and Larson, and when I got my class list at Northwestern [University School of Law, Chicago, Illinois], I would see these names that to me were unpronounceable so that was very different fun.  The thing about Northwestern that has been good for me, and part of the reason I chose it when I chose the visiting year, because I had offers from other schools, is that by plane it's an hour from Minneapolis, and my mother [Bessie Mae Hughes] is still alive in Minneapolis, and I have a sister--younger sister [Shirley Hughes] and younger brother [Solomon Hughes, Jr.] are there and my niece is there.
Speaker 1: Now what about the legal community here? And the black legal--it was--oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Black legal community here is--.
Speaker 1: I mean at that time--I'm just trying to understand--.
Speaker 2: No, the black legal community here did not perceive of me as a quote lawyer because I did not practice law even though I joined the Cook County Bar Association.  It was because I did not practice law, and again some people tried to remind me of Northwestern's history, which I did not know, and said that its history was not that sterling if you look back years ago, and so not being from here was some difficulty.
Story_ID: 8650
Speaker 1: Well, the other thing that actually amazed me, because I thought by moving to Chicago [Illinois] that there would be a number of black women lawyers of my generation, and I found out that was not the case, and that's when it really dawned on me that if there were only about 500 black women lawyers in the country in 1970, five years after I got out of law school, it was not so unusual that there weren't a lot of black women lawyers in Chicago that were my generation.
Story_ID: 8651
Speaker 1: How going to [the first conference of the] Helsinki [Accord, Belgrade, Yugoslavia, 1977]--how did that occur?
Speaker 2: Well, what that occurred--that was all because of Justice [Arthur] Goldberg.  He believed that any U.S. delegation ought to have ordinary citizens as well as [U.S.] State Department professionals, and so I was recommended to him as, you know, a person so he had, I think, a Native American who went, and a Hispanic, a guy who was originally from Poland.  I don't think he was a Polish immigrant.  I think his parents had been so that was very fascinating, and in addition, Justice Goldberg chose me to deliver one of the major speeches on behalf of the United States.  What I remember most about that, however, is the State Department professionals wanted to write the speech that I would deliver, and I said no, I will do my own speech.  I also learned the kind of games that people play with you.  I was fairly young and naïve.  People kind of kept me out and about almost all night so I couldn't write my own speech, and I then remember going back to my room and having to stay up all night to write this speech, but I stayed incommunicado until it was time to go to the session and deliver my speech because part of the reason Justice Goldberg had ordinary citizens there is that we were not State Department professionals so we were not delivering the State Department professional speech.  It was an ordinary citizen speech.

Speaker 1: Campaigned for Harold Washington.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And let's talk about that whole thing. What made you get involved in the campaign at that point in time? And--you had been--you know, was there any significance with you stepping down from the National Urban League, 'cause that's the same year that you went to [the first conference of the] Helsinki [Accord, 1977].
Speaker 2: No it wasn't, no, my term was just up.  I had been on there six years, I believe.  Yeah, I had been on there six years.  Right.  Yeah, but obviously to have Harold Washington become the first black mayor of Chicago [Illinois] was significant, and so it was clearly something that I wanted to get involved with, and there was a Lawyer's Committee for Harold Washington so I was able to get active in that.
Speaker 1: So who recruited you to that role? Do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't know that I was recruited.  I think I probably just heard about it and said I want to join, yeah, because I obviously--you should also realize he was my congressman.  I lived in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] at the time, and as a matter of fact, I actually lived around the corner from him so even though I didn't really know him, you know, but he was my congressperson so I had followed him.  Even when he ran for Congress I had gotten some information about him and already knew about him when he decided to run for mayor.
Speaker 1: And so this was--was Chicago strange to you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: See, Chicago I found very strange when I first came here. That's why--and even the--well, okay, because--.
Speaker 2: No, but you're absolutely right, because Chicago, politically, was so alien to me from Minnesota because Minnesota's politics are what many people would call quote good government. And the kind of you have to know somebody, and somebody's gotta vouch for you, and I mean the whole Chicago political business was very alien to me, but what was refreshing is that Harold Washington was really, really a believer about a change.  People, you know, kind of wanted to believe oh, he's just a black machine politician.  No, he was not.  I found that out when I became general counsel to the CTA [Chicago Transit Authority].  It was just amazing.
Speaker 1: So let's talk about you being general counsel--okay, first of all though, let me talk about--talk about the role that the Lawyer's Committee did.
Speaker 2: Well, the Lawyer's Committee did what I thought was very important.  One of the things that they did, for example, was to write memos on every single city department or agency about what its functions were by law, I mean giving the legal background of it and its duties and the history, and I mean those were very important kinds of things for lawyers to do.  Now Harold Washington was a reader.  I have no independent knowledge that he read everything the Lawyer's Committee delivered, but I suspect that he did because he was a person who read things, and so, yeah.  We did amazing memos about each department.
Speaker 1: Now were there some friendships that you developed or associations that you developed as a part of the, you know, work with the campaign that still sort of last today?
Speaker 2: No.  Again, I was kind of an outsider 'cause I don't practice law, and I was not perceived as a practicing lawyer so.
Story_ID: 8653
Speaker 1: Now, so talk about your appointment to [the position of general counsel of the Chicago Transit Authority]--and that was another first.
Speaker 2: Well, it was also absolutely amazing.  Apparently someone at the CTA called the mayor's [Harold Washington] office and asked who would you recommend because we're looking for a lawyer at the CTA, and he gave my name. So I went to the CTA, not knowing what their history was, and they believed that once he gave my name that I was quote the mayor's spokesperson so we were actually operating totally at cross purposes.  I mean I went there.  I brought my resume.  I went around and talked to board members.  They all--and one board member even refused--he said, "Why should I have lunch with this person? The person is gonna be appointed." And I really didn't quite understand.  When I asked, I asked really silly questions, now that I look back on it.  I said oh.  When I was called and asked, you know, if I wanted to consider it, I said "Oh, is there an opening?" And they said "Well, there soon will be."  Well, you know, that didn't mean anything to me.  I didn't realize that what it meant is that the general counsel always just automatically needed to step down when somebody new became mayor. So the most important thing, though, is that after I got to the CTA is that people kept coming up to me asking me about what does Mayor Washington want on X, Y, and Z or whatever, and it finally dawned on me that they thought that I was the mayor's person.  I had no idea what the mayor thought about X, Y, and Z, and indeed the mayor never called me before I went to the CTA.  I mean, he didn't call me and say I'm gonna recommend your name.  I mean he didn't even tell me that, and he didn't tell about anything, and so when they kept talking about what does the mayor wanna do about this, that, and the other thing, I kept saying "Why don't you call the mayor?  I mean I don't know that."  There was a mismatch entirely because I thought I was going to be a general counsel, and they thought I was coming to be a political messenger. But it was a fascinating experience, and obviously by the election of Harold Washington, it meant that I was the first black general counsel they'd ever had, the first woman general counsel they'd ever had, and at the time the highest ranking black person they'd ever had, and then subsequently they got a black chairman of the board, and, you know, black people in all kinds of other positions but at the time amazing.
Speaker 1: So what was that experiece like, because this is your--you've not had that type of position before in your career, and you had been sort of in the throes of academia.
Speaker 2: Well, not only that.  I mean I had practiced law.  I had also been in the legal department of Continental Illinois National Bank so I actually had had non-academic legal experience, but I had never worked in a Chicago political bureaucracy, and what one person told me after I went, he said you know, you are going to a place that is a cesspool, and he also said it is a Chicago political bureaucracy.  I did not know what that meant until I got there and really found out.  I am pleased that I was able to make some changes in the sense of hiring more African Americans, more women, making some changes to more professionalize some things, but I think that probably was, and my family clearly believes, that it was the reason I had my first stroke so it was an interesting experience.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you--it was very stressful.
Speaker 2: Very stressful.
Speaker 1: And you were wanting to do a good job.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, and what I considered a good job was to be a good lawyer.  For example, an issue came up that the board members asked me about a legal opinion.  I researched the law, reported back to them what the legal opinion was, and they were like no, that's not the opinion we want, and so again it was a cross purpose 'cause I was like well, you can't tell me what opinion you want.  I have to figure out what the law is.  They were accustomed to having a lawyer who would pronounce what the political mechanism wanted them to pronounce, and that was not me so it was difficult.  It was difficult for me, and again now that I'm older and wiser I can realize how difficult it was for them because they also didn't really understand how different a person Harold Washington was.  You know, it was hard for them to understand that he and I didn't talk.  He didn't tell me he was recommending me.  I was not quote his person so.
Speaker 1: See, but that's the whole difference between where you had come from and Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: That's--that was the difference, that's right. Now, are there things--what did you find when you got there? You know, you said, it was--you know, what, what was the cesspool really like?
Speaker 2: Well, for one, they were not accustomed to a general counsel who actually came to the office and worked.  Now it's true I retained my appointment as a professor, but I taught one class, and all the rest of the time I was at the CTA.  Well, that was totally unusual.  I mean it was not usual to have a general counsel who was hands-on, and that created a little bit of difficulty.  In addition, the departments that reported to the general counsel were partially done for political reasons, and I was not aware of it.  For example, the labor relations department reported to the general counsel, but it wasn't really to report to the general counsel.  It was because the decisions about labor and union contracts were all gonna be political decisions, and so I needed to report to the political person for the mayor, and I was not the mayor's political person. So that was a little bit of a bone of contention. But ultimately, you know, while Harold Washington was mayor, the person who had been chairperson under Jane Byrne, the prior mayor of Chicago, ultimately had to step down as chairperson himself.
Speaker 1: Now who was the chairperson at that time?
Speaker 2: Michael Cardilli.
Speaker 1: Michael Cardilli. And then was Clark Burrus.
Speaker 2: No, not Clark Burrus.  Then Walter Clark.
Speaker 1: Walter Clark.  Oh, Walter Clark.
Speaker 2: Walter Clark.
Speaker 1: That would have been interesting then.  We've interviewed--he's--okay, that would have--so how was that combination then?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was very--it was great.  I mean it was great 'cause Walter Clark was also not a political hack.
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.
Speaker 2: Right.  No, he was not a political hack, and so having him as the chairperson to report to allowed me to act as a lawyer.
Speaker 1: So you--there were--and he came out of a corporate environment and had--so the thing is--so did you find--both of you find this very-- a very strange place to operate , and did it take a long time to get down deep in the organization?
Speaker 2: Well, I never got down deep in the organization, and again I have no idea, you know, whether he did or did not.  I just--I really am not sure about it.  All I know is I was never able to make the really in-depth changes that I wanted to make.  I mean some, but they took an awful toll.
Speaker 1: Now you were smoking at the time too.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now--and working like a fiend.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 8654
Speaker 1: You had your stroke when you--after you stepped down though, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: No, I was still at the CTA [Chicago Transit Authority as general counsel].  No, I was at the CTA when I had my first stroke, and so it was the stroke that caused me to leave the CTA 'cause I had one stroke each September for three years in a row.  I had three strokes every September--1980, 1981, 1982.
Speaker 1: That's--what was--?
Speaker 2: Was it '80 or '90 [1990]?  No, it was '90.  I'm sorry.  It was 1990--1990, 1991, 1992 because it's now been ten years.
Speaker 1: So now, Joyce, when this happened to you--I mean this--you know, because you have been, you know, you know, a hard-charging professional. What does this do to you? I mean what does--because--.
Speaker 2: Well, I will have to tell you that I probably was in a state of denial for the first stroke, and indeed I essentially saw myself as kind of still being in charge.  I was paralyzed on the right side from the first stroke, and I worked very hard to get my movement back and then had the second stroke.  When I had the third stroke, the third stroke was the one that compromised my hearing on the right side.  I like to tell people that the Lord tried to get my attention, and I thought that I was in control, and I would work hard, and I'd get all my movement back, and it's true I did that, but when you get a hearing loss, there is nothing anyone can do about that, and as a matter of fact, I said well, the Lord got my attention 'cause He said this lady's not paying any attention to me so I'm gonna do something that she has no control over.  The doctors can tell her, and they did, we have no control over that, and I think it was good because it suggested two things to me. One, that I had to change my ways, but also that life goes on, and again I credit my sister Toni [Hughes], and if I can just share this vignette with you. In the first stroke, I was in a wheelchair, and I was wheeled from the regular hospital down to the rehabilitation unit.  I got to the rehabilitation unit, and it had bars on the walls, and my sister Toni said to me, "Joyce, you're only paralyzed on one side.  I want you to get out of that wheelchair and hang on to this bar and walk down this hospital corridor," and I did.  Then when I got a little more movement back, and I was still wearing a brace on my leg, she arranged to get a pass to take me out of the hospital and go see a play, and in part, that was to suggest to me that yes, you're --I was walking slowly and with a brace and the whole thing at the time, but life goes on, and you can continue on, and so I think that was very important, and it helped me to now say to myself about anything that comes up is it worth dying for?  There is absolutely nothing that has happened since those strokes that I can answer yes to, and so whatever challenges that are thrown my way, whenever someone is trying to--essentially doesn't like where I am, I ask myself is it worth dying for, and I answer no, but it also means I know I can survive.
Story_ID: 8655
Speaker 1: I bet you were happy, though, you actually ultimately were on the tenure track at the time.
Speaker 2: Oh, if I were not a tenure professor right this moment, I would not be at Northwestern [University School of Law, Chicago, Illinois].  There is no question about that, you know.  You see, if a person is tenured, then deans can find other ways to try to get rid of you, including your salary, the courses you teach, the hours you teach, your secretarial support, and so if a dean really does want tenured people to leave, he or she can do a lot of things to that tenured person that will just have that person say oh, well, I throw in the towel.  I'll leave.  Yes, but there's no question in my mind that absent tenure I would not be where I am.  In addition, tenure does permit you to speak out, and you cannot be fired for what you say, and it's true.  I did make a statement that many, many people said we believe in what you said, but you better be careful about what you say, and basically the statement was simply this.  Color doesn't determine who's black.  I mean it seems like such an obvious thing, but a lot of Caucasians don't know that, that color is not the determinant of who's black.
Speaker 1: Why don't you talk about the circumstances behind this statement?
Speaker 2: Well, the circumstances behind it were that the school wanted to hire a woman who was the wife of a tenure track African American professor.  Tenure track--he was not yet tenured.  But this person people perceived of as being black in color, but this person was a product of an Australian father and a Cuban mother, and so when they said well, we ought to come with the person who's black, I said I don't think you can do that because color is not what decides who is black. And indeed there are people who are as white as any person in this room, but they are black, and the same token, there are people who are darker than my own mother [Bessie Mae Hughes]--for example, East Indians--but they're not black, and she is.  So I said basically the appreciation was that color doesn't determine who's black.  There are other things that determine that, black in the sense of being--and I'm using black with a capital B, and I wanna be clear that the Chicago Manual on Style says you can capitalize B when you're talking about ethnicity, so I'm talking about black to encompass African Americans, people with black skins who are not African-Americans in the sense they were not born here so that's what I mean.
Speaker 1: Did you take some--did you experience fallout from that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  The current dean was the chair of the appointments committee that was pushing for the appointment of this woman, and as a matter of fact, the woman herself decided that she did not want to take a visiting offer to the school. And the media was told that it was my position and that I required--I had some standard, and unfortunately, you need to have seen the movie way back when 'cause way back when was a movie where the standard phrase is, "is that black enough for you?"  So basically they were saying well, it wasn't black enough for me, but that--I was incensed by that because people using that phrase--one, had never seen the movie and didn't know what that means, but even if they hadn't seen the movie, it wasn't about your color, and it also wasn't about a standard line that you have to have as a black person.  Indeed, this woman's husband who was black, in the sense of being an African American, was exceedingly conservative and a law and economics person, which in the legal discipline is a very conservative discipline. So that wasn't the issue, but yes, I experienced some fallout including very, very bad press, including the 'Wall Street Journal' who wrote a terrible editorial, but of course, they never called me.  The 'Chronicle of Higher Education' ran something, so unfortunately people saw that as my taking a position against a quote black person, but since one could not speak about matters of appointments and what went on within the faculty meeting, I never spoke about it to anybody in the press.
Speaker 1: And you also--but you were saying something else about being black in American, and I'm wondering--when you--let's say--.
Speaker 2: I was also saying this, that if, for example, an institution decides to have three black people, all three black people should not be of political philosophy C--for conservative--but C. Because the institution may have forty white people, and those forty white people who run the spectrum, that it's a false and misleading notion, particularly in an educational institution, if all black people fit one mold because it suggests to students there's only one way to be black. So my issue is not only an issue about who is black in the sense of being African American or a black-skinned naturalized American, but also about intellectual diversity. And the unfortunate thing is that many people now believe that you now have diversity if you have, and I'm quoting from another law professor, if you have a black person whose skin is black whose thoughts are white. And in my judgment that is not diversity.
Story_ID: 8656
Speaker 1: Oh, well, first, race is an artificial societally-based construct.  It has no biological meaning whatsoever.  I mean that's what all the natural scientists will tell us. So my point, though, about who is black, and I like to use the word black, and in fact, I've had arguments with people about it is that the term African American is designed to speak to persons born in the United States who are of the quote black, and I'm putting race in quotes so for example, it would not include people like former students of mine who are Jamaican.  They're black in skin color.  They're not even naturalized citizens.  Or a student of mine who is Panamanian, a citizen, but not born in the U.S., you see, 'cause Panamanians can be citizens or you can be Puerto Rican, and indeed a Puerto Rican woman wrote an article about this and said hey, listen, people, black is not only skin color. So she's a Puerto Rican, but her skin color is black so I like to use the word black with a capital B to embrace all of those people I've just discussed.  I do think that whether or not one considers oneself black is in part a determination of culture.  For example, there is a young woman actually in Chicago [Illinois] who is the granddaughter of a person who was a judge.  When I first saw the young woman myself, I thought this young woman has to spend a lot of time suggesting to people that she's black.  She was a natural blonde with blue eyes.  I also had a student and--who is the grandson of the first black tenured professor at University of Chicago.  Only by his deciding to tell you that he is black would anyone consider him black so my whole point about that is don't just see somebody's color and decide that they're quote black people.
Story_ID: 8657
Speaker 1: I wanna go back and--I mean, your becoming, you know, a tenured, first black tenured professor--or even becoming the first faculty member, but on the tenure track--was met with a lot of hoopla, and there have been a lot of firsts. And when they look back they see all the progeny they've created. And I look, you know, when I see--what you can recount, I don't know if there's the progeny there as much. I mean, there's progeny.
Speaker 2: But there--there is in this sense.  I wish I had kept the article.  I picked up the magazine of United Negro College Fund, which highlighted various students in the United Negro College Fund colleges, and the students were talking about what they plan to do with their life, et cetera, and I read this article where a young woman who was then a sophomore in college saying well, what I plan to do in life is to go to law school and then become a law professor.  When I read that, I said that's the progeny, you see, because here is this young woman who has in her vision about what she wants to do in life that she's gonna be a law professor.  For her it's not a big deal.  In addition, I just got a letter from a woman who became the first black woman tenured faculty member at Wayne State [University] Law School in Detroit [Michigan], and she was talking about--and it was a great, you know, conversation I had with her before then.  And I guess what I really find fantastic is that there are people doing it.  Now when I started, there were no black women tenure track law professors at any white school in the country.  None.  Now there are almost 300.  That is really a tiny, tiny drop in the bucket, but there are 300 as opposed to none when I started. And I think somebody has to start for it to just be a natural part of one's consciousness so when I read this article on this young woman, I thought she probably doesn't even know who Cybill Jones Dedman was, who was the first black woman at North Carolina Central [University, Durham, North Carolina] now, but believe it or not, there were black women law professors in the 1800s.  They were not ad [adjunct].  They were not tenure track professors, but they were black women law professors in the 1800s so somebody has to do it, you know, to know about those things.
Speaker 1: And when you look at--are you happy about the career you've had, and teaching in the academic field?
Speaker 2: What I think is fascinating, I do think being a professor is what I should be doing. And I thought about that just recently because I like the intellectual challenge, and I also am a person who likes the fact that a professor--excuse me--a professor basically works alone.  I couldn't work in a corporate environment--excuse me--where there's a hierarchy I have to fit in.  This way, I walk into my classroom, and I can teach what I wanna teach and the way I wanna teach.  I only have to go to faculty meetings once a month so being a professor suits me.  I also can write.
Story_ID: 8658
Speaker 1: What's rewarding about being a professor is when you see persons who have been your students and see what they've done with their lives.  Now you realize that they've had a lot of instructors throughout their lives so when I--obviously you cannot say I'm taking credit for everything. But for example, just recently I went to Minnesota, and my mother was going to do a will, and a former student of mine--and we went to his office for it, and it was just amazing to me, now particularly because he graduated back in, oh, I think '78 [1978] or something, so I mean this is one of my first students so there isn't a huge age difference, but it was just great to see him.  I think that's important. Then last night was the orientation dinner for Northwestern [University] Law School [Chicago, Illinois]. And at orientation all the faculty were asked to come up on stage--excuse me--so students can see you, and initially I thought why are we all marching up and lining up?  This student said to me--he was a male, but he said, "I cannot began to tell you how significant it was to me and to others who look like me or others with my color to be able to see somebody walk across that stage who represents us."  He said, "We could see ourselves in you," and then this was a man so it wasn't, you know, and it was about color.  It was about the fact that--and I thought this is also partly why I'm still doing what I'm doing because it's still important for those students.  And I've oftentimes said it isn't the intellectual capacity that pulls students down or why they don't do well.  It's about how they feel about themselves.  You know, I don't think--it's really not the difference. And one of the things that I've oftentimes said, I can tell which students have gone to black colleges because they walk into law school with a sense of self that they've acquired from four years at a black college. And I'm not saying that students who didn't go to black colleges don't have it--they do have it.  But it's just so apparent, like on day one, you know.  With others, you know, you can eventually see it, but part of it is that these students understand--who went to black colleges--they understand if they haven't done well that they cannot claim racism.  And when they have done well, they know they're just as good as anybody else.  The problem so often for blacks is that they have to worry about well, did I really do it on my own or did they give it to me?  Well, I'll be honest with you.  I can tell you, and I'm sixty-one years old.  I will tell you with no hesitation everything I have I've done on my own.  They didn't give any of this to me so whatever credentials you wanna put behind my name, I know it's me, and I hold on to that, and I think that's very important for people to have that internal sense of self and--regardless, because people will continually try to make you feel less than. And I mean it doesn't just happen to black people.  It happens to everybody, but it's more pronounced because everything else around allows white people to have positive vibes. So if one thing puts them down, they get positive vibes elsewhere. The problem with black people is we don't get enough positive vibes coming all the time so one has to have them internally.
Speaker 2: And let me ask--so--do you think law is a profession that blacks should go into?
Speaker 1: Oh, certainly.  Oh, certainly.
Speaker 2: Okay. And why is it a good career?
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's a good career because people believe that if you have a law degree that you know how to do things.  You see, I mean you don't have to practice law.  I mean there are a lot of people who don't want to practice law, but having that law degree to the outside world kind of gives them some little cachet.  It's the same thing with, you know, a medical degree.  I mean just 'cause you have a medical degree doesn't mean you're so bright and know anything, but people will sit up and think.  They'll listen if somebody says well, I have a medical degree so I think the law degree does that as well.
Story_ID: 8659
Speaker 1: What do you think is one--is the most--one of the most significant things to happen in the legal community in the last, you know, forty--.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, the most significant thing was the 'Brown v. Board of Education' decision.  Now I know that there are white researchers who disagree.  As a matter of fact, I've heard their presentations, and even when I was in law school there were white people who thought it was a terrible decision, and, you know, there's all kinds of things about it, and I won't even get into that.  The reason it's the most significant is that that decision opened up the possibility of so much for so many people that went beyond education.  Take golf, for example.  You see, blacks could not play even in public golf courses, but after 'Brown v. the Board of Education' the decisions--and one of them is 'Holmes v. Atlanta'.  [Hamilton] Holmes was a guy who my dad [Solomon Hughes, Sr.] knew who actually was the father of the guy who integrated the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia], but Holmes' father, he sued Atlanta, but 'Brown v. the Board of Education' was decided, they said oh, it was a public accommodation.  You have to open it up, I mean, so it was just like zap so yes, 'Brown v. Board of Education' is the most significant decision in terms of what it's opened up.  Now obviously there is now a retreat going on, but 'Brown' is still there for a lot of things.
Speaker 1: Okay--O. J. Simpson case?
Speaker 2: Oh, let me tell you something about the O. J. Simpson case.  I teach evidence, and there were a lot of things in that case that are evidentiary issues, and so it would be a great case to use to show evidence issues.  I tried it once, and I realized that because O. J. Simpson is black and I'm black, students perceived my position on evidentiary issues to be totally affected by race.  They would not look at the evidentiary issues, and you see many people believe that O. J. should have been convicted or whatever.  It's not about that.  I was talking about evidence issues, and indeed I watched the trial looking at the evidence issues.  I read everything.  There's a book out about the evidence issues, but because of race, I do not use O. J. to talk about evidentiary issues although it is a celebrated case just like the case with Sam Sheppard was a celebrated case of its generation.  The other thing I wanna say about O. J. is the criminal justice system says that you are not guilty unless you are proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  He was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt so, of course, he should have been acquitted, and people say ah, that's just because of race.  No, it has nothing to do with race.  Quite often defendants who are convicted are convicted because they are black, and they do not have the resources to spend which O. J. had to spend to show that you could not prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, and what's the difference between O. J. and Claus von Bulow?  Claus von Bulow is this rich white man who everybody believed killed his wife, but he got off.  Well, they didn't prove it beyond a reasonable doubt so I don't understand why people think something's so strange that O. J. got off and Claus von Bulow also got off. And I want to make very clear, as I often have to tell people, O. J. is not a hero in the black community.  I mean maybe to people who follow sports, but I mean he's not somebody that, you know, everybody thought oh, yeah, you know, I'm rooting for him here. And I also told people don't you think it's a little bit strange that this jury which had a number of black women on it found him not guilty 'cause if you thought about it and you really want to say race plays a role, those black women could have been mad at this black man who was married to a white woman and said okay, we're gonna get him. So I mean your whole notion to me is skewed and those people who talk about it was race, but you're barking up the wrong tree.  If you really wanna talk about race, then he should have been convicted by a group of black women so.
Speaker 1: Now what about this recent election [2000 Presidential Election], legally?
Speaker 2: From a legal standpoint the [U.S.] Supreme Court stole that election, but more importantly I think it's a very good example that the Supreme Court will do that which it wants to do, and there is no such thing as this abstract law out there that you can pluck down like, I said, plucking an apple from a tree.  That the Supreme Court wanted to reach that result, and they did it in George [W.] Bush's case ['Bush v. Gore'], and I won't go into all the details about equal protection and the 14th Amendment, but they took some positions in that case that are totally contrary to positions they've taken otherwise.  Take one, for example.  If you talk about states' rights, this Supreme Court, to the extent it is pro states' rights, should have upheld the Florida Supreme Court.  The state did that.  The state didn't do anything wrong, and yet they overturned the state so I have not followed it in detail, but I know a number of people have written articles to suggest that the Supreme Court dealt itself a severe self-inflicted wound by its decision in 'Bush v. Gore'.

Speaker 1: Do you have hopes or concerns for the black community? I mean the black community is in a much different state when you first started off.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what do you think has, you know--.
Speaker 2: I'm ambivalent, and I think that's a good question because I've asked myself this.  You know, there are a number of young people, young black people, who don't necessarily have a perception of themselves as black people.  That is, they think of themselves in a very individualistic notion and don't necessarily see that they're part of a continuum that got them where they are, and so I worry about the fact that we may end up with too many of those, but unfortunately I believe that there's always gonna be stark reality, and the stark reality is that everybody black is gonna be brought back to their blackness by what happens externally.

Speaker 1: Who do you think has been most significant in the black community. Do you have--you know, there's been this whole issue of leaders or not leaders, or who have you most admired over the years?
Speaker 2: Me, personally? In a way this is a difficult question to answer, and I'll tell you why and put it in context.  Recently a group of law professors were talking, and they wanted people to say who were their mentors, and I said "My mother [Bessie Mae Hughes]", and people said "Oh, no, no, no, we're not talking about that.  We're asking about a mentor."  And I said "Yes, but a mentor is someone who guides you, shows you which way you should go, gives you a direction, and helps you along that way.  That's my mother so she's my mentor."  I think the same thing is true when you ask about heroes in the black community.  I also was raised to not be a hero worshipper, and so it's difficult for me to come up with somebody to say they're a hero.  I can talk about people whose contributions I think were extraordinary and significant, and to the extent that I think that 'Brown [v. Board of Education'] was a significant decision, I think it's Thurgood Marshall, and also when you read his opinions on the [U.S.] Supreme Court, he was significant.  But I guess that would be the closest I would come to saying a hero.  I'm not sure, though, that I would even call him a hero.  I mean I--yeah, I'll leave it at that.

Speaker 1: When you think about the importance that your family--you know, they have played in your life, and I know you recently lost your sister [Toni Hughes], and it seemed as if you were almost best friends--I mean, that you were in many ways best friends.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: My question is--family--the role family has played in the making of Joyce Hughes, the person.
Speaker 2: You know, there's an old expression that family is the place where you go and they have to take you in, and in a sense I guess that is probably true because you know that what--at least I know that whatever happens to me in the external world, I will always have my family's support, but what's I think even greater about that is my mother [Bessie Mae Hughes].  My mother is not gonna--she will support you to the outside world, right or wrong, but if she believes something needs correcting, when you get back inside that house, she's gonna correct it, and so I think that's also good.  I mean she's not a knee-jerk, you know, I will--if you go out and kill five people, you know, I'm  gonna say you didn't do it.  She's not knee-jerk in that sense, but she's gonna support you outside and then help you to correct whatever you need correcting. And I--my hat's off to my father [Solomon Hughes, Sr.] because I think he made a decision that was for his children.  I mean life would have been a lot better for him to stay in Alabama to work at a country club, even if it was a segregated country club.  You see, he could play golf, and he didn't have to put up with a lot of stuff because he was a good golf player, and therefore people were not gonna treat him totally, you know, you boy there.  But he made the decision to forego all that and move north so his daughters--at that time it was just the two of us--so his daughters, as he said, could play in the public parks and go to the schools.

Speaker 1: What do consider the Hughes tradition?
Speaker 2: Excellence, striving for excellence, at least.
Speaker 1: And what do you want to have as your legacy?
Speaker 2: That is a very fascinating question you've asked me, and I can't answer it.  The reason I can't answer it is because when my sister [Toni Hughes] died, her son preached her eulogy.  Her daughter did a magnificent program that I had never seen like before.  It was in full color.  It had a photo montage all in color.  It was just--it didn't look like a funeral program so someone said to me, "Well, it's unfortunate you don't have any children, you know, to"--'cause Toni's children are her legacy.  And I thought about that, and I thought well, I guess I would have to worry about my legacy, but in this sense I don't because I've come to understand that part of what teaching is about is you impact lives of people, and so as far as I'm concerned that the fact that there will be people doing things after I'm gone that--whose lives I impacted in some way will be my legacy.  Even the fact that there are--that this young lady who I don't even know wants to be a law professor, I mean I see that, you know, as part of my legacy even though she doesn't know about me, and I don't know her name

Speaker 1: What do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: I guess I need to find one word for it, but it is--I guess the minister says it best.  When they give you a lemon, make lemonade.  That's a capsulized version of it.  I'm not sure.  I'll have to figure out what I would say, but because I gave--because I know that phrase and the ministers come up with it, make lemonade.
