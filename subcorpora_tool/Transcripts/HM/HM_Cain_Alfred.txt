Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: I'm Alfred E. Cain, C-A-I-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Do you need the Alfred spelled?
Speaker 1: It's the regular way?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now what, what does the E stand for?
Speaker 2: Earl.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Date, Octo--is October 5th, 1921, in Warrior, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, that's an interesting name, Warrior, Alabama.
Speaker 2: It's--
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind that name?
Speaker 2: It's, it was just a, there's a river called the [Black] Warrior River that runs through that part of town.  About that date of birth, my birth certificate, which I didn't see until I was in the [U.S. military] service, gives it as October 4th.  And there's a reason: I apparently was born (laughter), the midwife went to work on the fourth (laughter).  I was born she left the next morning, so.  You know, history will show that I was born on the fourth, but (laughter) actually I was born on--the family always celebrated the 5th.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And, and what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Right now I'm retired.  I have work most of my work time as an editor and public relations specialist.
Speaker 1: You had, like, some experience as, as a performer, too, right, as a singer?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, yes, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was all avocational (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, sir, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: December 15th, 2004.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in Chicago [Illinois] at 1900 South Michigan [Avenue].

Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight, People magazine-ish type questions that I am compelled to ask, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, sir, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I'd have to say it's, it's fish.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Any kind of fish.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, blue is my favorite color.
Speaker 1: All right, a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Oh, believe it or not, it's summer (laughter).
Speaker 1: I believe it (laughter).  Now do, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Nowadays, it's a matter of just going somewhere (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is, so you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No.  I, I think I was people who changes his favorite (laughter) sayings with the times.  You know, the things that I used to think (unclear) no longer appeal to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 304340
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Louis Cain] side, and we'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, mother's name is Helen, H-E-L-E-N, Hazel Moore, M-O-O-R-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Wetumpka, Alabama, W-E-T-U-M-P-K-A.
Speaker 1: Okay, in what, what year?
Speaker 2: December 23rd, 1900.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, and what, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back does that history go, and--
Speaker 2: Not, not very much.  I knew, I knew my grandmother [Rosa Naomi Redrick], and that's as far as my personal awareness of family.  I knew there was a--her mother was a--(unclear), but I don't know anything really about her.
Speaker 1: Are there any, any stories about, do they talk about slavery or, or Reconstruction or any of those kind of stories on your mother's, on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: No.  My, my grandmother never talked of slavery, and of course, my mother didn't.  But I, I guess she was aware of it.  My, that great-grandmother I mentioned is, was part Indian [Native American] I understand.
Speaker 1: Okay, but there are no stories passed down the family about how the family got its name or how, you know--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --how they ended up in that part of the country or, or any of that?
Speaker 2: Evidently, we were pretty Alabama bound, but, and that's as much as I knew of them.
Story_ID: 304341
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Helen Moore] come from a large family?
Speaker 2: Yes, my [maternal] grandmother [Rosa Naomi Redrick] had a total of eleven children.  And there's a picture of my grandmother at her eightieth birthday party with all of the children that were still alive.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did your mother, did she talk about growing, did, did she grow up in, in wa--
Speaker 2: Alabama?
Speaker 1: --wa, Wetempka [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Well, in various parts of Alabama.  I, I heard them talk often of Anniston, Alabama.  And that maybe have been because my grandmother remarried a man who was a presiding elder of the [African] Methodist Episcopal [A.M.E.] church at that time, Reverend Noah Redrick, R-E-D-R-I-C-K.
Speaker 1: What was the, was that C.M.E. [Christian Methodist Episcopal] or the, or the--
Speaker 2: No, A.M.E.
Speaker 1: A.M.E.?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's Anniston, Alabama.  That's where that bus was, was set on fire in during the Civil Rights Movement then in Anniston, yeah.  So, well, did she have a chance to go to school when she grew up, your mother?
Speaker 2: Oh, my mother did, yes, and, and my grandmother did, too, apparently.  As a matter of fact, one of my memories of my grandmother was she was always doing those long, reciting those long poets, poems.  They called the elocutions (laughter), and--
Speaker 1: Oh, that's something.  Did she, do, do you know who some, what, who she was quoting or who, or did she write 'em herself, or?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the titles I remember is 'Curfew Shall Not Ring Tonight' ['Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight,' Rose Hartwick Thorpe].  And that was very animated.  It was a to and fro and that sort of thing.  Now who wrote that, never occurred to me to ask (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so, was that like a, you know, a pretty regular feature of being at home, you know, listening to elocutions and recite--
Speaker 2: Pretty much, or you know, interesting table conversation about family mainly.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you remember any good conversations about family members or, or about, you know?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (laughter).  The, the family joke was, was my grandmother's eleven children.  And there, ever so often there would be some trouble with other kids.  And according to granny, they would say that there was, here comes Helen Moore, Johnny Moore [ph.], T.A. Moore [ph.] (laughter), and more still a comin'.  That's just one of the little formulations I remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, here come some more, huh (laughter).
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Here come some more (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 304342
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Louis, and he was called Rookie (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, was it L-E-W-I-S--
Speaker 2: That's
Speaker 1: --or L-O--
Speaker 2: L, L-O-U-I-S.
Speaker 1: L-O-U-I-S, okay; Louis Cain?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But he had the nickname Rookie to other folks.
Speaker 1: Now, how did he get that name?
Speaker 2: Oh, he loved playing baseball.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so, did he play any organized baseball or just--
Speaker 2: No, no, just sandlot, pickup games.  He was, and you'll find that, that, that's a big hole in my story, because after my parents divorced, I lost any real contact with him.  But I know he was trained as a shoemaker at Tuskegee [Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so he had a chance to go to Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Helen Moore] go to college at all?
Speaker 2: No, my mother did not.  I don't think my mother ever got beyond the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your father went to Tuskegee and trained as a shoemaker.
Speaker 2: You know, that was pretty much the institute, so, of course, you were learning skills but not necessarily getting into the arts and what have you.
Story_ID: 304343
Speaker 1: What do you know about your, the history of your father's [Louis Cain] family?  Is there any more that you know about, about them?
Speaker 2: Not, not a whole about them either.  I, I knew my [paternal] grandfather, his dad.  As a matter of fact, I knew his parents as far as that's concerned, but--and my grandfather lived in a little town called, a little town, it's the county seat called Athens, Alabama.  And one of the stories was that for a number of years he was something of a, of a policeman.  But he made the mistake of assuming that he was to police outside the black communities (laughter).
Speaker 1: So he wasn't allowed to police white people, in other words, is that what you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  And he's, he, he was pretty well known in that town.  Judge--oh, I'm have, I'm having a problem with this name now, but he's a judge here [Chicago, Illinois], [HistoryMaker R. Eugene] Pincham.  That's who--
Speaker 1: R. Eugene Pincham--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I know once I made reference to, to my grandfather, and he later told me: "I knew your (laughter), I knew Doc Cain.  He was something of a community character."
Speaker 1: Okay, they, they called him Doctor Cain?
Speaker 2: Doc.
Speaker 1: Doc Cain, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, did you ever meet him?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, when my parents were going through all this rigmarole, I lived with him.  And he's one of the great influences in my life as--
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what, what did he do to in, I mean how did he in, in, influence you?  What did you pick up on?
Speaker 2: Basically, (laughter) I, I, I think one the, his salty expressions was, when he'd get annoyed with--and he had a short temper--(laughter) he'd say "I'm gonna hit you so hard you're gonna fart 'Home Sweet Home' without missing a note," (laughter).  But, on the other hand, at church on Sunday nobody could pray (laughter) more meaningfully than he.  He was a farmer, essentially, and one of those pictures in there you'll see me on a horse.  That was one of his horses, Old Frank.  He was just a great guy--although I, spent most of the time being scared of him but loved him, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you really spent, did you spend more time with him than you did with your father, or, or did you--
Speaker 2: In, in a way, yes, because, you know, in those early years, they would drop me in, in Athens.  And my parents went to live in Pennsylvania for a while, came and got me, took me to Pennsylvania (laughter), and took me back down to the South (laughter).  They decided they still couldn't make a go of it.
Story_ID: 304344
Speaker 1: Now tell me what's your, your earliest childhood memory?  Do you have an earliest memory?
Speaker 2: Believe it or not, it, the thing I, I keep remembering is how we had been somewhere, and I, I remember being on the train, and this was in Alabama, and it was in the spring.  And I, this is the first time I noticed flowers and, and you know, all the things that happen in the spring.  I was just bowled over by it.  I did, years later, I did a little piece on those days as I recalled them.
Story_ID: 304345
Speaker 1: Do you have any siblings?
Speaker 2: Yes--but I don't know 'em (laugher).  My father [Louis Cain] remarried, and there's a whole other family that, that I'm not really acquainted with.
Speaker 1: Were they, were they conceived at, well, in, at, in Alabama?  Did, did they grow up in Alabama?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --um-hm, right.  My last contact with dad, which was in 1971--no, it was 1970--he was living still in, in Bessemer [Alabama], which is a suburb of Birmingham [Alabama] also.
Speaker 1: All right.  Right, now, now you didn't, you didn't grow up completely in Alabama, right?  You, you grew up, you, you lived there part of, up to a certain age, and then you moved, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I left Alabama as, for all intent and purposes, at the age of ten, at least I celebrated my tenth birthday in New York [New York] after all that.  And oh, when I graduated junior high [Nathan Hale Junior High School, Brooklyn, New York], I had expressed an interest in going back to Alabama to attend school there, Trinity [School, Athens, Alabama].  And it was a K [kindergarten] through high school place run by the American Missionary Association [AMA], the folks who, who established Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and Talladega [College, Talladega, Alabama] and some of those other things.  And it was just a wonderful school as far as I was concerned.  And I was back living with my grandparents there.  And my mother [Helen Moore] summoned me home because the (laughter) truant officers were looking for me in New York.  And that was a--she didn't know how to handle the situation.  I'm sure anybody else would have called on the local politician and got that squashed.  But she was afraid and sent for me to come home, and that's where I stayed (laughter).
Story_ID: 304346
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds.  Well, sight was that I can recall, in the spring I chopped cotton on my [paternal] grandfather's [Doc Cain] place.  And in the fall I picked cotton on my grandfather's place.  I remember my step-grandmother cooking all sorts of wonderful things.  But cooking seemed to have been a family occupation, almost a preoccupation.  My mother [Helen Moore] was a, never happier than when she was preparing fancy food.  And after her death, I was at her church [Triumph Church of the New Age] in New York [New York] once, and one of the women said to me, you know, "Your mother did my last, made my wedding her last catering job."  Although she wasn't a caterer (laughter), but that was how they viewed her at her church.  And then of course, growing up in New York [New York], I, I think of things like my first trip to Coney Island [New York, New York], which was a mind-blowing event.  I had never been that close to the [Atlantic] Ocean before.  That was a thrill.  And, and I guess one of the most meaningful things was that after I was in school there, we used to have what they call field days.  And we went to a stadium [Thompson Stadium] in, on Staten Island [New York, New York], which meant that we had to take a ferry from Brooklyn [New York, New York] to Staten Island.  And one of the sights along the way was the Statue of Liberty [New York, New York].  It's, you know, it's very impressive to me how, how that thing could stand in all that water (laughter).
Story_ID: 304347
Speaker 1: Do you know the story of how your parents [Helen Moore and Louis Cain] met in the first place, or?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, no.
Speaker 2: My mother never talk about the, as a matter of fact, no, she never talked about that, as a matter of fact.   And my dad, I used to spend, for a few years I spent summers with him before he remarried, so, hear a little bit about his early, but nothing that lingered, that's memorable.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how did you come to move to, how, how, how did the family come to move, I mean your, your mother come--move to New York [New York]?  Did she have relatives in New York already, or?
Speaker 2: No, as a matter of fact, she was, moved there because of the relationship with, they was of a, of a church, a Pentecostal church, which, and that's how she happened to go there.  And then she came and got me, and, and ultimately, she brought most of her, her sisters to New York as well, so that we got to be a New York family.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it, it was a, through a church connection now?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: The church at that time was Triumph Church [of the New Age, New York, New York], and I suppose there was more to it, but I can--
Speaker 1: Triumph?
Speaker 2: Triumph, like--
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: --the automobile, T-R-I-U-M-P-H.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So it's like a Pentecostal type of a church and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, although she later moved to another church, it was still Pentecostal.  So the wonder is that I didn't grow (laughter)--it wasn't a Pentecostal one.
Speaker 1: Well, was it, I mean, well, how did you, I mean how, how did you feel about it?  I mean I don't--were, was, were your grandparents involved in a Pentecost church?
Speaker 2: Oh no, my--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my grandparents were Methodist to the core (laughter).  My grand, my grandfather was a member of the C.M.E. [Christian Methodist Episcopal] church.  And my step-grandfather was a member of the [African] Methodist Episcopal [A.M.E.] church, and he's the one who was a presiding elder.
Speaker 1: I know the Pentecostal churches can really get intense in terms of involvement and so forth.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, all right.
Speaker 1: Did, did you spend a lot of time in church when you were young?
Speaker 2: Had to, all right.  That was my mother's way of keeping me out of trouble she thought, so, and I went, I went pretty often.  Then, of course, I met my own group of friends.  They were the kids of--one of their bishops were mem- were neighbors of ours, so the Williamses [ph.], that's Harold [ph.] and, it's Timothy [ph.] and Harold, we were almost inseparable for a number of years.
Story_ID: 304348
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a little kid?  I mean, as a young man growing up, were you, were you, what were you interested in, and what did you, what kind of things did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, I was not good at sports, and there's a reason.  My [paternal] grandpa, Doc [Cain], (laughter) refused to let me do anything.  I couldn't even shoot marbles (laughter) (unclear) it was him.  So, but, but other than that, and I, I, I enjoyed, in New York [New York], I remember going, enjoyed going to the beach, and going to the park and that sort of thing but no real interest in, in, in sports, and I regret that to this day.  I, I'll read the sports pages, but they don't mean the same to me that I see it mean to other people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you, did you read a lot when you were a kid?
Speaker 2: I read rather a lot.  And that's one of the things that, that, and looking back, I am impressed by.  Shortly after we got to New York, my mother [Helen Moore] took me to the library (laughter), you know, and got, got me a card and got me to reading.  So, yeah, I did read rather a lot when I was growing up.
Speaker 1: Now you lived in Brooklyn [New York, New York], right, and the--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and what neighborhood?
Speaker 2: It was called South Brooklyn, and it's--that was on Warren Street, Bergen [Street], and Bergen streets, both of 'em between streets like, oh, Hoyt [Street] and, and Evans [Street].
Story_ID: 304349
Speaker 1: What was the name of your school, and--well, let's start in Alabama.  What was the first school you went to?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Trinity [School, Athens, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay, Trinity.  And, and in Brooklyn [New York, New York] what was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: In Brooklyn, Nathan Hale Junior High School [Brooklyn, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were in junior high when you got to Brooklyn, or just--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --or did you start at a--
Speaker 2: No, I was ten, so I was still--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in elementary school.  But the school was, it was a junior high school that took you through the ninth grade.  And that was the Nathan Hale Junior High School.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now did you like school?
Speaker 2: As (laughter), as much as, as school can be liked I guess (laughter).  Yeah, I had, essentially, had some good times.  I had some adjustments to make. I remember because I was from Alabama one of the big kids from New York, a white kid, assumed that he could bully me.  And, and he successfully did so for a while, 'til we got into it one day (laughter).  When they broke us up, he ran, so I always said I won.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's a big adjustment I guess coming from Alabama, to a farm country to New York, to, to Brooklyn, you know, with--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --six million people.  It's a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, you know, I, I remember my first ride on the subway, just a mind-blowing thing.  Although I'd been riding trains as long as I could remember, but the subway was just something different.
Story_ID: 304350
Speaker 1: We were talking about being on the trains in, in New York [New York].  We were talking about riding the trains and how that was fascinating, you know, riding the subway.
Speaker 2: Oh, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And of course, I, I got to be quite the expert on all the three lines that operated.  There was BMT [Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit], the IRT [Interborough Rapid Transit], and the [IND] Eighth Avenue [Line] we called it.  It was the independent thing that was done during the '30s [1930s].  It was the newest one.  When relatives from out of town came to visit, it was my job to squire them around.  They were always so astonished at how well I knew the lay of the land, as it were.
Story_ID: 304351
Speaker 1: When you were in school, did you have any favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: Yes.  In Alabama there was a Ms. Ann D. Mitchell [ph.].  She was, she taught first and second grade [at Trinity School, Athens, Alabama] and was a tyrant.  And you know, in those day, there were no prohibitions on teachers switching you, so (unclear) you would (laughter) work on you if you got out, out of place.  One day the whole class for some reason didn't respond to the bell at recess time.  We just didn't hear it, but I guess we were playing so.  And we saw her coming down this (laughter), a little hill that led down to the playing area.  And she told us to go, each of us to go over in a lot and pull ourselves a switch.  (Laughter) And what happened, was she going to march us all in (laughter), and we're all going to get a couple of lashes with our switch.  I saw her walk around the class once with something like sticky paper in her hand.  And one of the kids who wasn't aware that she was (laughter) listening got slapped in the mouth with that sticky paper.  But I think of her as one of my favorite teachers because she gave me a, a prize, as it were, at the end of the school year.  And it was a little folding metal cup for water.  I think of that cup often, because I wonder whatever happened to it.  In high school, there were one who does stand out, and that was a Dr. [Josephine] Britton.  And I can't remember her first name now, but she was an English teacher.  And she was the person who encouraged me to try writing things.  As a result of her encouragement, I think I was the first alumnus of Alexander Hamilton [Vocational & Technical] High School in Brooklyn [New York, New York] to have a piece in the yearbook.  And, and it was a piece on the Bible, which I thought I knew something about at that point (laughter).  But, you know, and the reason I, she stands out is that there was another teacher.  I remember spending quite a lot of my summer vacation one year writing what I considered a, a good short story (laughter).  And I gave it to this teacher, for whom I had some respect and enjoyed her class, and her only comment on the piece was that I should spend my time otherwise.  Well, and I now realize that this was--I mentioned Alfred [A.] Duckett to you before.  It's one of those things at that point, I think folks were trying to be protective, you know, so don't get your (laughter) eyes set on this because it's not going to work for you.  It did a pretty good job of stunting my, my growth.  And I think it was, I was almost forty before I could believe anybody who said that I could write (laughter).
Story_ID: 304352
Speaker 1: So this is like 1935--
Speaker 2: Well I--
Speaker 1: --thirty-six [1936]?
Speaker 2: --graduated high school in '39 [1939], so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, what was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: Alexander Hamilton [Vocational & Technical High School, Brooklyn, New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --High School.
Speaker 1: So you're at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It used to--
Speaker 1: --Nathan Hale Elementary [sic. Nathan Hale Junior High School, Brooklyn, New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: --was a elementary.
Speaker 1: --junior high.  And Alexander Hamilton High School, okay.  And that, those, those are in Brooklyn [New York, New York], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you graduated in what year?
Speaker 2: Hamilton, '39 [1939].
Speaker 1: Thirty-nine [1939], okay.  Well, when you were in high school, were, were you involved in, did you write for the school paper or anything like that or--
Speaker 2: I, yeah, there was a little school paper.  I did a little column for that, and--it's almost a 'Candid Camera' kind of thing.  And there was a little literary magazine called the Hamiltonian [ph.], and in my senior year I was, I was the editor.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, even though you were the editor of the, the literary magazine in your senior year, you still didn't necessarily think that you could write and the, the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.  Well--
Speaker 1: --put
Speaker 2: --you know (laughter) I guess such that one of the things that can happen with rejection, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that, that can be more potent than some of the flattery that goes with other things.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Ms. [Josephine] Britton encouraged you.  You said she encouraged you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and like I said, she was the one who saw the, the, that the little piece got put into the yearbook.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you like to write about?  I mean what, what were your favorite subjects then?
Speaker 2: Well, at that point, I, I thought that I was going to (laughter) be the next novelist and great, right the great American novel.  And maybe that's why (laughter) that teacher wrote so, so discouraging.  A novelist, I've discovered I'm not.  But, I just, I, I, I could do, I know, a fairly decent essay.  That's where, that was the writing that I got decent marks on.  And it could be anything.  Like, I said, that piece that did get published is on the Bible.  And, and the, in Hamilton High School, that's where I first got an awareness of black history as differentiated from the history that I'd learned in Alabama.  When I got to New York [New York], I couldn't understand that, first, they didn't know 'Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing' (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, they didn't know it in New York?
Speaker 2: At that point--
Speaker 1: Now, were you in an integrated school in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Brooklyn--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean what was the percentage of black people there?
Speaker 2: Oh, I would say whatever the population--(unclear)--but no more than 10 to 15 percent of the class.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But in, but in Alabama you all sung the Negro national anthem in school?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, and, and you, you lived black history in the community.  But at Hamilton, some of the teachers later classified as Communist (laughter) established, a group called the Frederick Douglass Society.  That's when I learned about Frederick Douglas, for instance.  I had not, was not aware of him until then.
Speaker 1: So you were involved in the Frederick Douglass Society and, and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, was this an all-black group, or--
Speaker 2: Yes, primarily black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think there were a couple of white boys who showed up--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --basically.
Speaker 1: Did a teacher form it, or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, one of the teachers did.  It was--
Speaker 1: It's--
Speaker 2: And he was a white teacher and of course, that whole group of teachers that were that concerned about matters were all classified as, as communists later.

Speaker 1: Now were you still really deeply involved in the church when you, when you were in high school [Alexander Hamilton Vocational & Technical High School, Brooklyn, New York, New York]?  Did you have to go to church and stuff--
Speaker 2: A little less.  My--for one reason, I was a little shy, you know, about going to, to church didn't have that, that many good clothes (laughter), you know, and you know, that Sunday thing was, turned out dressed up was really something.  So I, I would think from about the tenth grade up until graduation I was just an occasional visitor at church.  But, of course, for graduation I got all new clothes and went (laughter) back to church, just, just that I--(unclear)--nothing, but I had a great fear that I--or a great shock that I was not going to graduate because we took an examination in New York [New York] called the Regents [Examinations].  And you had to have passed two Regents in order to graduate.  And so my Regents for, for that year were English and, and history.  And I got a good grade on, on the English test, but the history test, which was the one for, on which I studied hardest, they couldn't bring me above sixty-five, as a matter of fact, couldn't bring to sixty-five or past that.  And so I spent the whole, whole week before graduation thinking that I was gonna have to go another term at Hamilton to make up for that.  As it turned out, it was an essay questions, and it was, it had to do with an, the separation of powers.  And I, I went at it from a completely wrong angle and did not know until the day before graduation that, that so many kids had made the same misinterpretation of the question that they had reversed themselves; the Regents had to reverse themselves and give us credit for what we done on that question.  That, and that's was kind of important to me 'cause my mother [Helen Moore] was just fit to be tied, you know, and there was no way of making her understand that I really had done the work in history.  Her feeling was that I, because I had been involved with other extracurricular activities that I was taking away from my study time to do these other things.  But she was proud on graduation night (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 304354
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduating [from Alexander Hamilton Vocational & Technical High School, Brooklyn, New York, New York], did you see yourself becoming a writer later on in life or did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No. At that point, the thing I was saying was get one of those good civil service jobs (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now had you heard of, at that point did you, were you familiar with Langston Hughes and J. A. Rogers [Joel Augustus Rogers], and, and all the different writers in New York [New York], Zora Neale Hurston and some of those people.
Speaker 2: I knew, I knew the name, Langston Hughes at that point and Countee Cullen, for instance, was a poet, was, poetry I loved.  And since his father [Reverend Frederick Asbury Cullen] was pastor of a Methodist church [Salem Methodist Episcopal Church] in Harlem [New York, New York], I had great respect for, for him, and I later met his, his wife [Ida Mae Roberson Cullen], who by that time was his widow.  But, and I later met J. A. Rogers as, but, and not at that, at that point.  But I did know, I get to see James Weldon Johnson and his brother [J. Rosamond Johnson].  And, oh, Paul Robeson, I was aware of him then and, and later met him and his--then Marian Anderson.  The year of our graduation was when she did the Washington [D.C.]--the Lincoln Memorial concert.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.
Speaker 2: And I think the first, the job with Education Heritage [sic. Educational Heritage, Inc.] for, I eventually became an editor.  But I was supposed to have been doing a book on the arts and had submitted a piece that I'd done on Marian Anderson.  So, she's been one of my heroes.  I got the job (laughter).  I never did get the piece published, but (laughter).
Story_ID: 304355
Speaker 1: So you thought you'd get a civil service job upon graduation [from Alexander Hamilton Vocational & Technical High School, Brooklyn, New York, New York], but what did you do?   Did you--had you thought about college at all--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --going to college?  Okay.
Speaker 2: And had, had planned going, but, and was able to matriculate at [The] City College of New York [New York, New York] but couldn't stay because I couldn't afford to be there.  That's really what it was--and I took a job with a place that made and shipped model airplanes, Skyway Model Air [ph.], and left there.  By then, of course, you know, we're, the world had starting to turn over anyhow because of World War II [WWII], and left there to take a job at a place called Barclay Tissue Corporation.  And it was out in the industrial area of, of Brooklyn [New York, New York].  And they were manufacturers of paper towels and, and toilet tissues, 'cause when the war started, there was a big sign that somebody put up in the, in the factory saying, "Wipe 'em out with (unclear) soft," (laughter).
Speaker 1: That is funny.
Speaker 2: I don't know why I remember that, you know (laughter).  So that's how I was--so I didn't go to college [Columbia University, New York, New York] until I came home from the [U.S. military] service.
Story_ID: 304356
Speaker 1: Okay so you were drafted while you were--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was drafted.
Speaker 1: Well, when, when did they draft you?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-three [1943].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, now, now where did you end up going?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to [Wilbur] Wright Field [Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio] (laughter).  I, I went in, in '43 [1943] and, like I said, it was Wright Field and--
Speaker 1: In Dayton, Ohio, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Well, actually, it was Patterson Field that we arrived at first, and eventually we were transferred to Wright.  And I stayed there all through the war [World War II, WWII].  I was given a sort of essential on the base classification so that we managed to get out of the cleaning battalions and into the orderly room.  And there I was sort of secure (laughter) and didn't have to do the cleaning.  But I got a chance to go through the ranks, the enlisted rank pretty quickly.  When I was discharged because I, with the rank of master sergeant--
Story_ID: 304357
Speaker 1: You're in Dayton, Ohio, in the, in the war [World War II, WWII].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And now, you said you met your, your future wife there, in Dayton, right?  She was a--
Speaker 2: She was a student at Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], but she had a job on the [Wright-Patterson Air Force] Base [Ohio] in one of those part-time things, and that's where, where we met.  And like I said, I stayed in, in Dayton the whole, that whole time I was in--
Speaker 1: Now you stayed on the base basically, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: Right, and now you went out to Wilberforce.  Now, you were telling us before we started the interview that you, you met some of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well--
Speaker 1: --Wilberforce luminaries out there.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Well, that was because we had this little singing group that got invited to come out, and so, of course, that gave us a nice Sunday (laughter) activity.  But, and by that time, I had already met Edna [ph.], and because we met in PX [Post Exchange], as it were.  And I must say, when I left there, I was very homesick for Dayton (laughter) for the longest time, and I still think very fondly of, of that place.  Most of the folks I knew there are no longer around now, so, but had a good time there, although it was a good experience.
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are the days of Dayton, I guess the heart of the black community would have been on West 5th Street then, with the Classic Theater [Dayton, Ohio] and the Palace Theatre [Dayton, Ohio].  And did you ever go over there much, or?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Well, whatever the shows were downtown--I mean, down 5th--
Speaker 1: Oh, downtown Dayton (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Down 5th Street (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are the two, the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Classic and the Palace, the two--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --black theaters that had live--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: --entertainment as well as--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --movies and so forth.
Speaker 2: Yep, we, as a matter of fact, we, one of my Sundays was ruined because we were downtown with very little money.  We ran into some more of (laughter) ladies from Wilberforce.  And one of them talked us into using our money to, to go to the show (laughter) and with the promise that they were going to give us some pink champagne (laughter).  I remember the young lady's name was Hattie [ph.], and we went to Hattie's house (laughter) and never did get the pink champagne.  But that was a, one of the memories is that that was a good soul on, at one of those little restaurants who took pity on us and let us have a hamburger that night and, and a pop (laughter), with the promise we'd come back and pay it the next day, and sure enough, we did.
Story_ID: 304358
Speaker 1: I've read in the Dayton [Ohio] paper [The Journal Herald; Dayton Daily News] that Scatman Crothers was actually on the radio in Dayton in the '40s [1940s] on WING [Dayton, Ohio].  Do you remember ever hearing him?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't remember--well, of course, you know, most of the radios that we heard was at, at night anyhow, so.  And I remember there was one evening program that we all went to sleep on.  It was, came on after 'Taps' [ph.] and, but it played very soothing music.  And the announcer was one of those great voices, and so we all listened to that just before we would doze off.  You knew, you knew Dayton, so this is with, a jump ahead.  In the '60s [1960s], I had occasion to go back to Dayton with the church choir [Cain Choristers].  And one of the things that I insisted on when I got back, I was gonna stay at The [Dayton] Biltmore [Hotel, Dayton, Ohio] because we couldn't stay there when I (laughter), when I was at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the Biltmore Hotel--that was the biggest old, the oldest hotel I think it was down--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --downtown Dayton.
Speaker 2: And, and it was, we, we thought of it was, it's, that's the hotel where Marian Anderson stayed.  Now that was a big exception for her (laughter) to stay there.  So, when we went back I insisted on staying at the Biltmore Hotel, and by that time it had become a dump (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, now it's a senior citizens building, and the city--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --uses it for the department of cultural affairs [sic.], and the rest of it's a senior citizens building.  But it's straight--my grandmother was a maid there, and my father was a carpenter there after the war [World War II, WWII], yeah, the Biltmore.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, at, at Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], you were telling me that you also met Hallie Q. Brown [Hallie Quinn Brown].  Well, I, I asked about it, and you said that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you did meet here.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: She was a great elocutionist and, and--
Speaker 2: Right.  And like, like I said, she was, it was just that she was one of those personalities on campus, and everybody knew Ms. Hallie Q., you know.  And of course, we are meeting her and not having any idea who, you know, her real significance, although I recall that Dr. [Charles H.] Wesley was president at point.
Speaker 1: Charlie Wesley, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And a group of us from the [Wright-Patterson Air Force] Base [Ohio] and our political awareness was developing, and we went out to ask him about things we should be doing in terms of getting rid of Jim Crow and all that.  He gave us a decent reception and some, some ideas that we held onto.  As a matter of fact, three of us took, made a, almost a blood pledge that we're, when we got out we were gonna go back to school, and we were gonna do something in the [Civil Rights] Movement, as it were (laughter).
Story_ID: 304359
Speaker 1: All right, so you were in Dayton [Ohio] for the balance of the--the, what you were just discussing on the last roll, the meeting with Charles [H.] Wesley, I mean, what were your impressions of Charles Wesley--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --and what's next?
Speaker 2: --well, as a matter of fact, I had known who he was before he became president of, Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  That's because he, two--two things that made me know who he was: one, I attended a, a conference in Bordentown, New Jersey.  And you know, the Bordentown School [Bordentown, New Jersey] was kind of a black prep situation; and--
Speaker 1: Okay.  I've never heard--well, tell us some, a little about Bordentown School.
Speaker 2: It was a school for black boys that was, it was, that's military and some of the other things, some of the other schools, but it was that preparatory kind of thing for, for college.  I was there because the, somehow or other I got hold of an invitation from the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] that there was going to be a meeting there.  And I've forgotten how much, the fees were nominal at any rate.  And it turned out to be one of the great experiences of my life because that's where I saw Dr. Wesley and because he made the principal address that day, and it was a thing of history, the YMCA.  And I'd never seen anybody be so eloquent for so long with no notes (laughter), you know--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, did, did you, now, did you ever go, go to the black Y [Harlem YMCA; Claude McKay Residence] in Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, I was, I did a lot of things there, as one of my groups used to rehearse there.  And then later on when Vinnette [Justine] Carroll was putting together the production of 'Dark of the Moon,' that's where we rehearsed, and that's where, where we played for, for about a week.  And then, later, Vinnette did it at Equity Library Theatre [New York, New York] downtown.  But, yeah, I used to go there on Sundays for, for meals.  They did a white tablecloth--that kind of meal on Sunday afternoons.
Story_ID: 304360
Speaker 1: And I asked you off camera about the Harlem History Club [Harlem, New York, New York], but that was going on while you were probably in grade school and high school [Alexander Hamilton Vocational & Technical High School, Brooklyn, New York, New York] with--but they, but they, they met at the Y [YMCA; Young Men's Christian Association].  And Channing [Heggie] Tobias was the director of the Y (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah, I know Dr. Tobias.  I think of him as the big sit--you know, he had those religious ties, too, because he was a C.M.E. [Christian Methodist Episcopal].  You remember, and the C.M.E. church had that old, it was where the Harlem [New York, New York] landmarks theaters--but I think of that, and I can't recall the name, name that it had at that point.  But that famous tree stump that everybody remembers was outside that church--that theater.
Speaker 1: Not the Apollo [Theater, New York, New York], but the--
Speaker 2: No, not the Apollo.
Speaker 1: --Lafayette [Theatre, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: I believe it could have been the Lafayette, because I saw the Orson Welles production of Haiti ['Macbeth'] there.
Speaker 1: Oh the--what they did for the WPA [Works Progress Administration]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm--
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Those, in those days--
Speaker 1: American Negro Theatre [ANT].
Speaker 2: --it was, the thing I remember about that, it was so realistic because there was a gun battle, and you smelled the gun powder (laughter) that were, that blew us away.
Story_ID: 304361
Speaker 1: That C.M.E. [Christian Methodist Episcopal] church that, that required that was the church that Dr. [Channing Heggie] Tobias was affiliated with all, although his funeral was held at Riverside Church [New York, New York], which was at--trying to--in, in Dayton [Ohio], though, back to Dayton.  We had some of the major entertainment attractions come through there.  I remember that's where I first saw Dizzy Gillespie, and also Billy Eckstine, who was the rage at that point, came through.  We were so put out with him though because we--you remember he was famous for his, for his attire (laughter).  So, first, we had done the best we could with those [U.S.] Army uniforms--we were clean (laughter).  We got there and the, the curtain opened, and there was Eckstine in, in some baggy pants and (laughter), and, and a rumpled shirt and what have you.  We didn't understand it.  We thought it was a deliberate insult.  It turned out that his, his luggage had not arrived (laughter).  And so they had no alternative but to perform in what they had on.  So that's where I got a chance to see acts like that.  But, and I still remember him coming to our day room and the guys who were all around the rest of, of the band.  And there was poor Billy, who was the leader of the band at this point, over in a corner by himself being (laughter)--(unclear) ignored because it was unforgiveable that he didn't dress up for us.  As, as much as I, I think as I recall of any significance at the, at Dayton, I do remember that there were, there was a point at which rises, raises--rank and rise in promotions were frozen at--and it was the talk of the [Wright-Patterson Air Force] Base [Ohio], that when the promotions were reinstated, the first of the group that got them were two guys from our outfit, myself and my buddy, Herman Otley [ph.].  And so, we were minor celebrities on base (laughter) for a couple of days, 'cause we, we'd go over to the PX [Post Exchange], these white guys wanted to see who (laughter) these two guys that got, got the promotions.
Story_ID: 304362
Speaker 1: Well back to Charles [H.] Wesley for a minute.  What advice did he give you, I mean that, I mean you said you determined to go back to school and all that sort of thing.  But what advice did he give your group?
Speaker 2: Well, I think we were asking him mainly strategic kinds of questions: what, how do we go about doing this, this, and that?  And I think I was so awed by, by being in his presence, that I don't remember the, the particulars of, of the discussion, just that he was very receptive to it, to us, and very warm toward us.  And I, and not--I had not known how, how to expect.  Again, I was still a little baffled by anybody with any stature, but what I, when I heard him at Bordentown [New Jersey] and again later on he came to the Bridge Street [A.M.E.] Church in Brooklyn [New York, New York], which is still a, one of the major black churches in Brooklyn, he came to address one of the conventions there.  And again, he was so powerful a speaker.  So I was really terribly impressed with, with him.
Story_ID: 304363
Speaker 1: Did you get married right after the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No--
Speaker 1: --the war [World War II, WWII]?
Speaker 2: --as a matter of fact, it was--well, we were discharged in '46 [1946].  I was married in '49 [1949], so, and, and again, had sort of lost touch with that--too, I had proposed while I (laughter) we were still in the [U.S. military] service, we're starting out, so.  And it was after the war was over, and I had gone on to, to Columbia [University, New York, New York].  And was, there was something happening in front of the library one day, and we saw each other (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you really just kind of accidentally saw each other, [HistoryMaker] Alfred [Cain]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Like I said, we'd lost touch with each other, so, we went on from there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, after the war, you, you, you went to Columbia on a G.I Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944]?  Is that what it is?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And incidentally, there in the note that mister, Dr. Porter [ph.] sent (laughter), he refers to me as having a Ph.D. from Columbia, which is not the case (laughter).  I, as a matter of fact, I, my only degree from Columbia--no, he referred to me as having a master's [degree] from, from Columbia.  I did grad [graduate] studies there but never wrote the, the thesis, so (laughter)--didn't get the degree.  And I had always said anyhow, but I was so outraged that they gave [Dwight David "Ike"] Eisenhower an honorary doctorate even before he became president.  Then I said I, I will never pay for (laughter), for a degree if you, if they can be handed out like that, highly principled young man I thought I was.
Story_ID: 304364
Speaker 1: So you didn't think much of [Dwight David "Ike"] Eisenhower at that point?
Speaker 2: He was hardly my (laughter)--well, there was some excitement when he was, when it was announced that he was going to be president.  But I had read what--a, a biography of his, and I was less impressed with him simply because of what I read there.  And it really broke down when I couldn't believe and didn't know how these things worked at that time, I, when the fraternity issue came up on, on campus.  Remember that one of the New England schools, I think it was Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] had discharged a, a fraternity because of, of their--let me get this straight.  Yeah, they had been, the fraternity had been expelled from that school, and I'm, I'm pretty sure it was Cornell.  And it was because they had refused black, black membership.  And there was a little stir on Columbia's [Columbia University, New York, New York] campus about that.  And somewhere or other there's a letter to President Eisenhower from one Al Cain [HistoryMaker Alfred Cain] demanding that that fraternity be banned on Columbia's campus, because I, my rationale was our, our payment of fees help to subsidize this thing.  Well, I got a letter back saying that, that President Eisenhower was away, but, and I'd seen him that day (laugher), you know.  And so I, I was just put off by the fact that I was being pushed aside like that.  But I, on the other hand, had, had friends who worked in the Eisenhower house and who said that he is quite a decent guy.  And then, but nevertheless he, as far as I was concerned, he dissed me (laughter), so--by telling me a fib.
Story_ID: 304365
Speaker 1: You were at Columbia [University, New York, New York] in--did you start at '46 [1946] or '47 [1947]?
Speaker 2: No, I was at--yeah, I come here in '46 [1946] to '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: Okay, '46 [1946] to '51 [1951]?
Speaker 2: If listed my, my degree in '51 [1951], I have to--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I was there from '46 [1946] to '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And, okay, now, now you were, what did you major in at Columbia?
Speaker 2: Public law and government.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which was their euphemism for poli sci [political science].
Speaker 1: Okay, and did you continue to write?  You know, did you start writing again, or--
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't doing anything except writing the papers that I had (laughter) to prepare and what have you.
Speaker 1: Okay, and were you singing at that time, too?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Well, I guess I just--
Speaker 2: --seem all--
Speaker 1: --just--
Speaker 2: --seemed always to have been an member of some group that was go--and even at Columbia I, when I became president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] chapter on campus, and one of the first things I did was to establish a, a NAACP choir.  And, and there were two members, two black members of the choir (laughter), myself and, and Doug Pugh [G. Douglas Pugh].  I don't know if you've ever run into Doug--(unclear) name, but we were really--it was great fun talking about 'Lift Ev'ry Voice [and Sing'] again.  It was great (laughter), great fun hearing them (laughter), them sing 'Lift Ev'ry Voice.'  We did, we did concerts on, on campus and a couple of singing engagements off campus.  And that's, and that was about the extent of my singing in, on campus.  I couldn't make the rehearsals for things like the chapel choir, for which we would get paid (laughter), but I just, I was able to get a deeper appreciation for good music.
Story_ID: 304366
Speaker 1: Living near the campus [Columbia University, New York, New York] at that point at International House [(I-House), New York, New York], Leontyne Price was there at that point.  And a man from Dayton [Ohio], Johnson, Deke Johnson, was living there.  And I recall going over to I-House when, when a group gathered around Leontyne, and somebody suggested at that point that we, we sing a couple of hot courses of 'Lift Ev'ry Voice [and Sing'].  But she was on her way to becoming the, the grand diva that she became.  But just on that musical thing, it was something I had, I loved music most of my life.  And one, wasn't terribly trained; as a matter of fact, I could almost be called untrained, but it was something I enjoyed doing.  We had a chorus on, on the [Wright-Patterson Air Force] Base [Ohio] at, at [Wilbur] Wright Field [Ohio], and we even did a few of the broadcasts from, from the field.  And that led to one of the interesting little episodes out there.  We did the first broadcast from there, and they were so pleased with the sound they asked us to perform more than we had, had planned to do and invited us to come back.  And when we came back, we thought we had a jam-up program for them, but they didn't particularly like the idea that we were not doing a spiritual.  And so it was one of those times when we stalked out; we weren't going to let them force us to do spirituals, you know.
Speaker 2: What kind of music did you do?  I mean what, what, what were some of the songs sang?
Speaker 1: Oh, we did, it was rather a full gamut of things.  We did some, a good number of the classical things, ranging from [Henry] Purcell thing up to some of the pop songs that were being done at that point.  So it was just a matter that, you know, we did--and we did spirituals and hymns.  We just weren't going to let them, you know, force us to, to do, do something.  I realize now that that was on radio.  What better way to let it be known that this is an all-black chorus than to have us sing spirituals (laughter).  And if I'd been program director, probably would have asked for it, too.  But I would have explained to the guys what was happening.
Story_ID: 304367
Speaker 1: So you all had, you had kind of an attitude then?  You know, you were, you had, you were kind of had, had a political attitude--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And you, you were focused on change and--
Speaker 2: And well, one of the pictures you'll see us, a group of guys in full dress things.  That was because we were supposed to go on tour, a tour arranged by the Dixie Bureau, who'd planned a lot of the entertainment on the college campuses.  And we were getting ready for that, and never again, because they were unwilling to agree to the program that we wanted.  We didn't go.
Speaker 1: Now, was--oh, I saw the picture earlier of, is, of Brock Peters [George Fisher] and--
Speaker 2: Oh, and--
Speaker 1: --and the, the other--
Speaker 2: --Theresa Hines [sic. Terry Merritt]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was--
Speaker 1: Was that in the '60s [1960s] or was it at, in the--
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Was that in the '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That, that was the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: With Theresa Merritt, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Theresa Merritt, Brock Peters, and--
Speaker 2: Joe Lewis.
Speaker 1: --Joe Lewis, and you all formed a group called the--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --[The] Normanaires, I think?
Speaker 2: It, we were, they waited awhile.  It's just that that had originally been The Harry Belafonte Singers [The Belafonte Folk Singers], but Harry's [HistoryMaker Harry Belafonte] agency wanted him to go out alone.  And one of the reasons was they thought that the girl was not pretty enough (laughter).  And Fred Norman, who was a, an arranger and what have you, agreed after Harry went.  And the person that went with Harry was Charlie Coleman [Charles Coleman], and that's when I joined the group as a replacement for, for Charlie Coleman.  And, and they were getting a lot of attention for a while there when they were with Harry.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, I could imagine, yeah.  But what year, was this before, this is like--what year is this I mean when (unclear)--
Speaker 2: It would have been, it, it was the early '50s [1950s], like--
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know you were involved in--it says here you're involved with 'Dark of the Moon' in the '50s [1950s], too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I don't know which came first, so if you could help me with the chronology, so, and I--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --know which came first, but, yeah.
Speaker 2: I just, I'm sure that the, yeah, The Normanaires thing came first--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --then 'Dark of the Moon,' and a production by Vinnette [Justine] Carroll came shortly thereafter.
Story_ID: 304368
Speaker 1: But by that time--the group [The Normanaires] had splintered because Brock [Peters; George Fisher] and Joe [Lewis] had gone to a revival of, of an old--so those--black show I'm trying to--[Noble] Sissle and [Eubie] Blake--
Speaker 2: Oh, 'Shuffle Along'?
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that revival of that.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: They had gone to be in that and then left me and Theresa [Merritt; Terry Merritt] to fend for ourselves (laughter).  And at, at about the same time I got a job as, as a choir director at a church [Antioch Baptist Church] in Harlem [sic. Brooklyn, New York, New York], so, yeah.  And then with the 'Dark of the Moon' thing, it was a case of being asked to, to make it a vehicle that would work for black actors and to provide the music for that.  And so I, I brought some of the best singers from my church choir to, to that.  I remember that we did a scene later, what is called 'Talent '60' I believe.  It was an Ebony--[Actors'] Equity showcase and used that pretty much that same group of singers and, and brought the house down some may say.  For, for a moment I had a, a couple of groupies (laughter)--(unclear)--I hadn't been on stage, but the name was in the programs.  They came running back, "Where is this [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Alfred] Cain?"  It's very enjoyable.
Story_ID: 304369
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about the cast for 'Dark of the Moon.'  Who was--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --in that cast now?
Speaker 2: Cicely Tyson, [HistoryMaker] Roscoe Lee Browne, a young man who, who was a very young man then, Clarence--
Speaker 1: Not Clarence Williams [III]?  No, not--it was?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Clarence--
Speaker 1: Clarence--
Speaker 2: --Williams III--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as Isabel Sanford.  And I can't remember who, who played the heavy then.  And I, and I don't remember who the, who the guy was.  But in the, in the, we, when we took it to 'Talent '60,' it was [HistoryMaker] James Earl Jones that joined the cast as the heavy.  And now I can't remem--but that was--he, whoever else it was it didn't have a name that was--registered with those 'cause he--
Speaker 1: Now tell me this, during this period of time, did you have a like a nine to five job, and were you doing this like, what, what were you doing nine to five?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Most of that time I was doing, I was a social investigator for the [City of New York] Department of [Public] Welfare [New York City Human Resources Administration] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's how I made my living (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, but for this play you were, you're a musical director, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were also musical director for, later on for 'Trumpets of God' [sic. 'Trumpets of the Lord']--or what, whatever the name of it, 'Trumpets of God,' which is loose, based--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --somewhat on 'God's Trombones[: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse,' James Weldon Johnson], right?
Speaker 2: Right, it, it--
Speaker 1: And for '[The] Amen Corner' [James Baldwin] in the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That was when 'Amen Corner' came.  Well, you know, it wasn't a big success in New York [New York].  It lasted a very little while.  And that, that's more a credit than, than any real work that I had to do, 'cause the, they brought in a production from the West Coast.  And it was just a matter of getting, getting the actors attuned to more or less lip syncing to, to (laughter) those (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, they had the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --music prerecorded or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the, oh, and the actors just had to lip sync the music?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's, that a--I guess those are the big lip, lip sync days though, I guess, you know, 'cause you had a lot of movies then with lip sync stars and you know.
Speaker 2: I would think--yeah, of course, yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you had, a 'West Side Story' was lip I think--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: A woman named [Marni] Nixon did the voice, voice for Natalie Wood in that.  And I think and--
Speaker 2: Oh, right, and--
Speaker 1: --Marni Nixon, yeah, do--and what--
Speaker 2: Marni Nixon, right.
Speaker 1: Dorothy Dandridge was lip synced in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she--
Speaker 1: --'Carmen Jones,' right?
Speaker 2: Dorothy Dandridge, she was in 'Carmen Jones.'
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And that was [Marilyn] Horne.
Speaker 1: Oh, Shirley Horn?  I mean not Shirley, but--
Speaker 2: No, she was a big opera singer.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know he performed, yeah.
Speaker 2: She was married to [Henri] Lewis, the conductor of the New Jersey Symphony [Orchestra], yeah, Marilyn Horne.
Story_ID: 304370
Speaker 1: What was the, the critical reception of, to 'Dark of the Moon'?  What was--
Speaker 2: Oh, 'Dark of the Moon,' I, somewhere or other there is, there is a piece by, and I'm pretty sure it was Dorothy Kilgallen, and it's one of the papers that's gone out of existence, but it was, according to her, that was the triumph of the, of that event.  That particular day, [HistoryMaker] James Earl [Jones] was doing a scene from, from '[The] Emperor Jones' [Eugene O'Neill].  And that was the first time most of us had ever, had ever seen him.  And some of the old theater people--had I been, I got paid back for my attitude about things, because some of the black people did not like the music in the church scene for 'Dark of the Moon,' you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: They thought it was sacrilegious or--
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: --or, what were they--
Speaker 2: --just, just thought it was, it, it was that uncultured black sort of thing that was--[HistoryMaker] Ossie [Davis] and [HistoryMaker] Ruby [Dee] used to say it was the mandatory black scene, and it's a whole lot of handclapping (laughter) and what have you, which they didn't--
Speaker 1: Oh, you're saying the actors didn't like the--scene?
Speaker 2: Oh, the actors liked it.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: You know, the, the chorus liked it, and the folks in the cast liked it.  But folks like Juanita Hall, for instance, she, (laughter) she was very offended by it and another person, (unclear).  Your Leonatus, I don't know if you--but she was one of the, the people in 'Carmen Jones'; they both had the feeling.  And of course, Theresa [Merritt] was telling me this, all this because they were her buddies really.  And, and she had been in, Theresa had been in 'Carmen Jones' also.  And--
Speaker 1: What exactly did they object to?  Now, I'm trying to get a clear--what was--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --what was it?
Speaker 2: --it, it was, it was just that, you know, in our music we've gone through periods where some of the mainline churches didn't want you to do spirituals.  They were, they were too coarse and, and vulgar.  And that's, that's how they saw all that hap--hand clapping.  It was very Pentecostal, clean, as far as that's concerned.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they were like too, a little bit, you know--okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, too saddity for--
Speaker 1: Right, that's the word; that's the word.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right, the word we're looking for.
Story_ID: 304371
Speaker 1: And yet, on the other hand, I recall that's another name that was attached to that production ['Dark of the Moon'], Alvin Ailey.  And I recalled at one of the early rehearsals Alvin, who was going to do theater but (laughter) nothing else, I saw the, the company getting ready for, for the church singing.  And they were leaping over benches and (laughter) what have you, and at first that was too much for me (laughter).  We had to, had to get that toned down.  But that's a, you know, that's that a very sensitive area when you, when you get into it.
Speaker 2: Well, people were sort of wrestling with the question of how black people should, that Negroes in those days--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --should be depicted--
Speaker 1: Right--
Speaker 2: --right, because there was--
Speaker 1: --that, and that's--
Speaker 2: --such, such sensitivity about, you know--
Speaker 1: Right, and I mean some of them were, you know, Juanita Hall didn't even speak to me afterward.  And that bothered me simply because that group, The Normanaires, we had done backups for, for some of her recordings (laughter), and--
Speaker 2: You know, Juanita Hall, now she's the actress that, she ended up in 'South Pacific' didn't she, on, in, in the movies?
Speaker 1: That's the original Bloody Mary.
Speaker 2: Right, and she, and she's, she's black, but most people think of her from the movies--
Speaker 1: As, as--
Speaker 2: --as being a, a, a Polynesian or a, a--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 2: --Chinese woman--
Speaker 1: Right, but--
Speaker 2: --because she was in 'Flower Drum Song.'  She played the lead in 'Flower Drum Song' as a, as a--
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: --as a grandmother [sic. Auntie Liang].
Speaker 1: --I, I didn't see 'Flower' (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, she was a grandmother, a Chinese grandmother in that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, well, she had that kind of look.  And you know, the--a little work on the eyes, and she's there.  And yet I'd known her since I--I'd known of her since I was in high school [Alexander Hamilton Vocational & Technical High School, Brooklyn, New York, New York], because at that point, she had a group of singers who came to school and did a concert.  And, and then later, I saw, I went to a, to another concert and, and she was a, you know, a classical soprano.  And, but she did not like that, that church singing.  That bothered her greatly.
Story_ID: 304372
Speaker 1: I take it your job was fairly flexible in terms of allowing you to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was one of those jobs that (laughter) you, that you kept because you could do things with it.
Speaker 1: So you were a social investigator for the State of New York?
Speaker 2: For the [City of New York] Department of [Public Welfare; New York City Human Resources Administration]--
Speaker 1: The department of--
Speaker 2: --New York City [New York, New York], yeah.
Speaker 1: New York, okay, the City of New York, okay.
Speaker 2: And at that point it was called the Department of Welfare.  I think they call it something else, something resources, something.
Speaker 1: Okay, probably Department of Human Development or something, probably the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But it was welfare then, huh?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And when did you start there, and how long did you work for them?
Speaker 2: I was, I started there in I think it was '51 [1951].  And I was there until, until '60 [1960].
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's nine years.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And well, tell us about the next one ['Trumpets of the Lord'], the trum--the one based on 'God's Trombones[: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse,' James Weldon Johnson].
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Who, who was in that one and, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can--Lex Monson was in it, Cicely [Tyson] was in it as one of the preachers.  One of the singers in that was Bernice Hall, and she had been, she'd done musical, musicals like 'Finian's Rainbow,' and she, she never had the lead but she was in it.  As a matter of fact, she's on that [HistoryMaker William] Warfield and [Leontyne] Price 'Porgy and Bess' [George Gershwin].  She, she's, I think she had the line, "Where is Brother Rob?" in the, what have you.  I left, left that production when, shortly after it went into rehearsal for two reasons: I had gone, been a little bit reluctant about going on it because I had worked with Vinnette [Justine Carroll] in terms of getting what I called the mise en scene for, for the thing.  And when the contracts came (laughter), I was being hired as, as choral director only.  But I felt the work I'd done, 'cause it was (laughter), I, it was the pivotal work for, for this thing.  And, and I was wanting writer credit for that, and they were, and they were giving Vinnette the total credit, but I had brought the thing to Vinnette.  And one of those falling outs (laughter) that would have developed, but we soon eased over it and got back together again.
Story_ID: 304373
Speaker 1: The whole thing was that, to make those poems ['God's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse,' James Weldon Johnson] mean something in a, in a context, and that, that was what I had worked out.  So we did things like, there was that funeral thing, 'Go Down, Death,' and then another was the, that was staged as a civil rights rally.  And the rest of them were done as something that I would remember from Alabama where, where they called them flat form services--platform services, naturally where all the young preachers got a chance to show, show their stuff, and they preached about anything that came to mind.  So, you know, and you had this woman who was the sort of mistress of ceremonies, the one who did all the hallelujah talk and what have you and brought them on.  And that's, Theresa [Merritt] did that in that show, although when they did it, they did it at the White Barn [Theatre, Norwalk, Connecticut].  Miriam Burton--has her name come up ever?  Miriam was the one who did the, the role that he, that Theresa eventually got.  And--
Speaker 2: Miriam Burton, okay.
Speaker 1: --and you know, this is when Theresa's luck changed.  By now she's fat (laughter) and what have you.  And she got a number of additional calls and opportunities to play other things, so.
Speaker 2: So she had the kind of strange situation of being, not thought of as being glamorous enough when she was slim.  And then when she gets big, she gets--
Speaker 1: Gets big, she's, she's as star (laughter)--well, that tells you, 'cause, you know, they were waiting--they'd kept 'Ma Rainey['s Black Bottom,' August Wilson] running until the, the Tonys [Tony Awards; Antoinette Perry Awards for Excellence in Theatre] were out because they thought it was, it had--
Speaker 2: And she was later the star of 'Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.'
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Yep.
Story_ID: 304374
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about 'The Amen Corner' [James Baldwin] now that--was, was this--they--this isn't the first production of it then?  It was the--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --second--
Speaker 2: And, and like I said, that sounds more impressive simply because the name [James] Baldwin is attached.  I didn't no, no serious work other than doing one verse with the, with the company.  And yet, if you get the play bill (laughter), you'll see me in the credit for being the musical director on that one.
Speaker 1: Well, you didn't get credit for one job you actually did.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now you get--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the credit for another one.  That's, that's kind of the way it works.  So, did, did, did he show up at this?  This is a New York [New York] production, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--
Speaker 1: And did, did he come to, to a production?
Speaker 2: He came, he came by one of the rehearsals because this was a production that Nat King Cole's wife was involved with.
Speaker 1: Maria Cole, was it?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yep.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Maria Ellington Cole, yep.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --he came by with her one day.
Speaker 1: Who, who else was in this one?  I mean who, who was in this one?  Who, who played the lead, Sister Margaret, yeah.
Speaker 2: Beah Richards.
Speaker 1: Beah Richards, okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.  And the--(unclear) I can't think of the--Frank [Silvera], and it's a Latin kind of name.
Speaker 1: Oh, Silvera?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Silvera?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Frank Silvera?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's what I thought, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Now he's another actor that played multiple roles.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: He played everybody but a black person--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on the stage--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --on, on screen.  You know--
Speaker 2: But he played the husband in, in this, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've seen him play Mexican Bandito [Mexican Bandit]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right (laughter).
Speaker 1: --or--
Speaker 2: That's, that's what I've heard about him, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, Frank Silvera, okay.  So yeah, it was--so he was, that's the husband that's the jazz musician that comes in at the end and is sick and all that?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 304375
Speaker 1: Any other musical productions?
Speaker 2: No.  At about that time, I, I would, I became the full-time church musician--I'd been on, on staff at the church [Antioch Baptist Church, New York, New York].  I was, they called me the chief of staff (laughter), but I had to direct choir.  But that was in order to give me a salary, and that's when I was able to leave the [City of New York] Department of [Public] Welfare [New York City Human Resources Administration] and didn't do anything that wasn't at the church.  With the church choir we did the New York World's Fair [New York, New York] of--what was that, '64 [1964]?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, that's it, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, we did one of the appearances there and did, we did one very interesting program.  We called it Symphonic Gospel [ph.].  And Fred Norman, the arranger for our group, did arrangements of some gospel things for us that used a small orchestra.  And that was interesting, didn't take off wildly, but that was probably the most ambitious thing we did at, at the church.
Story_ID: 304376
Speaker 1: You didn't start your editorial work until the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was, I was an old man--
Speaker 1: --'til the '70s [1970s], right?
Speaker 2: --by that (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: --when I--no, I, I joined Educational Heritage [Inc.] again--
Speaker 1: So did you start with them first or with Tuesday Magazine first?
Speaker 2: I started with Educational Heritage first, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, what, what, what, what year was that?
Speaker 2: That would have been '63 [1963]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, 'cause that's--
Speaker 1: Now how did you get that, that job?  How, how did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, the minister at the church [Antioch Baptist Church, New York, New York] where I was working was Reverend George Lawrence.  I don't know if--at any rate, he was a very close associate of, of [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] Wyatt [Tee] Walker and, and Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young].  Those were two of the people I know.  And he was approached by the people at the Educational Heritage about, about the concept of Tthe Negro Heritage Library.  And he had felt that I, I could do something in relation to this thing.  But, and again, you know it would be like I would, the church would still be my daytime job (laughter), and the project would be something that I did in the evenings or off time.  As it turned out, Al Duckett [Alfred A. Duckett], the man I referred to earlier, was supposed to have been coming on board as the editor.  And through some estrangement with, with the management there, I was asked to take over the editorship on this project.  They did, and I think it was in '63 [1963], they did a testimonial to, to Dr. King, Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, and Wyatt Walker.  And Al was supposed to be riding herd on that.  He disappeared for a couple of days (laughter), at a very crucial time.  I called and, like the event was going to be on Tuesday night, and I went up to the headquarters in Yonkers [New York] where they were putting all the final details in place on Sunday afternoon and did not leave that office until Tuesday afternoon (laughter).
Story_ID: 304377
Speaker 1: What were you doing?  You were preparing for this publication or (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, at this point, we're just--
Speaker 1: --there was a program--
Speaker 2: --preparing for this--
Speaker 1: --for a program?
Speaker 2: --program and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and you know, and all the seating arrangements, the whole business of--because all of that was being done from, from the offices of Educational Heritage [Inc.].  And I pitched in simply because I'd learned how to do these sorts of things at, at church as it were.  But it was a hundred dollar a plate dinner at that time, and those were not as common as they are now.  And so it took some, some effort to get everything pulled together.  I remember the, the night of the event after we'd gotten everybody in place.  Even [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was gonna come down (laughter).  He had (unclear) (laughter), but he was gonna come down and, and the program would go on.  And I had walked through the, through the banquet hall and spoken to some of the folks just to ensure that they were all satisfied with their seating and all that.  And I went upstairs (laughter) and got my bag (laughter) and checked into a hotel and slept for two days.  But, and that, and that's when I got the offer to come aboard even at that point not necessarily to be the editor, the editor, except this was one of those things that fell into place for me.
Story_ID: 304378
Speaker 1: Can you explain what the project, The Negro Heritage Library, like a, sort of a black history--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, it was, yeah, it--and like there were, oh, we had projected possibly as many as twenty titles.  But the whole idea was to do black history from various perspectives or from some peculiar or some special areas like the arts, and that was the book that I was supposed to be working on.  And Sylvia [G. L.] Dannette was gonna do the book on women ['Profiles of Negro Womanhood'].
Speaker 1: So it was like an encyclopedia, like a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Negro history--
Speaker 2: The, the idea was--
Speaker 1: --a heritage--
Speaker 2: --encyclopedia.
Speaker 1: --encyclopedia.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: All right, so the arts--
Speaker 2: The arts, yeah, and, and a overall history.  And that's what my book, 'The Winding Road to Freedom[: A Documentary Survey of Negro Experiences in America,' Alfred E. Cain and Horace Varela] attempted to do, but it was a documentary history not, you know, no great narrative involved, but all these documents in, in history that I was able to pull together.
Speaker 1: How did you approach pulling them together?
Speaker 2: I, frankly, don't recall.  I just, I just remember being in a pressure cooker (laughter) for, for about three years trying to get this thing--
Speaker 1: No, but you, you did--before we even started, we, we were talk, talking about the Schomburg Center [for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] being a resource.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that, that--
Speaker 1: And, and--
Speaker 2: --sort of thing.  And I--
Speaker 1: I mean so, so what would you?  Go to the Schomburg and--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: --or, and I had a couple of researchers working with me.  None of us--for instance, the, the American Library Association [ALA] has a critique of, of the set.  Ben Rave [ph.] gave my book (laughter) the best grade of, of the thing, but, and, and chastised me because one of the areas I, I neglected, and it never dawned on me until I read that review.  I, I did completely neglect the [Great] Depression, you know, but I lived through that.  I guess I didn't consider it history (laughter).
Story_ID: 304379
Speaker 1: It's not an easy thing necessarily to do this.  You have to have some background in history.  And you--
Speaker 2: Oh, well--
Speaker 1: So did you have assistants, and, and did you have, I mean--
Speaker 2: Yes, I had, I had it.
Speaker 1: What did you, did you feel at the time, you felt like, well, I can do this and, or--
Speaker 2: No--I--no, I had read documentary histories, 'Attica' and all the rest of them and just wanted to, to do that.  And as a matter of fact, it was a--because one of the titles that we had out--now I don't remember whose it was, was not gonna come through on time.  So it was a matter of having the next book in the series ready.  And so that's when I decided I would do 'The Winding Road to Freedom[: A Documentary Survey of Negro Experiences in America,' Alfred E. Cain and Horace Varela] based on those documents that were available.  And that was really a research thing that all of us had to get in and, and collect the stuff, then edit the stuff to the, to fit the format of the books [The Negro Heritage Library].

And we were talking about the process of compiling documentation that was to be published in a book called, which is now out, been, been out since 1965 called 'The Winding Road to Freedom[: A Documentary Survey of Negro Experiences in America,' Alfred E. Cain and Horace Varela].  And so, now--
Speaker 2: That was my personal opportunity to, to talk about some of the things that I had learned dating back to that experience that, the [Frederick] Douglass Society.  So it is much research but also a great deal of, of personal experience with certain, certain things, after all I lived through the Scottsboro [Alabama] cases.  And, and I also had lived through the segregated [U.S.] military, so it wasn't too hard for me to get this material.  As a member of that Douglass Society, I called it--that was where I first had an opportunity to see Dr. Carter G. Woodson or Dr. Mary Bethune, Mary McCleod Bethune.
Speaker 1: That was in high school, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that, yeah, that was at Hamilton, Alexander Hamilton [Vocational & Technical High School] in Brooklyn [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: Right, so Dr. Carter G. Woodson came to your--
Speaker 2: No, what--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as I said, I had a chance because of that membership to see him.  But what had happened is that the, the year they met there, had their annual meeting in New York [New York], I and one other chap were sent as youth delegates to the meeting.  And it was at the luncheon that I met Dr. Woodson just to, you know, stand in awe of him really.  And at the opening evening session at Riverside Church [New York, New York], Mary McCleod Bethune spoke, yeah.  So it was one of those opportunities to live with some of the greats, although at that point, I can't say I really knew how great they were.
Story_ID: 304382
Speaker 1: What was the scope of the book ['The Winding Road to Freedom: A Documentary Survey of Negro Experiences in America,' Alfred E. Cain and Horace Varela] in term--I mean how far back did, did the--what ground did it cover?
Speaker 2: One group covered everything from the landing of blacks at, at Jamestown [Virginia] up until the civil rights era.  I remember we closed with [President Lyndon Baines] Johnson's We Shall Overcome speech, which for me was astounding (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so this, these are documents that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're documents of, and most of them were in public repositories.  The Schomburg [Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] figured very heavily in our research.  We made some trips to Washington [D.C.] to both the National Archives [and Records Administration (NARA), Washington, D.C.] and to the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: These are court cases, speeches--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: --letters--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I don't, I mean I suppose.
Speaker 2: Anything that sort of showed the way the progress was being made.  I remember--and I haven't looked at the book in so many years, I'd almost forgot--all of the chapter headings are, are really old testament spirituals and such a things, you know, like the walls came tumbling down and those sorts of things.  But then, of course, that was also how civil rights leaders were talking.  You heard [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and Ralph Abernathy talking about going back to Egypt (laughter) and those sorts of things.  So, it has that kind of frame of reference, too.
Story_ID: 304383
Speaker 1: It seems to be the--a tradition of using that biblical themes--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --for black history.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Vincent Harding's got a book called 'There Is a River[: The Black Struggle for Freedom in America,' Vincent Harding]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --you know, and Cain Hope Felder that--well, he's a theologian, but he ties--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but--
Speaker 1: --he ties in the black struggle to 'Stony the Road We Trod[: African American Biblical Interpretation,' Cain Hope Felder]--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, and it is (laughter), and of course, that also brings up a question that we have a problem with now: how, how do we, as black people, relate to, to Jewish people?  One of my (unclear) is Noel [N.] Marder, who was president of, of Educational Heritage [Inc.]--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, what was his name again?
Speaker 2: Noel Marder, M-A-R-D-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He, he was president of, of Educational Heritage and very enthusiastic about the [Civil Rights] Movement as it were.  But sometimes he had a, he had a tendency to want to be more black than we were (laughter).  And the photographer, Roland Mitchell, recalls going to a, oh, it was a ski resort that they were at, at one point.  And somebody was asking Roland how it felt as a black person to be there at that ski lodge and probably the only black person that they saw.  And before Roland could answer, Noel was (laughter) gonna give a, an explanation of how it all came about.  So he had to remind him: "Noel, I can answer that," (laughter).
Story_ID: 304384
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was really fired up--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in terms of trying to publish black history and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and of course (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did he publish anything else?  I mean did it have, I mean what were, what were his other--
Speaker 2: They had, there was a, another encyclopedia, and I, at this point, I don't remember what the name of it was.  But shortly after I left [Educational] Heritage [Inc.] the company went into bankruptcy.  I last saw Noel [N. Marder] after I'd come to Chicago [Illinois] when he came in one day as, as a salesperson, which was really his line of work.  He was an excellent salesman, not necessarily the best administrator.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but did he publish any books on any, any other ethnic groups'--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --heritage other than black people's?
Speaker 2: Other than, no, other than The Negro Heritage Library.  And there again, he was, I think he was sort of introduced to the concept by some of the clergy, with New York [New York] clergy with whom he worked.  As a direct sales operation, he relied very heavily on, on sales in the black community.  And I knew the Reverend George Lawrence in, in Brooklyn [New York, New York], who was the pastor at Antioch [Baptist] Church [New York, New York], with the person who introduced me to him first as, and we talked a little bit about, the last time we talked a little bit about Al Duckett [Alfred A. Duckett], who was--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Right, you told the story about Al Duckett.  He kind of like, kind of disappeared during a crucial time--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you had to--
Speaker 2: And at--I thought about Al just last night when I heard about Shirley Chisholm, because at the time that he died, he was working on a book with her.  I wonder if it ever got published.
Story_ID: 304385
Speaker 1: 'The Winding Road to Freedom[: A Documentary Survey of Negro Experiences in America,' Alfred E. Cain and Horace Varela] was published in '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite document in the book or a favorite portion of the book?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I was so in, in love with all of it (laughter).  And I still regret that I had not done that period, period that I was very close to and probably didn't see its historic value, the Depression--the Great Depression.
Speaker 1: Right.  Yeah, you said last time that you were criticized--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for--
Speaker 2: It was, you know it was--
Speaker 1: --though, for that.
Speaker 2: --an, an oversight of some importance.  But I, I guess I just saw that as something every day.  I'd, I'd lived through it.
Speaker 1: I remember about around the same period I think Joanne Grant had, had one I think in '68 [1968] called a documentary history of the Negro in America.  It was a paperback--no, 'Black Protest[: History, Documents, and Analyses, 1619 to the Present'], Joanne Grant.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Then there was another documentary his, history of the Negro in America ['The Negro in American History: Vol. I-III,' Adler et al].  There was a little small one than that, I think, you know.  It came out later, but yours came out first I imagine, well--
Speaker 2: Well, and all of us followed 'Attica.'  There's no, no--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --denying that.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now the 'Negro Heritage Reader for [Young People,' Alfred E. Cain] youth, now that was a--
Speaker 2: --'for Young People.'
Speaker 1: That came next, right, for, for young people, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And that, truthfully, that came about because I had met Tom Feelings, the artist.  And Tom (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He just passed away last summer I believe.
Speaker 2: And he had a concept for a comic strip based on, on a black character.  And when I saw it, I got excited about that.  And this is one of the instances of, you know, your editorial instinct.  This is something that was happening, so I contacted him and made arrangements to include the comic strip in the book, and then built the rest of the book around it.  And that was a, a staff effort.  All of us contributed portions to it.  But, again, I did the continuity for it.
Speaker 1: What was a comic strip that Tom Feelings came up with?  What was it?  What was it about?
Speaker 2: It was quasi-historical thing of telling, here again, telling the story of black people in, in this, their struggles.  And it was done with a large scale hero-type who was black and interacting with a, a young black person and impressing on him the significance of, of black history or the fact that he was living himself as a bit of history.
Story_ID: 304386
Speaker 1: We had a note from [HistoryMaker Reverend] Dr. [Kwame John R.] Porter that [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] asked you to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --join his staff at one point.  Can you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: I don't know if we did.  Well, again, at just about the time that I took the job at [Educational] Heritage [Inc.] (laughter)--that's when I became an editor and not just one of the contributors--I got a call from [HistoryMaker] Wyatt [Tee] Walker, who was one of Dr. King's associates whom I'd known for several years, again, through the Reverend [George] Lawrence, who was also a friend of Dr. King's.  And Wyatt called because a fellow, Jim O'Dell [sic. Jack O'Dell], in New York [New York] had, who had been the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] manager of the, of the New York office for that, and there had been allegations of, about O'Dell's communist leanings and what have you.  And he eventually had to leave the organization.  And it was at that point that I got a call from Wyatt saying, would I consider going to work in that office as.  And, and I had just gotten the Heritage job.  And although the figure was not astronomical, it was the first time in a long while I'd had a paying, paying job (laughter).  So I, I sort of declined the invitation.  And later, Dr. King came to New York, and I had made arrangements for him to have a car to the home of Jackie Robinson.  They were having a sort of a fundraising thing at Jackie Robinson's place in Connecticut.  I wasn't going, but I rode with them for, for a brief while and you know, had, had the opportunity to be teased by Dr. King as being, you know, a sunshine (laughter) patriot because I turned down his offer.  It was all in good humor, but you know, I thought you were a member of the (unclear) of the plan and all (laughter), but you turned me down for a job.  That, that's that connection.
Speaker 1: Okay, what year is this?  Let's see, was that in, in sixty--
Speaker 2: That would have been--
Speaker 1: --three [1963] or?
Speaker 2: That would have been somewhere between '63 [1963] and '65 [1965] and because in that interval too, there's also a, in this, in The Negro Heritage Library there's a book called the [sic. 'A] Martin Luther King [Treasury,' The Negro Heritage] Library--Treasury, rather, and it consists of things by him, excerpts from, from this book.  But the most important thing was, as far as that publication was concerned, was his support and advocacy for a, a book on desegregation and what have you.  And it, unlike popular things, this was a, a real deep study of why we needed to have some changes, serious changes made in American law.
Story_ID: 304387
Speaker 1: How were the books [The Negro Heritage Library] received?  How, how was the library received, and how many volumes were there published altogether do--
Speaker 2: We, we were ultimately able to get, we were supposed to have been doing twenty some odd books.  We ultimately put out ten, one of--two of the books being reprints of John [P.] Davis's book ['The American Negro Reference Book,' John Preston Davis].  And I'm having trouble now recalling the title, but, but as I said, the firm [Educational Heritage, Inc.] had financial problems, and so the rest of the series did not get, get published.  There was a woman's book ['Profiles of Negro Womanhood,' Sylvia G.L. Dannett], and there was a book on artists ['The Negro in the Performing Arts'].  There was a book on Negroes, as we used the term in those days, in politics and what have you ['The Negro in Public Affairs and Government,' Walter Christmas].  The, and those books did get included with some of the other things that we had.  We never got out the art book, for instance, which was what I was brought on to originally to edit.  But there I was finding it difficult to keep all those irons in the fire simultaneously because to meet publication deadlines and what have you, I frequently had to do more than just edit (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so how were they received?
Speaker 2: Well received, I thought.  I, again, it was the marketing that was a, was an obstacle in a sense, because they were sold on almost a door-to-door basis.  And, and they were expensive at, at that time.  You know, we wouldn't consider it expensive now (laughter), but at that time they, they were expensive, ranging, well averaging, say, twenty dollars a volume.  And, but you could buy them on an installment plan about the same as you would buy an 'Encyclopedia Britannica.'  But there were critics.  They'd said simply because the company was not all black and the fact that, that direct marketing thing can happen.  You've got a bunch of salesmen out there writing bad paper, really, and folks not making payments and like that.  But I would say that generally there was, folks that I was in touch with, and of course, there you get the warped impression that, that everybody loves you (laughter). That was what I was hearing, you know, how, how great it was and what have you. But I know, I would, I would daresay that it was an eye opening experience for a lot of those readers at that point.  I, I know that was something I, every time I met new people and the book was mentioned that, "I never knew" so and so, you know, which is gratifying to hear.  And as I think I made reference to the fact that when the American Library Association [ALA] reviewed some of the books, they called 'The Winding Road to Freedom[: A Documentary Survey of Negro Experiences in America,' Alfred E. Cain and Horace Varela] the most readable of its genre, so very proud of that.
Story_ID: 304388
Speaker 1: It was the black cultural revolution--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --sort of going on--
Speaker 2: Right, it was going on.
Speaker 1: --then, right.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, yeah, during that time, I remember that first international black arts [First World Festival of Black Arts (FESMAN), Dakar, Senegal] thing in, in Senegal took place.
Speaker 1: In 1966, yeah.
Speaker 2: I, I had a reservation, a ticket, but couldn't go (laughter)--(unclear) a deadline that involved a printer.  And so my associate editor, Mr. Walter Christmas enjoyed that trip (laughter), never got over feeling sorry for myself about that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, like once in a lifetime kind of trip, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right (laughter).  Well, and there again, you know, when, when [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] went to Oslo [Norway] to receive his Nobel Peace Prize, some of the people from the firm went along with him, again, because of their--(unclear).  I couldn't go (laughter), and my, my ticket was used by Dr. King's secretary, Dora [E.] McDonald (laughter), so, a whole series of near misses with Dr. King.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well, how long did you work for [Educational] Heritage [Inc.] publications?
Speaker 2: It was five years in, in total.
Speaker 1: Now what was the relationship between Heritage publications and the Association for [the Study of] Negro Life & History [Association for the Study of African American Life & History (ASALH)]?  Was it, was there a strong relationship between--
Speaker 2: No.  As a matter of fact, they--not they I should say--some members of, of the Association felt that this was encroaching on their territory, which it was.  And as a matter of fact, when we first talked about this, one of the things that were talked about was doing this in conjunction with the Association.  They declined, again, I think because of the white presence in, in our company at our--(unclear)--when they met in Detroit [Michigan] when, and I've forgotten which year it was now, but we went to make a presentation to, to Dr. [Charles H.] Wesley, who was president at that point, and you know, there was a lot of ill feelings generated by our just being there, so.  But, and as a matter of fact, it was a few years later that I saw, that they were doing a kind of same sort of project, because the salability was there.  There was a public ready for this sort of, sort of information.
Story_ID: 304389
Speaker 1: How did you end up leaving [Educational] Heritage [Inc.] publications?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) They couldn't pay me (laughter)--it was a very simple relationship.  No, they--I, I knew that there was--that their end was approaching, and so, my survival instincts led me to go get myself (laughter) another job.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now you were, now you were an editor at Tuesday Magazine, too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: And explain what Tuesday is for people who know, who don't know what it is.
Speaker 2: Well, the first example of a Tuesday kind of thing is N'DIGO now, being published now.  And Tuesday was one of the first of those kinds of inserts.  It appeared in the Chicago [Sunday] Sun-Times and major papers across the country.  This was the result of a idea of [W.] Leonard Evans [Jr.], who was founder, president, all the other top places in, in the company, it was a monthly magazine done.  It was generally conceded to be a first-rate operation, great graphics and decent people writing for it.  And they had been on board, they'd been out for a while before I was invited to come there.  As a matter of fact, I was invited to join Tuesday when they decided they wanted to put out a, another magazine with a heavy emphasis on the home and of course, to snare the woman reader.  And so that's when I went on, and they were, just before they published Tuesday At Home, it was, that one was called.  And that came out once a month, too, different closing dates and what have you, but, and, and it had its own sort of independent emphasis.  For that I did some writing, a lot of the editing, although at that point I was not the editorial director for a, but more or less had had a lot to say about what Tuesday At Home was going to be like.  But I have to acknowledge that Mr. Evans, who was the founder, president, and all of those other good things, had, had a finger in a, a whole lot of things.
Story_ID: 304390
Speaker 1: Well we were talking about Tuesday Magazine, and you were just, we were trying to explain what, what it was and how it appeared--but it's sort of like a black tabloid that kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: --folded over, was inserted in not just the black papers but the major--
Speaker 2: No, it was, as a matter of fact it--
Speaker 1: --papers all over the country.
Speaker 2: --it, it went to the major metropolitan papers here in Chicago [Illinois].  It was carried by the Chicago [Sunday] Sun-Times originally, and later it appeared in the, in the Chicago Tribune here.  And it was generally a well, well-respected publication.
Speaker 1: Tell me this, I've always wondered why, why the name Tuesday Magazine for a black--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Now that's whether the mythology holds or not, I, I can't swear, but it was Mr. Evans' [W. Leonard Evans, Jr.] view that Tuesday was a significant date in black publishing because it was necessary if you were going to get your publications to black readers, principally in the South, then you had to go on press on Tuesday.  And that's part of the--and after I joined one of my colleagues (unclear) said you know, you might also know that this has a biblical history, because in Jewish culture you'll find that when, in the story of creation, that it was on Tuesday that God said that's good twice (laughter).  So, but the, the genesis of the name was because of the significance of Tuesday in the life of black publishing.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they had to make sure they got out early to get to the South?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, you had to get--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so that it, by the weekend your readers in the South could, could receive it, you know.  The bundles would go out, and the trains would drop 'em off at, at train stations and what have you.
Story_ID: 304391
Speaker 1: So what period of time were you at Tuesday [Magazine], from what year were you?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was there from, I joined them in '71 [1971], yeah, and I left them in '75 [1975].  And that's, I had come through Chicago [Illinois] because of that job.  And, and when I left I almost returned to New York [New York], but I decided this is not a good plan to go back to a city like New York unemployed, so (laughter) and that's why I left Tuesday.  Here, though, it was a case of a disagreement in terms of, of policy--not, not publishing policy but management policy between myself and Mr. [W. Leonard] Evans [Jr.].  I must say that a couple of years later I was invited to rejoin, and Mr. Evans paid me a compliment of saying that I was probably the only, only former Tuesday person who didn't bad-mouth him.  But it, too, eventually had financial problems and, and went down.  I, I have to mention that in that interval between my leaving and return to Tuesday that three of us, Donn Davenport, John Lindsay [ph.], and myself, put our heads together and came up with another kind of supplement called Living Together.  And it was being distributed by the Chicago Sun-Times here and a few other places around the, around the country.  Bad luck again, not enough money, we had, had three issues to be published before we had to abandon it.  But it was, that was very, very well received.  We, when we'd do our presentations after the first issue, we had a large attache case filled with card from people, you know, praising the thing and--
Speaker 1: It's called Living Together?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and when, what, what, what are the publication dates on--
Speaker 2: That would have been '74 [1974], '75 [1975] I'm sure.
Speaker 1: So you were a founder of this one as well as a--
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: You, you were one of the founders of this one, yes--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as well as a, as well as an editor, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  As a matter of fact, I think my clearest expression of my own personal philosophy is in the, in the editorial of the first, first issue, which is based on that living together theme.  Yeah, I, I think of that pretty, pretty often, and again, a good, good idea that didn't survive.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it ceased publication in, so the year it was started, in--
Speaker 2: I am, I'm pretty sure it was '75 [1975] that we ceased publication--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --entirely.
Story_ID: 304392
Speaker 1: Were you working at Prentice Hall when you were working with Tuesday [Magazine] as well?
Speaker 2: Well, I was working at Prentice Hall when the invitation to join Tuesday came.  As a matter of fact, it came because I was seeing one of the editors of a book that was being done at Prentice Hall.  And he knew, Warren Picower, who was the, well, he was the editor-in-chief for Tuesday, and the agent wanted to know if I would be interested in talking with Warren.  I wasn't really.  I was satisfied with my work at, at Prentice Hall.   And I can't say that that may have been one of the big mistakes that I made in terms of judgment and well-being (laughter), 'cause when I told that, Prentice Hall that I was going to be leaving, it was standard procedure there was a lady in (laughter) a, in a room with a computer who (laughter) could very quickly punch in some figures showing that if you stayed until your retirement age, you'd retire as a millionaire (laughter).  But you know I'm not, so (laughter).  But no, that, but it was a very rewarding experience to, to work there.
Speaker 1: So, so you, you were--when did you start at Prentice Hall?
Speaker 2: In, I believe it was, yeah, '67 [1967] that I--yep.
Speaker 1: So you were there from '67 [1967] to--
Speaker 2: 'Til, 'til '70--'71 [1971] actually.
Speaker 1: Seventy-one [1971], okay.  And you were, you were the senior, a senior--
Speaker 2: A senior--
Speaker 1: --editor, editor.
Speaker 2: -editor, right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well, I do, I, I didn't join 'em as a senior editor.  And that's one of those cases again where you, you know, we'll, we'll give you a trial sort of thing.  So I--and the only vacancy they had at that point was for an assistant editor, but needing a job I took it.  And I must say that they were rapidly moving me through the stages of assistant editor to senior editor.
Story_ID: 304393
Speaker 1: Now you were a senior editor in the trade books division at Prentice Hall, and you, you think you're, you're probably the first black--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at--
Speaker 2: I, I'm pretty certain that I--on staff.  Now, I know that they, black writers had worked with them on other things, but I was the first black staff person in the trade books division.  I think the people in the textbook division had seen more blacks in--than had in trade books.
Speaker 1: So what, what, what were some of the publications you worked on?  Do you, you, do you remember the--
Speaker 2: Oh, I recall doing a book on, on the First World War [World War I, WWI].  There was a series that I worked on called the fort series.  It was a book, a group of books done by historians talking about the various forts around the country and their significance and what have you.  I worked on that and worked on, oh, we, I think that we published, in cooperation with the United Nations [UN], it was like the family of man kind of thing, a very handsome art book.  And I have to mention 'Variety's' ['Variety Music Cavalcade'], a book on popular music, which I, was already in publication, but it was time for a revision, and I, I worked as editor of that.  And as a matter of fact, they even mentioned my name (laughter) in the, in the foreword.  We did a book, one of my favorites was the book on Walter Reuther ['Reuther,' Frank Cormier and William J. Eaton], and my--I'm blocking the names of the two men who did it.  But it, one of them [Frank Cormier] was, was the, the journalist who used to end those presidential news conferences: "Thank you, Mr. President."  That was, that was my man, whose name I'll remember as soon as I'm out of here (laughter).  But that was one that I enjoyed immensely.
Story_ID: 304394
Speaker 1: And I recall at the time of the sixty-eighth [sic. '68 (1968)] election, that the, a group of journalists from the London Daily Express were under contract to produce that book.  And I sort of inherited it after I joined Prentice Hall, and we were determined that it was gonna be out in time for, be in the book service for inauguration day in '69 [1969].  In order to do that--this is one of the craziest turnarounds I'd ever worked with, but I would get copy today.  I would get it to a copy editor today (laughter), and when I went to deliver that, I picked up the previous day's work.  And it was one of those things where, in order to meet that deadline, it was that constant wheeling and dealing, but very rewarding.  It was called 'Divided We Stand' [ph.].  You know, it's been so long now since I (laughter), since I was doing these things that, that my memory of them is not as clear as I'd like it to be, but--
Speaker 2: But that's the book on Walter Reuther, 'Divided We Stand'?  'Divided We Stand' was the Walter--
Speaker 1: No, that's the one on the--
Speaker 2: Okay, that's another--
Speaker 1: --that's the one on the election--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: --on the [Richard Milhous] Nixon election really.  'Divided We Stand'--the Reuther book was just called 'Reuther' [Frank Cormier and William J. Eaton].  And I enjoyed that especially, and--
Speaker 2: Did you learn some things you didn't know about the labor movement I guess--
Speaker 1: Not, not that I learned so much, but I found myself with a new kind of empathy with the labor movement.  I suppose I was labor inclined all my life, my early work experience right out of high school [Alexander Hamilton Vocational & Technical High School, Brooklyn, New York, New York].  I, I worked for a union in, in New York [New York].  I used to do volunteer work once a week and what have you.  So, in one sense, I was, you know, something of a partisan.  But I had never--and I mentioned this simply because in the, in my working, it's one of the few times that I've worked with a book and came across something that made me cry.  It was just that poignant.  And it was nothing more than a recitation of the union hymn, 'Solidarity Forever' (laughter).  But, yeah, just heightened my awareness of how significant the labor movement has been in American history--

Speaker 1: After Prentice Hall you worked for Tuesday [Magazine], and then you started your own publication, Living Together.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then, so what happened after 1975?  I mean what did you do for a living after--
Speaker 2: Well, then I went, went back Tuesday for, until it finally (laughter) shut its doors and did some freelancing.
Speaker 1: So when did it finally shut down?
Speaker 2: Actually, I think it, it probably would have been '77 [1977], probably.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, in the meantime, you're, you're off, you're, you're still doing musical directing at the, at, for--
Speaker 2: Yeah, for--
Speaker 1: --churches and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.  And, and I've mentioned that after, that I did some freelancing.  And one of the jobs I had was as, and this goes back to my Tuesday experience, was as a writer for a series on, on food for Kraft [Foods] at the--it was called 'The Heritage of Cooking.'  And by and large, it was a matter of writing about the black palate for all intents and purposes.  And I, I wrote the first few months of that publication, which was owned by Kraft.  You know, you were hired to do (laughter) a piece.  You got paid for it (unclear)--and I think I lasted about a year.  And a couple of other little jobs, writing jobs came along that sustained me until I got the invitation to join [HistoryMaker] Roland Burris.
Story_ID: 304396
Speaker 1: Now how did that come about?  Now this is in 1981 that you come to Chicago [Illinois] to--
Speaker 2: No, this was, I joined him in '79 [1979].
Speaker 1: So, okay, all right.  So what we have here is actually wrong, so, '79 [1979].
Speaker 2: Actually, we didn't go on payroll until, until '80 [1980].  That's why--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you came to Chicago in '79 [1979] to work with [HistoryMaker] Roland Burris?
Speaker 2: No, no, I came--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I came to Chicago in '71 [1971] to work with Tuesday [Magazine].  That's (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Oh, so you stayed here after--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --you'd got, okay.
Speaker 2: --right.
Speaker 1: So after you got here with Tuesday and stayed.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, 'cause what had happened was [W. Leonard] Evans [Jr.] called me and asked if I would consider coming out to work for a couple of months, and I agreed, because what, and the reason for that was we used to, Warren Picower and I used have to come out here twice a month to close the book as it were.  And I had said that, after all that work at Prentice Hall I saw, saw this is being a waste of, of energy and suggested that they ought to hire here a production editor who would be able to operate as liaison between the New York [New York] office, and where all the editorial was done, and the Chicago office, where all the publishing facets, manufactured the paper and everything else was done.  And that would have obviated the need to come out here twice a month.  Evans didn't particularly like the idea, but then had a second thought about it and said, "Would you come out?"  And I, I agreed, and I've been here ever since (laughter).
Story_ID: 304397
Speaker 1: How did you get associated with the [HistoryMaker] Roland Burris campaign?
Speaker 2: Well, this was a case of being recommended to Roland by one of the authors that I had worked with at Tuesday [Magazine].  And so, you know, he, he arranged for me to meet him.  And we talked, and so I got the invitation to--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to join his staff.  And at the point that I had joined him, I was gonna be the guy in New York [New York]--I mean in Chicago [Illinois], because the head of the department was gonna be in Springfield [Illinois] with, when Bill Sharpe [ph.] was--that person died, and then I became the editorial director, communications director or whatever.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, did you enjoy the job?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes and no (laughter).  (Unclear) it was, I didn't, and the only lack of enjoyment was the fact that you always felt somebody was looking over your shoulder and (laughter), and planning to do you in if they could.  And I was eligible to retire in '87 [1987], and that's what I did (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you basically rolled out, did PR [public relations] and stuff for--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 304398
Speaker 1: I enjoyed the fact about that cooking series ['The Heritage of Cooking'] with Kraft [Foods].  And that came, again, from I, I had an experience with Tuesday At Home.  And we were having a problem with us, some people who were supposed to be supplying the material for the food section.  And since food and cooking is sort of a hobby with me, I, on a couple of occasions, filled in, and ultimately it was just decided, "Well, you go ahead and do it."  And so I wrote that column or that feature under my mother's first name and her maiden name, so Hazel Moore (laughter) was my, what do you call 'em, nom de plume (laughter).  And I said I enjoyed that, and I did, because in one of the things I had created a sort of fictional family.  Mind you, I'm writing this as a woman (laughter).  And so, in that situation you had a husband and children.  The husband was an old hotshot.  And (laughter), and the, one of the letters that had us all cracking up was this woman who wrote and said (laughter): "Dear Hazel Moore, your husband, old hotshot, sure reminds me of mine," (laughter).  So it was a validation of, of what we were trying to do.  But that was enjoyable.  I think I was able to do a couple of things there that were important.  I recall that at one point in food publishing everything looked so artificial, and I had made a, a decision at Tuesday [Magazine] that what we showed as food was going to be food that had been prepared.  And as a result, every now and then you'd see a, a piece of chicken with a little bit of a burn on it.  But that's what would have happened at, in anybody's kitchen, and that's the truth of the matter rather than just putting a, you know, a raw chicken on, on the platter and, and painting it with a gravy master.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were going for truth I guess, huh?
Speaker 1: Yeah, truth in, truth in eating (laughter).
Story_ID: 304399
Speaker 1: So you worked for [HistoryMaker] Roland Burris.  Now he--that's before he ran for governor, right?  And that was during the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, at, at the time that I went to work for Roland.  And you know, I, I think if he'd wanted to, he could still be in, in government.  I don't know if he would been governor, but I know he ran very early on for a seat in the [U.S.] Senate.  And I, I thought that was where he, where he belonged, where he could make some, his best contribution.  And this is one of those cases where two good men bumped heads.  Before the campaign began, Roland had talked with Paul Simon, who expressed no interest in, in running.  By the time of the primaries, Simon was very much into it (laughter).
Story_ID: 304400
Speaker 1: You started working with [HistoryMaker] Roland Burris in '79 [1979] and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and actually (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) and said he--
Speaker 2: --was hired in '79 [1979] right after he won the primary--not the primary but the election itself.  I didn't actually go on staff until January of, of '80 [1980].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were--we, I know we were saying before we closed the last roll that he decided to run for [U.S.] Senate after he, he kind of, he knew that he, he had, he stood a really good chance, but then Paul Simon decided to get involved in the contest.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And Simon had already stated he wouldn't be involved.
Speaker 2: Wouldn't, right, and which was part of Roland's decision making, you know, the fact that he wasn't gonna have an opponent like Simon in the primary.  But politics being what they are, Simon had been persuaded to, to get in the race.  And I think you'll find that the primary results left Roland as, as a strong second to, to Simon.  And so many people have said afterward that they, they regretted having to make a choice between what they considered two good men.
Story_ID: 304401
Speaker 1: So what were the highlights of your, well, working with [HistoryMaker] Roland Burris?  And what really stands out as a--
Speaker 2: Well, I'd, I'd have to say that for me the greatest experience was attending the Democratic [National] Convention [DNC] in, in '80 [1980] in New York [New York].  I went in to, to be on hand if Mr. Burris needed me for anything, but, and there were a couple of PR [public relations] things we wanted to do like be sure he got a spot on the program and that sort of thing.  But just being there and being able to see this thing unfold after all these years of reading about it was really gratifying to be there.  It, it was also rewarding to see the kinds of things that Roland was able to do that were sort of breakthrough things and, and the fact that people enjoyed them; appreciated them is probably better.
Speaker 1: What, what are a couple of things that you--that come to mind?
Speaker 2: I called it one of, and I don't think this is necessarily the newest idea in the world, but we eventually put out a little publication called It's Your Money [ph.].  And it was one of the best simplified explanations of what happens with taxpayer funds.  And again, you know, it, it gave the public ownership of, of these funds rather than the government per se.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it, that was sort of an echo that was heard in the president's [President George Walker Bush] statement just yesterday.  You know, he was talking about the funds for South, Southeast Asia, that, you know, it's, it's the public, it's the public that's gonna wind up doing more for those people than the government would.
Story_ID: 304402
Speaker 1: Now Roland Burris' [HistoryMaker Roland Burris] career as a politician here in Illinois has been one of--I mean he's, he's--people respect him, but he doesn't seem to excite the voters--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --like a Harold Washington did and, and you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Well, very few actually do.  [HistoryMaker] Barack Obama, we just saw him, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --be able to galvanize lots of people.  Now what, do, do you have any thoughts on, on Roland Burris--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, your two names you just mentioned, you mentioned Harold Washington; you mentioned Obama.  Most of them are terrific on the platform.  Roland is better now, but he did not come off as a natural in those early days.  And, and I, I'd have to say that some of that may have been my fault, because the speeches I was writing were not necessarily the things that he would, you know, grab ahold and make his own.  He made his points, but they, they didn't necessarily energize a lot of folks.  As a matter of fact, one of the, the things that I remember in the Washington campaign, there was a day when the rulers--movers and shakers of Chicago [Illinois] had Roland, Harold Washington, and I believe the late senator [Richard H. Newhouse, Jr.]--let, let me--
Speaker 1: I mean a U.S. senator or state senator?
Speaker 2: I know with the Senate [Illinois General Assembly], state senator--
Speaker 1: State senator.
Speaker 2: --from Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois].  This kills me because I considered him a friend.  But, put it this way: Roland made a speech before this group of movers and shakers.  And it was so well-received, and I remember Roland was so proud to have received a letter from [HistoryMaker] John [H.] Johnson praising his appearance at that group.  And when we were going down to Springfield [Illinois] for, for another inauguration, some of Washington's stuff was being circulated, and you know, my secretary and I were having a great time, "Oh, well--remember this?" (Laughter) It was just a few conceptual things that we threw in that Roland had used, and we were glad to see that somebody was gonna put it in, into language that would reach a public, right.
Story_ID: 304403
Speaker 1: Was it Dick Newhouse [Richard H. Newhouse, Jr.] you were thinking of?
Speaker 2: Thank you, yes.
Speaker 1: Richard Newhouse, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, state senator from Illinois, yeah, from Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois].  So, in--'cause I know, well, [HistoryMaker] Roland Burris ran for governor I guess in '92 [1992] I guess or '90 [1990], '90 [1990] or '92 [sic. 1998].
Speaker 2: I think--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, I think--
Speaker 1: But you were--yeah.
Speaker 2: --at this point, I was gone.  But, because in that interim, since (unclear) he had become attorney general, which is really one of the, one of the good jobs.  The best job would have been to be secretary of state if you weren't gonna be governor, just because that gave you so much influence over so many things.  But he had his eye on the governorship, and, and you know, after one run people just saw you as the loser.  That's so often the case in politics.  You can come back and maybe, but he did, he did have his second run, and, and that didn't work out.  And then when he took on the, the mayoralty here in Chicago [Illinois], that didn't work.  And so then he becomes sort of like almost, and I, I wouldn't want him to hear me saying this, but he becomes almost a Harold Stassen of, of local politics.
Speaker 1: Harold Stassen the Minnesota--what was he?  He, he was a senator from Minnesota that ran for president every year?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right, he just (unclear) (laughter).  He was just (unclear) (laughter) who was gonna be there.  Well, so, of course, the closest example of him now is Ralph Nader (laughter), does nothing but get in the way of other people.
Story_ID: 304404
Speaker 1: So why--when you retired in, in '87 [1987]?  I mean what did you, I mean what have you done since '87 [1987] I mean basically?
Speaker 2: Well, (laughter) that's my other life--when I retired, I became more active in my church and--
Speaker 1: The name of your church is?
Speaker 2: Ingleside-Whitfield United Methodist Church [Chicago, Illinois].  And I've been, oh, I served as the lay leader of the local congregation, then was elected to be lay leader of the district, and along the line got elected to be a delegate to the general conference in, in ninety--'96 [1996], and have worked with groups like Black Methodists for Church Renewal [BMCR], who, with whom I worked up until now.  I'm co-chair of the communications committee for Black Methodists.  So, that's been the stuff that has kept me sort of active and reasonably alert.
Story_ID: 304405
Speaker 1: What are your, some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, my hopes are also part of my concern, and that is it distresses me to see how indifferent young people are to the situation in which we live.  And, and I hate most the fact that they have such a negative image of themselves.  And, and I think the whole time I was working that was something that was something dear to me.  And so when I see the, some, some child who's a high school graduate who can't read and, and even worse can't express himself sensibly, that bothers me.  But on the other hand, there are a whole crop of bright, terribly bright young people coming along.  And I think if we can support them and keep them encouraged, things will continue to move, well, the term is: will continue to progress.  And that would, that would be my hope, that we will be able to progress so that if at some point, [HistoryMaker] Barack Obama, for instance, were to be considered for a higher office, for the vice presidency or, or the presidency, that that there won't be the need to justify his being, being on the ticket.  That's what I would hope for.
Story_ID: 304406
Speaker 1: When you look back at your life and all the things you've done, you had so many different roles in play, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Oh, (laughter) yeah, yeah, there, there are some things I, I guess I, I would have gone ahead and earned the doctorate.  And, and that would have probably led me to take a different set of jobs.  So, really, I think what my life has, have been directed by others more than by me.  You know, it's a matter of somebody saying, Al [HistoryMaker Alfred Cain], there's an opening at such and such a place; why don't you go for it.  And I've never had the kind of ego that would have led me to think that I should, should apply for this on my own.  So I'm grateful for those folks who have tried, who saw something in me, but I wish I'd seen it, too.
Story_ID: 304407
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look back on the things that you've done, you know, to this point, do you--what, what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, just I think of myself as having proved unstoppable in the usual way.  There are few things that I'd undertaken that I didn't have a reasonable amount of success with.  I didn't become a pop idol or anything in what I was doing, but at least there was generally a feeling--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: --there was generally a feeling that I was making a contribution as we went along.
Story_ID: 304408
Speaker 1: There's one little thing that we didn't talk about, and that was a, a group here called [Chicago Society of] Writers and Editors [WE].  It was, it was done by, it was established by Alfred [A.] Duckett, who was a close buddy of [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory.  And Al had pulled it together at the time that Dick was leaving Chicago [Illinois].  And, and after that first spurt of action, we became a, a sort of permanent organization called Writers and Editors, WE as--which gave us a lot of fun because we could always say we as in not be incorrect.
Speaker 2: Now, when, when did Writers and Editors start?
Speaker 1: It would have been in the, in the late [sic. early] '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Here in Chicago?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And yeah, been the late '70s [1970s], because we used to have a thing called Coffee and Conversation, it was called.  And the meetings were usually held on Sunday.  And for a couple of years they met in my apartment.  And this was another opportunity to get some of those folks who were interested, younger folks who were interested in journalism and in writing and what have you, and we were able to give them a supply of, of celebrities that they could look up to.  The ones that they seemed most interested in were not necessarily the writers, however. I can recall that I could barely get in my apartment when, when Billy Dee Williams came (laughter).  But he was in town making a, making a film, and he had been invited to say--and on the other hand, we had a chance to introduce them to, to writers like Cyrus Colter and have them meet somebody who had been involved in local work, like Lillian Calhoun, for instance.
Story_ID: 304409
Speaker 1: Did any of the writers for Johnson [Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] publications participate [in Chicago Society of Writers and Editors (WE)], like [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett or, or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or--
Speaker 2: Lerone didn't.  And a couple of the people who were on staff came to the meetings.  It was such a loose-knit organization anyhow that by and large we didn't find ourselves talking too much about who we, who we worked for, but rather talking about what we'd like to do.
Speaker 1: Hoyt [W.] Fuller or--
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Was, was Hoyt Fuller a part of this group or, or, or Dick Durham [Richard Durham] or--
Speaker 2: Hoyt was, as a matter of fact, it was just shortly before Hoyt got the, Writers and Editors really hit its stride.  But we used to--well, again, Al Duckett [Alfred A. Duckett], I keep mentioning because Al was a good buddy, and we referred to each other as the other Al (laughter).  So, he had been a PR [public relations] man for folks like [Duke] Ellington and Mahalia Jackson and what have you, so he knew everybody that worked at Johnson.  And, and when he--Al could come up with some of the most fantastic ideas.  That's part of what happened at, at [Educational] Heritage [Inc.].  But he was, he was not all that smart of a fellow (laughter), but if somebody was gonna take it and run with it, it, it would produce results, right.  And so we had a, an, an opportunity to influence some of the younger people.  I know I wound up sort of tutoring one young man, who I've lost contact with, but he was, he happened to come to one of the meetings.  He was a high schooler at that point, and he was so in awe of all, of what he saw, of those old men who knew everything about writing and everything about the world.  And he had submitted someone a little piece of copy that I got you (unclear).  I started to edit it and then decided well, he needs more than just somebody editing and correcting his paper and giving it back to him.  But that's how we wound up he'd come once a week, and we'd talk and review stuff that he had written and the likes.  One of the people who was very involved with, with us was [HistoryMaker] Ellis Cose.  Ellis was the person who wrote the first article for Living Together.  And it was a question--it was what was then a, a (laughter) lot, was a wild goose kind of thing because it raised the question: can a black man be mayor of Chicago [Illinois]?  And of course, we found out he could be but not often (laughter).  But those are the kinds of things that, that interaction led to.  And a lot of the movers and shakers in this town came through when we'd ask them.  Anne Blair, who writes a, write, oh, she writes for The Chicago Crusader newspaper.  She's the movie reviewer.  She was a regular, and well, her husband had been one of the, one of the founders of Writers and Editors, Harold Chisholm [sic. Earle Chisolm].  And as a matter of fact, their son is, is my godchild.
Story_ID: 304410
Speaker 1: So you've been involved in trying to develop, I guess, and organize writers--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right--
Speaker 1: --through [Chicago Society of] Writers and Editors [WE] and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, that gave us an opportunity.  When [HistoryMaker] Carole Simpson left Chicago [Illinois] to take the position in Washington [D.C.], I, I don't know if I mentioned this, but for one semester I substituted over at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] for, for a class in basic writing that she, she had done, and one of the great experiences of, I think, left me was not being one of those people who had been prepared for teaching at a teacher's college or any of that sort of thing.  I, at the end of that year, there were two black kids in the class, and I had said that I was--I insisted that they meet their deadlines and that every assignment, you know, or test was to be treated as if it were an editorial assignment.  Well, I didn't get final papers from the two black kids.  And that really (laughter) threw me for a loop, and I didn't know what to do.  And then finally it dawned on me: give them an incomplete (laughter), because they were both capable of very good work.  So I gave them the incompletes, and Northwestern does (laughter) require if you're gonna graduate, you're gonna get rid of those incompletes (laughter).  And they, both of them did turn in final work, one I had to ask to redo it, just because you could say it was something quick and what have you.  He was just doing it because, as an exercise, but the second time around it was better.  And the young lady I met, whom several months after her graduation, she was working with World Book [Inc., Chicago, Illinois], and, and she actually thanked me for (laughter) making her have to do that final paper.
Story_ID: 304411
Speaker 1: Dearborn [Street, Chicago, Illinois] and what?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dearborn and right, right off Division [Street].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --'cause, well, it wasn't the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], but it was still, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: --out of the neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Well, and of course, that got to be part of, of the problem for some folks, because (laughter) parking was so bad up there.  But they [Chicago Society of Writers and Editors (WE)] showed up every Sunday.  As a matter of fact, John--
Speaker 1: Every Sunday?  Every Sunday?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, the genius of that is that you, you never had to worry about when the next meeting was; you knew (laughter) it was gonna be Sunday at 4:00 at Al Cain's [HistoryMaker Alfred Cain] house.  And we eventually moved into a, a club--a pub sort of atmosphere.  And here I can't remember the guy's name who owned it, but he, he gave us access to the place.  We weren't necessarily good customers because we didn't allow drinking (laughter) at our meetings.  And so, I don't think you can make very much out of selling a bunch of old folks soda pop (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, every Sunday they, they were there.  And like I said, some Sundays they, they struck it rich and some Sundays it would be just be a matter of talking amongst ourselves and sharing experiences.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how long did the group run--or is it still going on?
Speaker 2: No, Al [Alfred A. Duckett] died in, I think it was '80 [1980]; if I'm not mistaken, it was '81 [sic. 1984] when Al died, and, and bit by bit we fizzled.  But a couple of other organizations had been born in that process.  One was--run by John Bellamy.  Have you run into him?  He's--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And the other was Anne Blair put together a thing she called Pro & Con Screening Board.  So, I, I know John is doing other things now, and, but I think Anne is still doing that, and she, she established her own variant on Grant A Wish [Inc.] because she does that kind of thing every year--
Story_ID: 304412
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Helen Moore] get a chance to see you become successful as a writer?
Speaker 2: That event [Salute to Alfred E. Cain, Ingleside-Whitfield United Methodist Church, Chicago, Illinois] was my mother's last--my last opportunity to see my mother in good health.  My cousin had flown her out for this event.
Speaker 1: Oh, so this is, now, you, you were honored in 1997.  That's the event we're talking about here?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, and--
Speaker 2: And she came out.  By then, she was blind, more than legally blind.  She was totally blind, but it was a nice visit.  And then in November of that year, she had a fall and had to, you know, one thing led to another, and finally in March of '98 [1998] she passed.  But she had--and I think she got a lot of pleasure out of people like [HistoryMaker] Roland [Burris] saying, "Mom," (laughter), which I had never called her, but she enjoyed hearing it from others.  I'm always, I mention that with a certain amount of gratitude to my cousin because he was the one who persuaded her that she ought to come out here.  She--
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: What's your cousin's name?
Speaker 2: Clarence Nelson [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 304413
Speaker 1: The last question we ask is similar to legacy, but a little, a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That, that's a tough one (laughter).  And it, I, I would hope that folks would remember that I tried to do the right thing and at the right times and I that I had a I had a certain tenacity; circumstances didn't throw me too often.  I, and I'll send you a copy of that opening editorial Living Together.  I think that sums me up pretty well.  I ended the little piece with a quote from Langston Hughes, his, his poem where he talks about we do a variety of things, and we try to, and in all our efforts, we we're trying to make progress out of difficulties.  And, and I think that's pretty much the way I've lived and not let any difficulties impede my progress any more than, than they did.  And whenever I talk to younger people now that's one of the things I'm always stressing, you know, take a good look at yourself, and, and try to be the best you that you can be.  And that's important I think now because of the peer thing, where everybody wants to be (laughter), be alike.  And it's so important for some of these kids to know that they can, they can achieve without necessarily being, the one who was always, you know, in the group but not leading it.  So, but I'd like--I'll, I'll have to send you a copy of that Living Together editorial.  I didn't realize it at the time: it's one of the, it's one of the fastest pieces of writing I'd ever done (laughter), because I went in the office one day, and sat down and come out of there, I, I handed the piece to Donn [Davenport].  And when we had our, our initial introduction, you know, fancy cocktail party, and well, we had to--it's a cocktail party and, and a luncheon.  And, and everybody who was anybody it seemed was there.  And I was, I was very moved by the fact that the major presentation was a drab, an actor reading that editorial.  And we had put some pictures of, of Brown [ph.] that, not so much to illustrate what I was saying but to illustrate the idea that I was trying to convey.  And since I hadn't participated in that phase of things, I found myself all choked up at, up at the meeting.

Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Hold on please.  Okay, good next.
Speaker 1: That's my mother, and that would have been in 1990 because it was a celebration of her ninetieth birthday.
Speaker 2: That's, I really don't remember the date on this one, but that's my mother doing what she enjoyed doing most and that was playing the hostess.
Speaker 1: Me at a photo session for [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Roland] Burris, and I imagine that was somewhere around '81 [1981] or '82 [1982].
Speaker 2: That's me as a youngster in Homestead, Pennsylvania.  That was, I guess I was about seven years old at that point, so that would make it like '28 [1928].
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That's my grandfather, Doc Cain, a very wise old man.
Speaker 1: About what year is that?  About how old is there?

Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay, at top of this, that's me a few months before I went off to join this [U.S.] military in 1943.
Speaker 2: Moving down, the kid on the horseback is me at my grandfather's farm.  And I must have been four or five at that point.
Speaker 1: The next picture is my dad [Louis Cain], and that's a picture dating back from the '30s [1930s].
Speaker 2: At roughly the same time of the last picture on the right, that's dad and me.  And that would have been late '30s [1930s]--and not late '30s [1930]; I was only fourteen then.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That's a picture of my mother, again, on a boat.  I don't know where they were going, but my mother used to arrange excursions, as it were, for her church, and this is one of the activities I'm sure she sponsored.
Speaker 1: This is a real family picture, because in it you'll see my, in the very center you'll see my [maternal] grandmother, Mrs. Rosa [Naomi] Redrick she's surrounded by her children, all of whom were seated.  And the people in back are her, their spouses.  Should I identify these, this, the people are?  Is that enough?

Speaker 2: If you can't remember that's okay
Speaker 1: I can't remember (laughter)--
Speaker 2: That's roughly 1960, and that's me.  And that picture was taken because I was being considered for the job at Antioch Baptist Church [New York, New York] as director of music and also as a staff member.
