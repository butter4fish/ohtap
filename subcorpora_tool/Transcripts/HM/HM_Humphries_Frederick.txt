Speaker 1: --[The HistoryMakers] interview is being conducted by [HistoryMaker] Robert C. Hayden and the videographer is Scott Stearns.  The interview is taking place at the black archive and research center [Southeastern Regional Black Archives Research Center and Museum; Carrie Meek-James N. Eaton, Sr. Southeastern Regional Black Archives Research Center and Museum] on the campus of Florida A&M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], and the date is October 17th, 2006.  Mr. HistoryMaker, would you please state your full name and would you spell your name for me.
Speaker 2: All right.  My full name is Frederick Stephen Humphries [HistoryMaker Frederick Humphries].  Frederick is F-R-E-D-E-R-I-C-K and Stephen is S-T-E-P-H-E-N, Humphries is H-U-M-P-H-R-I-E-S.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  Would you give us your, your date of birth and your place of birth?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was born December the 26th, 1935, and I was born in a place called Apalachicola, Florida which is down on the Golf Coast of Florida near the Panhandle.
Speaker 1: The conversation was--
Speaker 2: Was I--was I focusing on the camera?
Speaker 1: You looked like you looked at the lens a couple of times.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I want to make sure that you got me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Believe me, I got you (laughter).
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Dr. Humphries, how would you describe or label your profession, your occupation currently and in the immediate past?  What have you been doing professionally?
Speaker 2: Well, there, there have been several facets to my life.  First, I would have labeled the first part of my life as a researcher and a teacher in science, and then the middle part of my life has been tied up with administration in education.  Administration and the developer of academic programs as an administrator of educational institutions, both private and public, and now I'm, I am a--purely a professor not an administrator, and I am engaged in the perseverance of preserving a law school [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University College of Law, Orlando, Florida] that I had a huge hand in, in returning to Florida A&M and trying to make sure that nothing happens to it as a return entity to Florida A&M.  And so I am playing out the latter stages of my professional life as a regent professor doing a work with the law school both in terms of the attraction of students to that law school, fundraising for that law school, and doing something related to what I've spent an entire lifetime working on--how to increase the number of African Americans going into science and engineering, and all along the pipeline from undergraduate school to graduate school, and then finally working in the profession.  So, I'm still doing that and that's--I'm going to do that for a little while longer and then I'm going to be through.
Story_ID: 379894
Speaker 1: Dr. Humphries [HistoryMaker Frederick Humphries], you had several top administrative positions in higher education.  Would you tell us what those positions were and where you served in those positions and how long in each one?
Speaker 2: Well, I--the first really top position was the--was the director of the Curriculum Resources Group of the Institute for Services to Education, which I did in Boston [Massachusetts] and, and there I was in charge of all of the what you would call the faculty of a major higher educational national experiment in higher education.  It was a curriculum approach to the first year of college and it involved six or seven disciplines of, of science, mathematics, social sciences, humanities, and English philosophy as a part of that.  But, later I went on to become--I, I stayed in the director's job for two years, and then I moved from the director's job to becoming vice president for the Institute for Services to Education and largely confined to academic programs, and in that capacity, I started the interdisciplinary program for I guess maybe twenty historical black colleges.  I started an institutional research consortium and that went on for about twenty-five, twenty-six HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities], and I started graduate programs.  I did a--we did a program in social studies with master's degree for students with the univer-, Memphis State University, which is the University of Memphis [Memphis, Tennessee] now.  Atlanta University, which is Clark Atlanta [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] now, and Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] which is still Fisk University.  We did a program in science, master's degree and did that with Tennessee State [Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], Fisk, and Atlanta University which again is Clark Atlanta University.  We did those programs with them.  The, the largest program was the Thirteen College Curriculum Program which started out with thirteen universities for the first year of college for trying to solve the problem of, of students--African American students dropping out of college in the early years and dropping out not just because they couldn't afford to continue, but dropping out because of looking at a curriculum that they studied that did not speak to their interests nor their needs, and so we developed an approach to the first year of college and second year.  The driving force of that approach was to not only lighten the kids up, light their eyes up for academic attainment, but to also keep them in school and we did that and that program expanded from the thirteen colleges to forty universities from thirteen hundred students to twenty thousand students and I--.  The number of faculty members from black colleges came on the order of somewhere between seven-fifty and a thousand faculty members in the program, and it was a tremendous activity.
Story_ID: 379895
Speaker 1: Now, we did some research projects.  We studied, you know, what informs students' choice in making a decision to go on to higher education, what they're going to major in, and since we were interested in trying to understand something about why it is that African Americans do not pursue majors in science and engineering akin to the percentage that white students pursue these majors, and so we did a study down in Chesapeake Bay-Portsmouth area of Virginia in the high schools to do that study.  We studied--we did a study in black colleges to look at what the impact was on the faculties of historical black colleges and universities [HBCUs] in terms of what kind of people in the '70s [1970s] were going into faculty positions in the historical black colleges, and were we becoming diversified to the extent that we didn't have many African Americans teaching on the faculty in science and engineering in, in those areas, and so we did some of that work which I conducted in the activities that we were doing with regard to that activity.  When I became vice president, it was the vice president's position that allowed me to, to have this whole host of activities reign at the Institute for Services to Education and then from there, I went to Tennessee State University [Nashville, Tenn.] where I became president, and I stayed in the vice president's position at ISE [Institute for Services to Education] for four years and went on to become President of Tennessee State from that position.  My time spent at Tennessee State University which was a--an opportunity to explore a topic that I was sincerely interested in which was the desegregation of higher education and the fairness of desegregation of higher education to existing historical black colleges and universities, and so Tennessee State represented an interesting proposition inasmuch as it was a, a school involved outside of the Adams versus Richardson case [Adams v. Richardson, 1972], and its own desegregation case called the Geier [Geier v. University of Tennessee, 1979] case in the State of Tennessee.
Story_ID: 379896
Speaker 1: So, Tennessee State University [Nashville, Tennessee] represented an interesting proposition because it was involved in its own case.  The Adams versus Richardson [Adams v. Richardson, 1972] case was a Kent State [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio] case, and Tennessee was exempted because the only public institution of higher education in the State of Tennessee was Tennessee State University and I was being selected president, and so the only desegregation that you were concerned about in the State of Tennessee as it related to historical black college and university [HBCUs] was that Tennessee State as well as the desegregation of the formerly all-white institutions and, and the University of Tennessee system of higher education in the State of Tennessee, and also the state board of regents' system [Tennessee Board of Regents] of higher education in the State of Tennessee.  But it put Tennessee State right in the heart of, of the desegregation issue, and it was something that I was interested in pursuing, participating in and the like, and so I, I can tell you that it fulfilled all--it fulfilled all of my aspirations (laughter), in regard to that because it was a--it was a significant and a really tortuous set of activities associated with, with desegregation.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I want to come back to this a little later, maybe in a little more depth, but this is a good beginning.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: How long did you serve as the president of Tennessee State University?
Speaker 1: Ten and a ha-, ten and a half years.
Speaker 2: And what was that period; it was from when to when (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was from nineteen--from January the 1st, 1975 to June 30th, 1985, I served as president of Tennessee State.
Story_ID: 379897
Speaker 1: I actually became President of Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] on June 1st, 1985--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and here I served for sixteen and a half years, all right.  I went from June 1st, 1985 to December 31st, 2001, which is sixteen and a half years, and so all told I served as presidents of both institutions twenty-seven years of, of administration.  After I left--after I stepped down as president of FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University], two things happened to me.  The National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education was interested in, in hiring me to become the president and CEO of NAFEO.  The National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education is a professional organization of black college presidents and it includes all of them, the private institutions and the public institution, two-year and four-year so, and some schools that are not--do not meet the requirements for be call--for being called a historical black college or university [HBCU], but fall under the category of predominantly black colleges.  So, we had a few members who were predominantly black colleges, schools like Medgar Evers [Medgar Evers College, Brooklyn, New York] and Sojourner-Douglass [Sojourner-Douglass College] located in Baltimore [Maryland] and urban schools.  Coppin State [Coppin State University, Baltimore, Maryland] out in Los Angeles [California], two-year institution.  So there were a few of those but all told, we counted as our membership about a hundred and fifteen to a hundred seventeen institutions of higher education.  And I, I spent almost three years serving as the president and chief executive officer of NAFEO, which was largely a lobbying and a programmatic--at the time that I started with NAFEO--was a programmatic institution and a, a sort of an advocacy group for black colleges, and I did that and, and when I stepped down as president of Florida A&M University, the board of regents--they gave me a, a contract to serve for five years as a regent professor, to have my office at the College of Law [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University College of Law, Orlando, Florida], and compensate me at the level of what I got compensated as president of the university, so I considered that a fairly good reward for the years of service that I had granted to--given to Florida A&M, and that is what I am doing now.  I'm serving as a regent professor.  I requested to be--to have my office at the College of Law, and to do the things that I'm doing now.  So, I am now in the third year of that contract and I--when I finish serving that out, I'm fairly certain that I will be through--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --working (laughter).
Story_ID: 379898
Speaker 1: Well you have a--you run a long ways around the track and, and all of these positions that you've had, you have confronted and faced some major challenges.  I mean, even the ISE [Institute for Services to Education] program of increasing the retention of black students in the HBCs [historically black colleges and universities]--that was a challenge. The Tennessee State University [Nashville, Tennessee] situation was another challenge.  Even coming to a FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] was a challenge, so we're going to talk more about these challenges because you've been a pioneer and you've been a, a creator of, of extraordinary strategies to deal with these problems.  So we'll come back to some of this depth, but thank you for the, the overview of your career.  The HistoryMaker interviews also begin by looking at your roots, looking at your family history but before we do that, we have a few warm-up questions.  So, I want to do the warm-up questions because it gives us a chance to further relax, and also to get to know you better and give another slant on your personality.  So, I want to ask you, Dr. Humphries [HistoryMaker Frederick Humphries], what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I like seafood.  I grew up in Apalachicola [Florida], all right.  So, almost--when I was growing up, almost everybody would give you some mullets, right.  Well, I didn't like mullets that much.  I like brim and, and I like trout and I like mackerel, charter fish.  I mean, stuff that was not so common, all right.  So, but most of all, I like oysters and shrimp, particularly fried shrimp.  When I was growing up, I suppose I've had oysters every which way.  Almost any way that you can prepare oysters, I've had it because when I was growing up, the oyster bars in, in our bay were just filled with oysters, and--I mean, you could just go out to the bar and, and get you some oysters and come and knock the shells off of 'em, right, and you'd have a--you could have oysters for a meal, right.  So, I grew up--I, I--the most commonplace seafood you got was, was fish.  Then next shrimp and then oysters, right.  So, I grew up liking seafood better than I've liked anything.  I mean, I certainly had my share of the--of pork and, and beef but when I could, I would eat seafood.  So my, my favorite food was, was seafood and, and the other thing that I like a great deal, I mean in terms of, of vegetables, right, I like lima beans and butterbeans.  People don't--I don't know where you can get butterbeans today, but we used to grow them ourselves--butterbeans, right, and I--it was a favorite dish of mine and I, I had a relative who when I was in college [at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] every time I came home, I'd have to go by and, and eat them butterbeans with her because she loved--she loved fixing them for me and she loved sitting down talking while we eat butterbeans and hot water cornbread, right.  So, I grew up with that and, and I really liked that.  The other--the other dish that I like in the vegetable line was okra and tomatoes, which again is something you have--you don't see too often.  They used to put okra and tomatoes in a can together, but I don't see that stuff anymore, but, but I had loved okra and tomatoes much more than having okra by itself.  I liked okra and tomatoes.
Speaker 1: Well, I can deal with the oysters.  I can deal with the butterbeans, but I can't deal with the okra (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So, two out of the three are in my sight, too (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, those are the kind of thing--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Then my favorite dessert was lemon icebox pie followed very closely--made with graham crackers--followed closely by pecan pie that my mother [Minnie Henry Humphries] would make.  Best pecan pies in the world.
Speaker 1: That's good.
Story_ID: 379899
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I like springtime.  I also like the fall.  Summer I, I think is a lazy time.  Winter is an inactive time because you get out but the, the seasons are, are great, and I like spring.  I like the freshness of the morning, and those two mornings kind of go true for the fall with the mist.  So, I like spring and fall (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What about a favorite color?  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I like--I probably like blue more than anything else.  I like tan, too, though.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: My, my favorite place of going is--I like water, right.  So, the vacations I've had have always taken me to water, to Acapulco [Mexico], San Francisco [California], Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], all right.  And then even in South Africa when I went to Africa, I always wanted to be on the coast.  And I definitely like Cape Town [South Africa] which--  So, I've liked places that have water for my time that I'm free and--.
Speaker 1: That's why I moved to Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Like water.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, the last warm-up question.  Dr. Humphries [HistoryMaker Frederick Humphries], do you have a favorite phrase or saying that you like to use from time to time with friends, colleagues, relatives?  Something that is kind of philosophical?
Speaker 2: Now, a favorite phrase (pause).  You all gonna have to edit this out (laughter). I don't want to tell you.  This is a recent favorite phrase, right?  If you are doing something and white people think it's right and black people think it's wrong, you're probably not doing the right thing, right.  That's my favorite kind of statement today.  So you'll have to edit that out, but I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I--most seriously, I, I--in most of the ad hoc talks I do, are prepared talks, right?  I believe that you win by working hard, and that's--that runs through pretty much everything I've done.  I don't think you can win looking at issues leisurely.  I think you win by committing yourself, and by yourself I mean both physically and mentally to the task and then you work at it.  And the second part of this has to do with you gotta make a start.  I mean, I've--in my lifetime, I've seen too many people not do anything because they talk themselves out of taking that first step, right.  So, I believe that the way you accomplish things is that you--first of all, you make that first step.  I mean, whatever it is, even if it's wrong, you make that first step, and then you, you work hard.  You commit yourself to it, and I think that's the way you get results.  That's the way you change things, and that's the way to have some of the things that you care about and value achieved.
Story_ID: 379900
Speaker 1: You mentioned that one of your favorite desserts, dishes is pecan pie?  Pecan pie made by your mother.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, we want to continue this interview by having you talk about your parents and I'd like you to start by talking about your mother.  Her name, when she was born, and where.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Minnie Henry Humphries.  She was born in Columbus, Georgia.
Speaker 1: And the year?
Speaker 2: In (pause), in, in 1908.
Speaker 1: And where did she grow up?  Did she grow up in--?
Speaker 2: No, she grew up in Apalachicola, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Would you spell that for me?
Speaker 2: A-P-A-L-A-C-H-I-C-O-L-A.  My mother grew up in Apalachicola, Florida.  She came to Apalachicola--at the time she was growing up in the South, these sugar boats and cotton boats came down the Chattahoochee River to the Apalachicola River and stopped in Apalachicola.  They would unload their cargo in Apalachicola, unload their sugar and unload the cotton that came from interior Alabama and interior Georgia.  My mother's relatives worked on these boats.  Her--the female members of the family worked as chambermaids on the boats, and the men worked as deckhands on the boat.  So my, my grandmother and my great-grandmother and their siblings came down that river and they got to Apalachicola and they liked Apalachicola.  So, my great-grandmother and my grandmother and their husbands obtained property and built a home.  Now this was before the turn of the century when they came down that--I mean, they were working up and down the river.
Speaker 1: What was you grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Fry, Lavenia Fry [ph.].
Speaker 1: And your great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: My great-grandmother's name was--I can't remember right now.  But my grandmother's name was Lavenia Fry and, but we all--my father [Thornton Humphries, Sr.] and my mother when they got married, they still lived in the house with my grandmother, so I grew up in, in a home where my grandmother was present and we lived with our grandmother which was her home.
Speaker 1: I see.  When did your mother leave Columbus for Florida?
Speaker 2: It was about--she was five years old.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: Five or six.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She had a brother, Fred, that's whom I'm named after, Fred Holoman [ph.], and he came and they all stayed there.  He died young.  He was thirty-some years old when he died so.  I didn't know him that well because by the time--he was older than my mother--and so by the time she had grown up and met my father and they got married and raised a family, all right, he, he had passed during that time.
Story_ID: 379901
Speaker 1: My father--my mother [Minnie Henry Humphries] came from Columbus [Georgia], my father came from Mobile, Alabama.
Speaker 2: And his name?
Speaker 1: His name is Thornton Govan Humphries, Sr. [Thornton Humphries, Sr.].
Speaker 2: Would you spell the first name?
Speaker 1: T-H-O-R-T-O-N.
Speaker 2: Thornton.
Speaker 1: Thornton, Govan.
Speaker 2: How do you spell that?
Speaker 1: G-O-V-A-N.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Humphries.
Speaker 2: And what year was he born and where?  Well, you told me he's from Mobile; what year was he born?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was born in 1898.  He, he was--he was approximately ten years older than my mother, and when he came--my father came from a pretty good size family in Mobile and he left home.  His mother, Mama Lottie [Lottie Humphries], my grandmother, all of his siblings kind of stayed around Mobile, but my father left because he's kind of a rebel in his thinking and he left Mobile following a guy who owned a--a white man--who owned a lumber mill, and he was re-establishing that lumber mill in Apalachicola [Florida] on the river, right.  So you put the pine logs down the river and take them up there and make planks and lumber and stuff out of it, right.  So, he and, and his friend whom they remained friends for life, the Osmond [ph.] family, and my father, they all came to Apalachicola from Mobile, Alabama, and--
Speaker 2: What do you know about his parents, your paternal grandparents?
Speaker 1: Oh, I, I mean, I went to--.  We were not--we were not very close.  I know more about my mother's people because all those people came to Apalachicola, and so I grew up with everyday speaking with somebody or relating to somebody on my mother's side.  I only got to know my father's people later on in life.  When I was small, my father carried me to Mobile one time and that's where I met, for the first time, my relatives.
Story_ID: 379902
Speaker 1: Well, my dad [Thornton Humphries, Sr.] came to Apalachicola [Florida], he met my mother [Minnie Henry Humphries], they got married and they had five children.
Speaker 2: Where did he meet her?
Speaker 1: In Apalachicola.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  And now, we were pretty much estranged from the family.  My father, like many African American men who were talented and no real outlet for their talent, they called my dad Collie Humphrey, and he was recognized as being a very bright man, right, but no outlet for him.  He brought in the South, in Apalachicola, Florida, a small town.  So he drank a lot and he had, had some buddies who--my father was interesting and I would've said, exceptional.  He would drink all weekend, never during the week.  He, he'd come home Sunday afternoon, he'd be high, we'd put him to bed, and he'd wake up four o'clock Monday morning, and my mother would have hot biscuits and coffee and grits and bacon and, and eggs ready for him Monday morning.  And he went to work, and he worked all week.  Never touched a drop of liquor.  But came Friday--Friday evening, he would have a drink and then Saturday and Sunday.  But he never drank during the week and he never failed in his responsibility to pro-, to provide for us and to provide for my mother.  He had a little entrepreneurial spirit, so one of the things that all of us did when we were small, my father worked for a fishing--a fishing house in Apalachicola, a company that had boats that would go out and get mullets in the Apalachicola Bay and then bring them in, and then they would salt them down.  And so my father moonlighted a bit from working at the mill.  He'd go down and, and work at this fish place and he would engage in, in salting mullets for shipment to places.  But he would secure mullets that he would sell to our community, so we would have regular customers and we would all have to deliver, wrap the mullets up in, in paper, and then deliver those mullets--order of mullets to different families in the community.
Story_ID: 379903
Speaker 1: Now does the we refer to siblings?  Did you--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My, my sisters, my brother.  We all did it, right.  The only one who didn't do this was my younger sister, Barbara [Barbara Humphries], who is four and half years younger than I am.  I was the fourth child of the five.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about each sibling and then the oldest to the--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Thornton [Thornton Humphries, Jr.], Thornton is the oldest.  He was born first.
Speaker 1: What year was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in 1930--in 1930.  He's four and half years older than I am.
Speaker 1: You were the second?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: My sister, Mona [Mona Humphries Bailey]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was the second, and then my sister, Mamie [Mamie Humphries], was the third, and then I was the fourth and Barbara, born four and half years later, was the fifth child.  All of us, with the exception of Barbara, are approximately eighteen months apart, give or take a few.  My first sister is approximately eighteen months younger than my brother.  My second sister is approximately eighteen months younger than my first sister, and I'm approximately eighteen months younger than my second sister.  It was--we're all--.  Thornton is born in July.  Mona is born in December, a year and a half away.  Mamie is born in June, approximately a year and a half away, and I'm born in December, a year and a half away, and my sister is four and a half years younger.  She's born in September, 1940.  So, it was almost eighteen months apart in all of them, right.
Story_ID: 379904
Speaker 1: I want to come back and ask you what you and your siblings did with each other, but let me go back to your mother [Minnie Henry Humphries] if I can for just a minute.  Did she share with you her childhood memories and things that happened to her as a child?  Did she--do you remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: -- stories, stories that she told you?
Speaker 2: Yeah--well, well my mother was--well, let me try to assemble that for you.  I, I used to spend a lot of time with the elder folks, relatives and the like 'cause I wanted to know things.  So, I told you about the person who used to--every time I came home from college [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] would do the butterbeans and hot water cornbread.  We call her Aunt Willa [ph.].
Speaker 1: Aunt Willa?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And she was sort of like the historian of the family.  So she had the family--she had a Bible and she had dates and stuff all when things happen.  But I would go and, and we would eat and she would tell me things about the family.  Some tell me who I was and, and how we--how, how things happen, right.  So, my mother--I had these things which I don't have today, I have a portion of them, but my mother had three diplomas, right.  She, she finished the sixth grade in Apalachicola [Florida].  Then she went to--came up here, Tallahassee [Florida], to the ninth grade which she has a, a graduation certificate for, and then she went to the normal school [Senior High School Department, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University] here in Tallahassee, right.  So she has a normal school diploma, right.  And so she has three which show you if you trace those certificates and diplomas, you would trace the--what education was available for black people.  In my home town, you could only go--if you were black, you could only go to the sixth grade and that's--that was it, right.  And then if you--if you were fortunate enough your, your family could you send you up here to get ninth grade, and then if you're still fortunate enough, you get normal school you got by.  Apalachicola when my mother was growing up did not have a bus service, so the way she went to--the way she went beyond Apalachicola was the way they got to Apalachicola, they caught the boat coming down that river.  So, my mother used to get on the boat to come up here.  She'd get up on the boat in Apalachicola and then go up the river and get off at in Liberty County [Florida], which is down here by Hosford [Florida] which is maybe twenty miles away.  And then they would pick her up and bring her by horse and buggy to Tallahassee where she finished off her education, right.  My mother was athletic, so one of the things as I was growing up I remember she showed me her, her outfits that she weighed--that she wore to, to take physical education and the like, right.  She--they were a very close-knit family on her side, right.  So, we were always getting together on, on my mother's side with her family, right.
Story_ID: 379905
Speaker 1: My mother [Minnie Henry Humphries] was, was hardworking and I, I--my father [Thornton Humphries, Sr.] died when I was about eight years old, okay.  He died in 1943 and my mother took him to, to Mobile [Alabama] to the hospital there because we didn't have any hospitals to speak of in Apalachicola [Florida], so to get the care that he needed, she had to take him to Mobile where he was put in the hospital and he expired there in the hospital in Mobile.  All right.  So, she brought him home and we buried him in Apalachicola, right.  When my father died, my mother became the leading force in our lives.  Now, let me try to explain that what I mean here.  When my father was alive, he'd partial out the chores, like I told you we all had this mullet route--
Speaker 2: Special distribution.
Speaker 1: We had to go, right.  He was the disciplinarian, right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: We didn't go out.  We're all Catholics, right.  My mother was a Methodist.  My father was a Catholic.  His family in Mobile were all Catholics.  So, my mother maintained the vows which said that you promised to raise the kids Catholics.  So like when we didn't go to church, all right, she wouldn't do anything to you, but my father would, right.  So he was a disciplinarian and though like he'd give out not only doing the mullets and stuff, but like he would tell me that, "You know, I want this backyard cleaned up.  I want all the leaves ranked and I want them burned, and I want this place sparkling."  Well, if he came home and that wasn't done, right.  So he was the person setting the tone on how well you did things or what you did.  He was in charge of all that.  Now once my father died, then a vision for us became the vision of my mother, okay.
Story_ID: 379906
Speaker 1: Now, my mother [Minnie Henry Humphries] and her family fundamentally had been more involved in education than my father [Thornton Humphries, Sr.] and his side of the family.  So Aunt Willa [ph.], whom I told you was the historian, she had gone to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] to study music and she was a teacher of piano, right, and we had other people in the family who had gone off to, to school, all right.   So, the fact that my mother got those three diplomas was a manifestation of how my grandmother [Lavenia Fry (ph.)] viewed and her husband viewed getting an education, right.  So, when my father died, my mother took over it and became her vision, and so all of us became much more attuned to doing the things that would further us in getting an education because I would say in Apalachicola [Florida] on the street that I was born on and lived on is that whole street was dedicated to--the whole street was dedicated to education.  Almost everybody that lived on that street was aiming their children toward education, finishing school, and going to college, right.  Almost all of them.  So, even though my father had died and my mother became a domestic, she worked for the guy who was the president of the Apalachicola State Bank [Apalachicola, Florida].  She worked in their home and I worked for them.  I did yard work and polished silver, waxed floors.  I grew up doing that and working with my mother in this--.
Speaker 2: She didn't teach then?  Did your mother ever teach?  Did she--your mother ever--?
Speaker 1: Nah, nah.  She didn't teach.
Speaker 2: She never taught.
Speaker 1: She stayed at domestic the whole time.  But she wouldn't take--my mother would not take aid to the dependent of people.  She'd never took welfare.  We never took welfare.  All of us.  I mean, we earned our way.  I mean, my mother worked hard, she set the style for the family, and then all of us worked.  My brother [Thornton Humphries, Jr.] got a job while he was in high school working on the back of a garbage truck going out before school started and then coming back and going to school.  My sister delivered papers.  I delivered papers.  Mamie [Mamie Humphries] delivered papers.  Barbara [Barbara Humphries] was the only one 'cause she was the baby, right.  But we all had jobs.  I used to cut lawns--go and cut lawns and I worked the wharf, the docks.  I took the heads off of shrimp.  I gutted the roe out of mullets.  I did all those things, we all did.  In the evening after school, on the weekend.  Saturday we'd go down and work, but all of us had chores that when we made some money, and like I brought my money home and I gave it to my mother, so did my brother.  And so, as we were progressing, we had our own home because my grandmother died right after my father died.  So then it was just my mother and the five of us, right.  And so we had our home, it was paid for, and so we had to, to just get clothes and get food and, and do things.
Story_ID: 379907
Speaker 1: As we got older, my sister Mona [Mona Humphries Bailey] went to St. Mary's Academy in New Orleans [Louisiana] with the nuns of the Holy Family [Sisters of the Holy Family], right.  She's very smart.  Mona was a very bright young lady, so my mother [Minnie Henry Humphries] wanted her to have that experience of going over there and she went to St. Mary.  Met some wonderful people who remains her friends through, through life.  She, however, finished the public school at Apalachicola [Wallace M. Quinn High School, Apalachicola, Florida].  My brother [Thornton Humphries, Jr.] finished the public school.  He was a good basketball player but at the time that he finished--and you should remember this time in America wherein if you go to the [U.S.] military, you can get making an allotment out to your family.  So my brother went to the [U.S.] Air Force, made an allotment out which helped to pay for my sister's college education here at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  Mona and--was a chemistry major here and she came and finished, and my brother helped her.  He was in the military and then when he got out, my brother played--he was an Air Force policeman.  So he played ball in the military and when he was overseas, he went to--he was stationed in London [England].  He played ball for the Air Force team and was quite good.  So when he got out, he stayed in Seattle [Washington]--he got out in Fort Lewis, Washington [Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington].  We had people from Apalachicola [Florida] living in Seattle who were close to our family.  So he stayed out there, got a job, start playing ball in this AA ball, set all kind of records and wound up getting a, a scholarship to play ball at University--Seattle University [Seattle, Wash.] playing with Elden Bell [ph.].  So they were on the same team.  He came back and married my English high school teacher, and took her out there to Seattle where she was--she taught and he finished his education.  He got a degree in mathematics and they both came back to Florida.
Story_ID: 379908
Speaker 1: Well, when I went to college--when I finished high school [Wallace M. Quinn High School, Apalachicola, Florida], I went to FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], too.  I went on a quarter basketball scholarship, (pause) and I had saved enough money working to pay for the first year.  Mona [Mona Humphries Bailey] was a senior--my sister was a senior and Miss FAMU, and I was a freshman, and both of us chemistry majors.  She finished and she went to work teaching, and she used to help me go through college.  Now, I came along at a time when there was no scholarships and no federal financial aid, so you had--going to college was you had to--school had some money.  You know, you can get some work study money which I, I did.  I got some cleaning the labs.  I got some work study money.  But despite the fact that I was the number one student in my freshman class, I didn't get a scholarship, so.  (Laughter) I mean, still had to, to, to hustle and get money, but I mean there was so much that you didn't know during those times in terms of resources availability.  I learned--you know, Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] had this program for talented high school students and it come along and pick you up before you finished high school and bring you up to Morehouse, and then you complete your--you get a college education, and I've met so many people who went through that program during my time and I always wondered, why didn't I know about that, (laughter) so that I could--'cause they paid for your education, right.  Well, I, I didn't know about it and the people who, who influenced me and who taught me didn't know about it, and so I didn't--I didn't get a chance to avail that.  My principal got me the quarter basketball scholarship, all right, and which was a--which was the deciding point for me to come to FAMU 'cause without that quarter scholarship, I wasn't coming, right.
Story_ID: 379909
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your early childhood, formal education up through middle and high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What was that process like for you?  What were some of the turning points?
Speaker 2: Well, we had in--in our hometown, we had a, a Catholic school [Holy Family School, Apalachicola, Florida] taught by the nuns of the Holy Family [Sisters of the Holy Family] that went from kindergarten to ninth grade.  So my early education--first grade through ninth grade--was, was done there.  Then I transferred because there wasn't--your choice, if you wanted to continue to have a Catholic education, you would have to go to--either I would have to go to Mobile [Alabama] or to New Orleans [Louisiana] where they had a Catholic high school.  So, my choice, since I couldn't do that, by now my father's [Thornton Humphries, Sr.] dead, I went to the public high school, Wallace M. Quinn High School in Apalachicola, Florida.
Speaker 1: What was the name again?
Speaker 2: Wallace M. Quinn High School, which was where I did the tenth and eleventh and twelfth grade in high school.  Now, we had four classrooms over nine grades so every class that you had was a multi-grade class.  So like fourth, fifth and sixth were in the same classroom.  Seventh, eighth and ninth was in the same classroom, right.  So, the, the teachers were phenomenal, right.  I mean, they would teach the fourth grade and then teach the fifth grade and teach all in the same day and, and would, would manage to handle that, right.  Well, when I got to the seventh grade was when I met Sister Clara Marie [ph.] whom I thought was, was fantastic.  She was a, a brilliant lady, a mean nun, and somehow had decided that I was gonna be the object of her affection through seventh, eighth and ninth grade.  So, Sister Clara Marie taught me and taught me everything that she could teach me in seventh, eighth and ninth grade.  But then she'd disciplined me.  She'd make me do those halls with oil, rake the yard of the convent, pick all the damn plums (laughter) that were on the plum tree.  She made sure that I had a, a respect for authority, all right.  I mean 'cause I--.  Very early on, I questioned things and that used to get me in trouble all the time.  I mean, when I was in the seventh, eighth and ninth grade, I would question and the answer was always that, "Well, it's in the book."  Well, I said, "I don't care about what's in the book.  It doesn't make sense."  Right.  So, she helped me a lot with that in terms of coming to grips with legitimate sources of authority.  Handling your questions to find answers in an appropriate way and not going off half-cocked about information that you may think is wrong, but not having considered the full view of things regarding that, right.  And, so she was the one, along with my mother [Minnie Henry Humphries], that put the notion of going to college for me in my mind.  So when I went to high school, going to college was an issue for me and I wanted to play ball, too, so I got to play ball in high school, but not necessarily at the first through the ninth grade level.
Story_ID: 379910
Speaker 1: Grades one through nine at the Catholic school [Holy Family School, Apalachicola, Florida], was that mixed racially or not?
Speaker 2: No.  It was segregated.
Speaker 1: It was segregated?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: They had a--they had a Catholic white school, too.  A Catholic black school, a Catholic white school.  You could go to church.  We--our church was a part of the school, all right.  The white--the white community had a Catholic school at a separate St. Patrick's Church [Apalachicola, Florida], but Apalachicola [Florida] was not harsh in, in racial activities.  It was not a harsh place.  I'd never experienced drinking water from a fountain that was--water was hot in Apalachicola.  If I drink water from a fountain and it was hot for black folks, it was hot for white folks.  If white folks had cool water, black folks had cool water.  I mean, it was not harsh.  I went to Mississippi and the fountain for white folks had cold water and hot water for, for black people.  Apalachicola was not a community like that.  I mean, you could go downtown and go into the drugstore and get your stuff and all of that and there was not a demeaning enterprise, right.  Yet, it was--you had segregation, but I would say Apalachicola had a, a soft segregation.  For instance, if I missed Mass at our church, I could go to St. Patrick's and go to Mass, and I could even serve as an altar boy at St. Patrick's as I would do at the Mass up there.  So, it--the segregation of Apalachicola and the attitudes and I think it had a lot to do with the white people in Apalachicola were mainly Greeks, Italians mostly and they were from the sea, right.  All right, so they were Mediterranean white people, so--and they had color, right.  So, it was--it was interesting.  It was a soft--I rem-, I remember distinctly in 1968 when, when they had the race between Hubert Humphrey and Richard Nixon [Richard Milhous Nixon], the only county up in the Panhandle that voted for Hubert Humphrey was Apalachicola, Franklin County [Florida].  All the rest of them, it was a blue--it was a blue county.  All the rest of them were red, right.  So, different kind of mix there, right.  So, but we went through the rituals of being a Catholic and having certain kinds of requirements put on you, and, and, and so when I went to the--as well as all the other kids who left that Catholic school, there was a discipline enforced on them.  And there was an appreciation for learning and we turned out to--but, but it made the public school better, too, because the competition for the kids that came from the Catholic school and the kids who came straight through the public schools, they had to be equal.  So, you had the nuns teaching over here then you had people from Apalachicola teaching at the other schools, and they weren't about to let the kind of education you received at the Catholic school outdo the one that was getting in the public school.  So, we had very competitive matches at the tenth grade or the ninth grade because one time it was just the eighth grade that the Catholic school went to.  And so, that influenced your performance and your ability to work hard because you, you, you had both on both sides--the nuns plus the lay faculty at the public schools would--they were tough, and we got a good--we got a good education in there.

Speaker 1: Two people when I got to high school [Wallace M. Quinn High School, Apalachicola, Florida], Charlie Watson [Charles Watson] was my science teacher.
Speaker 2: Washington?
Speaker 1: Watson.
Speaker 2: Watson.
Speaker 1: Charlie Watson, graduate of FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  He was an agricultural major.  He taught science because if you got a B.S. degree in agriculture, you had to take physics and chemistry and math courses here at FAMU.  You couldn't find a, a math teacher or a chemistry teacher to come to Apalachicola [Florida].  It was a small town, not much to recommending it for a social outlet.  Charlie was an Apalachicolian, he was born there, and he cared deeply about Apalachicola.  So, he taught all of it.  He taught math, he taught chemistry, he taught physics, he taught biology.  He was the science man, and Charlie Watson did something phenomenal.  When he would recognize that you had some special talent, he would keep you after school and work with you to develop that special talent.  So in my class, there were two of us.  Two students that he picked and said, "I want you to stay and I'm gonna work with you," and we did.  We worked with math, we worked with the sciences, and he taught, taught us far beyond what happened in the daily classes, okay.  So Charlie Watson was heavy into my life, right.  And so when I got to be a senior, he told both of us that we ought to go to college and that he would help because by now, I had met a young girl I dated.  Met a young girl.  I liked her.  And the typical thing in Apalachicola what people did was they either finished or dropped out of high school and then they went to the [U.S.] military, then they would marry the girl they were going with.  And here I was, my brother [Thornton Humphries, Jr.] had gone to the [U.S.] Air Force and here I was thinking about doing the same thing--finishing, volunteer for the Air Force, come back and get my girlfriend and we'd march off into the sunset with a military career.  Well, Charlie Watson said, "You can't do that.  You got too much happening with you that you need to go to college," and course my mother [Minnie Henry Humphries] was, was preaching that all the time that you, you gotta get out of Apalachicola and you gotta go to college.  And so I started preparing myself to, to go to college and not only did Charlie help me, but the principal helped me, too.  And they played a force in my life in terms--.  Now, I majored in chemistry because I blew up the lab in high school.  I, I put sodium with water and had an explosion in the laboratory, and so I said, "I'm gonna master this thing that damn near killed me!"  And so I majored in chemistry (laughter) to try to--to try to do that, right.  So that's--and, and that was the thing that smart people did.  You either majored in math or you majored in chemistry and didn't know nothing about physics or even pre-med for that--for that matter, right.  I--it was chemistry or mathematics.
Story_ID: 379912
Speaker 1: Many years later (clears throat), as you said earlier, you came back as the president of FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], but what was FAMU like when you were there for the four years?  What was college like at that time for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, college was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  What was the place like, I guess.
Speaker 2: No, FAMU was exciting.  I mean, everybody in my freshman class was either a val [valedictorian] or a sal [salutatorian] or an honor student.  I mean, it was an amazing place.  I mean--
Speaker 1: This is about 1953 roughly when you entered on sight?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  When I went--we lived in the barracks.  I mean, FAMU didn't have all the dormitories that they have now, and so we--they had army barracks with a central showering facility.  Well, I lived down in the army barracks, but in the barrack that I was in when I was meeting the people, everywhere I went--I mean, every door that I knocked on to meet somebody, the person that lived--there was two of us to a room.  Everybody that was in the room was either a val or a sal.  And if they were not a val or a sal, they were honor students and they came from Roosevelt High School in West Palm Beach [Florida], Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington High School] in Miami [Florida], Millington High School [Millington Central High School] in, in Tampa [Florida], Gibbs High School in St. Petersburg [Florida], Stanton [New Stanton Senior High School; Stanton College Preparatory School] and Matthew Russell [ph.] in Jacksonville [Florida], Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington High School] out of Pensacola [Florida], Rosenwald High School in, in Panama City [Florida].  And the people who were in those classes, right, they were always the top students.  So everybody you met was, was a top student in their high school graduating class.  It's almost like the whole freshman class was filled with nothing but honor students and the like, and they were smart.  There were--to show you this, Robert [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden], it's, it's, it's a--twenty-five students in my freshman class majored in chemistry.  Twenty-five, right, and all of the top students in their--from their high school.  When I came back here on the faculty, it was hard to get five chemistry majors, but back in 1953 there were twenty-five students who started in my freshman class as chemistry majors.  Then I remember that (laughter) our teacher, Julia Martin [ph.], came to class and told us, "Say look, there's no curve.  Ninety to a hundred is an A.  Eighty to ninety is a B, seventy to eighty is a C, sixty to seventy is a D, and all below that is an F," right.  And she said, "I don't curve grades."  You have to make the score that is related to that, right.  So, that's how we started chemistry.  That's how we started FAMU. I mean, and people study it.  I mean, it wasn't anything to find the lights burning early in the morning with kids studying.  I mean, it was competitive here at the university and people, people were smart.  We had--I, I mean, Carl Curtsey [ph.] who was a member of our freshman class had played with the Jacksonville Symphony.  He had won oratorical contests and he marched in the band, was a chemistry major, a top student from--he was the talk of the state when he came to school here.  Well, McDonald, McDonald--I think McDonald [ph.] was his last name.  I was going to say William, I'm not sure about that.  But McDonald won the oratorical contest of the State of Florida and he could speak.  When he stood up--you talk about Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], McDonald was just as eloquent (laughter) as Obama, right.  I mean, he could talk, right. I mean, he could speak and he used to speak regularly and, at the things that we did and it was--it was a good time.  FAMU was, was a, a good place to be, and we had good school spirit, and we had a good paying attention to academics here at the university.
Story_ID: 379913
Speaker 1: Did you participate in athletics while you were here [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I, I played ball.  I only played two years though because I came from a very small school [Wallace M. Quinn High School, Apalachicola, Florida].  My high school graduating class had nine students, just nine in the class.  When I got here, Booker T. [Booker T. Washington High School] had 250.  They came from much larger schools and the competition was a whole lot of choice.  It wasn't much choice in Apalachicola [Florida] for youth who played basketball, right.  But I, I, I went out for the team and I played.  And I thought I had--I comported myself pretty well against much stronger competition from larger cities, but at the end of my sophomore year they did not renew my scholarship so, I didn't play anymore and I focused on my--I went into the Army ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] and that replaced athletics 'cause I went into the Army ROTC and continued my academic pursuits.
Story_ID: 379914
Speaker 1: So you graduated from here with a B.S. degree in chemistry.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And that was what, 19?  What year was--
Speaker 2: Fifty-seven [1957].
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven [1957].  What came next in your life?
Speaker 2: Well, what came next was the, the following thing.  When I was finishing, I thought I wanted to go to graduate school.  I mean, when I was a little boy in Apalachicola, Florida, I was--I told you we did all these odd things to earn money, and so I was assisting a carpenter and doing the ceiling of a doctor's home in Apalachicola, and the guy was a black carpenter and he was up on a ladder, and I was handing him turning groove planks, right, to do the ceiling.  And he looked down at me and he says, "Boy, what do you want to be?"  I said, "I wanna go to college."  He says, "Well, if you go to college, what kind of degree you want?"  I said, "I wanna get a, a baccalaureate degree."  He said "Nah, if you go to college, man, you want to get the highest degree."  And I said, "Well what is that?"  And he said, "That's a Ph.D.  So if you go to college, you want to get the highest degree."  And I said, "Well, that's what I want."  So it was that day that getting a Ph.D. became my ambition from this carpenter.  I didn't know a thing about a Ph.D. degree but when he told me that's the highest degree that you can get I, said, "Well that's what I want."  So that became my MO [modus operandi].  So when I--when I got through, the whole time I was in college, I was preparing myself to go to graduate school to get a Ph.D., not to teach, but to get a Ph.D.  So, I took all the math, chemistry and physics courses FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] offered, and I was preparing myself to go to college.  So when I got to be a senior, the head of the department of chemistry said to me, "What do you want to do?" and I told him, "I want to get a Ph.D.," and he said, "Well, what, what, what kind of chemistry do you want to get your Ph.D. in?"  And I said, "I want to get a Ph.D. in physical chemistry," because I, I'd, I'd liked the quantitative aspects of physical chemistry, so that's what I had decided from all of the courses that I took there, analytically, inorganic and organic that I wanted to major in physical chemistry.  So he said, "Well, if you want to get a degree in physical chemistry, then you've got to go one of these three places," which was Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], Cal Berkley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkley, California].
Story_ID: 379915
Speaker 1: Now when I finished [at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], I had an obligation to the [U.S.] military, right.  So, I was in the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  So, I had to go in and that's what I did next.  I went to--when I finished college, I went in.  I had my orders to report to duty at Fort Devens, Massachusetts, September the 3rd, 1957, which I did.  And I went in and spent my six months at Fort Devens, became a, a radio intercept officer, trained there, and then I went to Europe where I spent eighteen months doing what they had trained me to do at Fort Devens.  And while I was there, I applied to three graduate schools.  I applied to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I applied to Pitt [University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and I applied to Cal Berkley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkley, California].  Now, I was so afraid of Harvard that when I wrote to Harvard University graduate school, I told them that I did not want--I wanted a fellowship.  I did not want an assistantship, that I felt if I were going to make it at Harvard, I had to have--I didn't need to work.  I needed to be free and unencumbered, and so that I wanted them to give me a fellowship, not an assistantship.  Well, they thanked me (laughter) for my interest and told me that only a few people got fellowships and they weren't able to accommodate my wish, so they didn't accept me.  I wrote Pitt and I wrote Cal Berkley for an assistantship.  So, I got admitted to both places, got an assistantship to both places, but I got my assistantship from--response first from Pitt, and I was faced with the proposition when, when I got the response back from Pitt, it came at a time where the [U.S.] Army--I mean, the Army had said to me I either have to tell them I was going stay, or I was getting out, all right.  So when I got the assistantship from--'cause I mean, I--if I hadn't got accepted to go to graduate school, I wasn't leaving Europe, right.  I was having a great time in Europe.  And so I was gonna stay there except to go--I wasn't coming back to America to work except that I was gonna--the only thing I was coming back for was to go to graduate school, otherwise I would've stayed another year in Europe.  So when Pitt's letter came, I accepted it and told the Army I was going home.  Well once I accepted the, the offer from Pitt, I felt not right to--when California's offer came which was three weeks later, that I should undo my, my response to Pitt to go to Cal Berkley.  Now I have to tell you, Robert [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden], if I had been up on, on the institutions, I probably would've undone my commitment to Pitt.  I'd probably gone to Cal Berkeley to get my doctorate, but I didn't know, so they were just two schools, one in California and one in Pittsburgh, to me at the time.  And so I stuck with my decision to go to Pitt.
Story_ID: 379916
Speaker 1: Well, it worked out fine because I met my wife, had my first two children.
Speaker 2: What was her name?
Speaker 1: Antoinette [Antoinette McTurner Humphries].
Speaker 2: Antoinette?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  I met her--
Speaker 2: Was she a student at Pitt [University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] or--?
Speaker 1: No.  She was going to Central State [Central State College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] when I met her--to school and I met her.
Speaker 2: But how'd you come to meet her?  You were at Pitt and she's at Central State? I--
Speaker 1: No, no.  I, I lived in the--she was in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: She was going to Central State to go to--to get her degree like I was from Apalachicola [Florida] going to FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], and I met her.  How I met her?  We lived next door to each other.  I got a--there's so many things I want to tell you about--I mean, like when I went to Pitt (pause), I went to get some help on where I should live.  When I went to the office they told me--they didn't tell me where to live, they just told me that there is a, a box back there in this room and they have all of the places that are available to the University of Pittsburgh students and why don't I go back there and look through there and see where I would like to stay.  Well when I went back and I looked at the box, they were separated.  They had places for Pitt students to stay and then they had for coloreds in the back.  So, it's your choice.  Pitt did not tell you where you could go, but they made it available that if you wanted to live in a black neighborhood you could, or you could go into an integrated neighborhood.  But everybody in that box had agreed that they would take students, and they didn't specify black students over white students, right.  So, I went to look at places in the black neighborhood, and the one I liked was the lady's home was right next door to my wife's home.
Story_ID: 379917
Speaker 1: Dr. Humphries [HistoryMaker Frederick Humphries], you came away from the University of Pittsburgh at Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] with, with two things and you were talking about how you met your wife [Antoinette McTurner Humphries] and also got your Ph.D.  So let's talk about your wife first, meeting her and how that resulted in your marriage and when you got married.
Speaker 2: Well, I came away with two things, my wife and my Ph.D.  When I--I was very serious, I wanted to get on with my life.  I wanted to make a contribution.  I wanted a Ph.D. because I didn't want to apologize.  So many of the faculty in black colleges [HBCUs]--I had planned on working in a black college so, so many of the faculty did not have that terminal degree, all right.  So, I wanted to add whatever talent that I had to working it in a way that it would improve a black college.  So, it was necessary to get the Ph.D.  So when I went there, I wasn't under any illusion about--not sure about what I wanted to do or did I want to go away off and, you know.  I simply wanted to get a Ph.D. and then return and teach.  Then the second thing when I went to Pitt--when I went to Pittsburgh was that I did not wanna be distracted by--I was prepared for marriage 'cause I wanted to meet a young lady and I had some criteria which I'm not gonna tell you what they were, but I had some criteria about the kind of person I wanted to get married to.  And when I met my wife, she fulfilled all of those criteria that I had.  So, I wanted to be swift.  I didn't want to have a prolonged--I didn't want to have to spend a long time getting a Ph.D. and nor did I want to have a long-time relationship precede to marriage.  I wanted to get on with my life, and my wife met the criteria that I had set in my mind that I wanted to have in a person that was gonna be with me for the rest of my life, and she had that.  And lucky enough for me, she felt about me the way I felt about her.  So we got married and then we started having a family.
Speaker 1: What year were you married?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What year were you married?
Speaker 2: I was married in 1960.
Story_ID: 379918
Speaker 1: I went to Pitt [University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] in 1959.  I got married in 1960, and we had our first child in 1961.  Second child almost the way we--my parents [Minnie Henry Humphries and Thornton Humphries, Sr.] had us.  Eighteen months later, I had my second child.  And then a long period before we had our third child which was born in Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Would you give me their names and, and where they are today, what they're doing.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  My son, the first one--the first born, works for Microsoft [Microsoft Corporation].  He's a lawyer.  He went to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and from Morehouse he went to Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.] to get a law degree, and he is now employed at Microsoft in Seattle [Washington].  My daughter Robin [Robin Humphries Watson] is a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  His name?
Speaker 1: His name is Fred Humphries, Jr. [Frederick Humphries, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I named him after me.
Speaker 2: That's important.
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).  So, my second child, who is my daughter, Robin Tanya, she's married.  They have two kids, and she's the one who has the son at Andover.  She's a--she was a chemistry major.  She went to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] and Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] to get her degree.  She's a housewife and she lives in Orlando [Florida].  And my younger son [Laurence Humphries], who came eight and a half years later, is an M.B.A.  He went to Morehouse, got his M.B.A. from Clark Atlanta [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], and he works for Chevron [Chevron Corporation] in Houston, Texas.
Speaker 2: Great accomplishments.
Story_ID: 379919
Speaker 1: My wife [Antoinette McTurner Humphries] just died.  We were married some forty-six years.  She died March 15.  I took her home to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and buried her this year, but she stayed devoted to me, and the life that we chose which was to come back to a black college [HBCU] to make a difference, and I started out by teaching chemistry here, when I finished Pitt [University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] in 1964 and we came as a team here.  I taught for three years here.  I took a leave of absence, went to the University of Minnesota [University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota].  That's when I was pursuing the research part of my life when I was chasing--
Speaker 2: I remember you'd mentioned that.
Speaker 1: --energy transformation.  And the reason I went to Minnesota was because one of the world's foremost chemists in my field was, was, was there and he had invited me to come for a year, so I got a chance to work with him his last year of active research work.
Speaker 2: His name?
Speaker 1: Robert Livingston.
Speaker 2: Robert Livingston.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He is one of the world's outstanding photo-chemists.  So, I got a chance to work with him in much elaborated laboratories.  I mean, they had stuff at Minnesota that very few schools, in terms of equipment, that could do things and measure things than any university in America.  Minnesota was the--had the fourteenth best chemistry department in the world.  And so I got a chance to work there, and I went and I spent it with him.  And I taught there, and then I came back to FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] to participate in the Thirteen College Curriculum Program and that ended when I got back.  That ended my pursuit of doing basic research in chemistry and the beginning of, of my efforts to improve the quality of teaching and improve the retention of African American students in science and learning something about how you get black kids to go into science and mathematics and engineering.
Story_ID: 379920
Speaker 1: Which was the beginning of, of my work in doing that after I came back from Minnesota [University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota] and I was put in charge of the Thirteen College Curriculum Program here at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], and then the next year put in charge of the whole national program at EDC up in Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: What's EDC?
Speaker 1: Educational Development Corporation [sic. Educational Development Center].  I mean, Curriculum Resources Group was housed at EDC. The Curriculum Resources Group of the Institute for Services to Education [ISE] was housed there.  So, I went there to, to provide leadership for that group which we later combined in, in Washington [D.C.] and combined both the curriculum people along with the evaluation staff in Washington, putting the institute for service and education together in, in one setting, and then from there I went on to become president.
Speaker 2: Was Herman Branson involved with you--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --along that line?
Speaker 1: Herman was the vi--.  Samuel DeWitt Proctor was the--when I went to work for ISE when I left FAMU, I came back from Minnesota, we spent 1966 through '67 [1967] at the University of Minnesota in the Institute of Technology [University of Minnesota College of Science and Engineering, Minneapolis, Minnesota] where I was on the faculty of the division of, of physical chemistry of the department of chemistry.  So, I did my research work and I taught there.  When I came back, it was for one year that I was assigned to the University of Minnesota, and I replaced a guy who was in statistical mechanics, a guy named Steven Proggo [ph.] who was away in Germany on a sabbatical leave, so I replaced him for one year.  While I was there, Dr. Gore [George W. Gore, Jr.] called me and said, "We--we're gonna get into this program and I want you to direct it."  So, I did.  That had brought me back to FAMU, and I stayed there one year directing the program on the campus.  Then I went to Boston with that activity.  Herman--when I was hired by ISE, Samuel DeWitt Proctor was the president and CEO of the Institute for Services to Education.  Herman Branson, who was chair of the department of physics at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] was the vice president.  No sooner had I taken the job, Sam hired me, no sooner than I got to Boston did I find out that Sam was leaving ISE going to Wisconsin to head up this big project that the, the people in Wisconsin had promised him that they were gonna give him all kind of money to work with black kids to do some of the things that he wanted to do and, and have the money to do it.  So, Herman became the interim president of our organization.
Story_ID: 379921
Speaker 1: You came to Tennessee, Tennessee State University [Nashville, Tennessee], as president.  (Clears throat) You faced a major challenge there.  Tell us about that challenge again just to (unclear).
Speaker 2: The, the--when I, when I came to Tennessee State, it was--the Geier case [Geier v. University of Tennessee, 1979] was before the district court level there, and what the Geier case was about was that the University of Tennessee had established a, a branch campus in Nashville [Tennessee] and it had done that in the early '70s [1970s].  Now what, what made that so horrific was that this was a time of desegregation.  The Adam versus Richardson [Adams v. Richardson, 1972] case had been issued in 1968 wherein desegregation was being brought to public higher education where the focus had gotten away from primary and middle school and secondary (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Public schools.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now it was focusing on higher education.  So here we are, the public institution in Nashville don't have any problems with a, a choice because the only public university in Nashville was Tennessee State. So, here you got the national mentality is desegregation so instead of trying to work with Tennessee State to produce desegregation, University of Tennessee comes in and puts a campus there which creates a choice, an alternative to Tennessee State.  So now you've got all of the stuff that you've got everywhere else in the South where you got a white school facing a black school.  Now you gotta decide what you're gonna do with both of them, right.  Well, it was so unfair, especially since everybody knew that now you've got to try to provide desegregation.  So it seemed like a deliberate alternative to thwart the development of Tennessee State in this large, urban, public.
Story_ID: 379922
Speaker 1: So how did you confront this?
Speaker 2: Well, the state wanted to have two-school concept, that is to, to help both schools exist.  But in, in calling out the two-school concept, what the state was willing to do was to sacrifice Tennessee State [Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] because all of the future programs that were worthwhile to recognize the changing times were earmarked for the University of Tennessee Nashville [University of Tennessee at Nashville; Avon Williams Campus, Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].  All of the graduate programs were earmarked.  So what, what that meant was that, hey, Tennessee State's gonna stay alive, but it won't be anything significant.  It'll probably be about four thousand students while the University of Tennessee Nashville will grow to sixteen to seventeen thousand students.  In fact, the two-plan concept projected that, that the University of Tennessee Nashville would grow to sixteen to seventeen thousand, and then Tennessee State will trawl along at four thousand.  So, in order to provide a unified front to the court required Tennessee State say that--to say that they accepted the two-school plan, right.  Well, I didn't accept the two-school plan, not on the terms that it was presented with of maintaining a school that just got there and to make it be richer, more powerful and more populated, have more diversity in academic programs than we had which was a long-term course there.  So, I, I never went along with the two-school plan.  That of course caused a lot of heartburn, right, because then there was tremendous effort exerted on me and Tennessee State to make us accept the two-school plan.  Rather what turned it toward merger was that at the time I became president of Tennessee State, the state was changing its governor.  A governor named Governor Blanton [Leonard Ray Blanton] was coming into office.  He was politically tied to a man named Roy Nicks who was the chancellor of the University of Tennessee Nashville.  So he sent for me--the governor--he sent for me and he said, "Here's how I want to solve this case.  I'm gonna put the two schools together, and I'm going to put you under the University of Tennessee."  So that meant that Tennessee State, which was a member of the board of regents [Tennessee Board of Regents], would no longer be a member of the board of regents, but would become the University of Tennessee at Nashville, and so all of our history and identity would be wiped out because now we would become a part of the University of Tennessee instead of staying Tennessee State, a part of the board of regents, which we had grew up under in the system, right.  So he, he told me that was the solution that he wanted, and the reason that he wanted to do that was because he had planned to make Roy Nicks who was the chancellor at UTN [University of Tennessee at Nashville; Avon Williams Campus, Tennessee State University], the chancellor of the state board of regent system.
Story_ID: 379923
Speaker 1: So you solved two problems.  You put Roy [Roy Nicks] in as chancellor of the state board of regents [Tennessee Board of Regents], Tennessee State [Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] which is a problem for him is no longer in the state board of regent, but a part of the University of Tennessee now.  The University of Tennessee is satisfied because they maintain the University of Tennessee, they control Nashville [Tennessee] and get to be the University of Tennessee in Nashville [University of Tennessee at Nashville; Avon Williams Campus, Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].  Well, he told me to take that proposition out to the people at Tennessee State, and I told him I would.  So we formed a team and we investigated this whole proposition of what it meant to be the University of Tennessee at Nashville, Tennessee State and UTN combined and merged, or whether you stay Tennessee State.  And we looked at the pros and cons of that and when we got through examining that, I went back to the governor [Leonard Ray Blanton] with our answer which was, "We don't want to join the University of Tennessee system.  We want to stay part of the state board of regents, we want our autonomy, we want the autonomy of Tennessee State continued, and therefore we applaud merger but not with the University of Tennessee Nashville."  So boy, did all of the stuff hit the fan then, right, because I told the governor I couldn't sit on this any longer, that I had to speak to the people, my student body and the faculty and all of that at Tennessee State because everybody knows that something is going on, but they haven't heard from me.  So, I gotta go back and address this, right.  He said, "I don't want you to address it today 'cause I'm going out here to the board to make Roy Nicks chancellor of the state board of regents," right.  "But after I do that, you are free to--."  So then I, I called the whole university together in the convocation and announced that we applauded merger, but to stay a member of the state board of regents and then that went into the court, and so when the, the federal district judge, Judge Gray [Frank Gray, Jr.], brought us in for a hearing, right, we put forth the notion merger was an option now because the governor had suggested it, but not the way he wanted to have it, right.  So, we went into court with everybody.  Now, I got my--my boss is the former chancellor of the University of Tennessee Nashville, right, and, and what he told me was that he was gonna be a man and he was gonna follow what the board wanted which was the two-school concept, right, and I told him, "That's fine.  You be a man, but just as long as you can respect that I'm also be a man and I'm do what I think is in the best interest of Tennessee State."  So we went into court with this and now merger was on the table as a end result of the adjudication in the case [Geier v. University of Tennessee, 1979].  So then the question had to be answered as to what's fair in terms of should you keep two schools with split board of governance, or would it be better to have one board of governance which covered Nashville which would not--cut down on the argument--argumentative circumstances that you would have.  It would make for a clear development of the institution and okay.  So but it still depended on the leadership to say where they were, all right.  And so they tried hard to--after the governor put that thing out there to bring it back to the two-school concept, and so every meeting that I went to was framed in a way of the two-school.  What's the programs you want?  What's UTN gonna get, and fighting that, right.  So, ultimately the judge, based on the input and the consideration of governance, the history of Tennessee State University, the, the relatively new history of UTN, the unfairness of the projections for the future, he ruled that there should just be one school, it should be Tennessee State and UTN should become a part of Tennessee State.
Story_ID: 379924
Speaker 1: Well, a little known thing was I had never thought about the question of who's gonna be president of this combined institution, right.  I had always assumed that if we won, I was gonna be the president, right.  So, then I had to put together your thought process which would be defensible in who should lead and who should your vice presidents be because you got two vice presidents there, right.  Well, I wrote up a plan based on experience and knowledge.  The guy at UTN [University of Tennessee at Nashville; Avon Williams Campus, Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] was just coming 'cause Nicks [Roy Nicks] had just left to be the chancellor.  Here's a guy that just, just coming to be chancellor and he didn't come from a, a presidential position to be chancellor.  He came from some political position to be chancellor, right.  So clearly, I beat him on the substantive things.  Then we got to our vice presidents, right, and in every category we had more experience, more knowledge of higher education, and on the basis of vedas, we went, and so we did.  I created a new vice presidential position and put one of their people into that, and allocated one or two deans slots to formal UTN people, and we went on.  So when we were put together, the stuff that we put down prevailed in terms of providing the leadership and the management for the institution, all right.  But still, you lost students because a lot of white students fled UTN once we were taken over.  But today, Tennessee State [Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] is still alive, it's bigger, it's a beautiful campus.  I mean, Tennessee State is beautiful today.  I mean, they pumped a lot of money into the school to build new buildings.  It's got one of the best student union facilities in the country.  They used the Titans' [Tennessee Titans] stadium to play football.  I mean, it's a--they got a magnificent gym.  They got just magnificent facilities, and so I think that that decision and what we fought for made today Tennessee State one of the top universities in Tennessee and one of the top universities in the country, and, and quite a place for a person to get be president of.  It's got a terrific future ahead of it and will continue to have one (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's good.
Story_ID: 379925
Speaker 1: Why'd you leave?
Speaker 2: Well, I had done--well, I mean very simply.  I wanted to be president of Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 1: So what was the biggest challenge that you faced when you first came here?
Speaker 2: To Florida A&M?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: When I--When I came to FAMU, FAMU was demoralized.  It had a money problem, particularly in athletics.  The enrollment was declining.  My first--I, I came in June I told you.  My first class was seven hundred students with a 700 SAT was the quality of that first class.  Running a deficit in athletics, the faculty demoralized because they didn't like the organizational structure of the university.  So all of those things were easy to fix, right.  I mean--I mean, they were. To fix the morale problem of the faculty.  The largest school that FAMU had then and then what it has today in the College of Arts and Sciences.  The College of Arts and Sciences had been put into a divisional organizational structure.  It had a division of science, a division of vocational technology, a division of humanities in--the College of Arts and Science history were--was the departments, right.  So, I simply reorganized the College of Arts and Sciences back into its departments.  The reason why they were having--I mean, the reason why there were problems in the athletic budget was simply that two things:  FAMU had stopped playing Bethune-Cookman [Bethune-Cookman College; Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida] and stopped playing Tennessee State [Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].  Both were very huge games.  Both great revenue games for.  So I did was put those two schools back on, on the schedule.  Played Bethune-Cookman in Tampa [Florida] and we played Tennessee State.  As soon as we did that, solved the revenue problem in athletics.  So, we got enough money 'cause first game we played, we drew forty thousand with Bethune-Cookman.  We weren't having any games that was worth forty thousand people, right.  So, we made good money.  Played Tennessee State, another huge game, right.  So, we made big money.  So that solved the revenue problem for having a balanced budget in athletics, all right.  And then the next problem was to go on, on the road to recruiting students.  Now, what I had--what I had developed at Tennessee State, I had developed a concept of recruiting students around athletics.  So everywhere we went in to play football in, in Tennessee, I carried a recruiting team, so I had started doing that when I was at Tennessee State, so and it worked 'cause I mean, in order to grow Tennessee State--without a merge--just to begin to grow Tennessee State, I did the study of the demographics of Tennessee State and then in what it was clear was that Memphis [Tennessee] had dried up on Tennessee State.  We weren't getting in students from Memphis.  We weren't getting any students out Chattanooga [Tennessee] or Knoxville [Tennessee], so we were having difficulty having numbers because these areas which have been fertile in the past had no longer a fertile for us.  So, I carried a football game down to Memphis and used that football game to attract people to come, but also to get the interest of students.  And so I then recruited those kids, and so our Memphis population went up, and our Chattanooga population went up, and our Knoxville population went up.  And so in doing that, Tennessee State was growing and I--so I used that when I got to Florida.  So, I said that we're gonna build around recruiting students around athletics.  So, I carried a game to Jacksonville [Florida], Miami [Florida], Tampa.  Wherever we went, we recruited students, all right.  Now, the second thing happened which gave us pizzazz in recruiting students 'cause you had to worry about the big issue for FAMU became after I got here was that the board wanted to establish admissions standards.  When I got here, FAMU was an open admission institution but in a year, it was a--it was an institution that had admissions standards.
Story_ID: 379926
Speaker 1: The next effort was toward increasing the enrollment and improving the quality of the students coming to the institution which required the recruitment, and I told you we were gonna build around--recruiting around athletics, and what we did is do something that I dreamt about in an airport in St. Louis, Missouri.  You know from our relationship that I've always been dedicated to trying to increase the number of African Americans going into math, science, and engineering, and one of the things that has occurred to me, especially since I was at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], was that there are a lot of students out there who have the capability of going into science, math, and engineering.  So, there're two parts of the problem to increasing the number.  The first is to compete effectively for the kids who are coming out of high school who are equipped to, to do math, science, and engineering, and to get your fair share of those students.  The second part of the problem is to increase the pool size.  So you got a pool that's in existence, you just gotta get your fair share of that pool, and then you gotta increase the pool so that there is more to get your fair share being larger to solve the problem, but the first step was how to compete effectively for the kids who were coming out of high school today that's got all of the necessary requirements to be successful at pursuing math, science, and engineering, all right.  So, one of the big drainers--one of the big alternatives to math, science, and engineering is business, and business get a lot of good students, but business had a lot of money to go out and give scholarships to students, right.  So, the question was how did you make something attractive enough that you could compete with the allure of being a business major going to Wall Street, making a lot of money.  What could you come up with that would compete effectively to get kids who might be better suited in science, math, and engineering and who got all of those credentials.  So, here I am in St. Louis early in the morning, the place is empty, and I'm there thinking about the problem of what to do about it and all of a sudden this thing says, "Life gets better," and it all came together, is that to put down this concept that on the day you graduate from high school, I give you a ticket to Corporate America and when you go to Corporate America, I'll pay you a thousand bucks [dollars] a month prior to coming to college and when you come to college, I will give you a full scholarship.  Remember what tuition fees, buy your books, and then five hundred dollars a semester stipend that you have money to do things with out of this scholarship.  What would make it work?
Story_ID: 379927
Speaker 1: What would make it work is that from my experiences that all of these technical companies that come to the university says that you gotta get us the right people.  Right people meaning people who can--who are a ticket, who show great promise in their discipline--technical discipline, make good grades.  General Electric [General Electric] had come to FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and, and as I became president, they said to me, "We're leaving.  We're not gonna come back," and I said, "Why?"  They said, "Well, we're not getting what we want from FAMU," which meant that we were producing engineers who had C averages, but not necessarily fulfilling all the requirements that they saw that they needed, right.  So, if I'm to give them somebody who comes out of engineering with a baccalaureate degree with a 3.5 or 3.3 [grade point average], I had to make sure that I had some top-notch students going in.  Well, that became the answer.  So, I went to Corporate America and I said to them, "Look, I've created--I have this program called Life Gets Better [Life Gets Better Scholarship] and it does for the student.  This program will deliver for you some of the top black students in America.  If, if you pay for this Life Gets Better scholarship, I'll go out and recruit one of the top students in the country and I will put him in your peep sight."  In other words, I can't guarantee that the kid who gets your scholarship will come to work for you, but you'll have him for four years--four summers internship--which you will pay him while he's on an internship and you'll pay for the full scholarship, and it'll be up to you to convince him that he ought to come to work for your company.  Now I, I figure that if you--I go out and get you what you said you've been wanting that you ought to be smart enough to convince that person to come to work for you with all of your resources, and if I can convince that kid to come to FAMU with my limited resources and all the resources you got, right, then you ought to win and we ought to win.  Well, that's the way we started.  I put the concept on paper, put that concept out there to a company, they said, "Okay, let's try with two students."  I went out and recruited two students in engineering, sent them to this company, and we were off and running, all right.  Now, I took the concept and the scholarship--I went out and sold Corporate America on my Life Gets Better.  General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] took five, Honeywell [Honeywell International Inc.] took two, 3M took ten, Wal-Mart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.] took ten.  All over the country, people were buying in to the fact that I would recruit a top-notch student to come to FAMU and put them in their peep sight, not guaranteeing that they can hire them, but put them in the--in the reasonable range that if a company really wanted to hire that kid, they could hire him by making the, the marriage well worthwhile for the student who's getting hired, right.  So, I combined that with the recruitment activity.
Story_ID: 379928
Speaker 1: So when I went to Miami [Florida] for the first time trying out this notion of scholarships for the very brightest students and building that around a football game using tickets, I'd write and invite people to come and say, "If you come, I'll provide you two tickets to the football game," all right, but then when they get there, we have this tremendous showing of talent because we've put together a group called the FAMU Connection which were talented kids.  I mean, you'd have to be amazed if you saw them perform and say, "You've got those kind of kids at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]?"  Yeah.  "You got that kind of talent at FAMU?" Yes.  So, we put that together and the next step of it was we would knowingly invite the top students in that community to come to our event.  You get football tickets, you go to this reception, and then what the real coup d'etat was I'd take out a letter and give it to the kid with a scholarship offer inside of it and then I'd tell him how much it was worth.  On the spot they could accept and they had a scholarship.  They didn't have to go through all the rigmarole.  It was based on their GPA [grade point average] and their SAT scores, right.  And so that word went out like wildfire.  "Hey, you go to FAMU's recruitment activity, if you got anything on the ball, that president's [HistoryMaker Frederick Humphries] gonna give you a full scholarship to come to his university, right."  So, everywhere we went we got just a tremendous crowd.  And so we did two things, we improved the quality of students, we got kids to come major in engineering, major in chemistry, major in physics, major in biology, major in pharmacy, major in business, major in journalism.  All of them, they came, right.  So, we grew our freshman class from seven hundred students to twenty-three hundred students.  Seven hundred students who had a 700 SAT to a--to a class, 2300 who had 1060 on the SAT and 3.2 GPA.  Can you imagine an, an African American class of students that's 2300 in size that's got a 1060 on the SAT when the average in the country is like 892, and maybe a C average and you got a B or--you got slightly better than a B average and a 1060 on the SAT?  Well, we became the place to come to get talent, all right.  So Life Gets Better [Life Gets Better Scholarship] brought us top-notch students.  I mean, recruited a kid out of Dallas [Texas] with a 1570.  Created another--recruited another one with a 1530.  Got a young lady out of Dallas who had a 1440, came here and finished in three years, made a--scored 99th percentile on the MCAT, 99th percentile.  Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] gave her a full four year medical school scholarship and couldn't wait to get her so that when she graduated--we had graduation exercise on a Saturday.  On a Sunday, she was on her way on a plane to Ithaca [New York] to begin her work.  I mean, Cornell didn't want to lose her, so they brought her right after graduation, they brought her right on.  She didn't have time to even spend the summer away from Cornell.  Grabbed her just like that.
Story_ID: 379929
Speaker 1: So, all over America there are stories like that of, of kids who, I mean--and, and, and what has happened is as these students have gone to Corporate America, they have distinguished themselves, right.  So now they're moving up, up the ladder.  They're forming--I mean, they--they've worked on products and now they've become entrepreneur, all right.  Or they, they've gone up the, the corporate ladder and now they have greater responsibility of making big money.  We have a, a group of students who, who now are--combined their resources to create an investment group, and they just gave FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] a hundred thousand dollars because they're being successful, right.  So, out there now is a whole bunch of people that are--that are being success-, successful and who are turning their eyes back to the university to support them.  There's one other point that I want to make.  When, when I was--I started Life Gets Better [Life Gets Better Scholarship] with engineering because the problem was how to increase the number of African American students going in engineering and it worked.  I mean, General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] gave me five Life Gets Better Scholarships in engineering.  I went out and found five top students and they went into engineering, and our engineering program grew.  It grew so much that we became the top producer of black engineers in America.
Speaker 2: I've read about that.  Read about, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so we went from essentially producing maybe ten or fifteen to producing over a hundred and fifty baccalaureates in engineering, right.  We, we became a top--the top producer of baccalaureate degrees period.  And not by a little bit, right.  Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] used to be the number one school for the production of baccalaureate degrees for African Americans.  We went to a point where in the number of baccalaureate degrees that we produced from FAMU was at least four hundred more than were--second was a distant second from where we were in number one.  My next goal was to be the number one producer of African American Ph.Ds where their undergraduate school was Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University], right.  We're third in the country now, but we're on our way to, to becoming number one and as with a little time passing since I've left, that will happen, too, because what we did--.  One day we were sitting around and say, "Well, you know, we created the Life Gets Better in engineering, we created in business, we've created it in journalism, we've created it in pharmacy, and so what are we doing?"  So we said, "What it looks like we're doing is creating a pathway to in-places in the society," all right.  So, when you take that concept, creating a pathway to in-places in the society, then everything becomes clear, right.  So when you go out--when I go out after a student to come to FAMU, I can tell them, "If you understand the concept, creating in-places in the society, pathways to those in-places in society--so one pathway leads to Corporate America for an engineer.  Another pathway leads to graduate school.  Another pathway leads to work in the government.  Another pathway leads to law school.  Another pathway leads to medical school," all right.  So you build pathways to all of those in-places.
Story_ID: 379930
Speaker 1: Now, those things have always been there, right.  I mean, you could always go to medical school, you could always go to law school, you could always go to Corporate America.  The difference is though is to do that with a design, not to leave it up for grabs so that when you come to college and you say, "Well, I want to major in something" like that young lady we met before this thing.  You say, "What's your major?"  Right.  "What're you going to major?"  "I don't know."  Right.  We went out and we had programs in place that we offered students something, right.  It's not that you have--I mean, you can be willy-nilly about this.  "If you want this, we have this pathway that you can walk on."  So like if you want a Ph.D., if you come to FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], I will finance you through your undergraduate program, but then I'll have it set so that you can go to the graduate school with full funding, too.  So it's possible if you come to FAMU, you can go all the way from high school to a Ph.D., never cost you a nickel, all right.  But, you gotta walk the pathway, and now what is walking the pathway?  The walking the pathway is that you've gotta maintain a B average.  What got you this offer is what will keep you this offer.  That is, you gotta be a good student coming out of high school.  If you are a good student coming out of high school, you got a good SAT, a good GPA [grade point average], you gotta maintain that while you're at FAMU, and you gotta do the same thing when you go to graduate school because as long as you maintain your academic standing, all right, you get everything taken care of and you realize your dream of getting of Ph.D., but you do that without encumbering huge loans and a huge amount of debt on the way to do it.  Same thing with medical school, if you want to go to medical school, you come--we work out the relationship with the medical school where you come in for financial support and you come and you maintain your--the criteria which is you gotta make a B or a better average, stay on course, be a good citizen, you go to medical school and you get to be a doctor and it doesn't cost you anything, right.  Same thing with going to law school.  And we--and so we took that and we invited graduate schools to come to FAMU and we said to them, "Look, we have top students here.  We'll help you to recruit those top students providing you agree that you're going to give them the financial wherewithal to accomplish their goal, that is to get the Ph.D., go to med school, or go to law school."  And we drew up a memorandum of understanding and, you know, they all signed it.  So, we were off and running.
Story_ID: 379931
Speaker 1: But now the other thing that we did which I think is important for the development is that we became proactive.  Going to graduate school was a reactive thing.  You only talked to--just like when I was a student.  When that professor asked me--Dr. Elliott [ph.] asked me my senior year [at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], "What is it that you want to do?"  And I said, "Go to graduate school."  Then he told me, "And you want to get a Ph.D. in physical chemistry, you go to--you apply to go to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Pitt [University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] or California [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California]."  Well that's the normal circumstances, even though we know that we need to be sending African Americans to graduate school so that we can get competently trained people to go out and be faculty members at the institution and go out into these other facets of our society.  We don't act like that that's a problem.  You only talk about graduate and professional school only when the student asks you about it.  You're not proactive towards sending kids to grad--.  So that's what we did.  We became proactive.  I'd set up a team who ran workshops to say, "We want to teach you about going to graduate school.  How do you go?  How do you get it supported?"  All right.  What's the advantages of going to graduate school?  What does that mean for your life to go?  We weren't doing stuff like that, but we set it up to be proactive so that we could put on the minds of our students that there is an alternative to going to work.  Go to a professional school or you go get a Ph.D., and we said that.  And then we would tell them how important that is because we have to have more people in the society who did those kind of things, and so we created that what we called the Graduate Feeder Program.  Had forty-three institutions sign on for that, right.  Each of those forty-three institutions would get a minimum of five students, right.  So that's two hundred and fifteen students, right, that we were sending to graduate school as a minimum.  That doesn't count the other ones that we didn't--we didn't know about, right.  But, so it's via that program that we are going to become the number one producer of African Americans Ph.Ds. that come from Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].
Story_ID: 379932
Speaker 1: For those in science, math, engineering, was there another ingredient such as research opportunities for them in the summer?  Was that another piece in this or not?
Speaker 2: We, we,--
Speaker 1: What, what did they have for the summer for (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They, they, they go--they go to work.  They go work in a lab.
Speaker 1: So that they--
Speaker 2: These things were set up, don't you understand?  These were not hit-and-miss activities.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But I'm saying, what was the summer experience?  What, they had the internships built in or research opportunities?
Speaker 2: They had it built in.  And then we also--all right.  Suppose we didn't get one of those National Science Foundation [NSF] summer research experience grant, right?  We would hook up with the schools that had them.  So like in computer science and chemistry, we hooked up with the University of Minnesota [University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota].  So they would take kids from our program to provide summer research experience.  We hooked up with the University of Missouri [Columbia, Missouri] to do the same thing.  So everywhere they had these programs we would write to have a relationship so that it's not an ad hoc thing.  It's a thing by design that we--
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just say that the research opportunity is very critical.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and that was built in during the summer?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's what I--
Speaker 2: And we had--and then we had the mark program which is a program that allows kids to go to a major research laboratory and get paid while they are matriculating at your university.  Then we had our own summer research programs from the--you know, from the different programs from NIH [National Institutes of Health] and NSF where we built in summer research experiences.  But there was not enough for the growth that you had, right.  So for all the kids who wanted to do that, we had to have spots that they could take advantage of.
Story_ID: 379933
Speaker 1: I think that we are coming down to some closing questions--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --on your life and your institution building and your presidencies.  And the first one is, is there anything more that you'd like to add to this interview that I haven't asked you about?
Speaker 2: Well (pause), you, you haven't asked me about--I, I, I don't think you have, but what, what I think is kind of important about the work I have done in both Tennessee State University [Nashville, Tennessee] and at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], and the number of students that we send out now in both places, we grew the institution, okay.  We didn't grow the institution in willy-nilly ways, all right.  So, one of the things that I believe is important in making a difference, other than the things I told you about taking step one, being committed, all right, and working hard to achieve it, right.  You have to have a belief in the ability of our people to compete.  You cannot get there worrying about whether the people that you're getting involved can be successful, all right.  So, one of the fundamental things of growing is that you cannot be afraid of failure.  And I'm not talking about you failing, about the people you're working hard on the behalf of failing is that you don't have any faith in your students, right.  Now, what we did to grow and it--and, and what helped and made it easy was that that faith was always affirmed.  When you put those kids out there and you put them out there with the notion and you talk to them about what this represent and what it meant, they would go out there and get it done and then not only would, would they affirm your belief in them, but they killed doubts of the wider society.  And so you found people coming and being enthused about coming because they learned something special.  I remember the dean of the Graduate School at the University of Minnesota [University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota] telling me that in Atlanta [Georgia] there was this regional recruitment of black students for graduate school and all of the graduate schools were assembling, right.  Well, we had our meeting conflicting with that which I didn't know, but he said, "I'm coming to your meeting, Fred [HistoryMaker Frederick Humphries], 'cause it's just better fishing in your waters than I'm going to find up in Atlanta.  I mean, I'm, I'm a true believer you have got the goods."  And it's not that we had so terribly different students, but it was--what was terribly different was that FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University] believed in their students.  It believed in its faculty, it believed in its administrators, and we wouldn't let anybody down us, down the administration, down the faculty or down the students.  We preached success and the ability to be successful, and we put people in positions wherein they had to perform, and that's--that just creates a terrific environment for doing things that one would have ordinarily difficult to do in our society which made this place a very exciting place, a very dynamic place to be in.  People, you know, people were happy.  Students were happy.  Faculty were happy because you were challenging them, all right.  Administration work--everybody worked hard because they were working against all of the negatives that surrounded our lives and, and, and always conspired to keep us down.  We just would not admit to that stuff.  We were gonna conquer all those kind of images and statements.  (Laughter) I rode home in a cab--in a taxicab from the airport in Tallahassee Airport [Tallahassee International Airport, Leon County, Florida] one evening and this white guy recognized me and he said to me--he said, "Dr. Humphries, you gonna make FAMU so damn good that I won't even be able to go there."  (Laughter) I thought that was a--was a great compliment to Florida A&M and the work we were doing.
Story_ID: 379934
Speaker 1: Just a few--a few more closing questions.  Dr. Humphries [HistoryMaker Frederick Humphries], how do you feel about the way you have lived your life?
Speaker 2: I feel good about the way I've lived my life.  In fact, I, I wouldn't change a thing about my life.  In, in my personal life, I wish that I would have not worked as hard as I did, and at times didn't give the time to my family that I should have.  Attention to my children was--especially my daughter [Robin Humphries Watson]--and the time to my wife [Antoinette McTurner Humphries].  I mean, my wife, as I told you, we stayed together for some forty-six years.  But there were a lot of times when, when I should've been with her and should've been together, and so if, if I were to change anything, I, I would change that.  I would have--I would make it--.  I'm a firm believer in what people--these modern people on, on things to do who say that you have to program personal time, too, not only--you don't program your day professionally.  I'm a firm believer in that now.  I mean, I think that you should combine your personal life and your professional life, and when you make your agenda for what you gonna get done, you put all that together and you make sure that there is something that you're doing as you do the prof-, to further the development of your institution or to create new opportunity for kids, or to get the faculty more involved.  You've programmed a set of activities that get you more involved in your personal life with your family, your children and your wife.  So if, if, if I were to--what I would love the opportunity to do over and repeat is that I become victimized by that thought (laughter).  Where can you, you plan these activities to move the agenda for the, the good things you want to do, but also plan the--to move the agenda for the good things in your personal life, and I would do that differently (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 379935
Speaker 1: What do you still want to do that you have not yet done?
Speaker 2: Well, I--the last thing I want to work at, and it has to do with science and engineering, I, I believe that if we're going to solve the problem with participation, that we have to create an accountability mechanism, and then let me just tell you what I mean by as, as, as quickly as I can.  When kids finish high school, there is no demand on them.  When you finish high school, you go and--you go to college and you major in what you want to major in.  When you go through high school, there's no demand on that high school that a certain number of kids must take biology, must take chemistry, must take physics and wha- must take these math courses.  That is still pretty much a choice activity.  It's if, if your kids wants to take these kind of things, they are available and you can take them there.  There's a teacher there and, and the like.  When you come to college, you don't have to major in chemistry, you don't have to major in physics, and you don't have to go to engineering, all right.  Here's the plethora of academic disciplines we offer.  If you come and we'll talk about them with you, but you make the choice about what field you want to go.  When it comes to going to graduate school and although we've come to a point now that like in the State of Florida--in the State of Florida, we give more Ph.Ds. in engineering to international students than we give to all ethnic groups together--black, Hispanic, white, Asian American born in the country.  That sum total does not equate to the number of international students getting Ph.Ds. in engineering in Florida, right.  Now, so can we do that better?  Can we avoid a result like that?  Can we produce the numbers that we need?  And at, at this point, it's not just--it's not the African American any longer, it's for the country.  And I think the key to doing that is, is that there is the people who run the high schools have got to have a commitment for a certain number of kids coming out going into science, mathematics and engineering.  And the people who run the colleges have got to have a commitment for a certain number of kids coming out in science, math, and engineering.  And then the people who run the universities have got to commit to a certain number of kids going to graduate school and the like.  In, in other words, if this is not happening, you're failing.  And so you have to do something.  You have to, to, to do a, a set of substantive activities that will move the flow of people from this free choice to being more interested in responding to these needs that are in the scientific and technical areas to make sure that we are creating the pool of people who have the capabilities of sustaining the technological advantage of the nation and the like.  And so I--I'm saying you can't be hands off about that.
Story_ID: 379936
Speaker 1: You've got to--you've got to do certain kind of things.  So now, what's required for that, right?  I think that what's required is that the state has got to say for our public schools we have to produce so many thousand people going into science and engineering.  The State of Florida has to--got to commit that it will produce a certain number, not just be happy with whatever you get out of the process, but produce a certain number.  And it has to say--the State of Florida has to say to the institutions with this base, you've got to produce a certain number of baccalaureate degrees in science and engineering coming from this state, and then with the graduate school, you gotta say, "You gotta produce a certain number of Ph.Ds. along the line."  And we gonna have this stuff reported, and we gonna have it looked at, right.  And we gonna figure out how to put a science teacher--a qualified science teacher--in every high school and got to know--figure out how many we gonna have to produce.  And then if we have to do things like everything, there is no reward for being a--.  I mean, if I had my way, I'd give every kid who majored in science and engineering a full scholarship, right.  We give everybody who play football a full scholarship, we give everybody who play basketball a full scholarship, but we won't consider doing that in certain academic discipline 'cause that's--.  But I think that that's some of the kind of things that you gonna have to come to is to, to ensure this kind of result for yourselves and for your nation, right, and so that we can have the kind of distribution of talent that we need to run this nation.  And so I'd like to play a part in, in having that kind of thinking exposed and subject to discussion, and to see what kind of policies we can come out with associated with that.
Speaker 2: So you're posing another major challenge for yourself as you have all along the way?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's what I'd like to do.
Story_ID: 379937
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the historically black colleges [HBCUs] today?
Speaker 2: Well, my hope is that--two things.  We still have within the black college community, a dependence structures, okay.  All major colleges have advocacy groups, so black colleges should have advocacy groups, right.  But we need to examine every structure that creates a dependence for us.  In other words, it doesn't allow us to unleash our potential to, to drive the institution where a good president can take it, all right.  And so we've got various structures which interfere in, in our lives that once upon a time were very helpful, but questionable today, right.  So, if your future's depending on a third-party activity that you don't control, is that a useful element in this day and time?  So, I, I think that if we are gonna have wherein you force the unique vision and leadership of the people who are entrusted with the leadership to be that and let them drive the institution as far as it go, and then take away the appendages that takes away their, their drive and their ability to get things done.  So, number one, I think if we don't get that done, then a lot of the schools are gonna get killed because it doesn't--the power to lead and the, the, the pressure to lead and the pressure to, to do creative things to, to get what you need for your institution is mitigated by third parties doing things for you, right.  So to be free is a--is a big issue.  And then secondly, the colleges have got to get beyond just thinking of themselves as baccalaureate degree granting institution and accept the notion that everybody can't move to the next level, but there are ones that can, and all of us will be better for it that those ones that can, in fact, do move to the light.  It will help everybody, not just the ones who are doing it, but the ones who are in association with them.  And so, I think without those things happening, the future's not bright for black colleges and to stand still is to lose, and if that is not well understood, then I think there's not a very bright future for our institutions.
Story_ID: 379938
Speaker 1: Last question before we move to the photographs.  How do you want to be remembered?  What do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, the, the--I mean, number one, I want people to say I was good president, all right, because I was, right, (laughter) and, and that's important to me because I think in America, leadership for a black American is always in question, and somehow our society always manages to destroy our leaders so that when you look around history and you, you, you look at the people who are leading you, somehow or another what becomes anonymous with black folks assuming leadership is that it's a failed leadership, right.  And so, the whole time I served as president, I was mindful of this and I--and I think what requires you to be a successful president is that you don't do the naturally expected thing, right.  When I fought the leadership in Tennessee, it was not the normal thing.  People don't stand up (background noise).  So, I mean, you cannot do the expected thing.  If you do the expected thing, then you're gonna get the traditional answer which is never good.  So, it's only when you do the unexpected thing that you get different kinds of results, and those different results in my mind creates a level of respect, all right, and, and, and, and it, it makes it undeniable that leadership was executed, right.  So, I, I, I think that you, you, you, you have to understand that, otherwise in 2006 and 2007 and on in to the future, you're gonna be getting the same results that you've always got which has not been good for our advancement, or our development, or looking at the people who lead with a certain kind of reverence.  It's like, "Can we have a Clark Kerr?"  Okay.  Can you have--who is the great president at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]?  Right.  I mean, can you have a Bill Friday [William C. Friday] who, who is well respected, right.  So, and--I mean, I think that (pause), that the way I want to be remembered is that I was a great president because I did not adhere to the traditional mind, that I did some things that were just different and in so doing, accomplished some amazing things which is what I would want to communicate to the future leadership is that you can win balking the system, and you can win by having a vision and thinking creatively.  And the third thing I think that my, my--that I would like to remember by that if you got the right solution, people who you don't think will support you will support you.
Story_ID: 379939
Speaker 1: All right.  This photo is taken on the campus of Florida A&M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]. It's in the quadrangle which is right out in front of this black archives building [Southeastern Regional Black Archives Research Center and Museum; Carrie Meek-James N. Eaton, Sr. Southeastern Regional Black Archives Research Center and Museum].  This photo was taken on the occasion of my inauguration as president--the eighth president of Florida A&M University, and in this photo are my children and my wife.  On the far left--my left is my elder son, Fred Jr. [Frederick Humphries, Jr.], the young lady standing next to him is my daughter, Robin Tanya [Robin Humphries Watson], then there's me and the person that I am hugging is my wife, Antoinette [Antoinette McTurner Humphries], and standing beside her on her left is my younger son, Laurence Humphries.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Great.
Speaker 1: We'll straighten this up later.  Don't get confused by this horizontal (unclear).
Speaker 2: All right.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: This photo is, is taken of me in my office at Tennessee State University [Nashville, Tennessee], and it is a photo taken during my early service at Tennessee State University.  So this is in 1975, '76 [1976] picture in which I am faking writing or signing a document.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Very good.  Excellent.
Speaker 1: Can we get this?
Speaker 2: Yeah, put it so that is at the bottom.  Move up it another 90 degrees.  (Unclear) a description--
Speaker 1: This is a, a photo of Bill Cosby and myself and is taken here on the campus, and this is a 1988, '89 [1989] vintage photo.  Very early once I had come to FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University], did I meet with Bill Cosby and Cosby formed a friendship with Florida A&M University and me.  One of our largest early gifts came from him and Camille [Camille Cosby], $325,000 gift to support the arts and the humanities, and I had him down to speak for commencement.  But this is a speech that he gave on an occasion in the fall where the, the day was very much like today, it was raining, and Bill challenged all of us to be true Rattlers, and that is a Rattler--a true Rattler would stand out in the rain and listen to him.  They would not run for cover under the stands to try to get out of the rain.  A true Rattler would set out there in that rain and take it, get wet, and listen and the program would go on.  But that's a fall 1989, '88 [1988], '90 [1990] picture.
Speaker 2: Good.  Next.  All right.  What about this one?
Speaker 1: I got to see.  Let-, may, may I look at that?  Oh.  This is a, a--could I--.  (Pause) This is a photo taken place in the--in the '90s [1990s].  The fellow on my extreme left--from the picture of my right is Charlie Reed [Charles B. Reed] who was chancellor of the system, and the lady in the middle is a member of the board of regents, and of course, myself.  This picture is, is, is taken when we were being recognized for being the Time magazine, Princeton Review college of the year.  And so that Time magazine that you see there, "Best Colleges in America," that kind of thing, had to do with we were celebrating the fact that we had been named by Time magazine and the Princeton Review as the number one college in America.
Speaker 2: Very good.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Turn that up so I can see it.  Okay.  (Pause) This is a picture of, of, of me presiding at commencement, awarding degrees to graduates of the university, and the reason why we're on the cover, it's a photo of a cover of Black Issues [Black Issues in Higher Education; Diverse: Issues in Higher Education] is because that summer we became--it, it was the first time that we lead the nation in the production of black baccalaureates.  Now, ever since we have assumed leadership in terms of using the number of--the most black baccalaureates of any college in, in America, we have kept it.  So, this is around 1997, '98 [1998] when we by-passed Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] in terms of the production of, of the most black baccalaureates in the country.
