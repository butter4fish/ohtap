Story_ID: 481833
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you some questions about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family first and then your father's [Mark Martin, Sr.] side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So we can keep them sorted out.  So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Junie, J-U-N-I-E, Alberta Martin [Junie Martin].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Martin.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: June 1st, 1917 in Columbia, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I noticed something that you and your mother both have June for a first name and you're both born in June.  Is that--is there a story behind that or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think she named me June because I was born in June.  She named my sister Christeve [Christeve Martin Boykin] because she was born on Christmas Eve.  But my brother's name was Mark [Mark Martin] and he was born in September, so I guess she ran out of (laughter)--didn't know what to do with that one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Now--okay, so--well, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  Was the--is the family as far as you know always from that--I mean, as far back as you can go from that region?
Speaker 2: From that area of--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --South--of Columbia, South Carolina, Hopkins [South Carolina], Eastover [South Carolina], the area surrounding.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The country.  It used to be called--now it's called the suburbs, but it used to be called down in the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said Eastover?
Speaker 2: Eastover, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hopkins, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what are the stories passed down in your family about this part of the country and, and the family history?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know you've done--some of the family has done a lot of research and you can go all the way back to slavery (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --is what I hear.  Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother--my grandfather [Will Martin] and grandmother [Rosena Martin], my mother's parents, married when they were very young.  She was an only child and they always lived in Columbia after she was born.  My grandfather was the first black licensed electrician in the State of South Carolina.  My grandmother never worked outside of the home, and they were the--kind of the caretakers of the community.  They were the ones that at the holidays made sure all the families got a Thanksgiving basket or a Christmas basket.  They were very--just really good people that black and white people respected and knew a lot about our family.  We owned a lot of land, still do own a lot of land around where she lived, where she grew up, and--
Speaker 1: By a lot, what would you say?
Speaker 2: Well, about eight or nine houses were built right around where we lived that they owned.  In fact, we still own most of the property and some of the houses.  I live--I have our family home that I grew up in, I still have.  So, my father--my grandfather was an entrepreneur in terms of starting his own business and being an electrician.
Story_ID: 481834
Speaker 1: Now, when was he--did he get his license?
Speaker 2: In 1915.
Speaker 1: And what were your [maternal] grandparents' names?
Speaker 2: Will Martin and Rosena [Rosena Martin], R-O-S-E-N-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  All right.  So, 1915.  Now, that is--I don't know if you realize it, but that's before a lot of black electricians got their licenses in Illinois, in Ohio, and a lot of other states.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Right.  And he was also a barber, owned a barbershop.  And then my--when my mother [Junie Martin] got married, my father [Mark Martin] joined him in the business and became an electrician as well.
Speaker 1: So, what was it--is there a story behind--I mean, what kind of difficulty did that present for him--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to get a license?
Speaker 2: What I remember about it is it was very--it was--the people that he did the work for, there were white people who got him to do a lot of their work, who really built his business that he had a good relationship with the people who owned the supply stores.  I remember going with him, you know, to get the supplies.  But I also remember I learned how to drive, driving him around to collect the money that he was owed for the work that he had done.  And we would always have to go to the kitchen door or the back door of the person's home to collect the money.  And sometimes they wouldn't pay him on time and he'd have to go back and we'd have to keep going back.  So, that--I remember that as part of the difficulty of it.  But, I also remember that he trained a lot of other black men to be electricians.  They worked under him.  And some of the electrical companies that are still there today, that's how they got started because they worked for him.  I guess you had to have workers, an apprentice or--to get your license, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, was it unusual for him to be a black electrician in South Carolina in those days (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, see I--by the time I was born in 1947, it was, you know, not as unusual as it was I'm sure when he first started because there were other electricians by the time I was born.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1915, we're talking about electricity really hadn't been around that long (unclear).
Speaker 2: I know and I remember, you know, my grandmother resisting getting the first electric stove.  She did not want it.  And that was in the '40s [1940s] or '50s [1950s] maybe.  But the wiring he did, I remember him talking about--we would pass by a building and he would say, "I wired that," or, you know, I did--I put the plugs in there, I put the lights in there.  So, he had been doing that for--you know, forever when--from when he started.  And I don't know how he got started.  That part of the history, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's quite a story.
Story_ID: 481835
Speaker 1: There any stories that go way back to--because I know you mentioned an ancestor named Trixie, I think it was?
Speaker 2: Tracy [ph.].
Speaker 1: Tracy, Tracy as being directly from Africa.
Speaker 2: Now--yes.
Speaker 1: And what--about how long ago, I mean, would that be?  I mean, what--about what year or what era would she have come over here, if you remember?
Speaker 2: It's in that book (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't remember it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: Was it prior to 1800 or?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When she came, she was bought by a slave master in Charleston, South Carolina, whose name was John, John Martin, and the difference that has been researched was that he taught--had his slaves educated that they could read, and also encouraged them to be entrepreneurs that they could start their own business.  And as a result, Tracy's daughter, who had a child by John Martin's grandson, that's how the family lineage of the Martins started, from Tracy's daughter, and spread out throughout South Carolina, and a lot of our ancestors were business owners as well as A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] ministers.  My father's Martin side of the family, my mother [Junie Martin] and father [Mark Martin, Sr.] were both Martins, but my father's side founded a town, Jenkinsville, South Carolina, which was built around an A.M.E. church in--which is still in Jenkinsville.
Speaker 1: So, would this have been after the Civil War or?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Jenkins--so, it was a black town founded (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --by the A.M.E.--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It--well, it--kind of that was the foundation of the--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of the community, Jenkinsville and White Hall A.M.E. Church [Jenkinsville, South Carolina], which is still there.
Speaker 1: Jenkinsville, huh?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, this--I know there's a--anybody in your family associated with Bishop Turner?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.
Speaker 1: Henry McNeal Turner?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.
Speaker 1: I know he was in South--Columbia [South Carolina] for--you know, he became like a big bishop in the A.M.E. church.
Speaker 2: What was his name?
Speaker 1: Henry McNeal Turner.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not that I recall, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: They had a plan to actually go to Africa on a ship called the Azor back in the 1870s.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: So, I was just wondering--you know, I was wondering if probably some association, but.
Story_ID: 481836
Speaker 1: Okay, so Jenkinsville [South Carolina].  Any stories about Jenkinsville?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father [Mark Martin, Sr.], Martin side of the family, grew up in Jenkinsville and Newberry [South Carolina], in that area, and my father was an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal], my mother [Junie Martin] was a Baptist.  And on Sundays, we would go to Sunday school at Bethel A.M.E. [Bethel A.M.E. Church, Columbia, South Carolina].  Then, we would go to church at Zion Baptist [Zion Baptist Church, Columbia, South Carolina].  And then afterwards, we would go up to Jenkinsville, every Sunday, which was only twenty-one--twenty-five miles from Columbia [South Carolina], to visit my father's sisters and his other relatives in Jenkinsville and Newberry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And even after he died--my father died very--when I was very young.  I was seven.  He was very young as well.  He was thirty-eight when he died, but we still went to visit his family every Sunday in Jenkinsville.
Speaker 1: Well, it's interesting that Jenkinsville--now, we hear about the black towns in Oklahoma and some in Kansas and Texas, and--but--and, of course, Mound Bayou in Mississippi, a lot of people know about that.  But--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Jenkinsville, was there any--how did it--is it still in existence or?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we used to--it's a--we used to say--there was a sign that said, "Welcome to Jenkinsville," and that you could hold your breath until you got to the sign that said, "And come again."  That's how big it was (laughter).  Just two stores, you know, but as Columbia has expanded and grown, it's become a place that's developing.  There's a nuclear water plant that was built in that area that brought employment and people to that areas.  But, yeah, so it's not a town that you could go downtown to.  It's a town that was really where the people lived and there was probably a general store, you know, and a few stores.  So, it wasn't a big town, but it's an area.
Speaker 1: So, but black people I take it controlled the--owned the stores?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And that made it a black town.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, and as you know, a lot of--even in Columbia, there was a section where black people owned all the stores, you know.  That's where we would go on Saturday, to the black drugstore, you know, black general store, my father's barber shop, the--all the dentists were, you know, black business owners, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, you had a class of black professionals--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in town.
Speaker 2: Business owners.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Above and beyond just the school teachers and such.
Speaker 2: Yeah, above and beyond the school teachers and the one or two funeral homes that were there, and the one or two lawyers that were black.  There were a few doctors, but there were also black business owners.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember that very well.
Speaker 1: There's also--is that Bennett College [sic.] that's there?  The (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There are two colleges--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in Columbia, Allen University [Columbia, South Carolina], which is Baptist--no, Allen University is Methodist and Benedict College [Columbia, South Carolina] is Baptist and there were--
Speaker 1: Oh, Benedict, right.  I keep getting it--okay, Benedict.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they're right across the street from each other.  My mother went to Benedict, my father went to Allen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  One of the significances of South Carolina is it was--it's one of the few states--I think one of two that has a black population that outnumbers the white.  At least it did at one time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Mississippi and South Carolina.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 481837
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Junie Martin] tell any stories of growing that are--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she grew up as an only child and really, my [maternal] grandfather [Will Martin], my--I was just in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], and my sister [Christeve Martin Boykin] and I were talking about the fact that she was probably very what we would call spoiled today because she had everything that she wanted.  He built her from, you know, woodworking of complete doll babies, bedroom set with a dresser and bed and mirrors.  And so she grew up by what standards we would call probably privileged because he was a business owner, and her family--and being an only child, she had what she wanted, dressed very well, went to visit her aunts in New York and Washington every summer.  My grandmother's sisters because she had a lot of sisters who lived in the North.  And we have pictures of, you know, the beautiful clothes that she had.  Her wedding picture, all of the women had beautiful formals on.  So, she had a--probably a very privileged life.  You know, I--you know, my grandmother [Rosena Martin] never worked, so she was at home with her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, where did she go to school and--
Speaker 2: She went to Benedict College [Columbia, South Carolina]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and--for two years and graduated from Virginia State [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And eventually got her master's [degree] from South Carolina State [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University] in Orangeburg [South Carolina] when blacks couldn't go to the University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina].  So, she and her friends, I remember a group of them, every Saturday, they would--they were teachers and they would drive to South Carolina State on Saturdays to get--work on their master's.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that's a black school?
Speaker 2: South Carolina State in Orangeburg (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) South Carolina State in Orangeburg, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, she became a teacher, okay.
Story_ID: 481838
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your father.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Mark Anthony, M-A-R-K, Anthony Martin [Mark Martin, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a story behind Mark Anthony (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.  My brother is named Mark Anthony [Mark Martin, Jr.], too, but no, I don't know.  And he had a large family.  He came from a large family of brothers and sisters.  I think there were maybe eight or nine of them.
Speaker 1: You know, I was just referring to the classical allusion to--of Mark Antony (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, of Mark Antony.
Speaker 1: You know, yeah.
Speaker 2: His brother's name was--there was one named John and then Talmadge, John Martin and Talmadge.  I don't what significance those--where those names came from.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, it's John Martin and Talmadge Martin were the brothers?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  Now what is your father's date of birth and place--date--
Speaker 2: Jaunary 10th, 1915.
Speaker 1: And he was born in Columbia [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: He was born in Jenkinsville [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Jenkinsville, okay, that's right.  Okay, now, what do you know about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, it's kind of the same.  The--when I say the same because the ancestry of the Martins goes back to Tracy and then depending on which one of her sons the lineage came from and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so are your parents like distant cousins?  Is that what, what--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --it is or--
Speaker 2: --probably so far removed that it's hard to even trace it back for a connection for them.  But his--I do know the history that we have is of--that includes more information about his side of the family.  I could probably go and trace where my mother's [Junie Martin] side came from if I took the time to do it as a part of our history to see which son she--her fam- her parents came from in terms of lineage.  But, his I know is that the ancestor who was a direct descendent of the slave owner was named Benjamin Martin, and--excuse me--and who also was a business owner who owned--I'm not sure what kind of business.  It was a blacksmith or it was some kind of entrepreneurial business that he owned.  And then my father had seven brothers and sisters, and they all lived in Jenkinsville.  And he was one of the younger ones and died very young.  And his sister who was the oldest--his parents [Viola Martin and John Martin] died young, so he was really raised by his older sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your father died young?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, at thirty-eight.
Speaker 1: Thirty-eight, okay.  Okay.  And what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was an electrician and a barber.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Owned his own barbershop.  He joined my father--my [maternal] grandfather's [Will Martin] electrical contracting business when he and my mother got married and he also owned a barbershop.
Speaker 1: Now, did he get a chance to go to college too around there or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he went to Allen [Allen University, Columbia, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Went to Allen University.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  Now, now, did your father tell any stories of growing up there?
Speaker 2: I would--probably so there, but I was so young when he died, I was seven when he died, so I don't remember a lot of what his stories were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, from what you know about him I guess and--now, did you have a stepfather at some point?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Never did?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Story_ID: 481839
Speaker 1: Well, from what you know about your father [Mark Martin, Sr.] and your mother's [Junie Martin] personalities and talents and dispositions, you know, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Wow.  Probably my mother because I was around her, you know, most.  I saw--my father, my memories of my father were--and my [maternal] grandfather [Will Martin] were as the protector that--because I was the youngest of three children and I was the baby, I remember my brother [Mark Martin, Jr.] and sister [Christeve Martin Boykin], you know, saying I always got treated better and I was the favorite and--'cause I was the baby.  And if I would get in trouble, I would always run to my [maternal] grandmother [Rosena Martin] and I knew nothing would happen (laughter).  And I remember--I--my memories of my father, some of the memories that I have of how much he and my mother were in love with each other I remember, and we have beautiful love letters that he wrote her.  Because at one during their marriage, he lived in Columbia [South Carolina], and she lived in Florence [South Carolina] as we were building a house in Columbia, and he would write her beautiful love letters about how much he missed her and so that's a very positive memory that I have of them as being married.
Speaker 1: Is there a story that they--that your mother told you about how they met?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the story that I know--I don't know exactly how they met, but I know that my grandmother and grandfather did not want her to be with him, so that's when they sent her to Virginia State [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University] in Petersburg [Virginia].  Because both of them--he was at Allen University [Columbia, South Carolina], she was at Benedict College [Columbia, South Carolina], and they were right across the street from each other, the schools are, and they were not happy about their relationship, so they sent her away to school.  But that didn't stop them from being together, and as soon as she graduated, they got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, when did they get married?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I think it was 1939, '38 [1938]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --or '39 [1939].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do, do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I have a brother who is deceased.  I have one sister who lives in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now--and where do you fall in that order?  Are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The--I'm the baby.
Speaker 1: --you're the baby.  Yeah, you're the baby, that's right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You already said that, that's right, baby of the family.  So--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 481840
Speaker 1: What's your earliest memory in the family?
Speaker 2: Sitting my--in the--my dad's [Mark Martin, Sr.] lap watching one of the first black and white TV programs.  You know, this is probably in nineteen fifty--maybe 1951, '52 [1952]?  When did black and white come out?
Speaker 1: I--'48 [1948] is when the first sets--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I think hit the market, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, it wasn't too--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --long after that.
Speaker 1: 'Cause they had them--you know, they were out in the early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: But I remember us sitting around as a family watching TV and I remember the--you know, him getting sick and being at home because he couldn't work because he was ill.  And my [maternal] grandmother [Rosena Martin] and grandfather [Will Martin] lived right across the street from us, so just going back and forth to them, having dogs who lived outside in their doghouse.  They did not come in the house (laughter).  You know, having pets and my grandmother had chickens and--in the backyard.  And every year--they raised pigs and remember killing the pigs around this time of year, around Thanksgiving time.  So, and also we owned land in Eastover [South Carolina] and Hopkins [South Carolina], and going down there with my father and grandfather to collect the rent from the people who were leasing the land or renting the properties that we owned.  So, those are some of the things.  And I also remember right next door to us, there was a white family that owned a liquor store that was on the adjoining property, and I remember my father being threatened by the owner that if he walked across her property that she would shoot him, you know, because she didn't want him walking across her property because he was black or the N word was, you know, what was used then.  So, I remember that part of growing up.
Story_ID: 481841
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The sights were the chickens in the backyard and the turkeys and the, you know when--what happened when the hogs were killed, how people came over to help my [maternal] grandfather [Will Martin] at the smokehouse.  I remember that.  And I remember honeysuckle, the bush that smells so good because I had a girlfriend who lived a couple blocks away and the halfway point, we would walk each other home to the halfway point and there were all these beautiful honeysuckles, and you could pull them off and suck the--suck the nectar out of the honeysuckle bushes.  I remember that.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.  Now, I smelled them before, but I didn't know you could actually--
Speaker 2: Just--yeah.
Speaker 1: --consume them, you know, so (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, we thought we could.  Maybe (laughter)--well, it's like a little taste of nectar that you get out of them if you pull them off.  I remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, what about--what's your earliest memory of school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I--my [maternal] grandmother [Rosena Martin] kept me.  I never went to a daycare center, but I stayed with my grandmother every day until I went to school.  And my mother [Junie Martin] was a teacher at the school that I went to, first grade.
Speaker 1: What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: Carver--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Elementary School [Carver-Lyon Elementary School, Columbia, South Carolina].  It's still there.  And when I went to school, there was a neighborhood school, but I didn't go to that one.  I went with her where she taught.  And the children who were there had been in kindergarten together, so they all knew each other and I didn't know anybody.  And I remember standing on the playground on the first day of school by myself crying because I didn't, you know, want to be there.  And this girl came up to me and said, "Do you have any friends?"  And I said, "No."  She said, "I'll be your friend."  Her--and her name is Linda Love [ph.] and she lived right across the street from the school.  So, we became friends and every day after school, I would go to her house and wait until my mother got out of school, and we're still friends today.  I just saw her a couple weeks ago.
Speaker 1: That's a sweet story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep.  So, she was my first friend at school.  And her family became an integral part of my life because I spent every day after school at her house waiting on my mother.
Story_ID: 481842
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest memory of religion?
Speaker 2: Going to Sunday school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, going to Sunday school at the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church and then going to church at the Baptist church [Zion Baptist Church, Columbia, South Carolina], going to bible school in the summer on the campus at Allen University [Columbia, South Carolina], going to bible camp.  So, yeah, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you notice any difference between the two?
Speaker 2: The churches?
Speaker 1: The Baptist and the A.M.E.?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Was there any significant difference?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the A.M.E. was more conservative in terms of the music and the Baptists were--they had the--you know, the gospel choir and the men's choir and the--you know, people would shout in the Baptist church, but they wouldn't shout in the A.M.E. church, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your--so, your family kind of--did you ever settle on one of those or?
Speaker 2: I'm A.M.E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's--so, how long did it take for you to--
Speaker 2: I joined the church when I was about ten, ten or eleven, but still went to--and after that, we went to Bethel [Bethel A.M.E. Church, Columbia, South Carolina] most of the time but still would go with my mother [Junie Martin] to church some time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And my [maternal] grandfather [Will Martin] and grandmother [Rosena Martin] were Baptists.
Story_ID: 481843
Speaker 1: So, what did you like to do growing up?  What were your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Play.
Speaker 1: --favorite things--yeah.
Speaker 2: We used to play, play school, play outside, you know, just play with kids.  We didn't have any games--play hopscotch, play baseball.  We made up games.  I liked to play (laughter).  'Cause we could be outside most of the time in the South, so we just played.  Be worn out when you came in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause playing was--I mean, we ran races, you know, just played (laughter).  Not--you know, not--play with dolls and stuff, but play with wagons, skating, that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you stayed outside a lot.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: You had--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: I don't think that happens as much--well, maybe down south it does, but not--
Speaker 2: Not now--kids in front of the TV or the computer.  They don't know how to play with each other.  And they play video games.  That's what they play.  But, we used to play if you--sitting on the steps and somebody would ask you a question, if you answered, you moved up a grade to the next step.  If you didn't, you got put out of school (laughter).  Yeah, but that was--you know, it was--playing was fun.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you played school like that where you just get put out if you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --don't know?
Speaker 2: You get--if you didn't answer the question, make mud pies, you know, play cooking with mud and dirt, yeah, just play.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, you attended Carver elementary school [Carver-Lyon Elementary School, Columbia, South Carolina]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and--now, was Columbia [South Carolina]--about how big is the black population in Columbia compared to the rest of the city in those days when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Comparatively, I really don't know, but it--we--all the black people mostly knew each other because we lived in certain communities where you either, you know--I lived in an area called Ridgewood [Columbia, South Carolina], which is all black but right next to Eau Claire [Columbia, South Carolina], which was the white section and had--there was a white school that I couldn't go to.  And then there was Greenview [Columbia, South Carolina] and Waverly Heights [sic. Waverly, Columbia, South Carolina], so I really don't know how large the white population was because we didn't interact with them, you know, so I really don't know.
Speaker 1: So you don't have any idea what the percentage would be.
Speaker 2: No, I--
Speaker 1: Would you suspect that black folks were half of the city or?
Speaker 2: I think so, probably, when I think about it.  I don't think it's that way today because it has expand--Columbia has grown and expanded.  It may well be.  I haven't spent that much time there to know the makeup of the city now.  But it--I know it has really grown and expanded.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I know they have a big airport now and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --a lot of things are going on, yeah.
Speaker 2: The University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina] is huge.  A lot built around--excuse me--excuse me--a lot of the culture is built around the university, huge stadium, big football town, three rivers, Congaree [Congaree River], Saluda [Saluda River], and Broad River, and a lot of development on the rivers, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Columbia is the home, home of the University of South Carolina, yeah.  It's--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Story_ID: 481844
Speaker 1: When you were in school, did you--what were your favorite subjects and activities?
Speaker 2: Playing (laughter).  I loved to--we played in school (laughter).  No, I liked--I always liked social studies.  I liked history and social studies.  And we would--my mother [Junie Martin] being a teacher, she was an artist, but she also taught kids, what now they call special ed [special education].  And she used art to teach children who had what we call learning disabilities or ADD [attention deficit disorder].  And I remember helping her with projects, art projects for her classroom and--I can't think of a favorite subject.  I just--I liked school.  We learned and liked--I just liked it.  It was fun.
Speaker 1: Just to that--what you just raised about your mother.  Did your mother create work for exhibition or that sort of thing or did they, you know, too, or did she just--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: --teach art?
Speaker 2: She taught art.  We have some of her artwork at home, paintings, sculpture, linoleum block prints, but I don't remember her selling art or exhibiting art.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Okay, so were there any special teachers or mentors?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had a teacher that I really li- her name was Jewell Walker [ph.] and she was my third grade teacher, and she was beautiful, and all the girls liked her because she was so beautiful and she dressed really nice and her hair was always beautiful.  And she and my mother were very good friends, so I really admired her and always stayed connected with her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now you were there throughout elementary school to the end of--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --eighth grade?
Speaker 2: No, went to what was the junior high school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For seventh and eighth grade.
Speaker 1: What was the name of that one?
Speaker 2: W.A. Perry Junior High [W.A. Perry Junior High School; W.A. Perry Middle School, Columbia, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Any--well, your last name is Perry now, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --I guess there was no relation to (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, no.  And my girlfriend, very good friend, her father was the principal of the school and my mother transferred to that school to teach art after I left Carver elementary [Carver-Lyon Elementary School, Columbia, South Carolina].  So, she was there and my girlfriend's father was the principal, and the two of us would always get in trouble because we talked too much in class.  And we would end up in the office and my mother and her father would just look at us and shake their heads (laughter).  But we still had--we had fun.  We were--it was a fun, fun time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, now this is like nineteen--what are we talking about, in nine--in junior high school?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I graduated from high school [C.A. Johnson High School, Columbia, South Carolina] in '65 [1965], so that would've been '59 [1959] maybe, '59 [1959], '60 [1960].
Story_ID: 481845
Speaker 1: Now, the country was really getting into the Civil Rights Movement in the late '50s [1950s], you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Little Rock [Arkansas], and you had, you know, the Montgomery Bus Boycott and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so were things starting to heat up in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --South Carolina?
Speaker 2: I remember when we went to the movies, we, you know, had to sit upstairs and I remember, you know, the news talking about segregation and the--kind of an escalation of the fear--well not fear, but just conversation about you shouldn't drive alone at night because, you know, the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] is around and we'll never see you again, just those kind of things being a part of the conversations that were prevalent in the community in the school.  Yeah, so I remember the difference and more attention to the things that we had lived with, like the black and white water fountains and the different bus station and train waiting rooms and all of the things that were segregated.  I remember that.
Speaker 1: When you first encountered--can you remember when you first encountered that kind of thing or took notice of it?
Speaker 2: As a little girl, I remember my [maternal] grandmother [Rosena Martin] taking me to ride the bus and the fact that we had to sit in the back.  And I would ask her, "Why do we have to go to the back," and she would say, "That's just the way it is."  Yeah, and like I said, being with my [maternal] grandfather, and knowing that he had to collect money from white people and sometimes they wouldn't pay him, and also recognizing the difference of he always called them mister and they always called him Uncle Willie [Will Martin].  So, you know, I always--you knew those things happened and also my family would travel, drive, when my father [Mark Martin, Sr.] was alive.  I remember we drove to Canada, to Quebec, and we would stay in people's homes that they knew because we couldn't stay in hotels and stop on the side of the road and, you know, have a picnic because we couldn't go in hotels or--you know, in restaurants.  So, I--yeah, I remember those things.
Speaker 1: Once you got to Quebec, was it still segregated?
Speaker 2: No.  I remember staying in the hotel in Quebec and I think that's, you know, probably why we wanted to go there because it was a different country with different rules, but I remember that.
Speaker 1: It's interesting in those days, a lot of places in the North, black people couldn't stay in hotels either, yeah, I know so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's true.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The North was just as segregated.  It just wasn't talked about as much, you know, but it was.  It was--Baltimore [Maryland] was awful, you know, and where--the Mason-Dixon Line, it was supposedly after you crossed that, everything was okay, but I don't think so.  And I had my grandmother's sisters, several of them went to New Jersey to work in very wealthy homes, so they worked for people who had a lot of money, for white people, and they lived in a neighborhood in New Jersey, I think it was Newark [New Jersey] then, that was not a bad neighborhood.  People had very nice homes and--excuse me--all the people who lived there worked, but it was a--certainly a distinction between what white people and what black people and how they lived.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--usually the pattern is South Carolina goes to New York, and--
Speaker 2: D.C. [Washington, D.C.]
Speaker 1: D.C., too (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous0 Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot in D.C.  I have one aunt in D.C., one in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 481846
Speaker 1: What was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: C.A. Johnson [C.A. Johnson High School, Columbia, South Carolina].  It's still there.
Speaker 1: Now, was Perry [W.A. Perry Junior High School; W.A. Perry Middle School, Columbia, South Carolina] or Johnson, I take it they were black people in the neighborhood--in the community that the schools are named after?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now that's often--is there a story behind these people before we move on?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I know that C.A. Johnson was--he was an educator, a principal and the same with Perry, so they were named after educators.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, I take it they may have been the founding principals--
Speaker 2: Yeah, could've been.
Speaker 1: --of those schools.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Maybe.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, so, high school, how many black high schools were in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Two.
Speaker 1: --Columbia [South Carolina]?  Two?
Speaker 2: Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington High School, Columbia, South Carolina] and C.A. Johnson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm glad I asked 'cause I would assume one, but I'm--
Speaker 2: There was two.
Speaker 1: --glad I asked.  There's two, okay.  That speaks to a bigger--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --population then.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Now, how, how many students were in your school, do you--
Speaker 2: I would say, oh, probably a thousand because our graduating class was close to three hundred and Booker T. Washington was the same, so big schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did you kind of--did you kind of focus on a career in high school in the sense of, you know, I'm gonna learn this so I can go to school and do this when I get out or?
Speaker 2: Not really, unh-uh.  I took a lot of, you know, the classes in social studies and involved in a lot of the clubs that did projects and volunteer work in the community, but--and in the choir, yeah.  But not really--it was not really focused on--we all knew we were going to college, so it was--you know, and you go to college and decide what you're gonna major in once you get there.
Speaker 1: Now what was it about social studies that really attracted you?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was just knowing the history of people and also the fact that my family was involved in the community and helping to take care of people, involved in civic activities, so that's probably it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what--well, other than the church, I guess, what other activities were they involved in the--
Speaker 2: In the neighborhood club, organizing the neighborhood, beautifying the neighborhood, planting trees, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother [Junie Martin] and her friends had a book club that--you know, that they would meet and discuss books.  We would have the--some of the meetings at our house.  We were in Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.], so we had Jack and Jill meetings.  And as a part of Jack and Jill, we would go to the ballet and the symphony and the things that ordinarily we wouldn't--black people wouldn't do, but we did a lot of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so--now, were they a part of any political organization, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were all a part of--the churches, I think the NAACP met at the churches and there was another organization my mother was a part of, CORE, Committee on Racial Equality?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Congress of Racial Equality.
Speaker 2: Congress of Racial Equality.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, CORE was supposed to be the militant one--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of the two of them.
Speaker 2: Right.  I remember she had a very good friend from Birmingham [Alabama] who was a part of that who would visit us and we would go to the meetings with her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is when I was older.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 481847
Speaker 1: Now, you were in high school [C.A. Johnson High School, Columbia, South Carolina] when your older brother took part in the sit-ins at A&T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so tell us about--tell us that story.
Speaker 2: My [maternal] grandfather [Will Martin] was scared to death that--you know, he would say, oh, you're gonna get--he's gonna get killed, you know, he should be doing that, it's just terrible.  They were afraid for him.
Speaker 1: So, it wasn't just your brother, it was your cousin, two of the three.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, my first cousin.
Speaker 1: Your first--and what are their names?
Speaker 2: My brother's name was Mark [Mark Martin, Jr.] and my cousin's name is Ronald Martin.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Mark Martin and Ronald Martin.
Speaker 2: And Ronald, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the third fellow was?
Speaker 2: I don't know him [Robert Patterson].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's in the museum in--I think there's a museum in Memphis [Tennessee] that has the--no, the Smithsonian [National Museum of American History, Washington, D.C.] has the actual lunch counter I think, but I think there's also a museum in Memphis that may have a replica of it and the names.  My sister [Christeve Martin Boykin] has visited that museum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I read something--I remember vaguely that a couple of them were science majors or?
Speaker 2: My brother was in electrical engineering, and he went on to get his degree in electrical engineering.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And is there a story about how that happened?  I mean, how did they come to do that at that particular time?
Speaker 2: From what I understand is that there were a lot of students who were just encouraged to go down, and try to get served and it just happened that they sat down and the picture was taken.  That it was not anything that they were chosen to do or that they--you know, that somebody said the three of you do this.  It was just--they just happened to be there when it happened.  Because the drill would be you would go in and everybody would just sit and then people would refuse to serve you, and you knew that that was gonna happen, but you, you know, went anyway.  So, it was just a part of what they were doing as a part of the demonstration.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, they--so, were they the first to do it or were they (simultaneous) --
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know if they--
Speaker 1: But they were one--
Speaker 2: --were the first that--
Speaker 1: --some of the ones that--
Speaker 2: Some--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Some of the first--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were in school when Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] was at A&T and it was--you know, they were organized and there was a lot of demonstrations at A&T, not just A&T, but at a lot of schools around the country as you well know, there were demonstrations going on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you know about it when you were--what they were doing when you were in--well--
Speaker 2: I think I was--I knew about it but I didn't know the significance of it.  I just knew that my grandfather was very upset that he was doing it, but I did not know the significance of it when it was happening.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you get civil rights information on television in Columbia [South Carolina] about--you know, 'cause we--around the country, people were watching this on CBC News, NBC News, 'Huntley-Brinkley' ['The Huntley-Brinkley Report'], and we--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --we could see these things.  And I've heard some people say in the South they didn't even see it on TV (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't recall seeing it on TV as you--now that you mention it, I really don't.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just wondered 'cause it was big on TV in--outside of the South.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  No I don't recall that.
Speaker 1: Okay, just curious (laughter).  Makes you think that someone--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --pulled the plug on it.  But, okay.  So, well--now, did you participate in any demonstrations when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: I did in--at the state house in South Carolina.  I remember our--you know, going in a group and--
Speaker 1: When you were in high school or?
Speaker 2: No, this was when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is later on?
Speaker 2: --I was much younger--probably junior high school [W.A. Perry Junior High School; W.A. Perry Middle School, Columbia, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Probably, you know, back in--you know, in the late '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: So, what was the issue that you all were--
Speaker 2: I don't recall specifically, but I remember--I don't recall the specific demonstration, but I do remember there was unrest related to the lunch counters, related to the waiting rooms at the train station and the bus station, of wanting to make those things change.
Story_ID: 481848
Speaker 1: The segregated schools, I always went to all black schools, but then it was just the beginning of the integration of the schools right as I was graduating from high school and of the university.  Linda Love, my first best friend, was the first black woman who was admitted to the University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina] and went, was--her freshman year there was the first year that blacks were admitted.  That was in 1965.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, that's--yeah, 1965, okay.  What kind of--I mean, did she--was it done in a smooth fashion?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't a big deal.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In fact, when I went to college, I went to North Carolina Central [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University] in Durham [North Carolina] and we would get paid what was state--what was called out of state tuition.  The state would pay the difference between what it would've cost for us to go to the university and what it cost for us to go to North Carolina.  They called it an out of state scholarship, but it was so that you didn't want to go to the university, so they paid you not to go (laughter), not to want to go to the university.  So, part of my tuition was paid by the State of South Carolina.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you graduated from high school [C.A. Johnson High School, Columbia, South Carolina] in forty--
Speaker 1: In '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: Sixty-five [1965].  I'm sorry.  I was calculating and using the date (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, 1965.
Speaker 1: Sixty-five [1965]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and I graduated from North Carolina Central in '69 [1969].
Speaker 2: Now, when you were on the verge of graduating from high school, what did you see as your future career?  Did you--could you foresee what you were going to do?
Speaker 1: Social work or something--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --helping people or psychology.  I thought I wanted to be a psychologist or counselor.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Was there anything about those particular professions that attracted you?  I mean--
Speaker 1: Probably because I saw my family always helping people and just being caretakers.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right, so you went to North Carolina A&T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina]--
Speaker 1: Central.
Speaker 2: I mean, North Carolina Central, okay.
Speaker 1: In Durham, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  And how was that?  Did you--
Speaker 1: It was great.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I had fun.  Still playing (laughter), different kind of play.  Yeah, I enjoyed college.  It was great.  It was fun.  I pledged Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] my sophomore year, so I was involved in the sorority.  We would go to different colleges around in North Carolina, Winston-Salem State [Winston-Salem State College; Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina], A&T, Shaw [Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina], St. Aug [St. Augustine's College; St. Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina], Fayetteville State [Fayetteville State College; Fayetteville State University, Fayetteville, North Carolina], so we would travel around for the sorority activities and for the basketball games and football games, so yeah.
Speaker 2: There are a lot of schools around there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of schools, uh-huh, and not too far from each--in North Carolina.
Speaker 2: Did you ever get a chance to see Earl "The Pearl" [Earl Monroe] play (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, at Winston-Salem State, yeah.  And Walt Frazier, um-hm, yeah, sure did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.  Who else is from around that area?  You know, I know there's probably some other people.
Speaker 1: One of the--what's the guy who was a coach at the Olympics was a track coach at North Carolina Central.  He was very--I can't remember this name.  Walker--was it LeRoy Walker [LeRoy T. Walker]?
Speaker 2: I think you're right.  I think so.  But, I forgot about the track team.  And North Carolina (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: --Central had a--
Speaker 1: Had a--
Speaker 2: --wonderful--
Speaker 1: --phenomenal track team.
Speaker 2: --track team, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and some of the runners were in the Olympics.  I remember that during that time.
Speaker 2: I remember the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can't remember their names.
Speaker 2: --Tigerbelles came out of Tennessee--
Speaker 1: The what?
Speaker 2: --State.  The Tigerbelles from Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah?  The--
Speaker 2: They had like--
Speaker 1: The runners, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Around that time and then--can you remember any of the names of the runners who came out of North Carolina Central?
Speaker 1: No, I can't.  Oh, I can almost see it but I can't think of the names.  One of them was very--Norman [Norman Tate].  His last name [sic.] was Norman I think that went to the Olympics.  But, yeah, a very good track team.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, you were involved in the Deltas and--there was no need to have a black student organization 'cause the whole school was black, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: We all went to the student union--
Story_ID: 481849
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But was there a concern about curriculum?  I know students on campuses started calling for black history and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: There was no concern about that?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, no, not that I recall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there any being taught on campus [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: I think so.  I think it probably was.  I don't--I don't recall specifically, but that was right at the time where Jesse [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] had started Operation Breadbasket in North Carolina, and so there were--you know Howard Fuller?  Well, so, he was--he was there in Durham [North Carolina] and a lot of activism was going on.
Speaker 1: Now, he in--later on became head of the African Liberation Support Committee, I believe, under the name of Owusu Sadaukai.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Owusu.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know he was a--he's a city council member now here or something or was.
Speaker 2: No, he--he's from here and he was superintendent of schools--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for a while, but now he is head of the Institute for the Transformation of Learning [Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], which is very active in the charter schools and charter school education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  All right, so he--well, what was he like in those days, I mean when you--
Speaker 2: Very, very militant, and I didn't--I knew of him there, and when I came here, he was Howard Fuller.  He had gone away from being Owusu and worked for an insurance company and was--you know, had gotten back, you know, and I remember talking about it with him.  He said, "It was survival.  I couldn't get a job with a dashiki on," you know (laughter).  So, but, you know, he's always been very clear about what he believes in.  He worked at Marquette [Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  I think he taught at Marquette for a while.  Now, he's back at Marquette in a different role.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  I know I met him here, must've been fifteen years ago.  He was spinning records.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a deejay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He loved--he still does that at parties sometimes (laughter).
Speaker 1: I was quite surprised (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --it was who I thought it was.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's--
Speaker 1: I didn't know him.  I've just seen him in films.  There's a film about African Liberation Day--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --where he's got a gigantic Afro on--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and he's saying, "We are an African people.  We are," you know, to thousands--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at African Liberation, thousands of people were chanting, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Howard Fuller.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, he was a student there when you were--
Speaker 2: He wasn't a student--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --there.  He lived in Durham.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was married and lived in Durham, but he wasn't a student at Central, I don't think.  I don't know where he went to school.  He went to Case Western [Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio].  I think he was there organizing.  You know, 'cause people would travel around to organize, students and, you know--so, I think that's part of why he was there.
Story_ID: 481850
Speaker 1: I asked about the organizing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --part of it.
Speaker 2: Now, the--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The interesting thing about North Carolina Central [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] was that we had an exchange program with the University of Wisconsin that white students, maybe ten or fifteen a year would come and go to school at North Carolina Central.  And that was the first time that I was in a setting that was--there--was integrated in terms of education.
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever have white teachers before or?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  I had one German teacher at Central who taught German, that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you could go from kindergarten through college in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Never had a white teacher.
Speaker 1: --the Carolinas and never have a white teacher.
Speaker 2: Nope.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this relationship with the University of Wisconsin--
Speaker 2: It was kind of an exchange program.  So, when I was a senior, I was in the honors program at Central, and we were recruited by the university.  They sent a black guy to talk with the students about coming to the University of Wisconsin.  Because I wanted to go to grad school, and I thought about going to Atlanta [Georgia], I thought about going to Michigan, and the University of Wisconsin scholarship was much more attractive.  We had full scholarships.  It was from the National Institute of Mental Health that included your tuition and a stipend.  And I had never been to Wisconsin, didn't know anything about it, but there were students recruited from black schools in North Carolina: A&T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], St. Aug [St. Augustine's College; St. Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina], Bennett [Bennett College, Greensboro, North Carolina].  So we came in as a cohort.  There were thirteen of us that came in together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's 1971.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1971.  Okay.  All right.  So, what were your first impressions of Milwaukee [Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: When I got off the plane I thought I was in the wrong airport 'cause I didn't see any black people.  I said, "Oh my god (laughter), there must be another airport that I should've been there (background noise) because I don't see any black people here."
Story_ID: 481851
Speaker 1: Well, tell us now, what--your first impression was no black people here and--
Speaker 2: No black people.
Speaker 1: Now, you went to Madison [Wisconsin], right?
Speaker 2: No, here, in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was it here?  Oh, Milwaukee.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This was in Milwaukee, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this is UWM [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: UWM, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And there were thirteen black students that came in together.  There were no dormitories.  And the school had asked people who lived in the communities around the university if they would take students into their home who were coming to the city until they found a place to live or a roommate, et cetera.  So, I was placed with a Jewish family in an all-white suburb, placed in terms of this is--you know, they had a--this family had indicated an interest in having a student live with them.  And the fam- and George--their names were George [George Gay] and Evelyn Gay.  And they had always had opened their homes to field--American Field Service [AFS Intercultural Programs] students who were from other countries and came to high school here, so it was not unusual for them to have, you know, someone live with them.  And they were a wonderful couple that became my family here.  They were Jewish.  I didn't know anything about Jewish people because in the South, we didn't--the only thing I knew about Jewish people was the man who owned the clothing store that you talked about.  But, I didn't know anything about the Jewish culture, religion, the food.  So we--and they had never had a black student stay with them.  They had had, you know, Hispanic or Peruvian, but not anyone from the South.  So, we really learned a lot from each other, really just loved and respected each other, and I had a wonderful time with them.  I only stayed with them three months because then we as students got roommates and got apartments, and they really became my family here, a part of my family here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was your course of study--well, I mean, did--well, let me go back to that for a minute and just ask you, did the black community make differentiations between different white people in Columbia [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I remember growing up in a black community and we didn't--we saw them as white.
Speaker 2: Right, that was it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and very--
Speaker 2: Ate the same food, you know, yeah.  That was--you were either black or white.  That was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that was foreign to me when I came here.
Speaker 1: So did it kind of open up a--I guess a perspective in your mind about the different kinds of white ethnics and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I learned that here.  I didn't learn that in South Carolina.  I learned that after I got to Wisconsin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Polish, German, I learned all that here, even Italian.  I didn't know the difference (laughter), yeah.
Story_ID: 481852
Speaker 1: Now, your focus was sociology and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, social work.
Speaker 1: Social work and--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, and community organizing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And we were talking off camera about the community--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --organizing portion.  Now, social work, most people are familiar with that, what that means, but community organizing, there's a lot of confusion about it.  Do you have any way that you can explain what it is to us and so we might know?
Speaker 2: What my focus was on--getting people, communities, to support an idea, an issue, and to get people collectively to do that together, force in numbers, coming together to discuss a policy and what we as a group can do to change it or to make it happen.  So, it was bringing people together for a common cause.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, our current president was a former community organizer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: President-elect, anyway, Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], and it's often, you know, spoken about as if it's just somebody walking around the neighborhood or something (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, I mean, it's not given a lot of respect necessarily.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: But it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well because, I guess people think anybody can do it, that you don't have to have a degree to do it, but you do have to have skills in talking with people, explaining things.  You have to be able to analyze communities to know where the leaders are if you want to go to the leaders.  So, you do have to have some knowledge, I think.
Speaker 1: There's a training process, right, to do that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  I was a part of an organization called the Organization of Organizations, triple O, and that's what we did.  We brought different organizations together to mobilize them around issues.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I think you were telling me, too, that the triple O was based on the philosophy of Saul Alinsky.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Saul Alinsky--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and community organizing, of bringing people together and respecting that there are differences, but we can come together for a common issue that we're concerned about.  A lot of organizing during that time, it was right after all of the civil rights demonstrations, and there was Model Cities, which was government funded money to try to rebuild communities, and building communities, not just houses, but communities so that people live together and collectively for--you know, for good causes.
Speaker 1: Right.  Model Cities was an initiative of the Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] administration--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --I believe.
Speaker 2: Now, we were one--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --of the sites for it.  There was a huge Model Cities project here.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was still--and it lingered after Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] took over as well but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was around for a while, yeah.
Speaker 1: He had something called revenue sharing or something that--where he would--
Speaker 2: Now, that I'm not familiar with.
Speaker 1: --give money to the--through city agencies to do different community action projects and such.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What was that, CETA employees and all that--
Speaker 2: Comprehensive Employment Training Act.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  That was the money to get job training programs for people.  And then after that it was JTPA, Joint Training Partnership Act [sic. Job Training Partnership Act of 1982] or something.  But, yeah, all of those, what they called the poverty programs.  Those were around that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I remember even though it was a Republican administration, they had a lot of programs.  There were just lots of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 481853
Speaker 1: What issues did triple O [Organization of Organizations] identify in the community and how did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A lot of it--
Speaker 1: What role did you play?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Some of it was around--this was right during the time when there was busing starting in Milwaukee [Wisconsin], where the schools were becoming integrated and children were being bused from the black community to the outlying areas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, we start off with a segregated Milwaukee, black--all-black schools, all-white schools or for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All black housing.
Speaker 1: For the most part, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, de facto segregation.
Speaker 1: And so the busing was designed to bus all--it's always usually to bus black kids to--
Speaker 2: To the white areas.
Speaker 1: --white schools.
Speaker 2: To the outside area, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so were they welcomed with open arms?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  Nope (laughter).  No.  So, a lot of the organization was the parents who were concerned about it, who were upset about it and demanding that the children be treated respectfully and, you know, watching what was happening, making sure that the children weren't, you know, treated poorly.  But, the issue was always the busing.  Kids would have to catch buses 6:30, 6:00, 6:30 in the morning to go way away from the neighborhood and then come back later in the afternoon.  So, it was really organizing around protecting the children.  You know, so, are we going to let this happen?  Well, then you need to get involved in the schools.  If that's where your kid goes to school, this is what you need to do, organizing mothers to be involved in their children's education.  If they, you know--so, yeah, it was a lot of organizing churches to have after-school programs for kids and trying to maintain communities, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what were some of the challenges with--now, you mentioned--okay, black children having to get up earlier to be bused--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to another school and they go into a setting that's not necessarily the friendliest one in the world and they're expected to learn--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at a level that may be different from the level they were being taught at by teachers who were not necessarily from their own community.
Speaker 2: And who didn't want them there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And then they get back later--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and with more homework than they had before and--
Speaker 2: And then you couldn't be in the Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America], you couldn't be on the sports teams, you couldn't be--you know, if you got sick at school, your parents live way on the other side of town.  They couldn't come and get you.  So, it just really changed the culture of education, you know, of what--the culture of how it worked.
Speaker 1: At the same time, though, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] is saying that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We want--
Speaker 1: --is for the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --betterment--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of the black community.  We need to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Our tax money is being used to support these other--we need to go over there and take advantage of these laboratories--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and other facilities and things that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --we don't have.
Speaker 2: But when you think about it, I personally believe that that was part of the beginning of the demise of the fibers of our community because you got angry kids then, you know, angry at their parents, like why are you doing this to me?  Why are you sending me away to somewhere I don't want to go and they don't want me there?  And the parents thinking they're doing the right thing.  And like you said, the NAACP is saying that's what we should be doing.  So, I really believe, and this is my social work hat, I believe that this is when we started to see more of youth involved in violence, more youth with learning disabilities, dropping out of school.  We have, in Milwaukee, the highest school dropout rate for black children in the nation.  It's 50 percent, which is to me, you know, criminal.  But the--I believe that's when it started and why it started.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.  Milwaukee has the highest rate.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  For--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: For African Americans, 50 percent.
Speaker 1: So what was--were there specific issues at the time that the leaders raised that you organized with triple O that they--what did they want from this?
Speaker 2: Well, it was almost like a Catch-22 because it was what you thought you had been fighting for and now you got it and it's not good, so (laughter) what are you going to do about it?  You try to make the best of it by keeping people aware of what was happening, you know, making--trying to get the parents involved in the schools, trying to get the politicians to make sure that, you know, the laws were being followed.  So, yeah, it was--the issue of education, and that's what triple O spent a lot of time on, the issue of equal education and what was happening with busing.  I mean, it was one of the first groups to say this is not right.  This--we shouldn't be doing this to our children.  But, of course, we're fighting against the NAACP if we say that, right?  So, it was kind of a militant--not militant, but not traditional, non-traditional approach.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know later on some of the reactions in the black community are in the form of independent schools, charter (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There were a few.
Speaker 1: --schools.  I know a lot of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we were actively involved in one of the first ones that started here, Harambee Community School [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] for--just for that reason.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 481854
Speaker 1: --As a college student, though, I mean as a grad student then, you got--so, you're organizing with triple O [Organization of Organizations] and then the other aspect of what you're doing is social work and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.  I was very active in the student association on campus, very active and I went--would travel to other colleges.  There were--associations of students, the student associations in social work.  We would go to other schools for trainings, for conferences, et cetera.  But like you--we were talking about, there was no black student union at UWM [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] at that time.  We blended with--in the school of social work [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Social Welfare; Helen Bader School of Social Welfare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] it was very diverse.  That was where I met my first white friend, where it was the first time I hung out with white people, socialized with, went out, you know, hung out with.  So, it was not a negative experience at all in terms of separation of races.  We were certainly in the minority.  There were few of us, but there were a lot of things going on, on campus.  I remember Jesse [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] coming to campus because it was still--you know, still the civil rights era.  I remember Charles Evers, Medgar Evers' brother, you know, on the speaking circuit.  And so it was a lot still going on--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --during that time, '69 [1969] to '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, yeah, that was a--yeah, it was a lot of--I know that's a time when most of the black student organizations were being formed on campuses around the country.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you know Tejumola [Tejumola Ologboni] out here in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Milwaukee [Wisconsin]?  Now, was he--
Speaker 2: His name was Rockie Taylor then.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: We used to hang out at the bar together (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He's a well-known storyteller and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Storyteller.
Speaker 1: --community activist.
Speaker 2: Yep, um-hm.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was around.  We were--he wasn't around in that sense.  He was--he grew up in Milwaukee, so everybody knew him as Rockie.
Speaker 1: Didn't he teach at UWM at, at some point or, or--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: 'Cause someone we interviewed was talking about him as a teacher and a mentor.
Speaker 2: He may have.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But, I'm not familiar with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, Rockie Taylor, right, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, that was his name.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Okay.  So--well, so at the end of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Like Osha's [ph.] name was Fred Brown [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, so they all had--they changed--you know, they assumed their other identity.
Speaker 1: Now, do you know much about how the African movement here got started or the--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: --or the--
Speaker 2: See, and I didn't know--I was not really involved in the Milwaukee community socially until after I got out of school and--but yeah, we were here.  We were on campus.  We were hanging out with student--you know, with the group of us that came together.  We--that became our family, you know, because we came into the school together and knew each other from when we first got here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, so well, what was your thesis about when you got your degree?
Speaker 2: It was about organizing and around churches, organizing churches to have programs for kids, what it took to get churches together to support kids in their community and looking at the different churches, the smaller ones, the larger ones, the storefront churches in the neighborhood and how you could get programs in the community for children using the churches.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have any particular mentors or teachers that really were special to you when--during that grad period?
Speaker 2: Not really, unh-uh, no.
Story_ID: 481855
Speaker 1: When you got your degree [from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], I mean, did you--did you go immediately back to Columbia [South Carolina] or did you--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  I had a job when I got out of school here working for the department--it was then called the Department of Public Welfare [Wisconsin Department of Public Welfare; Wisconsin Department of Health Services], and I was hired before I graduated.  So I had a job and it made sense to stay here since I had a job.  And that's when I met--my first day at work, I met Lydia Brown [ph.] and I came in to work the same day together, and we were hired to investigate child abuse.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: We were child abuse investigators.
Speaker 1: Lydia Brown, she was at one time a coordinator of the Midwest African American Theatre Alliance [sic.] and did a lot of cultural things and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --now living in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Lives in Chicago, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But, so you all started the same day, that right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yep.  We were friends, have been friends since.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And the investigating child abuse was very--I never really knew about child abuse or about, you know, how children were hurt and killed as a result of abuse and neglect, so that was a rude awakening to me.  And one of my first experiences was because we would go all over the city.  We would get a complaint and, you know, if it landed with you, you had to go out to the home to investigate.  And I remember Lydia and I going into a trailer park on the South Side of Milwaukee [Wisconsin], and this was going to obviously be a white family.  And I remember the woman opening the door and saying, "I'm not letting any jungle bunnies in my house.  What are you all doing here?"  (Laughter) I looked at Lydia, I said, "What's a jungle bunny?"  (Laughter) 'Cause I had never heard that before.  She said I'll--she said, "I'll tell you when we get in the car, but I'm not going in there either."  So, we were clear with our supervisors that we did not want to go into the white community to try to investigate child abuse, you know.
Speaker 1: Because another issue pops up.  I mean, the issue of who you are is more (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --gets more important than what you're trying to do.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Is that what you--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, I'm--and I was like, well I don't want to come in your house either (laughter), you know, if you don't want me there and I don't want to be there.  So, yeah, that was one--that was my rude awakening to--one of my rude awakenings to--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: See, Milwaukee was very segregated in terms of housing.  You didn't--black people did not live across the viaduct [16th Street Bridge].  The dividing line was the river [Menomonee River], the South Side and North Side, very distinct, very distinct.
Speaker 1: Now that's--it's basically the same way in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But some might argue and say, well, why not be a pioneer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --and go over there and integrate that--I mean--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and, and walk in that community with your head up and do your job, and--you know, what does it--well, what would you say to those people and what--
Speaker 2: I would say it's dangerous.  I'm not gonna put myself in harm's way for people (laughter) who don't want me there.  It wasn't--no.  It wasn't about that for me.  I was not gonna try to integrate Milwaukee, you know.  I cared more about what was happening with my people, the children who were in black homes.  I wanted to help them.  That was more important to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so what did the department say to that?  Did they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They und--
Speaker 1: --say well--
Speaker 2: They said okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They understood.  They knew what was happening because it--you know, we have white people on the team.  I said send them over there (laughter), you know.  I don't need to go.
Story_ID: 481856
Speaker 1: In Chicago [Illinois], there are stories as recently as just a couple years ago where black kids had gone under the wrong viaduct and been beaten senseless and put in the hospital with brain (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --injuries and such.  But it--is that--did you have such stories in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] about that kind of thing or?
Speaker 2: You know, probably so, but I don't recall specifics of them, but I'm sure that that happened, may happen now, but I don't remember the specifics of any of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I just remember that this city, there was a man named Father Groppi [James Groppi] who was a big community organizer who everybody--he--and that was--his march across the viaduct [16th Street Bridge] was to say, now we're integrated.  You can come over here.  You know, you don't have to be afraid.
Speaker 1: Now, he's a white Catholic priest--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, white Catholic priest.
Speaker 1: --that is very famous for working with [HistoryMaker] Vel Phillips.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: You know, when we interviewed her, she discussed--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Father Groppi.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.  That was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He was a part of triple O [Organization of Organizations].  He was one of our teachers at triple O.  So, yeah that was during that time.
Speaker 1: Did, did you know him, get a chance to know him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, not know him personally, but knew his work, was in meetings and classes with him, yeah.
Speaker 1: I know he is always referred to as a brave man.
Speaker 2: Very brave, who was one--who--the march was across the viaduct to say, "We're coming over here."  I'm--black people can come over here (laughter), you know.  That was his march.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But as, as I read his story, Milwaukee must be a tough nut to crack 'cause he eventually ended up driving a bus.  He left the priesthood and was--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, he did, yeah.
Speaker 1: And was kind of disgusted with how some things worked out.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Milwaukee is tough.  It was--I mean, just the way the city is divided by housing.  It's only been in the last I think ten or fifteen years where black people have started going to the South Side [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] to live because it was just like--I don't even know the streets over there.  I don't go over there.  You know, you don't cross the viaduct.  That was just the way it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: So you were organizing on the North Side of Milwaukee [Wisconsin], the black (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --part of town?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, were you still investigating cases of child abuse?
Speaker 2: That was when I got out of graduate school [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was my first job, was investigating child abuse, yeah, and mostly in the central city and the North Side.  But, again, that was a very rude awakening to me of poverty, very different than in the South, I think.  The things that I saw, I had never seen before.
Speaker 1: Like what, for instance?
Speaker 2: The level of poverty, how people lived, homes where there was no food, where, you know, people were living in actual squalor and kids were neglected, didn't have food to eat, you know.  I--there are poor people in the South, but I never saw that level of poverty and mistreatment of children before, so that was a rude awakening to me of kind of a difference.  And I was thinking, some friends and I were talking about growing up.  In the South, everybody lived in a house and had a yard--a yard.  People didn't live in high-rise apartments or--the projects were one level, you know, maybe three or four units joined together.  But, I think the difference was people were more independent but connected.  There were neighborhoods where, like I said, my family--people--no child would go without food because people were around you that knew if you were poor, you lost your job, they were going to help you.  So, I had never seen the kind of poverty and mistreatment of children before I came here.  That was new.  And that was really kind of the motivation for starting the agency [New Concept Self Development Center, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Now, what was your analysis of I guess the child abuse problem?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was before crack cocaine, so it was some drugs, but not real prevalent.  It was poverty and it was frustration, not having--people were most often referred for child neglect, children who came to school with, you know, very dirty clothes or who--the abuse was I would say maybe 20 percent of the time, but neglect because of poverty was more prevalent.
Story_ID: 481858
Speaker 1: So how many years did you deal with the child abuse issue?
Speaker 2: I did that for two years and then went into management after that, into--
Speaker 1: Now, how do you deal with the depression of that?  I mean, it seemed like that to see a lot of that first hand would just--
Speaker 2: Well, the--what we would try to do for--when it related to poverty was to get the resources in, to get clothes and food.  And when there was abuse, we had to take some children away from their parents.  You know, you can't have this child because you have hurt him.  And put children in foster care or receiving homes.  Those are decisions that had to be made.  And it was always whatever you need to do in the best interest of the child.  That was the driving principle.  This child is vulnerable, and you have to make your decision in the best interest of the child.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was it.
Speaker 1: So, you, you went into administration around--this was about 1973, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Into my--you, you can't do the child abuse thing too long in my opinion.  Two years was enough.  And people would come in and out of there every two or three years 'cause you can't do that forever.  So, I went into quality assurance for contracts that the department [Wisconsin Department of Public Welfare; Wisconsin Department of Health Services] had and then I went into family counseling, and then left to start New Concept [New Concept Self Development Center, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] in 1975.
Story_ID: 481859
Speaker 1: What prompted the beginning of New Concept [New Concept Self Development Center, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: This is New Concept Self Development Center.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Part of it was some of the things that I realized that were happening with the child abuse was parents who were beating their children to punish them and--out of frustration and they didn't know how to parent their children.  Now, I got whippings when I was growing up with a little switch, you know, on my legs, but I never got a beating.  But, people were beating their children with extension cords, and it was out of frustration.  So, there was an opportunity to start--also as a mental health, part of my social work training was in mental health.  That was my secondary major [at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], so I was a licensed therapist as well as community organizer.  So, you could get Title XIX [Title XIX of the Social Security Act] reimbursement during that time.  It had just started that social workers could be reimbursed for providing counseling to families who were on medical assistance with Title XIX.  So, you could set up a private practice, and anybody who had Title XIX on medical assistance, you could provide counseling to them.  So, the focus was to provide counseling and parenting to families who--so that they wouldn't hurt their children, so that they could parent them properly and not beat them so that they would be taken away from them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, how did that, you know--how was that received by the parents?
Speaker 2: Many of them, very well because they really wanted help, but they just didn't know what to do.  You know, very young--a lot of young mothers, single mothers who were just frustrated and just, you know--and the law says you can't beat your children.  Now down south, they were raised and probably got beatings and, you know, but you can't do that.  So, teaching them alternatives to pun- you know, to beating your children, parenting skills is what we started doing.
Speaker 1: I know there are a number of a people in the black community that defend the right to beat their children or to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --whoop them or whatever they want to say.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Sometimes it is--and this means various things to people.  You--
Speaker 2: It does mean--
Speaker 1: --you described a--could be a switching--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or it could be a smack on the hand or--
Speaker 2: That.
Speaker 1: --it could be hitting you with an ironing cord or with the iron itself, you know--
Speaker 2: Well (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: --depending on what people are--
Speaker 2: Yeah, people have done all of that.  And it still is, you know--I personally think it goes back from slavery.  We were beat into submission and beat to--you know, to--made to obey.  That's a part of how we were controlled.  It's a control.  You beat people and you can control them, but that doesn't work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: So you think it's--actually goes all the way back to--
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: --the slave experience?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's how we were controlled, you know.  That's, that's a part of our history.  And I don't know if--you know, I'm sure that white people beat their kids, too, but that was a part of our heritage (laughter), you know, not a good part, but it's still there.  That's what happened to us.
Story_ID: 481860
Speaker 1: So, what are some of the alternative ways that you would teach parents?  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, let me get this straight.  The parents then would--if they're--if they are, I guess, caught beating their children--or accused of it, are--would be sent to various agencies to learn alternative (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Alternatives.
Speaker 1: --ways by the court?
Speaker 2: If it wasn't--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: If the children were not removed--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from the home, then they could go to counseling as a condition of being able to keep the children.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your agency [New Concept Self Development Center, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] provided the counseling that the court would--
Speaker 2: Would--yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --prescribe.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.  And also, I was able to get contracts with the Department of Public Welfare [Wisconsin Department of Public Welfare; Wisconsin Department of Health Services] to service some of their clients, children who are returning from foster care to provide counseling to them and their family.  So, there was an opportunity to contract with various agencies, the Department of Public Welfare, to provide counseling to teen moms as well.
Speaker 1: Now, before you started, was there any other agencies providing any services at all or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were a few--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that started around the same time.  None of them lasted.  I think the difference is that we started as a nonprofit and we were able to then become a United Way [United Way Worldwide] agency and expand as a nonprofit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So what would you advise a parent who came in with this problem of beating their children?
Speaker 2: A lot of times, it was out of frustration because of the children's behavior, of discipline.  How do you discipline your children?  I mean, and everybody who's had children, you've got to figure out the best way to control your children, to get them to do what you want.  I had two children [Crystal Perry (ph.) and Kevin Perry (ph.)] and I did not beat them.  I punished them, but I didn't beat them.  The one or two times that I hit my children, it was out of my frustration.  If I was--I was just angry.  I just didn't know what to do.  I probably would've hit you if you had (laughter) done the same thing (laughter).  But it--that's what happens.  You hit people when you're angry or you're frustrated, so how to control your anger, how to use timeout, how to--you know, what I used as a parent was, my children loved me dearly and I would say then, you can't be with me for the day.  I won't talk to you.  I can't--you can't be in my presence today because you know, and that would hurt them.  You know, they didn't want that to happen because they knew if mommy didn't--if she didn't want to see me, then I must've really done something bad.  There's no magic bullet to be a good parent or discipline your children.  My daughter has a--I have a twenty-one-month-old grandson and he is--he has to be disciplined, you know.  He has a timeout chair here and a timeout chair at home, and if he has a tantrum, he just has it and we just walk over him and ignore him.  You have to--there are different ways that you control different children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And is it--I suppose it would be--it seems to me it would be tough to--if you've raised your child to a certain point.  Say they're ten years old and all you've done is beat them when you got angry at them, how do you change course at that point?
Speaker 2: You have to start early, you really do, as early as--you know, from--when kids are born.  They have--they're--you're gonna need to manage their behavior.
Story_ID: 481861
Speaker 1: But that's why I say, Larry [Larry Crowe], I really believe that when you--when your children are away from you in a school setting or out of their neighborhood and a comfort zone where they feel safe, they are gonna react.  They're gonna be defensive, they're gonna be angry, and I really believe that we need--that's why the schools--that we get our kids back--you know, we can have more control over what happens to them, not to say that charter and private schools are the answer to, you know, the bad things that are happening with kids, but I believe that children who are educated in those schools have less disruptive and violent behavior than kids who are in public school.
Speaker 2: And that's because of--
Speaker 1: They're being taught by people who want to teach them, who want them there, who are there because they want to be there (laughter), you know.  And I used to say, related to the Milwaukee Public Schools system [MPS], if teachers who taught in the public school system had to send their children to the public school system, you would have a lot better classes, better teachers.  Most of the teachers who teach at Milwaukee Public Schools system do not send their kids to those schools.
Speaker 2: And to put that in perspective, the integration move with the busing--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --after it got--I guess it's true in every city, correct me if I'm wrong.  In Milwaukee [Wisconsin], like every place else, once it got underway, why students left the public schools (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --completely and now--
Speaker 1: Our, our school system is predominantly black.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it's--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Ninety some percent black.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And the white--
Speaker 1: But the teachers aren't.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You know.
Speaker 2: The teachers are--
Speaker 1: But their--and their kids don't go to those schools.  Even the black teachers' kids in Milwaukee Public Schools, their kids don't go to Milwaukee Public Schools, and I would always say, when I was very active in the community and involved in, you know, education and advocacy.  People who work at General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] do not buy Toyotas, so if you can't use the product that you're making, then you don't need to be there.  You're not gonna see a Toyota on a General Motors parking lot where people work, so why can't you make the people who are working for MPS send their kids there?  If they don't want to do that, then there's something wrong.
Speaker 2: So, yeah, that's quite a--yeah, quite a problem.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 2: It's not an easy one to solve I guess.
Speaker 1: Unh-uh.
Story_ID: 481862
Speaker 1: Now, you added other components to what you were doing [at New Concept Self Development Center, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  I think you at some point started trying to teach young ladies (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, to--
Speaker 1: --before they became mothers--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the values that you--
Speaker 2: Mentoring.  We started a--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --mentoring program in 1972--no, it wasn't--it was eighty--1982 in the housing project called Each One Reach One, where my friends, women who were my friends, became mentors to young girls who lived in the projects.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was the first mentoring program in the city.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, where did you get the idea for that?
Speaker 2: We had an office in the housing project, and girls would come in to the office and they would always want to be around us, who were working, you know, "You dress so pretty, you look so pretty," you know.  "I want to be like you."  But that didn't mean that they had a bad mother, it meant that they wanted to be around women who were different than they were used to.  So, my idea was, okay, well, so I have a friend who does--who, you know, all of my friends were working women.  So, maybe if you spend some time with us, you can see what it takes to be like this.  So I brought together a group of my friends to say, are you willing to just spend some time with a young girl, just to show--take her to your job, show her what you do and talk to her about what it takes to do that?  You've got to go to school, you've got to go to college, you've got to have an education.  Not to say that your mother, the girl's mother is bad, but this is different than what she's used to and maybe you can motivate her to do that.  So, that's how it started.  And I was able--I wrote a grant and got some funding from United Way [United Way Worldwide] to get it started.  That's what--that's how it got started.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And it's still going on now?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what are some of your success stories?
Speaker 2: The success stories are the girls who come back to be mentors themselves, you know.  And there are a lot of them who realize the benefit.  I often have young women say, "You don't remember me but, I was in Each One Reach One, and that was--you know, that was the turning point.  I really met somebody."  And some of the mentors are still connected with the girls who are now women because they developed a relationship.  So, it's--most of the girls did not get pregnant, they didn't drop out of school.  We weren't doing a scientific evaluation back then of keeping data.  But you could tell that it made a difference.  And the mothers knew that it made a difference, and they appreciated it.  And I always--my approach to mentoring was always to allow the parents to meet the mentor first and approve of their daughter spending time with that person because I wouldn't let my child go off with somebody they never met--that I didn't know, you know.  And I remember people starting mentoring programs and they were going to just put these kids with, you know, people that they--the parents had never met and I would always say, "Well then do that to your child.  Send your kid out there to somebody that you don't know and let them take them to the basketball game.  You're not gonna do that."  So, respect for the parents was always very important for me.  That was where you started, to get their permission.  Just like I--you, you got to have my permission.  I'm not gonna let some unknown person show up at my door, "Hi, I'm your kid's mentor, we're going to the basketball game."  I don't think so (laughter), you know.  So, that was a part of the premise, too.
Speaker 1: So, were most of the mothers then--they--did they become interested in what was going on, too?
Speaker 2: Some of them developed relationships with the mentors and some--you know, some of them you would have to be careful because some of them became jealous of the mentors because they--the girls would love to go with them.  So, you had to manage the relationships, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, did--was there anything--was there any program started for young men?
Speaker 2: We eventually added boys.  It started off with young girls, but then we eventually added boys.  We started off with girls ten and older and realized that was too late, so we lowered the age to seven because the younger the better, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What age do the boys start?
Speaker 2: Seven.
Speaker 1: Seven?
Speaker 2: Start at seven.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: About how many have gone through the program--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --would you think?
Speaker 2: It was about probably fifty or sixty a year and you're talking about over the last twenty, twenty-five years.  It's changed significantly.  We don't--not in the housing project anymore.  It's based out of a community center and sometimes we go into the schools.  The mentors will go to the schools, to the after school programs.  So, times have changed and you have to change, you know, with the times.  There are a lot more mentoring programs now.  The--before I left--you know, kind of set before I retired, I developed a model of mentoring for children whose parents are incarcerated to help them have a positive relationship with an adult because they had a parent whose incarcerated, and trying to keep them out of trouble, so to break that pattern of incarceration.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause it--did you often find in those days that people--and even now, I guess, that people who are incarcerated, their children end up in the same (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: --situation?
Speaker 2: That's why we--yeah.  That's, that's true.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, unfortunately.
Story_ID: 481863
Speaker 1: Was community organizing a part of New Concept Self Development Center [New Concept Self Development Center, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] at all (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Pro- yeah.  In, in the sense that I was always very active in coalition building and in organizing agencies around issues, teen pregnancy, violence prevention, parenting, getting people together for a common cause to develop program models for the community, yeah.  So my skills transferred into that arena, and heading task forces and involved in--with the mayor's commission on crime and organizing people around issues, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Okay, so what other programs came out of New Concept Self Development Center?
Speaker 2: God, so many.
Speaker 1: I probably have a list here, but (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, you got a list?
Speaker 1: I think so.  I--maybe I'll ask you about some and you can just tell--
Speaker 2: Okay 'cause, God, it's been so long.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, okay.  What about--tell us about the Blue Ribbon Report for Teen Pregnancy Prevention.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in 1985, Milwaukee [Wisconsin] had the distinction of being--having the highest rate of teen pregnancy in the nation for black girls, and I decided to try to find out why and what could be done.  So, I went to a foundation and got a grant to put together a panel of community leaders to come up with a plan of what could be done about reducing teen pregnancy.  And it was the first time that Planned Parenthood [Planned Parenthood Federation of America] and Catholic priests came in the same room together because they were so far apart on birth control and pro-life.  But, I chaired the commission for a--over the period of a year.  We had meetings and took testimony and developed a plan of what needed to be done to prevent teen pregnancy.  And it was used by the governor and by our legislators for--to determine what policies needed to develop and what funding was available.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, it says here also that New Concept developed the first prenatal--
Speaker 2: Prenatal.
Speaker 1: --care program in 1990.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was going in--when a young girl was pregnant, going into her home to make sure that she got involved in prenatal care so that she would have a healthy baby, and showing that that made a difference in the birth weight of the baby.  And as a result of that project being effective, it was included as a benefit under the Title XIX [Title XIX of the Social Security Act] Medicaid program, so it still exists, and other people are--can be certified to provide that service.
Speaker 1: Do you have any--what was, I guess, your ideas about why so many black girls in Milwaukee were getting pregnant at the--at that time?
Speaker 2: They didn't have a reason not to.  If you know that you're gonna go to college, that you know that you have a bright future, you're probably not gonna risk it.  But if you don't have any future and you know back then if you got pregnant you could get on welfare, you could get a check, you could get food stamps, you had insurance, why not?
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: But if you know that if you stay in school and don't get pregnant, you're gonna go to college and you're gonna have a job and you're gonna do well, then the chances are you won't.  So it's having a reason not to get pregnant was what was missing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what about the fathers resource center [George M. Sanders Father's Family Resource Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, I'm working with teen moms, I realized that a lot of times the dads wanted to be involved but didn't know how to be involved or didn't know what to do, so we created a fathers resource center for dads to be able to come and bring their children to get parenting skills about, you know, raising kids and also to help them find a job and try to help them build a healthy family life.
Story_ID: 481864
Speaker 1: Let's see, it says here that in 1996, New Concept [New Concept Self Development Center, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] began working on its succession plan, anticipating the retirement of yourself (laughter).
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yep.
Speaker 1: So you started that early doing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --doing this?  So, you had--you didn't have ambitions to be the director of this forever or to--
Speaker 2: I was, forever.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: Thirty-two years is a forever (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, what I mean by--you know, often, in the black community and in the white community, too, you see people who ascend to the head of something and it's successful--
Speaker 2: And they don't want to go.
Speaker 1: They're never going anywhere.  You know, I mean it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I used to think like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But, you know, after being there for so long, I realized that I didn't--I was doing the same thing over and over and I didn't want to continue to do it.  And also, I believe that new--I always trained people who worked for me and gave them the skills that I had to try to transfer my skills because I would say, I'm the director.  I will be here for a while.  If you want to be the director, it can't be here, so let's give you the skills so that maybe you can go somewhere else and be the director.  So, I always did that.  And, but after twenty-five--I remember our twenty-fifth anniversary in 2000, I was like, so I've been doing this twenty-five years.  That's enough, you know.  Somebody else needs to do this.  Before that, I started thinking about training someone to take over but still being there in a different capacity.  But then I changed my mind after trying that because that's not good in my opinion.  If you're gonna move on, you need to move out so that the person who's coming in can do it the way they want to.  So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: So, we started in '96 [1996], thinking about the fact that it needed to be done, but actually putting a plan in place to do it came later.
Speaker 1: So, am I to take it that the leadership for the organization came from within--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I mean, and you start identifying individuals who are already--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I created an executive internship program--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --internally to say to my top managers, if you think you want to be director or associate director, you can work along with me for six weeks to see exactly what I do.  You can go to meetings with me, you got to be able to turn the lights on, turn them off, you got to write grants when I'm writing.  So, you're gonna learn what this job is really like and you may want to do it or you may not.  So, I trained--there were five people who went through it with me.  Two of them decided that was not what they wanted to do because that's--it's hard work.  Three of them said that they wanted to do the job.  One of them got a job at another agency and the person who was eventually selected was one of the--one of the interns that I had trained.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it worked out.  It worked.
Speaker 2: It worked out, yeah.
Story_ID: 481865
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about the First Time Juvenile Offenders Program.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was a program that was--
Speaker 1: That's '97 [1997].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Was created for young people who--their first offense coming into children's court and it--probably for girls, it was shoplifting, for boys, it was petty theft or party to a crime, you know, riding in a stolen car.  And the premise being that if you catch them with the first offense, you can probably prevent further offenses if you intervene.  You keep them from getting locked up, and it's been very successful.  It includes tutoring, after school programs, mentors, counseling, a lot of support services to keep them out of trouble.
Speaker 1: What percentage of them actually show up for these things?
Speaker 2: They--it was mandatory.  It was like, either you do this or you're going to be put in children's court.  So, 95 percent went.  They--and we would go to the school, meet them after school.  You had to--it was not you just sitting back and waiting on them to show up.  This--but it was very successful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And, so is there like a recidivism rate or something?
Speaker 2: We were able to prevent the re-arrest of at least 80 percent of the kids--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and to keep them from being incarcerated.  And I used to always say, it cost fifty or sixty thousand dollars a year to lock one kid up.  You could spend 150 and keep a hundred out, so it's very effective in preventing incarceration.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, now, tell us about the Enrichment Institute School.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I had a fellowship with--do you know who Bill Strickland is in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the concept of social entrepreneurship and a fellowship to develop a model of social entrepreneurship with Bill Strickland and Manchester Craftsmen's Guild, which is in Pittsburgh, using the skills that you have to--in an entrepreneurial way.  And my approach was to sell the services that New Concept [New Concept Self Development Center, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] offered to charter schools, counseling, support for parents because they needed those services, but rather than hiring a social worker, we offered the services to them on a fee-for-service basis.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, that year, you also won the Sacajawea Trailblazer Award.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, from Professional Dimensions, which is a professional women's group here in Milwaukee [Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, there's some appreciation for what you're doing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Two thousand [2000], the twenty-fifth anniversary as you said, received the Women of Influence award for the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From the Business Journal [Milwaukee Business Journal].
Speaker 1: Yeah, from the Business Journal.  Two thousand year [2000], Mentor of the Year award--
Story_ID: 481866
Speaker 1: Before we broke, I was trying to think of the story that--well, [HistoryMaker] James Causey at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel was telling us a story about some kids as--some as young as ten beat a thirty-year-old man to death in 2002--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a mob of kids because he had hit--he hit one little kid in the mouth, knocked his tooth out, and I don't know what it was about, but they--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that was--can you--what was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was in a neighborhood that's very poor.  You know, the kids weren't going to school, parents incarcerated, nobody at home, and they're just hanging out.  It's just--it was just a mob mentality.  You know, it was just a violent reaction to--you know, people--when I was growing up, you know, if kids got in a fight, it was over.  You know, they went to the principal's office and, you know, they may have been put in detention, but then that was it.  Nobody beat anybody to death or certainly there weren't any guns or knives.  But, the mentality of these kids was just to hurt him, to beat him, to, you know, retaliate against him.  Now, they've seen that.  They've seen--what do they say in video games, you take somebody out (laughter).  You know, you eliminate them.  You kill them.  That's--then you won.  So, yeah (laughter), that's what they do.  Isn't that what they play in video games?
Speaker 1: That's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Isn't that how it works?
Speaker 1: That's right.  I forget what the exact phrase is when they--you know--
Speaker 2: I don't know, but you--
Speaker 1: 'Mortal Kombat' or whatever, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  You eliminate, you kill somebody and you have won.  That's how you--
Speaker 1: Finish him.
Speaker 2: --gain points.  Yeah, you finish him off.
Speaker 1: Finish him is the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then you get a point for that.  So, yeah, they have that mentality, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, did--were any of the kids from areas that you deal with or?
Speaker 2: No, it was in a neighborhood right--well, I shouldn't say that because New Concept [New Concept Self Development Center, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] works all over the city, but it was in a neighborhood right off of 20th [Street] and North Avenue, and right next to it is a very nice newly developed urban community, new homes, about two blocks away (laughter), you know, from where this happened.  And the city was in an uproar because it was right at the time when there was a lot of discussion about building the corporate environment in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] and the city didn't want people to think that this was a violent city, that it's unsafe, you know, that kids kill people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I have another note in here that in 2003, you all--New Concept expanded their Juvenile Offenders Program [First Time Juvenile Offenders Program] to include truant offenses, I guess--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah, kids who were not going to school, to work with kids who were about to be expelled.  You know, and it's stupid, but you don't go to school and they expel you because you don't go to school (laughter).  So the focus was to work with truant kids to get them back in school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And as you mentioned earlier, you're working with children whose parents are--
Speaker 2: Are incarcerated.
Speaker 1: --incarcerated.  And--now, you retired in 2006 and you received the Black Women's Network Lifetime Leader Award, Women Putting Their Stamp on Milwaukee award, quite a, a number of other awards here.  But, you retired in 2006 and when--how many--when you retired, how many offices of New Concept existed?
Speaker 2: Two.
Speaker 1: Two?  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Two offices.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Two, a main office and a satellite office.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Story_ID: 481867
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything that's happened since then--you know, since you started the organization in 1975, is there anything that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: I would've had a stronger fundraising board.  Traditionally, community based agencies don't have real strong fundraisers on their boards.  The large organizations do, the Boys and Girls Clubs [Boys and Girls Clubs of America], you know, they have people who come with money and access to money.  But our boards are usually people who believe in what we're doing, are community people, people who know you, so I would've built a different kind of board to be able to raise money for the agency 'cause that's very difficult.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what would the--I mean, the people that were the board members, they--I take it that they had the most enthusiasm for the project--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Very strong supporters, volunteers, people who have volunteered, who--you know, some of our former clients are board members.  Love the agency, but don't raise money.
Speaker 1: So what role will they--would you have for them to play?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: What role would you assign them, them to play if not board members?
Speaker 2: If they weren't board members?  You could have a volunt- you could have an ad hoc board who--you still need strong support, but you need some people on your board with money, who have access to money so that you can raise money.  And the people that I know don't have those resources.  Good hearts, love the agency, will do anything, have volunteered, you know, but to get a strong fundraising board, that's what I would've done differently.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I raised all the money.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's where it came from.  I wrote the grants, you know, I raised the money.
Speaker 1: Now that takes a lot of time.
Speaker 2: Took a lot of time, a lot of work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how did the welfare reform--I know, what, Tommy Thompson came in as governor and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was part of a big welfare reform in the state as a Republican governor trying to, you know, I guess cut back on a number of welfare--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he did.
Speaker 1: --recipients and such.
Speaker 2: That's when, you know, you--even if you--yeah, the whole welfare reform was that now you don't just get a check, you got to work.  You can get it for so long, but then if you don't get a job, you just don't get any more money.  So, you know, unemployment, job skills, you know, all those things played into it.  So, yeah, that was a big change.
Speaker 1: And how did it affect what New Concept [New Concept Self Development Center, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] was doing?
Speaker 2: Well, the people that we worked with, we had to focus on trying to help them get a job, you know, or getting some skills so that they could get a job.  And, you know, the reality is that you're not gonna get a check after a certain amount of time, so what are you gonna do?  Who's gonna take care of your children?  You have to--you know, so it became much more difficult to work with people because a lot of people just didn't have the skills to get a job.  So, yeah, it changed a lot.
Speaker 1: And what was the overall effect in your estimation of that policy on the community?
Speaker 2: I think that--I don't think it had a real positive effect in terms of people being able to all of a sudden take care of their families better.  I think a lot of people left.  People would move to Chicago [Illinois] or go where they could survive.  I think you had more people who lived together, larger households who could--you know, women who lived with their mothers, sisters living together just to survive.
Story_ID: 481868
Speaker 1: When you look at everything you've done to this point again, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: The thing that I am most proud of is that over--from 1975 until I left, the number of jobs that I was able to create, to hire people, social workers, counselors, to be able to give somebody a job can change their life.  And the hundreds of jobs that I was able to create and hire people to provide a service, that's what I'm most proud of.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And if you had to give someone advice now about, you know, starting an agency like, like yours [New Concept Self Development Center, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and--
Speaker 2: Don't do it.
Speaker 1: Don't do it?
Speaker 2: It's--well, and I'm serious because the--when you look at how to get money to do the things that we did, it's totally different.  Donors, to get donations, to get grants, it's almost impossible to do.  It's very difficult to do.  I mean, it's worse now because look at the economic times of even philanthropy has dwindled, you know, and gotten smaller.  And a lot of the things that we used to do, that the--were funded by the government, by the state or the county, it's not there anymore.  Those kind of programs don't exist anymore.  It's very difficult.  I would not try to do that today.
Story_ID: 481869
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns about the black community in light of what you just told me?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That it's hard to get any money to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very concerned--
Speaker 1: --do anything about it.
Speaker 2: --that--you know, about the violence, the increased violence against children, against people, what you talked about of kids beating somebody to death.  I think a lot of it is out of frustration, out of anger.  I don't know what the answers are.  I--but I, I really am serious to say that I would not try to start a New Concept [New Concept Self Development Center, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] today because of a lack of resources to be able to do that.
Speaker 1: So you're saying there, there would be--there would have to be a total, I guess, change in how the government approached these--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --things again to be able to do that with the--
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, and, and I think there is--in any Democratic administration, there are more social programs, more funding for the kinds of things that we--you know, when I was there, that we did.  So, it may get better, but a Republican administration is not in favor of a lot of the things that addresses the social issues in the community, so the resources to do that were very limited.  The mentoring children of prisoners program was an initiative that was started in the Republican administration but it got smaller and smaller and the money got less and less over the years.  You know, those were the kind of things.  So, I think the answer to private nonprofit agencies addressing the issues in the community has to be collaboration among agencies so that you don't have the smaller ones but you have a collection of people with different skills and interests who can come together to use their resources.
Speaker 1: Now, is there competition between state and--I mean, governmental agencies and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It--
Speaker 1: --not-for-profits--
Speaker 2: Not competition, but--
Speaker 1: --in terms of--
Speaker 2: But it used to be that the government would contract with private agencies to do the things that they didn't do, but now, that's shifted where they've taken it over and they do it rather than contracting.  So, yeah, it's different.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very different.
Speaker 1: So, do you find any hope in the present administration?  We just elected a president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], you know, from the black community.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, so--
Speaker 2: Well, you--I've--yes, extended hope.  It's not gonna happen overnight.  And people would, would say, did you ever think this would happen in your lifetime?  And I always--my--I always thought it could happen if we had the right person because I always knew that the previous candidates that we had who were African American were not the right person and they were not doing it for the right reason.  I didn't think that they could run this country.  I thought a black person could do it if we found the right person.  So, yeah, I believed it could happen and it did.  It wasn't like we'll never have a black president because a black person can't get elected.  My view is a black person could--we don't have a good black candidate that we can elect.  We don't have a good candidate (laughter) that we can elect, we didn't, period.  But, I thought it could happen if the right person was there.  So, yeah, so the right person is there, and who understands community, who is compassionate, who's passionate about issues.  But that's one person who has to surround himself with other people who think like that who can make change, you know.  And in Washington [D.C.], we always say you have the A people and the B people.  You know, the A people are the appointed people, but the B people are the people who are gonna be there regardless, and they're the ones who really are the ones that you got to deal with, (laughter), you know.  So if he gets a good A team around him and I'm sure he will, change will come, but you got to move those B people out of the way, too, to make change, and that doesn't happen overnight.  It's gonna take some time for that to happen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For it to trickle down.
Story_ID: 481870
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your family.  Maybe I'll think of this last one.  But, but you say you have two children--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your family.
Speaker 2: I have two children.  I was married and divorced and I've been divorced for over twenty-five years--well, twenty-three years.  I have a daughter [Crystal Perry (ph.)] who went to Tennessee State [Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] and she is actually now working at New Concept [New Concept Self Development Center, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin], the agency that I started, and she's a social worker and she is enjoying what she's doing.  She's working with families and mothers and daughters to try to improve their communication so that the daughters are not involved in the criminal justice system.  So, she's enjoying that and she has a son.  I have a twenty-one-month-old grandson.  And she's here.  She lives here, so I see her almost every day.  My son [Kevin Perry (ph.)], on the other hand, went to Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University] in Tallahassee [Florida] and he has never moved back to Milwaukee [Wisconsin].  And both of my children went to historically black colleges [HBCUs] because that's something that I wanted them to have that experience.  So, I miss him and don't see him as much as I would like to, and he may eventually move back to Milwaukee because I find as he gets older, family is more important to him and he expresses the desire to be with his family more.  So, my children are certainly--have given me much joy.  Raising children is very difficult, you know.  It wasn't always sweet and huggy and I love you.  I--you know, you got to be the disciplinarian, you got to provide the resources, but, yeah, they've been the joy of my life.
Story_ID: 481871
Speaker 1: Now, well one thing I didn't ask you about was, isn't there a National Association of Black Social Workers?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.  And I was a member for years and an officer in the chapter here.  In fact, the chapter here used to meet at New Concept [New Concept Self Development Center, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  But it's not an active chapter here now, not that I know of.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I think--you always got to have somebody who's gonna make it happen, and I was the person that did that for years and then somebody else took it over and then--you got to have organizers.  That's what organizing (laughter), part of what organizing is, right?  Bringing people together for a common cause.
Speaker 1: Well, you still have a lot of probably time left on earth to do some good things.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.  I'm (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, is--you're retired--
Speaker 2: --involved in some things, yeah.
Speaker 1: What are you--what are you doing?
Speaker 2: I'm involved in two, two projects that I'm working as a consultant on that I really enjoy very much.  One is the Medical College of Wisconsin [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] has a violence prevention initiative, and they have decided that--to develop a five-year plan on what can be done to bring people together to develop a plan for trying to deal with violence in the city, and they hired me as a consultant to bring people together, which is what I do best to--we've created a steering committee to develop a plan.  So, this project, the first year, we are developing--bringing people together to develop the plan, community people.  And then the implementation will start next year once the community decides what needs to be done about it.  And my approach is, and the medical college agreed, rather than them saying violence is an issue and this is what we're gonna do, I said, you need to ask people in the community what they think needs to be done, and that's what we are doing now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the other is a project called the Mosaic Partnership, which is a project to deal with the issue of racism and racial divide in Milwaukee [Wisconsin].  And what we do is identify two hundred community leaders, half black, half white, and match them one on one to develop a relationship over a period of a year, and meet each other, learn about each other, and also participate in a cluster group meeting once a month for nine months.  And this is the third year, and we've worked with over four hundred people to build a social capital and deal with the problem of racial divide in our community.  So I am one of the two master coaches for the project that we coach--we train the people who work with the groups to implement the curriculum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there anything I have not asked you about that we ought to discuss before I ask my--the last question that I can think of?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, the last question I can think--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --of is this one and I've asked it a thousand times.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a good friend.

Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, tell us about that.
Speaker 1: This is a quilt that was made by the staff of New Concept [New Concept Self Development Center, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] when I retired, and each one of the programs made a square to depict what they thought was important, and it's truly a legacy of the things that happened there and are still going on.
