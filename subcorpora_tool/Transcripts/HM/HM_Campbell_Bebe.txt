Speaker 2: No.  But it's seems to have been a good relationship, she looked upon her as a mother.  She had doubts, she thought she was ad--she questioned whether or not she was adopted.  I know that because she recalls someone, a woman coming up to her father at her mother's funeral and saying, "Are you gonna take that little girl back where you got her from?"  And he said, "This is my little girl.  What are you talking about?  This is my little girl."  She always wondered what that meant, and that's what haunted her, she wanted to know, did she belong to her father and this mother died, or was she adopted?

Speaker 1: Right, right.  Okay, let's, let's go back to your mother [Doris Carter Moore] and father.  Do you have any recollection or knowledge about how, what, what it was like, them growing up?
Speaker 2: My father was one of eleven children--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --in Pasquotank County, North Carolina, his father Nathaniel--
Speaker 1: Now is that, that, you're gonna have to spell that for--
Speaker 2: Nathaniel, N-A-T (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, no.
Speaker 2: Pasquotank, P-A-S-Q-U-O-T-A-N-K.  Pasquotank County, North Carolina, right outside of Elizabeth City.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was an area called, Newland [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay.
Speaker 2: And, he was one of eleven children.  There were eight boys and three girls.  They grew up on a farm, without running water, wood stove, pump, no indoor plumbing, no electricity, they had to do a lot of hard work, chop wood, work the fields, corn was growing, cotton was growing, vegetables, they had their own, you know, they, they basically grew or raised their own food.
Speaker 1: Okay, did they own the land or did they sharecrop?
Speaker 2: That was their land.
Speaker 1: That was their land.
Speaker 2: The--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the, my grandfather was, what did he do?  He was a contractor.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is Nathaniel?
Speaker 2: Nathaniel was a contractor and he would rent out workers to the logging mills.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was the mainstay of the family and then as with every other family, in a farm area, they raised their own crops and, and animals.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They went to a segregated school, most of, my father graduated from high school, the older, his older siblings did not, my father was for a while, the only one of the children to go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they went to, of course, segregated schools, his high school was P.W. Moore [P.W. Moore High School, Elizabeth City, North Carolina].  Went to church, they went to Mt. Carmel Baptist Church [Mt. Carmel Missionary Baptist Church, Elizabeth City, North Carolina], and--
Speaker 1: Was P.W. Moore High School, was that a relationship there to the family?
Speaker 2: We think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They, very religious family, get up at six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, family prayer, and then spend all day in church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The time he was coming along, they didn't have a regular minister at this church, it have a, you know, the itinerate preacher who would come maybe every other week.  So I don't know ho--exactly how they worked that, on the off days, the off Sundays.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but they couldn't really afford a full time pastor.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So it was a small country church?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 304044
Speaker 1: Let's go back to your mother and Doris Edwina Carter Moore.  And, did di--your father [George Moore] and your mother meet there in Elizabeth [Elizabeth City, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: No, no.  You know what?  I told you my mother was born in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], my mother was born in Camden, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And they met when my father came to Philadelphia.  As my aunts and uncles got older, they left Pasquotank County [North Carolina] and came to either Philadelphia, New Jersey or New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The oldest brother John [John Moore] went to New York, got work in the knitting mills and as each one of the brothers and the sisters came up, they got into the knitting mills.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They got into that kind of work.  My father was in the service during World War II [WWII], he was in the [U.S.] Army and he came to Philadelphia either on leave or after the war was over, his brother Eddie [Eddie Moore], an older brother had opened a grocery store in Philadelphia--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and he stayed with Eddie and his wife Marie [Marie Griffin Moore], Uncle Eddie and Aunt Marie went to the same church my mother did, Faith Tabernacle Baptist Church in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my father came to the church service and my aunt introduced him to my mother.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right, so that wa--that was the beginning.
Story_ID: 304045
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your mother [Doris Carter Moore] coming, she, she, she was born in Camden [New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And she, a--about her education?
Speaker 2: My mother was a really brilliant scholar.  As my grandmother [Elizabeth Williams Simmons (ph.)] used to say, her mother, she went to sch--she went through school smoking.  Straight A student, she went to Clycorn Elementary School [ph.], and I don't know what, junior high or maybe that went eighth grade in those days. I don't know, probably did.  And then she went to William Penn High School [William Penn High School for Girls], which was a high school for girls in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  High school was in Philadelphia, she was on the student council and student government and she took the vocational course, even though she was a straight A student.  My grandmother was divorced.  She had three children.  My mother and two younger sisters, she worked as a maid or as a waitress, it varied and my mother tells the story of this Jewish counselor stopping her in the hall at William Penn High School and she said, "I've been looking at your grades, why are you taking the vocational course when you have grades like this?"  And my mother said, "Because my mother cannot afford to send me to college."  My mother knew nothing about scholarships, and the woman said to her, "Switch to academic, I'll get you to college."  And, it kind of touches me still, you know how fate can just walk in there, and hand you a different kind of life.  When my mother was about to graduate, the woman came to her, she said, "I have two scholarships, you can be a big fish in a small pond, or you can be a little fish in a big pond," and she offered her a scholarship to, oh, I'm blanking on the school, a small historically black college [HBCU] right outside--Cheyney [Cheyney Training School for Teachers; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Philadelphia] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Cheyney.
Speaker 2: --to Cheyney.  And she offered her a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and my mother went to the University of Pennsylvania, studied social wor--became a social worker, got two masters, one in sociology, and one in social work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 304046
Speaker 1: I wanna go back for just a minute, just to be sure, 'cause of the way I've got my notes.  Your mother's [Doris Carter Moore] birthdate was May 4, 1921?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, just wanted to, to be sure about that.  Let's go back a little, little ways.
Speaker 2: No, 'cause she's eighty-three now--
Speaker 1: Okay, then that's--
Speaker 2: Twenty-two [1922], I always get the year mixed up.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: Nineteen twenty-two [1922].
Speaker 1: Nineteen twenty-two [1922]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, good enough, I'm gone change, change that.  Let's, let's go back to, what are some of the earliest memories that your mother, because I know the two of you are very close, that your mother can relate to you about her, her life, after, after--?
Speaker 2: She talks about growing up with her sisters, she had, she was the oldest.
Speaker 1: How many sist--I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There were two of--
Speaker 1: --I mean how many children?
Speaker 2: There were three--
Speaker 1: How many siblings?
Speaker 2: --girls.
Speaker 1: Three girls.
Speaker 2: Three girls, Doris my mother, Ruth [Ruth Carter] my aunt, and Bebe [Bebe Carter] my other aunt.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she talks about their personalities a lot.  Both sisters have passed away, my, my youngest Aunt Bebe, was dead before I was born, and hence I was named after her.  And that's a family story about how, you know, my grandmother [Elizabeth Williams Simmons (ph.)] said to my mother, "Please name your daughter Bebe," and my mother said, "I'm not naming my child Bebe," and she said, "Well not for a first name, make it her middle name."  And so I became Elizabeth Bebe, I was named after my grandmother and my aunt.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, wh--yo--your mother was the oldest right?
Speaker 2: My mother was the oldest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She remembers working in a store for my godfather.  It's the man who became my godfather, owned a small grocery store.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she would always, she said she had a sour disposition, she was a high school student [at William Penn High School for Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]  and she was always angry she said about things and, Mr. Davis, his name was Arthur Davis [ph.], he told her one time, "You know?  I might pay you more if you, if you smiled and were pleasant to the customers," and she just sort of thought, oh, (laughter) and changed her attitude a lot.  My mother was a church girl.  She liked being in the church.  Sunday school teacher, went to church, bible studies, I mean, whatever involved the church.  Loved her minister, got a lot of encouragement from her minister.  She talks about the parties that they used to have and how much fun my grandmother was but, and how strict my grandmother was too.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And she recalls a time when my Aunt Ruth was hanging out with a girl my grandmother disapproved of and my grandmother simply told my aunt, who was a teenager, "I don't want you with her anymore," and that was the end of it.  They were very obedient, good girls
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, the--we're getting a great picture of your mom, that's what I want to do here.  What are the earliest memories your mother has related to you about her life?

Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Any stories about that?
Speaker 2: Well she says he liked another woman.  And one of her friends.  He seemed interested in one of her friends, but slowly but surely they were more and more together.  My mother, at this time must have been going to college [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] or, yeah, she should have been going to college at this time.  And I have no doubt that that influenced my father.  For him to have been the only one of eleven children for a long time, later my, the youngest, my aunt, his sister, after working as a nurse, returned to Elizabeth City [North Carolina], after liv--having lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and went to Elizabeth City State Teachers College [Elizabeth City State University, Elizabeth City, North Carolina] and got her degree in education.  But for years, my dad was the only coll--college graduate and I think he was very much influenced by my mother.

Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay.
Speaker 2: And then he came home.	He came to Philadelphia after he got out of the service.
Speaker 1: Now those summers you used to spend with your father and that great affinity you had both, with both your mom and your dad, but did he, did your dad relate any stories to you in talking about any experiences he had (simultaneous)--

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, he was majoring in agriculture and became a county farm agent and so then my mother moved to North Carolina.

He went to some hospital outside of North Carolina, I wanna say Kentucky or Louisville, it might have been Louisville, Kentucky, I'm not sure and my mother would visit back and forth, so my mother took me to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], where I was born, I, I, I was born in Philadelphia, she did not want me born in segregated North Carolina.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I was born in Philadelphia, her mother [Elizabeth Williams Simmons (ph.)], my--

Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  My, she left me with her mother and went back to be with my father.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, after, he, he was not given a good prognosis.  It was expected that he would die within a few years because the internal injuries had been quite severe.  And that was 1950, my father died in 1977.  He had a really strong absolute will to survive and to live and after he got out of the hospital and went through the--
Speaker 2: Rehabilitation?
Speaker 1: --rehabilitation process, he and my mother returned to Philadelphia.  The plan was, she could not get work in North Carolina.  They would not hire her there.  So she wou--said she would go to Philadelphia and she would be the breadwinner.  My father and mother stayed with my grandmother in their home, he stayed downstairs in what was, there was a room behind the kitchen, it was called the shed kitchen.  And he was not happy there at all.

Speaker 1: To Philadelphia, because he had, he had who, he entered Goodwill [Goodwill Industries International Inc.] and got Goodwill training and he was able to, he was always very bright and all the men in the family can fix things, so he learned to fix appliances.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, so he went, when he went to, back south, that's what he was doing, he was fixing appliances in various, for various people (simultaneous)--

Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Where your mother [Doris Carter Moore] was the principle breadwinner and they were all living together?  Approximately the date when he decided to (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To leave?
Speaker 1: --to go back?
Speaker 2: I think I must have been about three.
Speaker 1: So that would have been about 19-?
Speaker 2: Fifty-three [1953], '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: Fifty-four [1954], '54 [1954].
Speaker 2: Yeah '50 [1950]. Yeah, I was born in '50 [1950], so about 1953.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then he did come back, because during my elementary school years [at James Logan Elementary School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  I can remember going to several Goodwill [Goodwill Industries International Inc.] events, Christmas dinners.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: So he came back and had training, Goodwill training and then returned to North Carolina.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So, you were three going on four at, at this time?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: There came a time of 'course when you started spending your school months, years with your mother in Philadelphia and your father in, in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: The summers.
Speaker 1: The summers?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In, in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you remember when that started, would that have been 1955, '56 [1956], or so?
Speaker 2: Right around that time.  And I have pictures when I was clearly like four maybe with him that were taken in North Carolina, so it might have started even earlier than that.  His brothers and sisters were always driving down there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it would have been easy enough for my mother to say, you know, if he wanted to see me, for one of his brothers and sisters to have taken me down there when they went.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 304051
Speaker 1: At an early age though, you started writing, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I started writing probably as soon as I could learn to read, six, seven years old.  I can remember, I think I was in, maybe I was even eight, I was in the third grade and I was in a--the school my mother [Doris Carter Moore] sent me to, we lived in a predominately black neighborhood in North Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and she didn't want me to go to the school in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she found out about a school that would take out of the neighborhood children, it was kind of like a forerunner of a magnate.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was Logan Elementary School [James Logan Elementary School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so she and some other upwardly mobile Negro mothers sent the kids, sent their kids to this school and they had programs such as creative writing, and I was placed in the creative writing class by my teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was the racial composition of Logan Elementary?  Do you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Logan Elementary--
Speaker 1: --I, you know--
Speaker 2: The, the area-
Speaker 1: --just guess.
Speaker 2: --was, I'm--white, Christian, there were also, Jews in the area.  I remember there were several, there was a Ukrainian population as well.  Something was going on in Russia in those early '50s [1950s], in the Ukraine and people, people were immigrating to the United States.  And there was a pocket of Ukrainians.	The teachers were all white, mostly older unmarried, I'd say WASP [White Anglo Saxon Protestant] types, career teachers who had gotten into the system when teachers couldn't be married or they couldn't have children.  I remember my sixth grade year we got two young pretty white teachers and we were just oh (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --we were just amazed and I, in the sixth grade, I had a black substitute teacher, and it was whoa!  I'd say the population, the, maybe it was five percent black kids, five to seven percent black kids.  We were all riding the subway.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And walking the four or five blocks after we got off the subway stop.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To Logan and it was a very stark change to my neighborhood, my North Philadelphia neighborhood which was comprised of row houses, no lawns, no grass, backyards, but everything was asphalt.  We got to Logan you walk out, you had these small lawns, I mean to my mind, they were just gargantuan, now when I go back, I see that this was a, you know, a working class, middle class, lower middle class, neighborhood, it just seemed like Taj Mahal to me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I remember they had flowers in the yard, they had roses, they had irises, they had azaleas and I ju--just loved going to school, spring time to see all these flowers.
Story_ID: 304052
Speaker 1: Got along well at school [James Logan Elementary School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Mostly hung with the black kids, but I had white friends and believe it or not, I was the teacher's pet.  She, she picked me for everything, even though I got off to a kind of a rocky start in school.  We had a cloakroom and my teacher was Miss Bradley [ph.], you were supposed to go in the cloakroom, hang up your clothes, put your lunchbox down, come out, no talking, no dawdling.  And I went in there one day with a little white girl named Sa--Sandra Loomis [ph.], and I started talking and dawdling and she said to me, "Miss Bradley doesn't want you to talk, we have to leave," and I said, "I don't care about Miss Bradley, if she bothers me, I'll cut her with my knife."	And Sandra's eyes just, what!?  You know, she was just like, "What did you say?"
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And then, her eyes got really big and I turned around and Miss Bradley was standing right behind me and the next thing I knew, she had me by my elbow and she was leading me down the hall and then I saw the direction we were going in and it was the principal, Jennie G. Wilton [ph.].  I'll never forget it.  She took me in there and told her what had happened and I was frozen with fear and then Jennie G. Wilton, picked up the telephone and said, I'm calling your mother [Doris Carter Moore] and I was like, "Oh my God," you know.
Speaker 2: This was serious.
Speaker 1: This was really serious.  My cousin, Michael [ph.] who lived with us, we grew up together, as I was walking home to the subway, the word had already, he said, "You are in trouble, you're gonna get it."  And when I got home, my [maternal] grandmother [Elizabeth Williams Simmons (ph.)] was just, I called my grandmother Nana, because he told as soon he got in and she just looked at me like, "How could you do that, I mean, why would you go up there and say something like that?  You know what they think about us anyway."  And then when my mother got home, it was like, why, why?  She was not a, a spanking mom, she was a talking, just, "Why did you?"  You know, she would have her, she, she had her own little social work case, she was like, "Why did you say that?  Wh--what, what is going on?"  And, then she had to go up to school and it was a big, big deal, but, it ended up that, Jennie G. Wilton, called me back and she said, "I think you have an overactive imagination, your mother seems very nice," and then I was, Miss Bradley didn't seem to hold a grudge and I still got picked to do a lot of stuff (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) The--what was your mother doing?  Was sh--?
Speaker 1: She was a social worker--
Speaker 2: She was a social worker at that time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in foster care.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 304053
Speaker 1: And, coming home to your neighborhood from the Logan Elementary [James Logan Elementary School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] neighborhood, give us a flavor of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My neighborhood [North Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was still good.  But it was much, much more urban, at that time you had a mix of black people, in a black neighborhood.  You had the doctors and the lawyers and the principals and the teachers, you had the postal worker, the bus driver, well, black people probably weren't driving buses then.  Everybody down to the unemployed and the maids because we were all in there together, some people were renting, some people owned, but you couldn't live anyplace else.  I mean you could live in another black enclave, but you couldn't live in a white neighborhood and there weren't no integrated neighborhoods.  So we were all there together, it was very urban, there were businesses there, black people owned businesses, a lot of Jews owned businesses in our neighborhoods and the Jews tended to employee black people to work in the store, to do something on, not a high level. But they would be a visible presence.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You'd get off the subway and there would be a subway stop, I can't remem--I used to remember them in order, let's see, Logan, was for Logan School, then Wyoming, then Hunting Park, I don't know, but, when, once you got to Erie, it was pretty much a black train.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And black kids coming back from over, not just Logan but a variety of schools and then we would go on down to Susquehanna and Dauphin which was my stop.  I lived right around the corner from a pretty famous musical variety theater, Uptown [Uptown Theater, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] which is comparable to, what is it in Chicago [Illinois], the Royal?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: The Royal in Chicago [sic. Regal Theater, Chicago, Illinois] the State in [Washington] D.C., I think every--
Speaker 1: Howard [Howard Theatre] in D.C.
Speaker 2: The Howard in D.C.  Who is the State [sic. Royal Theatre], was that Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it was.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so I'd walk, there were people I knew in stores and I would wave to them, my aunt, my youngest aunt, lived not too far from my house and sometimes I would stop by her house, my Aunt Edith [Edith Moore].
Speaker 1: Now that, Aunt Edith was on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They had all moved away from North Carolina by that time, except for my father [George Moore].  And so my Aunt Edith was there and she had three kids so I'd stop in and say hi to her, I might go by my Uncle Eddie's [Eddie Moore] store and then I'd come home.
Story_ID: 304054
Speaker 1: At home I would play behind what we, we had, behind our house we had our yard and our yards faced a small row of houses and, that was another street, Mole Street, I lived on 16th Street, and the back of our house fronted Mole Street.  We, my cousin Michael [ph.] and I had friends on Mole Street--
Speaker 2: Cousin Michael who lived with you?
Speaker 1: Right that was my Aunt Ruth's [Ruth Carter], my mother's sister's son.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And Janice [ph.], Jeannie [ph.] and Arnold Williams [ph.], those were the kids we played with.  And so, I would do my homework first, pretty much, I think and then go out and play, or else I would go out and play and do my homework in the evenings, watch TV, my [maternal] grandmother [Elizabeth Williams Simmons (ph.)] would cook dinner, my mother [Doris Carter Moore] would come home, we'd all eat, watch a little TV, get ready for bed.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I would read at some point for my own pleasure.
Speaker 2: Television was not big then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We liked TV--
Speaker 2: --radio and--
Speaker 1: --we like TV
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: We were a TV watching family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we liked that.  We watched 'Amos 'n' Andy,' we watched 'Leave it to Beaver.' We watched 'Howdy Doody', all those shows, 'Fran, Kukla, and Ollie' [sic. 'Kukla, Fran and Ollie'], we watch all that stuff, we liked that, and my mother and grandmother liked to watch TV too.
Story_ID: 304055
Speaker 1: Now, that you were still at Logan Elementary [James Logan Elementary School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and came time, six grade and you're about to graduate?  Or did Logan go to the eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Logan did not go to the eighth grade, Logan went to the sixth grade.  And at that time in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], you had, you were in one A or one--in, or one B, part two of first grade was one B, the first part of second grade was two A, two B, and they did away with that system at some point, I was either in the fifth or sixth grade and those people who had good grades just went to the next grade and those people who didn't dropped back a grade.  So, in the sixth grade we moved from our neighborhood [North Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] to a neighborhood closer to Logan School, that was becoming integrated, this was in 1960.
Speaker 1: So in 1960 you were really up one, upscale?
Speaker 2: We were moving on up.
Speaker 1: Moving on up, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We were moving into an integrated neighborhood, it didn't stay integrated too long because the whites fled.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But it had been a Jewish neighborhood, the house that we lived in in West Oak Lane [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] had a mezuzah on the door, the church that my [maternal] grandmother [Elizabeth Williams Simmons (ph.)] later began attending had a big ole Star of David over it for a couple of years until they could change that to a cross, it had been a Jewish temple.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And the business--
Speaker 1: That faith was--
Speaker 2: --Baptist
Speaker 1: That church?
Speaker 2: Baptist.
Speaker 1: Baptist, okay
Speaker 2: My mother [Doris Carter Moore], my cousin Michael [ph.] and I went to a different Baptist church, my grandmother chose a different one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  My mother, cousin and I went to same and then my grandmother went to another one.  We went to Corinthian Baptist Church [Corinthian Baptist Church of Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], my grandmother went to Second Macedonia Baptist Church [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there a reason that she--
Speaker 2: She never liked the churches my mother picked (laughter).
Speaker 1: So she was independent.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was very independent. And for a long time, my grandmother didn't go to church at all.  My grandmother liked to party.  Really, I mean, it--I can remember times when she'd be coming in and we would be getting up getting ready to go to church and Nana was just coming in.
Speaker 1: Good for her.
Speaker 2: But, sh--some, when, by the time I was ten, I remember her taking Michael, my cousin Michael and me to a church on Sunday and that was a big deal, 'cause she never went to church and I remember we sat in this church and she gave us a piece of chewing gum, admonishing us not to chew it, just to hold it in our mouths and the minister started preaching and she, we looked over and Michael nudged me and my, Nana was crying, we thought whoa, what's going on here and after that, she started going back to church.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And she never gave an explanation to why?  Your mother never discussed it with you?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What possibly it may have been?
Speaker 2: No, I don--I don't what it was, but, you know, you, you get partied out?
Speaker 1: Right (laughter).
Speaker 2: So maybe she just (laughter) was partied out (laughter).
Story_ID: 304056
Speaker 1: Now you are in the sixth grade, you're about to graduate, do you?  What do you remember about that graduation?
Speaker 2: I remember my friends Karen McKee [ph.], Roberta Jordon [ph.], and my friend Leslie Ban--Bantam [ph.], I remember us dressing up in pretty pastel color dresses, I remember that my mother [Doris Carter Moore] made my dress and it had a bow and I can remember Karen, my girlfriend Karen fixing my bow for me, I remember that Karen had her hair done as in straightened, curled and being envious of the fact that she had a grown up hairstyle and she had little Cuban heels.  And Leslie's mother took us out to lunch after at some little lunch, dark restaurant and I remember it had blue in the title of it.  And we felt, you know, extremely grown up and we had been practicing whatever we had to say in the assembly because we'd do choral readings, singing and it was just a nice ceremony, we had a good time.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  What school did you go to from Logan [James Logan Elementary School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: From Logan I went to Wagner Junior High School [General Louis Wagner Junior High School; General Louis Wagner Middle School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in my new neighborhood of West Oak Lane [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there I had black teachers for the first time.  I had had a black substitute at Logan, but here I had, Mr. Hines [ph.] was my math teacher, Mr. Dickerson [ph.] was my science teacher, Miss Wilson [ph.] was my English teacher and these were all black people.  I don't know if I had 'em, was there for two years for seventh and eighth grade, so I don't know if I had 'em one year, I'm pretty I didn't but that was just wonderful.
Speaker 1: Was there an appreciable difference between the curriculum and how it was taught or the way?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember that the grades were based on academic proficiency, and you were in sections based on, you were in the smart section or the dumb section or the, people knew based on seven one, seven two, seven three and I wasn't in the smartest section, I was in maybe like the next to smartest section.  My girlfriend, a girl I met later, Rosalyn Watson [ph.], was in, was in for those two years she was always in the smarter section.  And I just adored her, I thought she was just the smartest, cutest and we had health together.  She was a big influence because I, I, I saw how smart she was and she'd speak out in class and I'd never had a problem with that but, but seeing her do that, I wanted to be more like her.  Now Wagner was the first place I saw fights, the kids would fight after school, not every day, but every once in a while, there would be a fight and that was very exciting.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: We would all, I was one of those people, I would like to see the fight so I was on the edge looking at the fight.  You know, I probably shouldn't have been doing that because after a while there was a big girl there who more or less, I didn't know her, but I  became aware that, I didn't know the, the terminology then, but she really started stalking me, this was big girl from a not smart section and she just started picking on me every day, and I became very afraid and I would just duck her whenever she--I saw her, I'd go the other way, I'd get out of school and dash home as quickly as I could and gradually she just got tired of it and she just forgot about me.
Story_ID: 304057
Speaker 1: Wanna ask you, you were talking about that precarious thrill you got from watching the fights and so forth.  Have you ever tried to examine that?  Why, that that thrill was there over watching you?
Speaker 2: I was very conscious of being good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's why it was so horrifying to everyone when I said what I said about the knife and it was hammered into my head that when you are around white people you have to be especially good because they think you're horrible so you have to prove them wrong.  So you have to be on your, the onus is on you to be on your good behavior.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: You know, so, and I think that was my rebellion when I said I'd cut her [elementary school teacher] with my knife.  It was just like, not only that, this whole thing where I have to be good, I'll cut that up too I think.  But, I think the fights represented a kind of freedom that was withheld from me.  Here were kids clearly being bad and I got to watch vicariously, you know, I didn't see a lot of blood and gore, nobody, it was just that, you know, these girls they smacked each other and pulled each other's hair or boys, they fist, you know, and somebody would break it up pretty quickly.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then the other part of it was that in my household with my Nana [Campbell's maternal grandmother, Elizabeth Williams Simmons (ph.)], my mother [Doris Carter Moore], my aunt [Ruth Carter], my cousin Michael [ph.], and all of us watched the fights.  We watched Floyd Patterson and Jersey Joe Walcott and Archie Moore and, you know, all those people, we enjoyed that, I mean my, my mom and Nana and, and my aunt did and I just sort of gravitated to it also.
Speaker 1: Okay, as a rough sport?
Speaker 2: As a sport that, that we enjoyed watching.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know?
Story_ID: 304058
Speaker 1: Let me a--ask you this, 'cause I know that it was just below the surface.  You're taking these creative writing classes in elementary school [James Logan Elementary School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], but was there anything drawing you to creative writing during those junior high school days or did you do any creative writing during that period?
Speaker 2: I, I imagine I did essays and whatever was required, I read a lot, I, I, don't know.  Letters, I think I probably put a lot of creativity into the letters I wrote to my dad [George Moore].  And maybe, maybe I wrote some things on the side, I'm not sure.  I probably put a lot of work into whatever was assigned.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Any over fond memories or displeasures that you can recall there in junior high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I had another black teacher my, my other science teacher, Miss Lancaster [ph.] was, was black also.  The pleasure of Wagner Junior High [General Louis Wagner Junior High School; General Louis Wagner Middle School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] would have to be Mr. Dickerson [ph.] who was my biology and Mr. Dickerson was extremely handsome.  And I had a big crush on Mr. Dickerson and I memorized--there was a time when I could tell you every leaf in the forest (laughter) because that was the assignment and I memorized all the leaves to please Mr. Dickerson and put 'em together in a bound book.  So that was, he, that, that was exciting, it was a bigger place, having black teachers was exciting and also I think at that time I became aware, more aware of class differences among black people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were the kids who fought, who tended to be poor and then there were the kids who didn't fight or who were in these high achieving sections.  And so, I became aware of those differences.
Story_ID: 304059
Speaker 1: Now this was, we're talking about approximately '61 [1961], '62 [1962] now?
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961] through '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: And the Civil Rights Movement (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Is underway.
Speaker 1: It, it is beginning.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Are there--how did this influence the relationships there between blacks and whites?  You already said that a majority of the student pop--body population was, was white.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but they were leaving, this was part of my neighborhood [West Oak Lane, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  My neighborhood was clearly in flux.  Black people had moved in and there had gotten to be a tipping point, you know, there's a tipping point and you get so many black people, white people are leaving.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They're going.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So they were leaving, the tipping point had been reached and they were, there were for sale signs all over the place, white flight.  And, but, I mean, I had in class friendships for the most part, I didn't socialize with white kids after school, but I had, and then there were some in class friendships I had with black kids too.  But I have a--I met a girl there, Jewish girl and we've remain friends to this day and we used to walk to school together, didn't visit back and forth.
Speaker 1: You said, didn't visit each other's home?
Speaker 2: Didn't visit each other's homes.  I don't remember calling on the phone, but we liked each other and sort of were out of each other's range for many, many, many, many, years and then we discovered each other and still liked each other and now see each other, you know, every year, during the summer.  Found out we vacation in the same spot.
Speaker 1: Right.  Were there any racial incidents during that period?
Speaker 2: I don't recall, I don't recall that.  I don't really think so.  There were times I suspect when we thought race was at the bottom of something that happened when, you know, a black kid would get suspended or a lower grade, or expulsion, that kind of thing.  I can remember even in Logan [James Logan Elementary School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], now looking back, I remember being in kindergarten and being made to stay in for something I did when everybody else went out to recess.  And I, I remember being in the class by myself.  And I remember crying and somebody asking me, why are you here and I said, "Miss," I think her name was Miss Graham [ph.], "Miss Graham told me to stay here," I, I did whatever.  And now I think, why did she tel--why did she put me in that--why did she leave me in that room by myself?  What could I have done that was that bad that you would leave a five year old in a room by herself?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know?
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So, is it safe to say then that the emerging civil rights era did not adversely affect relations there in Wagner [General Louis Wagner Junior High School; General Louis Wagner Middle School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: I don't think so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And in a major way?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't think so.  I think people, as I said, I think most of the friendships were race based anyway.  The close friendships.  I think where they won't--were, I think they were mostly in school friendships.  You know.  So, I don't think a--if anything, I think the emerging Civil Rights Movement made whites a little more curious.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To see, wanting to get to know certain black people.  And not wanting to see themselves as Bull Connor.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You know?
Speaker 1: Right, so that worked and in your favor.
Story_ID: 304060
Speaker 1: After two years at Wagner Junior High School [General Louis Wagner Junior High School; General Louis Wagner Middle School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], you're ready to move on?
Speaker 2: Well, I could have stayed there in the nin--'til ninth grade.  Wagner ended at ninth, but, there was an all-academic all-girls school and all academic all-boys school.  And if you were going to go to that, you began in the ninth grade.  You needed a certain grade point average and a certain, I was told I.Q.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so, my mother [Doris Carter Moore] wanted me to go to the Philadelphia High School for Girls [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I went there in the ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And of course you had to catch the subway there.
Speaker 2: No, no.  I walked (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, you could walk.
Speaker 2: --I walked, it was at Broad [Street] and Olney [Avenue] and that was about maybe seven blocks away.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I could walk to that school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went there in the ninth grade and that was another new experience in, in a way--
Speaker 2: Very new (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) because--
Speaker 2: All girls--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --from all sections of the city.  I'd say maybe 20 percent black, a lot of Jewish girls, some Asian girls, not to many Latinas, Christian whites.  And a mix of economic backgrounds and that student body was a lot more cohesive than Wagner.  We all knew we were bright girls and college was in our future, there were some very talented young women in that school in a variety of ways, talented musicians, writers that--my class has done well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 304061
Speaker 1: At Girls' High [Philadelphia High School for Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], any particular teachers stand out or incidents that stand out as you, when you entered or during your time there?  'Cause you spent three years there right?
Speaker 2: I spent ninth and, I spent four years there.
Speaker 1: Four years.
Speaker 2: I remember that in church, a woman came to our church and she had a severely retarded child with an enlarged head.  This kid was about six years old, she could not walk, she could not crawl.  At that point there was a new technique which has been largely debunked since, but this new technique was to pattern children like this, so that you would take a hand, take another hand and make the crawl pattern, take a leg, take another leg and turn the head.  So, you really needed five people to do this.  I got very motivated that I wanted to, this woman needed volunteers, I was going to get some volunteers.  So, I asked people at school, and as it turned out, I ended up working with four Jewish girls, they all volunteered and we would go to this woman's house, I don't know, a couple times a week and we were p--pretty diligent about doing it.  And so I got to know them in a way that I hadn't, it wasn't like visiting in the house. But it was another bridge--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --that we crossed.  I'm trying to think of, of the teachers who stood out.  We had this gym teacher named Mrs. Chilickien [ph.], and I remember we had visitors coming from the board of education and we had this thing called contest, which was a sports contest, we didn't have football or, you know any teams, but we would show an array of gymnastics and sports achiev- acad-athletic achievements and they had different teams, it was a big, big deal.  And, girls usually sat in clumps, the Irish Catholic girls sat together the Jewish girls sat together, the Italian girls hung out together, sometimes Italians and blacks kind of mixed up and sometimes Jews and blacks would mix it up.  But, by and large, we sat with our racial religious group and I remember she got up in front of one contes- before one contest and she told us, "Wow I wanna see you mixed up, I wanna see blacks with whites," and I can remember resenting it, her saying that because I just thought why are we giving this big show?  This is not what we do normally, so why are we doing this for these people when this is not what we do ordinarily?  So, that kind of stuck with me, but it was a rigorous school, I really learned how to study, I got some bad grades for the first time, because I, I've just never been good in math.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I really, really struggled with math at Girls' High, I had to get a tutor.  So, for the first time I felt deficient academically at Girls' High.
Story_ID: 304062
Speaker 1: Let's go back, not go back but just wanna make a point because for some reason I thought this came later in life.  You've clearly shown a very strong interest working with the National Alliance of Mental Illness [National Alliance on Mental Illness], do I have their name right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Na--National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.
Speaker 1: For the men- mentally ill.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is that the beginning of your interest?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: This child was not mentally ill.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was physically disabled and developmentally disabled.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's a difference from a brain disorder which is, you know, can--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --which is--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --mental illness.
Speaker 1: So, you don't think of that as anyway for your interest today?  Okay, we, we were talking about some of the people you remember from, or the inci- or, or things while you there at Philadelphia Girls [Philadelphia High School For Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: I remember our principal Ruth Logan [ph.], and the vice principal, Dr. Thompson [ph.], because they really sort of set the tone for the school and Ruth Logan was a white haired woman who, very pale with a chignon and she had a beautiful shape, she must have been in her sixties when I got there.  And she was just very elegant, very soft spoken and she had a Ph.D., Dr. Logan, and then Dr. Thompson was her second in command.  And they just set a tone of wha--Dr. Logan did a kind of an elegance, and you didn't wanna do anything to disturb her, which would make her upset Dr. Logan.  She was sort of a sym- the symbol of the school, the school standard, you kind of wanted her to be proud of you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, I can't remember the teachers' names, but there were a lot of talented teachers there and whatever love of literature I had before, my English teachers at Girls' High [Philadelphia High School for Girls] really intensified that feeling in me through their instruction and what we learned and the way we learned it.
Story_ID: 304063
Speaker 1: Now you were still an avid reader (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: At this time?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did--
Speaker 2: They had a lovely library [at Philadelphia High School For Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and I loved going there after school and just sort of wondering around.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You said you were struggling at first?
Speaker 2: Struggling with math.
Speaker 1: Just with math?
Speaker 2: With math.
Speaker 1: Okay, the other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The others, I was okay--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, there, there were, I remember getting a C in French, and wondering how did that happen, but I brought that--but when I say struggling, I'm talking about D.  A D in chemistry, a D in algebra.  You know, so that was really difficult.
Speaker 1: And how did your mother [Doris Carter Moore] respond to that?
Speaker 2: She got me a tutor.  She said okay, she said, "We'll get you a tutor."
Speaker 1: And the tutor helped?
Speaker 2: Pulled it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Got the grade up.
Speaker 1: Okay, any other memorable experiences, or unpleasant things that you can recall?
Speaker 2: I remember again, this whole thing about class and caste, with each level I learned more because at Girls' High [Philadelphia High School For Girls], unlike Wagner [General Louis Wagner Junior High School; General Louis Wagner Middle School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], you had genuine black blue bloods, you had the daughters of doctors and lawyers and they tended pretty much to be lighter, lighter skinned and I became aware of that more so than I had been before.
Speaker 1: So you became color conscious within your ethnicity--
Speaker 2: I, I became aware, I knew, I mean within my own family, it goes from very dark to, to very light so I knew there were color differences, I didn't pin them ec- on economics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I didn't, I didn't see that, that was a reason why other people could be shut out if you weren't this color.  And I saw that there.
Speaker 1: Did you speak out or you just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I--
Speaker 1: --internalized it?
Speaker 2: --just, no, no.  I sort of internalized that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it wasn't across the board, but for some of the, quote, unquote elite, it seemed to be color and elitism all went together and you couldn't penetrate their clique.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And, I think I had that in [Washington] D.C. of course.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Also the, the--any other lessons, were you learning any other lessons there at Girls' High besides class and color consciousness?
Speaker 2: Well I was in Girls' High for let's see, I'm, I'm trying to think, the March on Washington would have been August '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So that, I didn't get to Girls' High 'til September of '63 [1963], but I got there in, with that aftermath and you know, I met, I can remember meeting white kids there who, or a white girl who said her father did not want her to have any black friends and that was the first time someone had ever said that to me and she was very adamant about that not happening and that she was better.
Speaker 1: Now, she didn't say that in a mean way, but as much as stating it in a very?
Speaker 2: It was mean enough (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't like using, it was matter of fact and plain and I'm not hanging with you, I'm not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Because we get into these lun- lunchroom discussions and that's what came out.
Story_ID: 304064
Speaker 1: Now, during the four years at Girls' High [Philadelphia High School For Girls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] also, you have to start becoming more aware that when you're ready to leave you're going to have to have made some choices about college.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what was you thinking at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, my father [George Moore], towards I guess eleventh grade and, was pushing for me to go to a historically black college [HBCU].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my mother [Doris Carter Moore] wanted me to go to a state school.  Well to, not to a, a majority school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, so I sort of was geared towards my mother's way of thinking and I applied to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts], I applied to Delhi [State University of New York at Delhi, Delhi, New York] in New York, I applied to University in Pitts--of Pittsburgh [University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and I got in to all these places and I don't know why my mother let me apply, because when I told her I wan- I wanted to go Boston, she said, well I can't afford that (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I was like--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I, I thought, I thought, oh?  And, she said, "You're gonna have to go to a state school."  So I went to the University of Pittsburgh.  But, years later, I realized that my mother did not want me to be on scholarship, she wanted to pay for it.  And that's what she could afford to pay for.  She, someone had, I don't know whether it, I think that her University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] experience, because she was a scholarship student, there may have been something negative with that.  She, she tells a story of this, she made a grammatical error and, when she was at Pen and a white fellow student said, "What did you say?"  And she immediately shrank inside herself knowing that she'd made a mistake and I don't know whether all of that feelings identified with being a scholarship recipient or not, but she wanted as a point of pride, she wanted to pay for it.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  I still don't understand it.  I was listening for clues there--
Speaker 2: She, she did not want me associated with a scholarship less, you know, she wanted me to have a sense that, her par- your, your parents are paying for this.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so you, therefore you ended up going to the University of Pittsburgh (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The University of Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Which turned out to be a wonderful choice.
Story_ID: 304065
Speaker 1: Tell us about that first year there at the University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: I went earlier that August to orientation, my mother [Doris Carter Moore] accompanied me.
Speaker 1: Was this '67 [1967]?
Speaker 2: This would have been '67 [1967].  Maybe July or August.  When I got there, I was in a suite and I found out that my roommate was a woman named Yvonne Latierie [ph.] and she was from Western Pennsylvania, we'd written each other back and forth and when I got there I was the only black girl among my suitemates.  I didn't feel uncomfortable, but I didn't feel at home.
Speaker 1: How many were in a suite?
Speaker 2: Maybe about four.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, four or five.  And I think I ate with them, and socialized with them for the first week or two and then gradually I began to meet black students and more and more my dorm was just where I slept and studied and my social life became the black student body.  Especially when, not long after I got there, the Black Action Society was formed, which was the black student group on campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was very active in that, very involved and our movement was about getting more students of color admitted to the University of Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The, your focal of activity then became the Black Action Society?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I was in dance groups.  I liked dancing.  I liked African dance, so I joined an African dance group, I volunteered, I was a tutor, because I was in the school of education.
Speaker 1: Right, you tutored--
Speaker 2: Student, elementary sch- school kids in reading.
Speaker 1: Okay, elementary school in the area?
Speaker 2: In the area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I did not pledge a sorority, but I had a lot of friends who had pledged sororities, I liked that they had a lot of parties, I went to everyone I could go to.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the bulk of, I'd say the biggest extracurricular activity would have been the Black Action Society.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you avoid a sorority or did you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, by that time I thought I was too revolutionary, that was too bourgeois, all those things.  I'm now a proud member, an honorary member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, but at the time I just, I didn't--and my mother's a member of that organization as well.  I didn't see that as part of my life back then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we have a revolutionary on campus.
Speaker 2: We've got a revolutionary (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And, and, but you're still living in the suite with your roommates or had you moved out?
Speaker 2: What happened was, that in October, I went to Howard University's [Washington, D.C.] homecoming--
Story_ID: 304066
Speaker 1: I enrolled at the, starting at the University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], September, 1967, in October I went to Howard University's [Washington, D.C.] homecoming, I got into, I was in a terrible car accident and I broke my back, so I was out.  I didn't return to Pitt until the following year.  So, when I returned, I got a single, I didn't have a roommate at all and that's when I got more and more involved in the Black Action Society.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'm gonna ask about the dance, were you involved in dance because you were looking at it as a future career?
Speaker 1: Oh no, no, no, no.  I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was--
Speaker 1: --just like to dance,
Speaker 2: --a release.
Speaker 1: --I liked to dance, I, I always liked to be fit and I knew the teacher, oh Kathy [ph.], I can't think of her last name but, had a troop and my best friend and I belonged to it and we'd just go and do it for fun and perform for fun.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't even think we got grades in it, this was just something sort of extra.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And you're tutoring the elementary kids in the Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] area?  Was that because of your commitment to the Black Action Society?
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: And what needed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --to be?
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Done and so forth--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and so on?
Speaker 1: And I also tutored, the Black Action Society was successful in getting more students of color admitted, some of whom needed tutoring.  And (unclear) up in certain areas.  And I became a tutor for some of those students who entered.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Are there any of the kids that you may have tutored in elementary school you probably would not have been able to keep up with them, but how about the ones that your tutored to help them get into Pittsburgh, are they?
Speaker 1: They were already in, yeah, and one is a very good friend of mine to this day.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Any notables you want to mention?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  Some of the other programs and actions that the Black Action Society did while you were there at, at the University of Pittsburgh?
Speaker 1: Well they shut down the computer room, that was part of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay--
Speaker 1: --the--
Speaker 2: --relate those--
Speaker 1: --demonstration.
Speaker 2: --details to us.
Speaker 1: That was when I was out.  That was when I was recovering from the back accident.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But they went into the computer room and took it over.  And had demands that Wesley Posvar, who was the chancellor at the time, listened to and the main demand was that we wanted more black students, more black faculty, we wanted African literature, Af- African studies courses and we got all of that.
Story_ID: 304067
Speaker 1: Now, earlier I'd asked about the Civil Rights Movement having an impact there at school, but really I should have asked, the black, this emerging Civil Rights Movement, having an impact on, on you and your consciousness--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) or is?
Speaker 2: --very, very much so, and I guess the part that I'd forgotten to talk about was early, when I was at Logan [James Logan Elementary School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  There was a library near Logan and there was a library in the school and, but the, the public library near Logan, which I went to at least once a week, had books about Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, George Washington Carver, Frederick Douglass, and at an early age, Harriet Tubman really became a hero.  A shero for me.  And I read about her and she made me feel the intensity of our struggle, her history, she gave me a timeline for the struggle.  And so I was very excited about the Civil Rights Movement but I felt frustrated and helpless because I wasn't involved, you know as a young teenager.  We would go to church and the minister would tell us, this was part of the service, what we needed to boycott.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: There was a lot of boycotts going on.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: At that time there was a company in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] called TastyKake [Tasty Baking Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And they made little pies and crumpets and little sweet things.  And there were no black truck drivers for TastyKake.  So, our, the feeling was, we buy 'em, we eat 'em, you like our money, why don't you hire some of our people?  And they refused and then we boycotted them and gradually some drivers were added.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, this new consciousness you're taking to the University of, of Pittsburgh [University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennnsylvania] and you're a member of the Black Action Society and--
Speaker 2: I don't think I took a new consciousness because when I look back now, I think I was pretty vulnerable when I got to the University of Pittsburgh.  I mean, I'd been reared, you know, black household, Harriet Tubman was my hero, all of that, but I was in a new place, I was away from home, and I don't know what it was that pushed me in that direction, prob- I mean, probably my background, but I can see now that I could have gone in another direction.  I think it's a very vulnerable time, a time of, you really are out there alone trying to make adult decisions for the first time.  And so, I think it was, maybe serendipitous that I went that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you did go that way.
Speaker 2: But I did go that way.
Speaker 1: And all of a sudden you were involved in activities--
Speaker 2: That was more intense.  I have always craved intensity, and that was the, the movement around getting more black people, becoming a cohesive group, was very intense.  The people who were involved with it were intense and I fed off that.  So that's what was the attraction and the pull aside from, you know, you know self-interest and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and self-love.
Speaker 1: But we're talking about 1967, and of course the televisions, radios, newspapers are filled with--
Speaker 2: What's going on.
Speaker 1: --what's going on.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The--
Speaker 2: But there were black people at the University of Pittsburgh who were watching those same TV shows who were not involved at all.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Who were going a different way.
Speaker 1: They're trying to hide from it, yeah--
Speaker 2: Maybe trying--
Speaker 1: I would--
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah, I, I agree.  But, you're recovering from your back in- injury and you're back at the University of Pittsburgh and you elect to continue your involvement with the Black Action Society.  So, what are some of the other activities, protests that you are starting to get involved in and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We are--
Speaker 1: --does it--
Speaker 2: It, it's not--
Speaker 1: --affect your--
Speaker 2: --necessarily protest.  We're involved now with the ongoing tutorial program and setting that up as institutionalizing that.  We're putting out a journal, we are getting the African American studies course up and running, although I, you know, as a student I was taking those courses, I was involved in setting them up, bringing speakers to campus.  I remember, what's her name?  Kennedy, from New York [New York], real activist, Flo Kennedy [Florynce Kennedy].
Speaker 1: Flo Kennedy?
Speaker 2: Flo Kennedy came from New York, Bill Withers came, so we want, we were doing things now to, now we're here, we want you to know we're here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're solidifying your interest--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and your concerns.
Story_ID: 304068
Speaker 1: How about your school work [at University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]?  Now is that suffering at all?  Are you?
Speaker 2: Again, not doing well in the sciences, you know, some of the core, but doing okay in the other, the other courses.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Does this bother your mother [Doris Carter Moore] or and you?
Speaker 2: It bothers me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It bothers me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: My mother's encouraging, my dad's [George Moore] encouraging.  You know, do your best, keep trying.  And I had to take somethings over.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now, your, you're te- you're a teenager, you're still maintaining a lot of contact with your dad during the summer months?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And with your mother?  How's your dad doing?  And what are some of the things you're experiencing with him when you go down during the summer?
Speaker 2: Well at this point, my dad is really benefiting from the Civil Rights Movement because it's also helping people with disabilities.  You have to be, you know, civil rights are for everybody.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Just as women benefitted, you know, probably more than (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Access and--
Speaker 2: --more than people--
Speaker 1: --all of that?
Speaker 2: --of color.  Yeah.  White women benefitted from the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: My father with his disability benefitted and he now had a government job in personnel.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because one of the job he had was as a personnel counselor, for people looking jobs when it was frustrating because, he wasn't paid a salary per se, but a commission.  So, but nex- then he went to work for the government in personnel, so for the first time, he's really getting a little bit of the a piece of the rock.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know?  And so, he's, he's, those were years he was in good spirits, he's happy that I was in college and his kid is going to college so--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --he's very happy about that.  He had a girlfriend, he's playing the stock market.
Speaker 1: Wonderful.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so he was--
Speaker 1: And your mother?  Is she similarly enjoying some benefits because, at that time, they're now looking for bright young blacks (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well she was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], so she'd always been working she's--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --by this time she's a supervisor and she's the supervisor of well, the homemakers service and that was a service provided by the city, when mother's became ill, had to go to the hospital, or couldn't care for their children, the city would send out a licensed homemaker who would make the breakfast, get the kids ready for school, be there when the kids got home, keep the house together until this mother got back in place.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you're str- you're struggling in a few subjects?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But in others you're doing well?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and you're still involved with the Black Action Society?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That's, that's a--
Speaker 2: I was involved with the Black Action Society until I graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 304069
Speaker 1: What are some of your other experiences now as you are moving from being a freshman up to--or sophomore [at University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I'm beginning--I took Speech 101, I remember that, and I remember writing my speech, the first speech and I remember giving my speech and knowing that I'd done very well.  And, at this time I'm taking African literature courses, and African American literature courses, and the writing bug is really coming back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, it, it--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --if it had, had diminished a little bit, or disappeared a little bit, it's, it's now coming back with a vengeance and I really, really like writing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know?  And I had, had, you know, a couple of heartbreaks, I could be (unclear) about them and write that down too.  So, I'm now seeing myself as someone who wants to be a writer, however, I'm not someone who has majored, majoring in journalism or writing.  These are not, this has just not even crossed my mind.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because as this child of an upwardly mobile black mother [Doris Carter Moore], I wasn't good in chemistry or math, so I'm not going into medicine, so what is left?  I, I can't be a nurse, so I'm either gonna be a teacher or a social worker so?  I became, I went to a school of education.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And, you're generally pursuing the major in education, you, you're doing well in that, but, you're still feeling that urge now, to write--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) a little more.  You're doing--
Speaker 2: --I don't have a sense that it is what I would do with my life but, I have a sense that, I'm going to do this.  I mean, and I also had entrepreneurial dreams.  I remember coming home one summer and told my mom, you know, I think I should get a cart and sell bread and different little, you know, and she said, no, no, no you can't do that but, and it was just like yeah, people would, people would buy that and that was before you, you'd see all these little carts and things that, you know, and so I was thinking of ways to earn money.  I was learning to cook, because by this time I had an apartment, and just, I guess on my way to becoming the woman that I would be.
Speaker 1: Right, you're developing.
Speaker 2: I'm developing.
Speaker 1: As, as of this point.  You, are you now a sophomore on campus?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sophomore or junior.
Speaker 1: Okay, a junior and you, you're moving up--
Story_ID: 304070
Speaker 1: When did you first get a hint that you might like to pursue a career as a writer?
Speaker 2: Oh, that wasn't until after I graduated from the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: You, you did have a feeling that you could do some journalistic things though?
Speaker 2: I didn't even think of journalism.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I always thought of creative writing.
Speaker 1: Okay, always--
Speaker 2: I never thought of writing for a newspaper or--well I thought of writing for magazines, feature writing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that was aft--when I would, became a teacher and I was teaching in Atlanta, Georgia, and I attended a workshop, I'd read a woman by the name of, of Toni Cade Bambara--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and, when I found out she was teaching a workshop that was sponsored by the recreation department of Atlanta [Atlanta Department of Parks and Recreation]. And so I signed up and it was just wonderful because, there were, I don't know, six or seven of us and we would write and come in and read and share and critique and Toni was there to kind of help us and midwife our work and it was the first time I had a deadline, a weekly deadline, I had an assignment, I had to get this in, whatever it was.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: This had to be done by Saturday, for the class so it was just that I couldn't write whenever I felt like it, when the urge hit, I had to b- I had to now, imbue this practice with a little bit of discipline.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was foremost in, in your life though?  Was it the teaching?  You were teaching at elementary school.
Speaker 2: I was teaching elementary school--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was foremost in your life, the teaching at the elementary school or now the writing?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) With the company?
Speaker 2: --teaching took up more time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I was very committed to the students I had.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, my first love was writing and, and now the writing was something that I wanted to see, I wanted to become published.  I could now sort of talk about that and see that as a vision.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I bega- I think around this time I was beginning to send things out and beginning to get the rejections.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Does that mean then that, at that time you wanted, if you could, become a writer as opposed to continuing your primary career as a teacher?
Speaker 2: That probably was beginning t- I was, I just wanted to be published.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I just wanted to sell something.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, I don't think I thought about quitting my job as a teacher, but I just wanted to be a writer in a bigger way than coming to the workshop.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I wanted more of the world to see what I was producing and creating.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You wanted to share this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --more--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --with, with people.
Story_ID: 304071
Speaker 1: And during this period, you finally get something, you send out to a magazine and somebody buys it right?
Speaker 2: Let's see.
Speaker 1: I'm thinking of Essence (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I was, I was not in Atlanta [Georgia].  By that time I had moved to Washington D.C.--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I was at a Howard University [Washington, D.C.] literary workshop and that was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --presided over by John Oliver Killens.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The late novelist.
Speaker 1: Let's see, when you went to Atlanta to begin teaching, what, what year was that?
Speaker 2: I went to Atlanta in '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then when you went to Washington, what, what year was that?
Speaker 2: I went to Washington in seventy, '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: End of '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And were yo- you--were you teaching in the districts?
Speaker 2: I was at an adult education center at 12th [Street] and K [Street], or 13th [Street] and K [Street]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, right.  Over there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  I was teaching adult education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, that's when John Killens was on the Howard campus and--
Speaker 2: John Oliver Killens was writer in residence at Howard University.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Tell us about that experience.
Speaker 2: John Oliver Killens was a tremendously motivating teacher.  He not only, h- he taught us about the craft, again, I had a deadline, I had an assignment, so I'm, I'm being more and more disciplined about this, I've gotta go to this class once a week, I've gotta read something, people are gonna critique it.  We had a, a good group, maybe about eight or nine writers, some of them serious, some of them who, some of who got published later, some who never got published.  [HistoryMaker] Terry McMillan, was in John Oliver Killens' writers workshop, I believe in Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, the, the effect of the two together really solidified for me what I was going to be about because my teachers, both Toni Cade Bambara and John Oliver Killens, were so encouraging and it was at a time when I was just being rejected by every publication I sent any work too.  And so, I think it was a really critical point because it was at a point where I was becoming depressed.  I think I would have become depressed and given up if I hadn't had the positive reinforcement at the workshops.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I really needed to have my fellow writers and particularly my teachers saying, "Oh this is really good, oh let's see if you can shape this and do that, you know, this is marvelous."  They were telling me, they thought I had talent, then there was a group of older teachers at the adult education center and I used too, I told them I was a writer, they said, "Oh yeah?  Give us some of your stuff."  So I would give them short stories and they would read them in the car, they carpooled together.  And they'd read them and they'd come back and say, "Girl?  You know, that was good," so I was getting in--I had little tiny audiences, but those audiences were encouraging me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that, so it wasn't just my mom [Doris Carter Moore] saying, you know, you, you're my darling talented daughter, it was, there was some other people--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I trusted.
Story_ID: 304072
Speaker 1: So you were teaching there at the adult center.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Going, being tutored there under John Oliver Killens.
Speaker 2: At Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], yeah.
Speaker 1: At Howard.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And that's when you sent the story to Essence and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --it got accepted?
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.  That was 1976.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was, I was pregnant with my daughter [Maia Campbell], I remember, thinking that she was my good luck or talisman.  And it was--I got a telegram and saying that they wanted to publish it and I remember they paid me $325 and I was over the moon, I was so excited.  And, I, I incorrectly thought that they would never, ever reject me again.  And then I sent them something else and they rejected that (laughter) and I was like, well wait a minute, what's happening here?  So, I found out that the editor--
Speaker 1: Who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) was going--
Speaker 1: --was the editor at that time?
Speaker 2: --Audreen Ballard.  The editor was going to be at Howard University's Communications Conference and so I said, well so will I.  So, I went up there, took my baby and a friend and I said, "There she is," and I pointed to this woman on the dais to the friend, and I said, "Now when she leaves there, I'm gonna give you the baby and I'm gonna go talk to her."  So, sure enough, they broke at one point, sh- and I saw her heading toward the bathroom, I handed my daughter to my friend, I met her at the bathroom and I just said, you know, "Ms. Ballard, I'm [HistoryMaker] Bebe Moore Campbell and you just published my short story and I sent you something else and you rejected it, I just wanna know what you want, what you're interested in.  I can write anything you want, just tell me what you want."  And, we talked a little bit and she said, "Well you know we really don't buy that many short stories.  We, we are in the business of publishing articles.  Can you write articles?"  "Oh yes," and I'd never written one, she said okay and two weeks later I got an assignment from her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, it was half made up, half research, I didn't know how to do it.  I mean, but they bought what it was and then I went up to New York [New York] and met with them and gave them some other ideas and they bought three more and all of a sudden I was in business, I was, I was, I was working for a publication (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And writing--
Speaker 2: --as a free--
Speaker 1: --articles.
Speaker 2: --as a freelancer.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: As a freelancer.
Speaker 1: Freelancer.
Speaker 2: Right.  I still wanted to write fiction, but I was being paid to write and so that was a goal that was being met.
Speaker 1: But you were still teaching at this time?
Speaker 2: No.  I was actually, I was home on leave, on maternity leave.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was between positions.  I would later go to Howard University Press [Washington, D.C.] and work as a publicist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, the--just wanted to get that chronology down because that's very, very important.
Story_ID: 304073
Speaker 1: But now you're, you are writing articles for Essence and you are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For Essence--
Speaker 1: --getting paid.
Speaker 2: --And now Black Enterprise and Ebony and The Washington Post--
Speaker 1: Who was the editor of Black Enterprise that you, were, do you remember?
Speaker 2: --Who did I work for?  Elliot, Elliot Lee.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you said The Washington Post and--
Speaker 2: The Washington Post in the, what section was that?  I know that--
Speaker 1: Style?
Speaker 2: Style section.
Speaker 1: And who, who were you working under there?  Or reported--
Speaker 2: I can't recall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I cannot recall the editors' name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you, every time you, you sell a piece, you gained confidence?
Speaker 2: I gained confidence, but then times, sometimes you turn 'em in and it's all wrong and you have to do it all over again.  So, I'm, I'm working two jobs and I'm just--
Speaker 1: What other job were you working in?
Speaker 2: The publicist, I'm now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the publicist--
Speaker 2: --yeah--
Speaker 1: --for the how--
Speaker 2: --the Howard University Press [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I'm, I'm becoming and I have a baby [Maia Campbell] and I have a husband [Tiko Campbell] and I have a marriage and I'm becoming exhausted.  So then, I figure out, plus my check isn't coming because they don't accept the article, sometimes because it's not what they want.  So from that I said, you know what?  They're never gonna do this to me again, they're gonna know what they're getting.  I started outlining the articles and saying is this what you want?  Let's change it here and that worked.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And, where are we now?  Seventy-seven [1977], '78 [1978]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, but you still wanted to write your fiction?
Speaker 2: I do.  By that time, I am working for Black Enterprise as a Washington [D.C.] correspondent.  Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where are we, '77 [1977] or '78 [1978]?
Speaker 2: Probably '78 [1978].
Story_ID: 304074
Speaker 1: You are now the Washington [D.C.] editor for Black Enterprise and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I imagine we're talking about '77 [1977], '78 [1978], around there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the, what were your duties there and what was that like?
Speaker 2: I did a column for Black Enterprise, it was really kind of lonely and isolated.  I had a one person office and I'd go out and work my beat and come up with a topic and write a profile on someone or if a certain bill was being pushed through, something having to do with the government, with legislation, the judicial branch.  You know, it was a job that did not fulfill any hunger I had for writing, it was kind of journeyman work.  I got to meet interesting people but, it wasn't the kind of writing I wanted to do, you know?  Not at all, it was very unsatisfying.
Speaker 1: Okay, but it did fill one need, wanting money while (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, absolutely.  And, and, you know, I enjoyed working with Earl Graves [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.], he, he's a, he's quite an individual and, and to just see what he had built.  I mean, I'd go to these meetings in New York [New York] and this black man was employing all these people.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that was always great to see.
Story_ID: 304075
Speaker 1: Now we're leading up to the time where you just hunkered down to do that first great work of fiction that, that you're doing.
Speaker 2: Well I did two non-fiction works before.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's, let's deal with them first.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I began to expand in terms of writing pieces for various magazines and I began to write for a magazine that's now going off print, Savvy magazine.  And I got an assignment from the editor, Wendy Crisp to do a piece a--maybe I asked her, I pitched it and she liked it on 'Successful Women, Angry Men: Backlash in the Two-Career Marriage.'
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: What happens when husband and wives are competitive with, with each other's careers, who's taking care of the kids, what are the disappointments?  What happens when a woman does become very successful?  How does a man handle it?  So, I did this piece and it was well received and I went on 'The Phil Donahue Show' talking about it.  Now at this time I had, I had a literary editor, agent and Carol Mann in New York [New York] and she had been trying to sell my- a novel that I was writing for a long time and, and nothing had been happening.  So when this article came out around, I guess '83 [sic. 1985], and I had moved to California, by this time also, I had divorced my first husband [Tiko Campbell], moved to California, it must have been later, it must have been, it must have come out in '84 [1984].  Moved to California, remarried--
Speaker 1: You mean the article?
Speaker 2: The article.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Savvy article came out in '84 [1984] or about.  And so, went on 'The Phil Donahue Show,' got lots of letters and I said to her, "Let's just table the novel for a minute, let me just get my foot in the door, why don't I expand this article and do a book on this whole phenomenon."  She said okay and she sold it in a minute.
Speaker 1: Whoa.
Speaker 2: She sold it in a minute and so I was very excited and wrote the book ['Successful Women, Angry Men,' Bebe Moore Campbell], interviewed all these people, all these couples, wrote the book, turned it in and I saw that they were gonna give me a tour.  Now by this time I had been writing for Essence for at least ten years, and I looked at the schedule and, you know, they said, "We're gonna try to get an excerpt in Glamour," and I thought why, why are you doing it in Glamour?  Why don't you do it in Essence?  I've got people who read me in Essence?  "Oh, no."  And I thought, oh they don't have a clue.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They don't have a clue.  So I said, well let me, I said if they don't know what they're doing, this book isn't gonna sell and I'm not gonna be able to write anymore books.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: So I, what I did was I figured out a way to help them sell it, I told them all the places I thought I needed to go, all the radio programs, black radio shows, the magazines, that they should be in touch with this church and that church and the civic organization and that civic organization and they didn't wanna to do it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I said, "Well look, I'll do it.  You just help me a little bit, when I ask for books, you send them to these people and I'll give you the, the template letter," and so they agreed to do that.  And the book sold well enough and so then I got a chance to do another one and the next one was 'Sweet Summer' ['Sweet Summer: Growing Up With and Without My Dad,' Bebe Moore Campbell], and I did the same thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, again I help--
Speaker 1: The formula that works.
Speaker 2: I, I helped them.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so, after that I wanted to do a novel and Random House [Penguin Random House, New York, New York], no it wasn't 'Sweets by Sweet' [ph.], but the second was 'Sweet Summer' with Putnam [G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Random House was interested in it so I went over to Putnam and I met Adrienne Ingram who was my editor and she was a black woman.  And she got where we needed to place this book.  So we really worked it and it, it did well and so then I was able to parlay that into a book contract for the next novel ['Your Blues Ain't Like Mine,' Bebe Moore Campbell] because, while 'Sweet Summer: Growing Up With and Without My Dad' was a memoir, it read like fiction, so they knew I could write fiction. So I got-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I didn't have to write the entire book.  They trusted that I could do it and I just gave them kind of an outline and told them what it would be about and they said, okay fine.
Story_ID: 304076
Speaker 1: Now 'Sweet Summer[: Growing Up With and Without My Dad,' Bebe Moore Campbell], after that they were going to trust you to write (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Your Blues Ain't Like'--
Speaker 1: --your first novel.
Speaker 2: --'Your Blues Ain't Like Mine' [Bebe Moore Campbell].
Speaker 1: 'Your Blues,' right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us about, 'Your Blues Ain't Like Mine.'
Speaker 2: Well, had had a--
Speaker 1: Was based on a very famous incident (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I had thought of this, it had been in my mind for a number of years and that was a fictionalized account of the Emmett Till murder, very fictionalized, because I wanted to look at the aftermath, what happened to the murdered victim's family and what happened to the white family, the murderer's family.  So, I wen- I did that, I, I went to Mississippi, I looked in the archives, I went to where the murder took place, I purposely did not interview Mamie Till at, Emmitt Till's mother, Mamie Till Mobley Todd [sic. Mamie Till-Mobley], I think was her name.  Because I didn't want to set up any false expectations, because I wanted to have really free rein--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --free literary license to do what I wanted and the book came out, it got really, really wonderful reviews, it was on New York Times [The New York Times] notable book of the year, was NAACP Image Award winner and it came out at a time when [HistoryMaker] Terry McMillan's 'Waiting to Exhale' had just hit and Alice Walker, was that 'The Color Purple'?
Speaker 1: 'Color Purple.'
Speaker 2: No.  It wasn't 'The Color Purple', it was the 'Temple of My Familiar' ['The Temple of My Familiar,' Alice Walker] and then Toni Morrison's, I don't know what book Toni had out, but the three of them were on The New York Times bestseller list together, this was in 1992.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was unprecedent- unprecedented that three black women would be on this list and it just really knocked down the myths that the publishing world had been operating under--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and that was myth number one, black people don't read, myth number two, white people don't read things written by black people and myth number three white people don't buy book, I mean--
Speaker 1: Don't by black wr- writers--
Speaker 2: No wait a minute.  Myth number one, black people don't read, myth number two black people don't buy books and myth number three, white people don't read black writers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was just like, nope wrong.  And the publishing world was now looking for particularly another Terry, they wanted Terry McMillan clones, they wanted anybody who could get that kind of success.  And so, you know, when I came up with the next ideas, voila, I had a two book contract.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was a combination of being prepared, having some history and the timing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know?
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: The timing was propitious.
Story_ID: 304077
Speaker 1: Now, you've got this very, very successful novel, 'Your Blues Ain't like Mine' [Bebe Moore Campbell], and what is, but you, you have a two book con--contract?
Speaker 2: No, you know what, that's wrong.  That was followed with 'Brothers and Sisters' [Bebe Moore Campbell]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which was a one book contract.  And that was about the aftermath of the civil unrest in Los Angeles [California] in 1992.  And it looked out, looked at a friendship of black and white friendship trying to get it's footing during those times and that was a very successful, probably the most commercially successful book I've written.  It was on The New York Times bestseller list for a while and that, you know, went to a paperback auction because at that time I was hav- having paperback auctions, I'd get my advance based on the hardcopy and then they--you know, let the word, let the word go out among the paperback publishers and they would come and have a bidding war.  So it went out to paperback auction, great price.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I'd, after that I got a two book deal.
Speaker 1: Oh, after that?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You got a two, two book deal?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  The, the next, the next book, you, you, you've got a two book deal now.
Speaker 2: 'Singing in the Comeback Choir' [Bebe Moore Campbell] and, and then, 'What You Owe Me' [Bebe Moore Campbell].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell us about 'Singing in the Comeback Choir.'  What, what were you?
Speaker 2: That was a book about a the, well it's a book that takes place in Los Angeles and New York [New York] and it's about how a young woman working as a TV producer go- in Los Angeles goes back to her old neighborhood in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], which has become quite, it's deteriorated quite a bit and reclaims her grandmother, who's a former blues and jazz singer, who also has deteriorated her and it's a book about the resurrection of both the neighborhood and the, and the grandmother.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay.  And that of course did very, very well--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --al- also.  You're now developing a style that's unique to you or it appears to me, maybe I'm wrong on, on that.  But people are reading your books.  You're one of the most celebrated, I think of black women writers in, in the country if not just black writers.  And, where, where, where are you going next, with your next novel and what's behind it?
Speaker 2: Well the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm trying to--
Speaker 2: --latest--
Speaker 1: --get behind each one.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  'What You Owe Me' followed 'Singing in the Comeback Choir,' and that was probably going back a little bit to my childhood, looking at the relationships I'd had with Jewish girls and Jewish women.  This is a book that follows a black women and a Jewish women, woman who work as maids in a hotel right after World War II [WWII], the Jewish woman is a Holocaust survivor, the two become friends and then form a business, there's a betrayal and the story is how that betrayal reverberates throughout their lives and even the lives of their children.  The book that followed that is my latest one, and that's called '72 Hour Hold' [Bebe Moore Campbell], and that novel, the title refers to the length of time a psychiatric facility can hold a mentally ill person against his or her will if he or she meets the criteria of a danger to self or a danger to others or gravely disabled.  And I have a mentally ill family member, so this is a book that came out of my knowledge of this world.  I've been at this time, on an almost nine year old journey with my loved one who has bipolar disorder.  And so this story is about a mother who has a child with bipolar disorder, the lengths to which she goes to seek healing for that child.  How she becomes fed up with the mental health system and opts for an illegal intervention by a group of renegade psychologists and psychiatrists who take the mother and the daughter on a journey to a place where she can heal and the gist of the story takes place on that journey.
Story_ID: 304078
Speaker 1: Now you've followed this along in a number of personal ways, first of all like, you started the NAMI [National Alliance on Mental Illness] chapter here in Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 2: I co-founded it.
Speaker 1: You co-founded it.
Speaker 2: With some other people.  Yeah I, in my own journey with my own loved one, I needed some support and I got, I found out about the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, or NAMI, and started going, I took their class which is a twelve week course on the diseases of the brain, then I joined their support group and they also have a support group for people with mental illnesses.  And after doing that I took teacher training and then when, some other people we opened up our own chapter, NAMI Inglewood [Inglewood, California], which is in a pre- predominately African American community.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Right, right.  And you participate in raising money for your chapter or for the national?
Speaker 2: Yeah, what I've done, yeah absolutely, we just had a great big walk, which was a major fundraiser, we had that on Saturday.  What I do is, I do a lot of speaking for mental health organizations and as part of the book tour, '72 Hour Hold' [Bebe Moore Campbell] was successful in getting July declared National Minority Mental Health Month [Minority Mental Health Awareness Month].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which is a month that, I'm hoping churches, civic organizations, radios, TV, PSAs will go out and will get some education and some de-stigmatization around the issue of mental illness particularly in communities of color.
Speaker 1: Right, so you, you feel that a special effort has to be made for people of color?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, I mean, every one, no one wants to say, I'm not in control of my mind, regardless of their race, but people of color, particularly African Americans really react adversely to being seen as having another deficit.  We know that in a race conscious society we already have one deficit, so we don't wanna have to own up to having another one, so we go right into denial.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so you're trying to combat that?
Speaker 2: I am.
Story_ID: 304079
Speaker 1: And help me if I'm leaving out any important questions of information that we need to get to.  I do want to go back and visit a little on your second marriage.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That happened after you moved out here?
Speaker 2: No, I met my husband, Ellis Gordon, Jr. in 1983, when I was visiting a friend out here [Los Angeles, California] and after a long distance courtship, we got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You want to tell us about some of those initial vibrations that attracted?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, I, I always say I fell in like--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I really liked him right away.  And he's easy to talk to and he's always been my biggest booster.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We used to sell books out of the, we'd take the remainders of 'Successful Women, Angry Men' [Bebe Moore Campbell] and sell them out of the trunk of the car.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And right now, he handles a lot of my speaking engagements, sets them up, gets the flight information, that kind of, those kind of details.  He got my website up and running, he reserved my domain name, you know, couple years before we even used it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, he really is the wind beneath my wings.
Story_ID: 304080
Speaker 1: All right, I wanna be sure that there is nothing else that we need to, or areas that we need to visit on your books, you know, something behind them, although I think you've sort of given us an idea of what's behind most of your books.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I'm now with Knopf [Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.; Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, New York, New York], Knopf is the publisher of '72 Hour Hold' [Bebe Moore Campbell], so my first book was Random House [Penguin Random House, New York, New York].  A number of the books were with Putnam Penguin Putnam [G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York, New York] and now I'm with Knopf for my novels and I have another, I just signed a contract for the next novel.  In between '72 Hour Hold' and 'What you Owe Me' [Bebe Moore Campbell], I wrote a children's book.
Speaker 1: Oh, let's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Which is for--
Speaker 1: --talk about that.
Speaker 2: --Penguin Putnam.  And it was again, on the topic of mental illness, it's called, 'Sometimes My Mommy Gets Angry' [Bebe Moore Campbell], and it's a book about a little girl whose mother has bi- untreated bipolar disorder and it teaches children resiliency when they have unstable parents.  I've since written for Penguin Putnam, two other children's books.  The second one will be out this year, it's called, 'Stompin' at the Savoy' [Bebe Moore Campbell] and it teamed me with the renowned and fabulous artist Richard Yarde, who is a marvelous and arguably foremost water colorist in America today.  He had done a series on the Savoy Ballroom [New York, New York], that legendary dance hall of the '20s [1920s], '30s, [1930s], '40s [1940s], were people were Lindy hopping and he was approached by a publishing company to do a book and he asked me to write it.  I own several of Richard's paintings. And we've become friends and the illustrations are just gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous, so I've got--
Speaker 1: And when does that come up?
Speaker 2: That'll be out 2006, May 2006.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, following that, May 2000, 2007, at some point, I have another children's book called, 'Sometimes I Get so Hungry' ['I Get So Hungry,' Bebe Moore Campbell] and it's about an overweight little girl who is motivated when her overweight teacher loses weight.  And I really wanted to address this obesity epidemic among little girls particularly, girls of color and to kind of teach them early on, ways in which they can maintain their ideal weights.
Speaker 1: So even though you're devoting a lot of your time and energy to writing, you still are donating that teaching effort to try to get a lot of social problems and correct or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well yeah, that's--
Speaker 1: --informing people.
Speaker 2: --that's what I'm attracted too, yeah, that's the kind of work I'm attracted too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you get a chance to just relax and--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I do.
Speaker 1: You do?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I have friends and I go to the movies and I work out and, I go out to lunch and get my nails done, so I do all of that.
Speaker 1: All, all of those things.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is there any period of your life that we've neglected to ask you about?  Can you think of anything?
Speaker 2: Not really because--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I think it's been pretty in depth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I can't think of anything.

Speaker 1: What would you like your legacy to be?  You've done so many things, so many wonderful things, what would you like your legacy to be?  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well there's the, the, there's an old saying, you, you asked me earlier, that, that one, when you're going through hell, keep going.  I, I think she kept going, she kept going.  Because certainly those five years of rejection were hell, that was hell and having a mentally ill loved one is hell.  But, I think that which does not kill us makes us stronger, I certainly tried not to let a little adversity take away my joy.  I fought for my joy.  So I kept going.

Speaker 1: And, for those who have mentally challenged or members of their family, loved ones, would you offer any particular advice to the parents and friends.
Speaker 2: Well, I say seek help and seek support for yourself.  This is for the family members because there's always two victims, when someone has a mental illness, there's a person with the illness, and then there's the person who is loving and trying to care for that person.  So, get support for yourself and find a way to maintain your joy, maintain your stability.
Speaker 1: Okay and I think I've asked you if there's anything I've left out.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, since there isn't, we want to thank you very much for this interview.  It's been a wonderful--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --experience and one, on this thank you very, very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
