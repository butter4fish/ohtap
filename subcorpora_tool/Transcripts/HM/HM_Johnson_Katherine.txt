Speaker 2: Coleman.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: June 15--I have no idea when her birth year, and she died in 1970, I think.  She was 85 years old.  That's about as close as I can get.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, we're talking about--
Speaker 2: I can give you that later.
Speaker 1: So she was born in the 1890s.
Speaker 2: Oh?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, tell us what you know about your mother's side of the family and how far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: Well, I can trace you back to her father and to her mother's father.  She was born in North Carolina, but grew up in Danville, Virginia.  Her father was a minister, I think.
Speaker 1: What town in North Carolina was she born in?
Speaker 2: Ruffin [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Ruffin, okay, R-U-F-F-I-N?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right, and she grew up in Danville, Virginia?
Speaker 2: Danville, Virginia, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you say her father was a minister, you think?
Speaker 2: Yes, but he died when she was very young.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories from her side of the family that are passed down about what life was like?
Speaker 2: She had two brothers and one sister.  I knew only the sister.  The brothers had died, I suppose.  Her sister was Lelia Lowe.  She was a teacher.
Speaker 1: L-Y-D-I-A?
Speaker 2: Lelia, L-E-L-I-A.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, Lelia.
Speaker 2: Lelia W. Lowe.
Speaker 1: And she was a teacher.  Now, did she go to one of the black colleges or did she--
Speaker 2: Oh, I think she finally got a graduate, she got her degree from Virginia State [Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] or West Virginia State [West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia].  She went to both of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's my aunt.  And my mother went to Ingleside Seminary, and she was a teacher also.
Speaker 1: Ingleside Seminary.
Speaker 2: Ingleside, yes, that's up here in Virginia--it used to be.  I think it's I-N-G-L-E or maybe Ingleside.
Speaker 1: Now, was she trained as a teacher there at Ingleside?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Her first teaching position, she was 18, and so was I.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Did your mother have any stories that she passed down to you about her family or growing up that you can share with us?
Speaker 2: Other than the fact, nothing special.  They really had a hard time because the father died early and the mother had four children to raise, you know, the usual story.  But they made it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did her mother do for a living?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: She was a seamstress.  And my mom was a seamstress as well as a teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right--
Speaker 2: And I and all my children came right along.  We can do it too.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she passed the skill down to everybody?
Speaker 2: Right on down.
Story_ID: 20610
Speaker 1: Okay, now, let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Joshua McKinley Coleman, and if--when did you say my mother was born?
Speaker 1: In the 1890s it seems, you know.  She was 85 in 1970, you say?
Speaker 2: Something like that.
Speaker 1: So that means she was born about 1885, I guess.
Speaker 2: Okay, then he was born in 1880 if she was born then 'cause he was five years older than she.  He died in 1973, I think.  That's about right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was your father born?
Speaker 2: He was born in White Sulphur [White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia].
Speaker 1: So he was born in White Sulphur Springs.  Now, what do you know about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Not too far except that they go back--the second generation back, he was an Indian, his grandfather was an Indian.  And I was so proud of that.  They were from Warm Springs, Virginia, his family.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you know what Indian nation or group he was from?
Speaker 2: No, I've never followed up on it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you know your grandfather?
Speaker 2: No, I knew my father's stepmother; didn't know his father and I didn't know my mother's parents--I knew my mother's mother, didn't know the, they'd all died.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did your father's family own land?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and is there a story about how the family got land in--
Speaker 2: Excuse me?
Speaker 1: Is there any story about how his family acquired land?
Speaker 2: They'd always had it so far as we knew, and daddy sold the farm, we had a large farm outside of town, which he sold when we, just before we went away to high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were all born in the country, and then daddy moved to town so we could go to school.  And then after that, at some point, he sold the farm, gave up farming and worked at the Greenbrier [The Greenbrier Resort, White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia], and we went from there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Greenbrier is a hotel ,right?
Speaker 2: Yes, famous hotel in White Sulphur Springs.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did your father have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: He went to school as far as he could go which was the sixth grade.  And I thought he was the smartest person in the world.  I thought he knew the answer to everything.  He was a, he was a smart man.  And I recall that we had a real tough arithmetic book, and he, if I ran into a problem, I couldn't work, I'd just read it to him.  And he'd tell me the answer.  He was good.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, I read that he really could answer some of the problems that the teachers couldn't answer, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  The principal of the school lived with us.  And if he'd have trouble with problems, just ask Josh.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: My mother was a teacher, and she didn't throw it around, and daddy didn't throw his intelligence around.  He was a very intelligent person.
Story_ID: 20611
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story about how they met, how your parents met?
Speaker 2: I just know that she came to White Sulphur [White Sulphur Springs] for her health when she was about 18 or so.  And she met him there at the Greenbrier through some relative.  And my ma took him away from all the girls.  He was the most eligible bachelor in White Sulphur.  He raised horses, raised horses, had--on the farm, he still had a bevy of good horses.  And he was an eligible bachelor.  She picked him off.
Speaker 1: Okay, what is the significance of White Sulphur Springs?  Is there--
Speaker 2: Excuse me?
Speaker 1: What is the significance of White Sulphur Springs?  Does it have some medicinal properties or something?  Is that what the White Sulphur is about?
Speaker 2: Well, there are white sulphur Springs.  There's blue sulphur springs, there's green, you know.  And it just is--it is famous for the springs.  The Greenbrier was built around the springs and the very, very rich came there for their health.  And because of the springs, the white sulphur springs.
Speaker 1: Okay, were they warm or did they have some kind of--
Speaker 2: No, I think they just drank from there.  And you could smell it when you got close to the spring.  Of course, I grew up [there].  I never could smell it, but other people could.  When you're around, got to the springs, you could tell you were there, and a very famous place.
Story_ID: 20612
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, when you think about your parents personalities, their looks, their talents, their dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, I was known as a daddy's girl, just because he was my favorite parent, but they were both very intelligent and very well liked all over.  So I don't know whom I would say I take after, some of both of them.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: An earliest?
Speaker 1: Childhood memory.
Speaker 2: No, I can go way back (laughter).  When we left the farm and moved to town, I just remember the bushels of apples sitting on a--see daddy had an apple orchard.  And he would bring the apples down, and that was my first memory, of these bushels of apples sitting on the back porch.  There's a picture of our house I brought for you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so we always ask this question and I guess you can, 'cause you really grew up in two places, right, in White Sulphur Springs and in Institute [Institute, West Virgiia]--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --West Virginia.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds?
Speaker 1: And smells, right, of growing up?
Speaker 2: It was just an average town.  Whites and blacks played together, had fun, and I had a very happy childhood.  I remember playing, and we were, all whole street was black, whites on the next street.  But it didn't make any difference.
Speaker 1: Now, is this in Institute or--
Speaker 2: No, this is in White Sulphur where I grew up.  I was in White Sulphur until I was 10.  That's when we moved to Institute.  We'd go down in September.  Daddy rented a house, and we would live till the first of June.  Then we'd come back home, every year.  For eight years, the whole family did that, and daddy stayed at White Sulphur and worked.
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on it, do you think that was sacrifice for your father to make?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think it was a sacrifice for the two of them, but it was just one of those things.  Whatever the parents said you do, you do it.  So we'd go, move down there and move back, no big thing.
Speaker 1: Now, who did you stay with when you were in Institute?
Speaker 2: Daddy would rent a house.  We'd have a whole house, and the house would just be there until we got back in the fall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We lived in several places because the place was not designed for that.  People thought it strange.  When we went to Institute, daddy went over to the president and asked, told him that he wanted to move his family there.  And the president told him there were no jobs available.  So he said, well, I just have to stay home.  But he would move us down.  Then he stayed at home and worked at the Greenbrier all the year.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is the president of West Virginia State College [West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia].
Speaker 2: West Virginia State, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Then, but it's West Virginia State University now.  But it was college then, right?
Speaker 2: West Virginia State University now.  West Virginia University is still itself.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  So this is at West Virginia State, and he thought if he could get a job there, he could stay too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but no jobs so he stayed at home.  It worked out fine, except for the parents.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did your mother stay there with you?
Speaker 2: The mother and the four children stayed at Institute.  Daddy stayed at home alone.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went to school, all of your schooling was at West Virginia State?
Speaker 2: From the eighth grade.  When we moved to Institute in 1928, I was in the eighth grade and went to that one year and college--elementary school, then went four years in their high school, then went to college.  All of us did the same thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was--
Speaker 2: I was the youngest.
Story_ID: 20613
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What was your first school in White Sulphur Springs?  What was the school and--
Speaker 2: It was a two-room school, and it graduated to a three-room school.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of it?
Speaker 2: White Sulphur Grade School, I think it was called.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then when they built the new school, the new school was Bethune Elementary School [Mary McLeod Bethune Elementary School].  I don't remember what year we went into that school.
Speaker 1: So were you still in school when they built it?
Speaker 2: I was in it, uh-huh.  I was in White Sulphur when we moved into the new elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was named after Mary McCleod Bethune, I guess?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, okay.  So did you have a, were there any special teachers or role models other than your family members when you were--
Speaker 2: Well, Ms., Mrs. Leftwich was my first teacher.  She was visiting at my home when I was four years old, lying on the floor reading the paper.  And she was talking to my mother and began, and I said, Ms. Leftwich, no need to spell, I can spell.  And she (laughter), ma had tried to tell her, just talk naturally.  So she was so impressed that she had a little summer school that summer for me and a couple of the other kids.  And when we went to school in the fall, I went right to the second grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you could read when you were four years old?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: When did you learn how to--
Speaker 2: My mother was a teacher, you know.  No attention was paid toward me.  I was the youngest.  Everybody could read, so I learned to read.
Story_ID: 20614
Speaker 1: Do you remember how young you were when you learned how to read?
Speaker 2: I must have been about four.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Four or five.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, you had a head start on some of the other (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Well, you see I had three older brothers and sisters.  And they were studying so I would meddle.  I was a very meddlesome, inquisitive person.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, that's good actually, isn't it?
Speaker 2: I maybe it was.
Speaker 1: When you look back at it, it's a good thing.
Speaker 2: Yes, (unclear) I'm (unclear) mention it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's funny, the way, the term "meddlesome", people would use that, but kids would--
Speaker 2: I was inquisitive.  I wanted to know why everything was this.  And my mother looked out one day, and I was not in the yard, and she was "where is"?  So Mrs. Tate said, she went off to school with the rest of the children.  So I would slip off from home, and my mom would look for me, and I'd be up at the school.
Speaker 1: So when you were at the school, would you go to class or?
Speaker 2: Well, I would slip in there too, and I would go and sit with my oldest brother who was a slow learner.  And I would be sitting in the seat with him, and the teacher would have a fit.  But they lived with it.  So then she, by the time I got to school, you see, I was already (laughter) in the second grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you were way ahead.  Now, did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: No, liked them all.  Math was not my favorite.  I just liked learning.  I have always enjoyed learning.  And I use that expression in all, every speech I make.  You've got to want to learn.
Speaker 1: And your parents encouraged you, from what I understand, they encouraged that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  So when White Sulphur had no school for blacks other--than up through the eighth grade at that time.  Now, when daddy was growing up, he only could go to the sixth.  That's where it cut off.  But then when we got up to the eighth grade, you had to go away to high school.  So that's how all of this started.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now had you--when the family moved to Institute for the school year, had you ever been there before?  Was it a shock or--
Speaker 2: It was a, no, just--it was shock in that each school class had a different room, a different teacher for every, you know.  And I was accustomed to one teacher teaching the first four grades and so on.  So it was different but that's just the way it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you adjusted pretty fast to it?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Story_ID: 20615
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, who were some of your favorite teachers at West Virginia State?
Speaker 2: Where, in White Sulphur?  Mrs. Leftwich and Mr. Otter (ph.) was the principal of the school.  And they were the two, and then when they got a third teacher, she became the, between them, she was a Miss Leftwich.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there was a Mrs. Leftwich and a Ms. Leftwich?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Rosa Leftwich and Miss Lottie Leftwich.  And Professor, Mr. Charles S. Otter was the principal.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what about at Institute, Institute of West Virginia.
Speaker 2: Oh, I cannot remember all of the, right now, all the elementary, and I can't remember all the high school teachers either.  Now, I had favorite high school teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you don't remember the elementary ones, I mean the ones in eighth grade?
Speaker 2: I remember the names of those that I liked best.  Angie Turner King was the math teacher at the high school, and I couldn't wait.  My brother was taking Geometry.  I couldn't wait to get to high school to have Geometry under Ms. Turner.
Speaker 1: Now, why was that so special?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  It just was.  I couldn't wait.  And guess what happened when I got to high school?  I had Algebra under Ms. Turner, and then she left to work on her doctorate.  I had somebody else in Geometry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But all the teachers at West Virginia State were good teachers.  So I had no special favorite other than Ms. Turner.
Speaker 1: Was it unusual for a woman to be a math teacher?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: It wasn't?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Not unusual at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Angie Turner King and in high school, it seems like there was a couple of others that I wrote down.  Let's see.
Speaker 2: I can't hear you.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, I'm--
Speaker 2: Oh, you're talking to yourself?
Speaker 1: Yes, right, (laughter).  But what about Ms. Lacey?  Was she in college or in high school?
Speaker 2: She was in college.
Speaker 1: College, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And she lived with some friends of mine.  And in the middle of my freshman year, I recall specifically walking across the campus.  They had gotten rid of all women teachers--that was during the Depression, remember that.  And married women could not teach.  So she said, I'm teaching again, and if you're not in my math class this semester, I'm gonna come get you.  So I went into her math class the second semester of my freshman year, 'cause I liked everything.  I had not made up my mind what I would major in.  So I didn't have any math in my freshman year, until I saw Ms. Lacey, and you better believe I joined.  She was an excellent teacher.
Speaker 1: Well, let me take you back to high school before we get in college.  But, in fact, we're gonna pause right now for a second.  And then we'll pick back up.
Story_ID: 20616
Speaker 1: Okay, now high school.  As you said, you grew up during the Great Depression.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you have any sense that you were growing up during a Great Depression?  Did you feel like everybody was poor, the economic--the economy was down?
Speaker 2: That's about how we felt.  Everybody around us had the same thing, you know, no great deal of difference.  I was--my two best friends were the president's daughter and there was a school for the deaf and blind there.  His daughter, the three of ran together.  And I didn't see any great deal of difference.
Speaker 1: Okay, who was the president then?
Speaker 2: Shawn W. Davis was the president of West Virginia State [West Virginia State High School].  One of my children is named for one of his, Connie.
Speaker 1: And what was your friend's name?  What was his daughter's name?
Speaker 2: Constance.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they called her Ditt.  They called his middle daughter Dot.  Then he married again, and they had a younger child.  So he told us on the--he was making a speech and he said, he married again, had a--they were expecting a daughter and her name was gonna be Dash to the campus, so Dit, Dot and Dash.  And she was, when she was born, they called her Dash.  To this day, they call her Dash.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Do you know why he chose to do that or was there a reason for that?
Speaker 2: He said the students had named her.  They had told him that we're gonna call this one "Dash" when it was born.  And when she was born, they called her Dash.  That wasn't her name, but that's what, Ditt, Dot and Dash.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I've interviewed a lot of, well, a few people that went to West Virginia State, and they have a lot of fond memories of the school.  And they talk about the community there and the institute.  Did you--what was it like to go to school there?
Speaker 2: Well, I enjoyed living just across the street from the college.  I knew every student, every teacher, and just treated the campus like a part of the community.  And it was a--for me, it was an ideal place in which to grow up.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the people that you met on campus that you probably would not have met in White Sulphur Springs [West Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Everybody, because these were all educated people, and White Sulphur Springs was not known for educated whites or blacks.  So I enjoyed being around smart people from the minute I got there.  And I just enjoyed, flourished there.  I, as I said, I knew every student, and my brothers and sisters were not quite as open as I was.  They didn't know everybody, but I knew everybody.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I take it everybody knew you too?
Speaker 2: Oh, couldn't help it, 'cause we skated from one end of the campus to the other.  Everybody knew everybody.
Story_ID: 20617
Speaker 1: Now, would some of the well-known black speakers or authors come to the campus to talk?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, you had every--as a matter of fact, after integration, NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] brought in speakers.  I knew every speaker they brought in.  They had wondered how could I know them.  They had spoken at West Virginia State [West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia].  All the artists, the singers, all those people would come to our campus.  Well, you did to all black campuses.  You had the Sunday night chapel.  You had every famous person in the United States who was doing anything would be a speaker.  So see, that's--
Speaker 1: Well, who were some of the ones that you saw?
Speaker 2: Name one?  Carter Woodson--
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know.  Let's see--
Speaker 2: I can't possibly remember them all, they all--they were all--
Speaker 1: Did, Marion Anderson, for instance, did she come?
Speaker 2: Yes, and Dr. Mays [Dr. Benjamin Mays], Mordecai Johnson.  They were all, anybody who was anybody.
Speaker 1: Dr. Dubois [Dr. W.E.B. Dubois]?
Speaker 2: Yep, he came to West Virginia State.  But he went to all, you know, they went to all the black colleges.  So we were well exposed to the best.
Speaker 1: Well, what's special as I'm hearing your story that I'm thinking that you got a chance to see them while you were still in eighth grade, high school?
Speaker 2: That's right, impressionable and I, you know, they, some of them would stay at the president's house.  So I know them, and I was in and out of there all the time.  He lost his first wife, I was still in high school.  It was a very sad, very sad time.  Then after a period of time, he remarried, and they had a daughter.  So then he had the three daughters, Ditt, Dot and Dash.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have a chance to--is there any person who came to the campus that you remember a story about?  I mean do you remember anything special about Dubois or--
Speaker 2: Nothing special, other than that I would get to meet them all.
Speaker 1: Can you think of anyone that you were more excited about than another?
Speaker 2: Didn't have sense enough (laughter).  No, every--you know, they were there, and they were famous people.  But they were just like anybody else when they'd come to the president's house.
Story_ID: 20618
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you family get--what newspapers did they get?  Did they get the black papers at home?
Speaker 2: Yes, and the white, and my brothers delivered two papers a day, the 'Charleston Gazette' in the morning and the 'Daily Mayor' in the afternoon.  And I was tagging along.  And there are people to this day who owe us for those papers (laughter).  Why do people hate to pay the paperboy?  Yep.  One brother delivered milk, and this other brother delivered the newspapers every day.  My brothers were very industrious.  One of them, the one who died early, owned property by the time we graduated.  And he went to school and had a job.  Those were great days.
Story_ID: 20619
Speaker 1: Now, in high school you graduated was magna cum laude or--
Speaker 2: Can't hear you.
Speaker 1: Now, did you graduate at the top of your high school class when you graduated?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you were magna cum laude, I think or--
Speaker 2: No, that was in college.
Speaker 1: College, okay.
Speaker 2: I was summa cum laude in college.
Speaker 1: Okay, summa.
Speaker 2: The one, that year only, summa cum laude they had.
Speaker 1: Okay, but I don't want us to get ahead.  I just wanted to--so in high school--
Speaker 2: I was--
Speaker 1: You came out in the top--
Speaker 2: That didn't make a big fuss.  It was a very small high school.
Speaker 1: How many were in your class about?
Speaker 2: I guess there were a 150 maybe in the whole high school, some smart kids there though.  And--
Speaker 1: Well, who were some of your classmates, for instance, that you remember?
Speaker 2: I can remember them all (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Jim Nappa and Brownie, and I, the three of us graduated from the eighth grade together, graduated from high school together and college, and we have pictures of each time.  We stayed friends--I just lost them the past several years since I've been here.  Brownie died, I think, but Jim Nappa was living in California, and I lost contact with him, but I'm still in contact with his wife who stayed this side.  She lives in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you were in high school, now, this is the mid 1930s, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, mid-1930's--
Speaker 2: I graduated from high school in 1933.
Story_ID: 20620
Speaker 1: Oh, that's the early--okay.  Did, how did your family feel--what was going on, I guess in terms of civil rights in the area?
Speaker 2: Nothing much.  Well, you see Institute was a black, little black town.  There were no whites involved at all there.  And at that time, I don't recall a single white professor.  At that time, all the professors were black.  And we wouldn't, other than just the normal segregated system, we didn't have any friction at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was sort of isolated and--
Speaker 2: Excuse me?
Speaker 1: It was sort of encapsulated, the town.
Speaker 2: That's right.  We knew when we went to the next town (laughter), Dunbar, oh, boy, you'd know right away.  But we didn't have to go out of our town for anything.  For any big shopping and sewing, you went to Charleston anyway.  So you knew when you got there you were black.
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean how did they let you know?
Speaker 2: Like they always do.  It was no friction, but it was segregated, definitely segregated.  In Charleston, you had black theaters, black hotels.  It was a nice place.
Story_ID: 20621
Speaker 1: Now, what did you like to do for fun when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Skate.  We skated, we hiked.  Those were the principle methods of, patterns of entertainment for kids.  And they were building, they built the first cement highway through Institute, and we skated on top of that.  So we had a delightful time.
Speaker 1: So you would hike for fun in those days?
Speaker 2: Hiking.
Speaker 1: Hiking.
Speaker 2: We had a hike, every Saturday we went somewhere, up in the mountains, places you'd never been.  And that was the normal pastime for village kids.  We went hiking.
Speaker 1: Was the scenery pretty--
Speaker 2: Excuse me?
Speaker 1: Was the landscape pretty?
Speaker 2: Oh, West Virginia State was down in the valley and you were surrounded by mountains.  So you just picked one.  We went, just made paths through there.  And my brother went over to the next town, way--I didn't ever do it but he did it.  And he met people who there who'd never seen Negros before, strange.  It was an interesting time and place in which to grow up.  Everybody had a car except us (laughter).  We couldn't afford a car.
Speaker 1: Now, did you parents have to pay tuition at West Virginia State?
Speaker 2: Yes, but tuition as I recall was $25.00 a semester.  And I remember that my senior year, my junior and senior year, I had a job.  I can't remember the name of it.  And we, anyway, part of it, your, your salary went to the college.  My mother went over to pay the tuition and they told her, said, oh, Katherine has paid everybody's tuition.  They took that out of the money that I made, and it was very interesting so I don't, you know, I wasn't aware that I was paying it.  It was interesting.  But everybody worked somehow and helped out getting us through college.
Story_ID: 20622
Speaker 1: Okay, at the--when you were in high or when you were young, did you have any concept of space travel?
Speaker 2: Excuse me.
Speaker 1: Did you have any concept of space travel?
Speaker 2: Space?
Speaker 1: Yeah, did you ever think about that or--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't learn about that until I came to NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration].
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wondered.  I mean even in the movies or in the paper or did anybody ever talk going to outer space?
Speaker 2: I don't recall thinking about it at all until I was working for NASA.
Speaker 1: Really, to put it in perspective, I guess rockets were actually new then, right, the concept of a rocket was something new?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We didn't give that too much attention at all.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were in college, had the government--I read somewhere in the literature that the government training some black pilots or they funded training for black pilots--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at West Virginia State.
Speaker 2: Mr. Evans, who later became the assistant, one of the assistant secretaries of defense was head of the trade and technical department at West Virginia State.  I worked in his office the last year of my high school career, last two years.  My mother told him that--she went over and asked him could he find something for me to do.  I had too much spare time.  So he said, send her over, I'll give her something to do.  And at the end of the first year, I just was a handy person, you know, around the office.  He handed me a ream of paper, a typing textbook and a typewriter and said when you come back in September, I want you to be able to type.  So I was.  And then I became his (unclear) [HNSA?] in his office.  Well, then he was a very, very smart person and long, thinking ahead.  And he was instrumental in getting those guys started into it since we had an airport down, off the campus.  And so we thought Tuskegee Airmen belonged to us.
Speaker 1: Do you remember a man named John Whitehead?  He was one of the Tuskegee Airmen, I think, that flew out of West Virginia State.
Speaker 2: No, but I knew the first five that went West Virginia State.  I probably can't think of 'em all, of their names right now.  But we stayed friends for years, but there were five guys who went to Tuskegee from West Virginia State.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I just wanted to raise that, just to let--
Speaker 2: Excuse me?
Speaker 1: I just wanted to raise that so that anybody listening to this would know that, you know, what was going on--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --in those days in terms of aeronautics and space-type thinking, and there wasn't a lot of thinking about outer space or going into space then, right?
Speaker 2: Not too much that I recall.
Story_ID: 20623
Speaker 1: Okay, at West Virginia State college, now you joined the AKA's [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were you the first member of your family to be an AKA?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, there, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was your aunt a member?
Speaker 2: Excuse me?
Speaker 1: Was your aunt a member of AKA?
Speaker 2: No, but she was at some, she was down in Danley (unclear).  She became an AKA.  I think I was "the" first AKA.  My sister was not interested in the sororities nor were my brothers interested in fraternities.  But it was there, and I joined right there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a pin indicating that I have been an AKA for 75 years.
Story_ID: 20624
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  I didn't realize that.  Okay, all right.  Now, I read that one of your mentors at West Virginia State was a fellow named John F. Matthews?
Speaker 2: Oh, Dr. Matthews.  He spoke only seven languages.  He was my French teacher, and we were great friends.  He came here shortly, for a short time, and I got to be friendly with him and his wife again.  He was a smart man, Dr. John Matthews.
Speaker 1: Now, I read that he had served in Liberia in President Tubman's administration?
Speaker 2: And there was another though who had served there ahead of him, Mr., can't think of--he had been business manager, and he went to Africa first as an ambassador.  I can't remember his name.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you majoring in French at first, I believe, right?
Speaker 2: Right, French and Math.
Speaker 1: Now, what did you envision--did you envision yourself becoming a French teacher or--
Speaker 2: Yes, and I was.  I've taught both French and Math and enjoyed teaching.  But Dr. Claytor told me--I guess I was a freshman, he said, you'd make a good research mathematician.  I said, what do they do?  He said, you'll have to find that out.  But he said, I'm going to prepare you to be a research mathematician.  So he, I took all the courses that were in the catalog.  Then he added a couple more.  So when I graduated, I had 24 hours of college Math.  When I came to Langley, I didn't have to take an examination for that reason.  I had so many hours in Math.  And he was right.  I, he--I said, "Where would I get a job like that?", and he said, "You'll find one."  And everywhere I went, everybody knew that I was a math teacher, but I wanted to be a research mathematician.  And I have a brother-in-law here, he said, you know, they've just taken on black mathematicians at Langley.  So I came home with him that summer to visit and applied for a job and got it in a year.  So at the end of the year, I--we came here to live, and I substituted at the schools around and was appointed at Langley in June of 1953.
Story_ID: 20625
Speaker 1: Now, let me go back a little bit, now, you graduated from West Virginia State in 19--
Speaker 2: Thirty seven [1937].
Speaker 1: Thirty seven [1937], right?
Speaker 2: And I went to Marion, Virginia and taught two years.  Then I went from there to Morgantown, and then meanwhile, I had married a man who had just graduated and had come back to Marion to live.
Speaker 1: Now, this is Mr. Gobel, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  And I went away, I went off to Morgantown to teach and, of course, at the end of that year, then I gave up teaching and came to Marion to live.  And that was in 1934--that was 1940.
Speaker 1: Okay, so during the War [World War II], you were teaching school basically?
Speaker 2: Part of the time, uh-huh.  Most of the time I was having children.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Had three girls.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then Jimmy got sick one year, and I taught the rest of his year, and then he, when he got well, we went to Bluefield, Virginia.  That was our next place.  And he had a teaching position, and then I became a part-time teacher there.  And then he moved, we moved to--no, that wasn't--because I have taught in Marion, Morgantown and Bluefield, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Now, where did you meet Mr. Gobel?
Speaker 2: It was the second half of the second year that I was there.  He came home for Christmas and we met there and started dating.  And we married the next summer or summertime.  He had a flashy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a good man.  We were living, I came home to Marion to live, and he became ill, and he gave up teaching.  And we went back to White Sulphur, and we were living there.  And he was teaching some place else, coming home on Friday.  I kind of got mixed up as to how long it was.  At the end of the year, we just, he didn't like--we were coming here just to visit.  Oh, I know, his sister got married.  And we went to Marion for her wedding.  In the meantime, the grandfather died, and we stayed over longer, and that's when we had this conversation with Margaret.  She said, what are you gonna do when you go home?  I said, nothing.  She said, well, come and go home with me for a couple of weeks.  And when her husband came in, he said, why don't you both go, and I'll get you both a job.  And just like that, we moved here to Newport News [Virginia].  And I got the job.  Jimmy worked in the shipyard, and I went to NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] wasn't NASA then, right?  It was the--
Speaker 2: No, it was NACA.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what did that stand for?
Speaker 2: [Pause].
Speaker 1: I didn't want to stump you, I just--
Speaker 2: Committee for aeronautics.
Speaker 1: Right, National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So, it was right here in Hampton, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it didn't get the name NASA until '58' [1958].
Speaker 2: Fifty eight [1958] when they decided to go into space.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's when they discovered that we were already in space.  We were already studying it.  We had written a textbook, first textbook on space, and we were right there from the very beginning.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nobody knew anything about anything.  And we just got our textbooks and bought of a globe of the earth here and the out of space with the stars (unclear).  We started from scratch.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're gonna pause here again.  He has to make another note.
Story_ID: 20626
Speaker 1: Okay, so, yeah, so you started in '53' [1953], 1953, and--
Speaker 2: I would say we started studying the space, maybe '55' [1955], '56' [1956].  It was '58' [1958] when we really made the change.  We were way, way--had been working on space for three years.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what--I know the United States was studying rocket technology and, for the, I guess for the purpose of delivering bombs, right, in those days?  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Purpose of delivering?
Speaker 1: Bombs.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yep, we worked on that too.  How the planes, the B-54's would fly and be inverted to drop the bombs.
Speaker 1: Now, your daughter was telling me before we started the interview that a lot of what you did was top secret.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you couldn't really discuss what you were doing?
Speaker 2: No, with anybody.  And further, we hardly knew ourselves what we were working on.  When we first started, we worked for a section called PARD, Pilotless Aircraft Research Department.  They were doing it, and they farmed some of the work out on us.  And that's how I got so deeply involved so early in the Space Program.
Story_ID: 20627
Speaker 1: Now, explain this to me, I was reading that initially the black people who were working as mathematicians were segregated in one office and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as a pool, a resource pool.
Speaker 2: But there was a pool of white mathematicians, women, and a pool of black mathematicians.
Speaker 1: But they had them segregated in terms of women?
Speaker 2: They were separated, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there were black women in one pool and white women in another pool?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And they kept all the women separated from the men mathematicians?
Speaker 2: As such, the guys would come over with work and pass it out.  And I didn't know about the white ones.  There's a, one of those pictures I showed you, you see where the head calculators wore skirts, one of the pictures that Kathy was showing you.  They had a big convention when calculators wore skirts (laughter).  We did all the hand work on a desk calculator, Friedan (ph.), Monroe, and I don't remember the name of the others, but those were the big hand calculators, 12 digits down and 12 across.  And we did all that, started the work by hand.  And I don't know what year they bought the big calculators, and we had a whole department devoted to that.  Well, when we started the Orbits, we did that by hand, of course.  And when they brought the calculators in, and they came up with the same data that we had been doing by hand, then when Glenn [John Glenn] was going up, he called over at the office and said, tell her the calculators, that if she gets the same thing they've got, then I'll use their data.  And I did, he did and they did.  But they didn't, we didn't have that confidence in calculators early, and he especially, them sending them up on data coming out of a calculator, he would take my hand calculations first.
Speaker 1: Now, this is John Glenn you're--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, who became the Senator later on.  Yeah, John Glenn, the first man to orbit the earth, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The first American to orbit the earth.  Was he the first man to orbit the earth, period, or--
Speaker 2: He was the first to orbit the earth.  He wasn't the first who went up.  And, you know, they just sent them up, go out of the atmosphere and come back down.  So then after they had succeeded there, they said, okay, we want to send him, when we get something, we're going to send him and let him go around the earth.  He was the first to orbit the earth.
Story_ID: 20628
Speaker 1: Okay, now, if I remember my history, and I'm trying to piece it together 'cause I was a little kid then, but I think Sputnik, the Russian satellite went into outer space in 1957, is that it, is that true?
Speaker 2: I don't know, but I have it in there on the wall.  I'll give you the date (laughter).
Speaker 1: Fifty-six [1956] or '57' [1957], but at any rate, that's shortly after you started working.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And the whole excitement about Sputnik, how did people feel about Sputnik, I mean here in the United States about the Russians putting a satellite up in space.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, they became very upset because here was this satellite flying around, and we could see it.  And that was, that's how we started working on it in secret, said, we can't have this happen.  We can't have somebody with something floating around up there that we don't know about.  So they began to ready to send one up themselves.  [phone ringing]
Story_ID: 20629
Speaker 1: Well, go ahead.  You were saying that people were concerned that this foreign satellite was circling around.
Speaker 2: So we decided to send one up there too, and that's what we were doing.
Speaker 1: Can you give us--now, I want you to realize that people watching this in the future are not going to have experienced the Cold War.  They don't know anything about the Cold War, you know, so kind of talk about what that feeling was in those days and how people felt about Russia and the competition with Russia and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: It was something you read about in the papers, you know.  And you knew that it existed.  And you were not a part of it, but you didn't want these people to do something and we not know about it, you know, and not know how to do it.  But, and so we--they were first.  No doubt about their being first, but we were right behind them.  They didn't know it.  But we had complained that NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] was too open with their information.  The whole world knew what we were doing, and we didn't know what these other people were doing.  And they almost got away from us, don't you think (laughter).  So we caught up with them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was the reason for all the secrecy and the, about what you all were doing in the laboratory and--
Speaker 2: Well, they--certain parts, nobody knew what we were doing in our division in terms of pilotless aircraft research or anything of outer space until '58' [1958].  Then everybody knew that we were working on it too.  We knew everything the Russians knew by that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we had other divisions of the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] family who, one section worked on the vehicle that did the boosting, another did something--did the tracking.  But we were responsible for the launching.  And that was partly what I was doing, creating the launch window.  And we didn't have anything to do with the, the powering it up.  We'd just tell them what power we wanted when they got there, what altitude, etc.  And that's what you call the launch window.  We would tell them--they would tell us when they wanted to land some place.  And I said, well, you just tell me when you want to land, and I'll tell you when to leave Cape Canaveral and make these orbits and get there at that certain point.  Well, that's what--that was my job, creating the launch window and tell them when to leave, what power they needed, etc., etc., etc.  It was very exciting, very exciting.
Story_ID: 20630
Speaker 1: Okay, well, I know the U.S. put a satellite up.  I can't think of the satellites names, but Allen Sheppard was the first astronaut to go into space.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he just went up into space and came back down, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Then John Glenn circles the earth.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And you had--so part of your job, from what I understand, or your job was to plot the trajectory of the--
Speaker 2: That's right.  We computed the actual trajectory, and for example, when they got ready to go to the moon, then I would compute the orbit up to the moon and back and tell them what conditions to have here and what time and tell 'em what time they would get to the moon and then tell 'em what time they would get back.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you remember Laura Bateman.  They said Laura Bateman was the first black woman to work for NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] or the pre-NASA or NACA at the--do you remember her at all?
Speaker 2: Did she work at Langley [Langley Research Center]?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.  I think so.  I think so.  It says she was hired in 1943.  So that was 10 years before you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was before my time.
Speaker 1: Okay, she may not have been there at the time, you know, when you got there.
Speaker 2: She wasn't at this, see, we have several installations, Langley, Cleveland, Houston, San Francisco.  We had about five.
Speaker 1: And Langley, the Langley Research Center is the oldest one, I believe, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now,--
Speaker 2: We spawned the Houston section, moved out from us through here, were called the Space Task Group.  And they moved the whole section to Houston.  And Chris Kraft was the head of that.
Speaker 1: Right, I remember that name, Chris Kraft, right.  Now, you worked with a gentleman named Al Hammer.
Speaker 2: Hamer.
Speaker 1: Hamer?
Speaker 2: H-A-M-E-R, it's just one "M".
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  We've got it here as Hammer.  So we have to change it (laughter).
Speaker 2: I've corrected it on several occasions.
Speaker 1: Okay, Al Hamer.
Speaker 2: Al Hamer.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: He was famous for guidance and navigation, etc., etc., etc.  We worked--Al, John and I worked together in the same office for 15 years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they never got you back in that pool of women.
Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't stay there too long.  I didn't ever go back.  They sent over, they wanted two computers, and Irma and I went over.  And we stayed.  They'd just converted us to this new division.  We weren't even considered a computer anymore.  We were over in the Space--it wasn't even space.  At that time, it was just guidance and control, I think, the flight mechanics branch.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Let's see.  So I also read that you had to kind of fight for the right to go to the briefings, right, 'cause they would only send--
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't have to fight for it.  I just had to ask for it.  I, you know, they'd had briefings on this, and I said, they didn't ask me.  Can I go?  And they said, well, we--women never go.  I said, well, is there a law against women going?  Shy (unclear) said, let her go.  So then I went to the briefings that our engineers were going to with regard to the Space Program.  I was working on it, and then I just gradually melded right in, and I did everything they did.
Speaker 1: Now, did you find it difficult to--I mean was it harder being a black woman, I mean being black or being a woman or did it--
Speaker 2: Not to me.  I had no problems.  They've asked me this before, and I said, I didn't allow it to get to me.  And they didn't either.  At one point, they were having a meeting, and they said, any of you have a black computer.  Nobody said anything, and so girlfriend said, are Shy and Katherine still in your office?  He said, oh, yeah, I forgot (laughter).  It just didn't matter.  It didn't matter to people at NASA that they were mixed like that, didn't have time.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in terms of time, you know, I've also read that you all worked long hours?
Speaker 2: Hamer and I did when they got the, mounted up with, in orbit.  We would go back at night and check with the installation in California and see, you know, that things were going as they should.  And we would have worked from 8:00 to 5:00, and we would go back after that.  And we did that for several months, not every day but enough so they finally told us, you can't do that.  You cannot work 16 hours at Langley (laughter).  But--
Speaker 1: Were you being paid overtime?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: We didn't ask for it, and you didn't get it, didn't get overtime, didn't get comp time or anything.  But we wanted to be on hand and see what was going on at night.  So the two of us would go back out and be in contact with the engineers out there.  It was fun.  They would, then when we would communicate on the data tracks that were going around, and they would say, uh-oh, you did so and so and so and so.  And it would be written on there (laughter), says, your supervisor will hear this.  It was really interesting.
Speaker 1: So the government didn't want you to work overtime?
Speaker 2: Say what?
Speaker 1: The government didn't want you to work overtime?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, they didn't want us to work overtime, no.  They didn't ask us to do it.  We just did it.  But they objected to the fact that we did work overtime without permission and without being paid.  So I don't know whether we stopped first or what happened or we just stopped going.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or if we were going at night, we would not go in the day or something.
Story_ID: 20631
Speaker 1: Now, I think we were off camera when you were saying that you lost your husband in '56' [1956]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then you remarried in '59' [1959].
Speaker 2: Remarried in '59' [1959].
Speaker 1: And you married a Lieutenant Colonel James Johnson.
Speaker 2: That's right.  You just met him.
Speaker 1: That's right.  He opened the door for us (laughter).  So how did--and he's an artillery officer, you know, he was telling me.  And, you know, he tracks the trajectory of--
Speaker 2: Only he was just carrying mail at the time.  He had retired from the army when we got married.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how did you meet?
Speaker 2: In church, you know, just like you meet anybody else.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We have a minister who loves to put people together, so he gives himself credit and Jimmy, this, Jim tells me when we got married, I said, "Rev. Rollins, I hope you're happy" (laughter).
Story_ID: 20632
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, in 1960, you were the co-author of a paper called 'Determination of Azimuth Angle that Burn Out for Placing a Satellite Over a Selected Earth Position.
Speaker 2: Okay, now that's this angle, see, you fire the rocket and it gets up here, and it has to bend over at a, in order to be in orbit or it would keep going.  So that was my first paper, 'Determination of Azimuth Angle' at which it would bend over to be (unclear).
Speaker 1: Now, I never thought about that, but I guess that's true.  If you send a rocket straight up--
Speaker 2: It'll keep going.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it'll just keep going up out of the atmosphere into space.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I would tell it at which altitude it should bend and how it should bend to go into orbit.
Speaker 1: Well, the danger is, if it doesn't bend, it keeps going, and second, if it bends, I guess, too late, you're out of--
Speaker 2: It'll come back--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, so we would tell it exactly how to bend to go into orbit at a certain point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was the importance of knowing down here, when it gets up here what it's supposed to do.  This is a launch window down here, you tell 'em everything.  You tell 'em which angle to bend to and so forth and so on.
Speaker 1: Now, how much of what you're doing here is physics, pure physics and how much is pure math?  I mean what--
Speaker 2: It's hard to tell.  I decided that the reason I was so good at it was the last course that Dr. Claytor taught me was 'Analytic Geometry of Space'.  And, you see, normally, in Geometry, you learn how things move on a plane.  But when you get into the third dimension, you're out here in this space, and you have rules.  The airplane has six degrees of freedom when it gets out here.  So that's another whole science, and it was important that we could know how to do that.  Well, I was the last one apparently who'd been to college, and I knew all this plain Geometry, Analytic Geometry of Space.  It was fresh in my mind, so I could do it quicker than they could do it.  So they, it just fell to me to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you said you could do it quicker than they.  Now, who are you referring to?
Speaker 2: I was working with engineers who have to figure out something about--for example.  When you have a plane flying, he knows where it is, you know.  And how do you, then when you leave the earth's atmosphere and going into space, how do you determine the conditions out there from earth?  He knows where he is, etc., etc..  Well, then, that's quote "another Geometry", and so then I could tell them faster, you know, just compute it.  And it was just simpler to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what you're saying, I guess, then not everybody understood that kind of Geometry, who was working on it.
Speaker 2: That's right.  They had to rethink it.  And that was the first textbook we wrote, 'The Geometry of Space'.
Speaker 1: Now, when you say "we", now you and who else, the team?
Speaker 2: The team, yeah, uh-huh.  I was in an office with about 15 men and five women.  There was about 20, about 20 in the office.  And they had five women and 15 engineers and anybody could ask anybody to do anything.  Well, it just lucked up that the engineers I was working with, we worked well together, and we just sort of gradually became a team.
Speaker 1: Okay, and when you say--so, I'm trying to understand now, is it every time, when you all came up with these new calculations and new ways of plotting these flights, you would write a textbook, right?  Is that what you said?
Speaker 2: No, no, not every time, but we did write a textbook on the--and I had my own copy.  And a guy came here and interviewed me, and he asked if he could use it as a reference, and he would bring it back.  You know, he never brought that back, and I don't have it to this day.  I'm furious, and I can't remember who he was, somebody from NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], Washington came down.  But we just put together a whole textbook starting with launch conditions and how you do this and how you do this, and it's about this thick, and it was a big book.  We just published it right here and had our own copies.  And the rest of them gave it up, you know, didn't pay any attention to it, and I kept mine.  And I'm furious with myself for being so trusting.
Speaker 1: Ghee, so, yeah, that's, yeah, it would be interesting to have a copy of that.
Speaker 2: Yes, I would love to have it because the field doesn't even have a copy.  Each of us who worked on it had a copy, well, not each of us, each office had a copy.  And the director of our office was retiring, and he gave it to me.  So I had the only copy in our section.  But it's gone.
Speaker 1: How long ago was that?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's been several--oh, I've been retired 20 years, so it's been more than 20 years ago.
Story_ID: 20633
Speaker 1: Okay, now did your job require much travel?
Speaker 2: Excuse me?
Speaker 1: Did your job require you to travel much?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't do any traveling at all.  The guys did a lot of traveling.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the guys that you worked with traveled, but you didn't.  Was that a function of the fact that you were a woman and--
Speaker 2: No, it had nothing to do with it.  They didn't have to.  I mean there were certain times that they made trips here and there, down to Houston and so on.  I just didn't go.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you all worked as a team, and you just didn't, it just wasn't required for you to go.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  Hamer didn't ever go anywhere.  I don't know if John went or not.  It was a matter of choice.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right, now, you helped plot the orbit for John Glenn, right, when he orbited the earth?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This is '61' [1961], I guess, right?  I believe it's '61' [1961].  Well, what were some of the other missions that you helped to--
Speaker 2: We computed all the orbits.  The first--anybody who was going anywhere, they asked us to compute the orbit.
Speaker 1: From '58' [1958] through--
Speaker 2: After, till after they got the computer.
Speaker 1: And when was that?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so up until--and you retired like what [year]?
Speaker 2: Eighty six [1986].
Speaker 1: Eighty six [1986], okay.  So when you retired, were you still plotting?
Speaker 2: Oh, we were working on the, the space station when I retired.  And I had--Al Hamer and I were retiring.  And the division chief came over and asked John if he would chair a committee on, having to do with the use of solar panels.  John told him he wouldn't chair it.  So the chief said, well, you'll be on it if you won't chair it.  So he proceeded to tell him what the job was.  And he said, John said, okay, can I have Katherine?  He said, if she'll go (laughter).  The division chief turned around, "Do you wanna work for John?"  I said, "Sure, any day in the week."  So I put my retirement papers aside and stayed another year because I said I was in the original space task group that started this, and it would be nice to say that I worked with them until they worked on the space station.  And for that reason, I stayed on another year and worked on that.
Speaker 1: Okay, we have to pause again for a second.
Story_ID: 20634
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, Mr. Hickey was just observing that mathematics is the language of physics and can you respond to that on camera?
Speaker 2: Oh, I did.
Speaker 1: Can you say it again because we didn't hear it on camera.
Speaker 2: Oh, I was saying mathematics was the basis of the whole thing, and anything in physics starts with an equation, and it's hard to say--sometimes when we first started moving to the larger computers, I'd have a stack of data that high for something that I was computing.  If you had to do it by hand, that's how long it would take and how much material you'd have.  But by the time they reduced it, and they got clearance and assurance that the computer was right, then I didn't have to do it anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I would tell him what to do, very simple, very simple.
Speaker 1: Okay, so we're talking about a time that is different from today in that today people would check someone's hand work with a computer.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then you would check the computer with somebody's hand calculations.
Speaker 2: That's right.  They did at first.  Then after they found that the computer was right, then--you can't even find a desk calculator out of there anymore.  Nobody has one.  You write it and put it on the computer.
Speaker 1: Now, describe, if you will, the kinds of computers you all were using in those days, the first computers?
Speaker 2: We used two kinds, the Friedan and the Monroe.  There was another, but those were the only two we used, and everybody liked the Friedan.  I liked the Monroe because it was smaller.
Speaker 1: You're talking about the calculators?
Speaker 2: The hand calculators.
Speaker 1: Hand calculators.  I'm talking about the computers.
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know anything about them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Didn't you have to do Fortran or Cobol or something like that mainframes?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we wrote in--I wrote in Fortran.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and that's a--just kind of describe the dynamics, you know, how it was done, maybe for people that don't understand what--
Speaker 2: How to--
Speaker 1: Yeah, what was that like compared to say, a laptop today?  What was that like?
Speaker 2: Well, the computer cannot read (laughter), so you've got to give it instructions.  So you write your instructions in Fortran.  You write your equations, and then it can read the numbers, you know, and so forth and so on.  But it couldn't read how you got there.  So then you, I had, all the, we'd write our equations out.  And then somebody would take it in Fortran and give it to the computer.
Speaker 1: And Fortran was basically a keypunch language punched on a card, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at the time.  And you'd go blind in there, punching those cards.  I did that too.  Early on, you did it all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was the relative size of the computer in 1960, say?
Speaker 2: About that big.
Speaker 1: I'm talking about a computer, not a hand calculator, I'm talking about computers.
Speaker 2: The computers, oh, they were on big stands like this.  And they would punch--we'd write in Fortran, punch it on a card, put the card in, and it had to read the card.
Speaker 1: So would a computer be about the size of a refrigerator or what would it look--
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh, and we'd have rooms of those.  That division up there is called ACD (unclear), and it's a whole building, just computers, computers, computers.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, okay, so, now, do you have any stories about a time when something went wrong that you--
Speaker 2: Oh, there'd be millions of those.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can't think of anything in particular.  It was our job to see to it that nothing went wrong, you know.  So you worked on that.  And other than telling you about when we were working overtime to check it, I don't think of anything in particular.
Story_ID: 20635
Speaker 1: Did you have--was there anything that you did that you think you were the most proud of doing?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was most proud of the trajectory to the moon because we had to compute the launch conditions from here, and then trace it around until it got to the moon, and you had to know how far the moon had moved in that length of time.  So it's like you're shooting at rabbits.   You don't shoot right at the rabbit.  You think where you think the rabbits will be by the time your bullet gets there, right?  Well, that's the way it was with this when we launched from earth.  You know where the moon is now, and it's gonna take "x" number of days to get to the moon.  Where will the moon be by then?  So they had that to calculate.  An then when it came time for them to leave the moon, you had to reverse the calculations and say that he left moon, and he leaves over here.  Then back at earth, you got to say how far has the earth rotated, you know.  So you had, those were very intricate calculations, and I was very concerned about them.  And we were right on target, of course, no problem, no problem.
Story_ID: 20636
Speaker 1: Okay, so how large a community were, I guess, the scientists and mathematicians that worked in NASA.
Speaker 2: Excuse me?
Speaker 1: How large or give us a sense of how large a community of scientists and mathematicians worked at NASA?  I mean did everybody know everybody else or--
Speaker 2: Oh, you knew everybody else.  There were 3,000 people.  You knew nearly everybody 'cause you ate at the same cafeteria, you know, and so forth.  But for our particular section, it was about 20, but then there was another little section over here doing something else, but 20 in that one, you know, and so forth and so on.  But I have no idea how many people were involved in the space.  I just knew my branch which was the flight mechanics branch.  And then it became the guidance and control branch, and when we did the navigation, so, and the name was not changed, we just did the work telling the--we did an interesting experiment on, modern experiment study on the errors that you could tolerate.  You would compute an orbit.  You know what it looks like, supposed to be oval.  And you could compute how much error you could afford and what would be charged by the amount of the error.  And it was called an "Error Ellipsoid".  And you would notify the--I mean everybody knew at what point this, if you were not on the nominal trajectory, how far off you could withstand an error before you would have to correct it.  And that was an interesting study.  Now, Hamer was famous for that.  That was his baby.
Speaker 1: I know--go ahead.
Speaker 2: I was about to say and John's forte was the forces on it at all points and so on.  And he said that if you're flying along, you wanted to go to Jupiter, for example, if you flew close enough to Mars, you could get some additional forces from Mars' trajectory so that it would pay you to go that way and let Mars give you that extra bump.  You get what I'm saying?  That was his specialty, and he--I noticed in the paper recently that they were talking about it.  And I called him up and mentioned it to him.
Speaker 1: Now, this is John--
Speaker 2: John Young.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was the third of my troupe, the three of us, Al, John and Katherine.  And the NTA gave a dinner for me recently, and John came over and spoke about it.  And it was really, I was so glad to see him.  We had a big time.  He lives in Emory now, and said, doing nothing.
Story_ID: 20637
Speaker 1: Now, I know a lot of what you--I've heard that a lot of what you were doing was secret, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --but did you ever wish you could tell somebody what you were doing or did you think that they would understand it if you told them?
Speaker 2: Oh, the two of us, now, we would understand it completely, the three of us.  We knew exact--
Speaker 1: Right, but I'm talking about outside of where you worked?
Speaker 2: I didn't discuss it with anybody at all.  And children didn't even know it.  And it was just, a matter of fact, you just didn't discuss it, period.
Speaker 1: So how did you feel about that, that you really couldn't discuss about, you couldn't discuss your work?
Speaker 2: Didn't bother me.  I didn't realize how important it was to other people, you know.  And so they wouldn't have understood it anyway, so you just, it was nothing to discuss.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was thinking that, that even if you explained it, most people wouldn't understand it.
Speaker 2: No, said, one minister was preaching and they said that people are now flying into space.  If God wanted them to fly into space, he'd have given them wings (laughter).  So he didn't believe it.
Speaker 1: There were people in 1969, I know that walked out on their porch and look at the moon and said, there's nobody up there.
Speaker 2: No, but I was making a talk in White Sulphur [White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia].  Ms. Leftwich asked me to come up.  And it was right after that, their capsule was going around there.  And before I left here, I computed when it would be in White Sulphur, and when I was talking, I told them what time they could see it.  And everybody went out to see it, and sure enough, you could see it going around.  But it was no longer a secret as such, but a lot of people didn't know that there was an actual space station floating around up.  They thought it was another flying star or just didn't even see it.  And it was really interesting and I went out and looked, and I saw it, and I knew what time it went over here and how far it was up there, and told 'em what time they could see it.  And they said, Ah [gasp] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a sense now of how special all this was, all your work was?
Speaker 2: Not especially.  You know, it was a job.  IT was interesting as all get out.  We were definitely interested in it, and there were other people on the field working on something else, and it didn't pay them any--it didn't bother them that over here, you were doing this 'cause they had a job.  And see, it was originally an aeronautic research center.  So those people are still working on airplanes to this day.  And they could care less what the people are doing in the space.
Story_ID: 20638
Speaker 1: Now, would you like to see the country, you know, focus more on space travel at this point?
Speaker 2: Would I?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, I wonder what they're gonna do with the information when they get it?  And I have the, I'm a friend of one of the astronauts who went up recently, we sit and chat about we did a study on the pattern of the stars they're flying through.  And he said that that information was not useful to them at all because he said, I'm among the stars.  He says, and all the stars were just around it.  He could not pick up the same constellation that we can.  You know, you look up and see, for example, Orion, you know, what it looks like.  It has three stars here, you know.  And he said, I couldn't pick those stars out among all the other stars like you can down here.  You could pick them out because they're brighter than the surrounding stars, and they create a pattern, and you know what it is.  He said, but when I'm out there, I'm among those stars.  He said, I can't tell one constellation from another.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  I didn't realize that.
Speaker 2: So we just, it's interesting.  We were working on it, and I have some of the information that I calculated, you know, and it showed the pattern of the stars they'll be going through.  And he said, it didn't--so the Air Force took that over, and we let it go.  And we were mad because they--but then we were glad, I was glad to know that it was not important.  It's nice to know, but it was not useful to the astronauts.
Speaker 1: And who was this astronaut?
Speaker 2: What's his name?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Melvin, what's his last name?
Speaker 1: Okay, but he went up in the shuttle, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We don't know what they're gonna do next.
Speaker 1: Do you have any ideas about what we ought to do next?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a question of what you're going to do it for 'cause, I mean you have this information, you can go out there.  Now, what do you do with that information?  What's it good for?  It is a good scientific study, and we study those changes in the sun's rays and so forth, but unless you're gonna use the information, what are you gonna do.  So I'm wondering what they're gonna do now.  They're going out and look at Mars.  They're trying to find out if there's ever been life on life.  And once they determine that there may have been, and they drop down there and they'll see evidence, then that'll be of some use.  So then if they find that nobody has ever lived on it, how will they know?  They cannot see any evidence that there have been people on Mars.  There are no houses left, you know what I'm saying?  So they have sort of let up on Mars.  So they're going out looking at another, they're gonna--what they really wanna know, is there another Planet Earth somewhere with people on it.  So that's all they're doing, looking around up there to see what's going on.  Interesting.  It'll be interesting when they find out something tangible.  So we don't know whether they're gonna do it or not.
Story_ID: 20639
Speaker 1: Now, you've been honored a few times now, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And you received some honorary doctorate degrees and--
Speaker 2: Right there on the wall (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's right.  There's one from Old Dominion [Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia], I'm looking at here, and there are some others.  There was a--
Speaker 2: Farmingdale, New York [Farmingdale State College, Farmington, New York], and Capital College [Capitol College, Laurel, Maryland] in Maryland.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: The first time I got one of those, I called, I said, "Are you sure you're calling the right person (laughter)?"  It was just, it was an honor.  I couldn't believe it.
Speaker 1: Now, I heard that at one event, Nichelle Nichols was there from 'StarTrek'.  Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: That who was there?
Speaker 1: That gentleman that you knew, one of the black astronauts, you know, escorted you up and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that's the one I'm talking about, Leland Atkins.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, that's Melvin.
Speaker 2: Melvin.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: What is his full name?  I call him Leland.  But anyway, he, we accidentally have been on programs and meet and have the best time.  I saw him first, where was I?  Oh, I was going to spend the day at a college in North Carolina.  I'm going there again a couple of weeks from now.  And, you know, when you're gonna spend a day in a school, you go from room to room.  And I said, now they would be very excited if they got to talk to an astronaut.  So I called Leland, couldn't find him.  Wouldn't you know, I'm sitting--I had just arrived on the stage in the first classroom, and my phone rang.  And Leland said, what did you want (laughter)?  And I said, I wanted you to talk to a class.  He said, well, are they there?  I said, yes.  He said, well, put 'em on.  So then he talked to them.  Oh, they were excited.  They talked to a real astronaut.  So they made more of the fact that I could call an astronaut and he would answer (laughter) than they did--so I hit the jackpot on that one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was an accident, and then when I was at Virginia--no, down at Old Dominion, for some other reason, he was on the program, and we got to talk.
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever meet Mae Jemison?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you know her actually when she was an astronaut?
Speaker 2: She came, she made a speech here or was it for a sorority.  Anyway, I have met her personally.
Story_ID: 20640
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you look back on everything that you've done to this point, what would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, the fact that we created, we drew up the first orbits, and that we created the one that went to the moon and dropped a man off and waited for him and picked him up again and brought him home.  I consider that my most, the most interesting and the most--one that really required accuracy and so on to do.  And I consider that my--when I went to White Sulphur [White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia], no, I was in Charleston [West Virginia] making a talk, and they wrote it up in the newspaper.  And my picture was in the paper (laughter).  And a guy was working at the Greenbrier [Hotel], and they got the newspaper in the middle of the night.  He bought up a whole fist full of papers and took them down to my house to give to my sister.  He said, we, this is Katherine's picture on here.  I want you to have it (laughter), and he brought her a whole handful of newspapers.
Speaker 1: So, now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, again, if you look over your career, is there anything that, anything major that you wish you could have done differently?
Speaker 2: No, I was just happy to be a part of it and happy to share in the creation of the work and to find what it was going to be used for and that it was correct.
Story_ID: 20641
Speaker 1: Okay, can you tell me offhand, I know you don't know all the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]employees, but how many other black people worked on the NASA project that you were working on?
Speaker 2: On this particular project, not too many black guys were working on it.  And I don't--none in our office at the time.  There may be some there now who are in that division, but at the time we were doing this, and I'd say there were about 20 of us.  I was the only black woman, and I don't know of any other black person.  But it didn't bother me, you know.  I wasn't concerned who was working.  I don't know who might have been.
Speaker 1: When you were working for NASA in those early days, were you aware of Ed Dwight or Robert Lawrence, those two first black astronauts?
Speaker 2: I knew Chuck [Charles F. Bolden, Jr.], what's his name.  He's the head of NASA now.  I knew him when he was doing it because I was a member of the National Technical Association, and he came to us to speak and joined us.  And then, ah, there was another guy.  See my memory was already--I'm 93 years old.  And I had this slight stroke.  I can't remember what I used to remember (laughter).
Speaker 1: Ed Dwight never really flew.  I mean he never got a chance to go--
Speaker 2: Ed what?
Speaker 1: Dwight.  He never, he was the first one named, but he never went into space.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And I think Lawrence died, you know, in an accident in--
Speaker 2: Well, this guy--
Speaker 1: --and Guion Bluford went up.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Bluford, and then--
Speaker 2: I didn't know any of them.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, but I do know this one.  The last, I don't know if he's the last black that went up or not, Leland Atkins.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: But I have gotten to know him.  He was at Langley [Langley Research Center], and he's still with Langley [Langley Research Center], but his office is in D.C.[District of Columbia]  And you can't find him.  He stays on the road, travels all the time.
Speaker 2: Okay, we're gonna pause here again for another--
Story_ID: 20642
Speaker 1: Ma'am, can you tell me a little bit about your family, about your daughters and your husband?
Speaker 2: I had three daughters, and they've all been very successful with their jobs and happy with what they were doing.  Now, the middle one, the one who just died, we're mad at her.  She had all the fun.  She quit teaching.  They bought an 18-wheeler and she drove coast-to-coast for several years, had a ball.  And she was teaching again, and she fell, as she stepped off her first step and bruised and broke her ankle.  But she was back teaching again.  But she, she didn't like the system.  They tell you what to teach, you know.  She says she found that everybody was teaching toward a test that they had to take and the kids were not getting what they needed to know.  And so she was very unhappy.  I could understand it because I had, I was teaching in Bloomfield, and I said, "You can do a lot of things, but you cannot tell me what to teach."  I said, "I don't know."  He got after me because I didn't, I gave failing students failing grades.  I said, "I don't believe in social passing (laughter)."  I said, "So if you want that, you can put me out today."  I said, "Because nobody can tell me how to teach and what I should be teaching."  So Connie had that same problem when she was teaching.  They were teaching to a test, and she said the children couldn't tie their shoes, you know, say you teach them to tie their shoes.  So she was not very happy.  She liked teaching, pre-kindergarten and kindergarten.  And they moved her up to teaching sixth grade English, and she was very unhappy.  And I could understand it.  Nobody else could.
Speaker 1: So two of your daughters are still alive.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this one is a, was a--Kat.  And the other one worked for, she had worked for several places as a mathematician.  And she was happy with what she was doing, but she just got old enough to retire.  So she retired.  Katherine was a counselor, and she started out as a pre-school instructor.  She liked it.  She was very successful, and she got her Masters and moved up, and then she decided that she would rather be a counselor, changed.  And she was very happy doing it.  When she got old enough to retire, she retired.  They all sing in their church choirs and Joylette was pianist, but she didn't want to be a professional pianist so she majored in mathematics.  And her music teacher asked me to persuade her to major in music.  And I said, "No, she doesn't want to be a concert pianist.  She just wants to play when she wants to play."  So they're doing fine.  They all married and had--two of them are divorced.  Connie and Kathy had divorced, but they, Kathy has one child.  Connie has, the one in New Jersey now has two and Connie has three, nice kids.
Story_ID: 20643
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you're 93, right now, aren't you?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: You're 93 years old at the present?
Speaker 2: And a half.
Speaker 1: And a half.  All right, well, we always ask this question too, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: One, that those who are acting a fool stop acting a fool and concentrate on something serious.  I mean if you're gonna be a comedian, you can be a comedian without being a fool, right?  All I'm asking is that they live sensibly and do something constructive.  We have, they have excellent opportunities.  We have some blacks in some good positions, doing a good job.  So I'm happy with that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have any advice for young, black people who want to, who are aspiring scientists or mathematicians?
Speaker 2: There's room , plenty to be done, other things to investigate so they can--it's a wonderful future.
Speaker 1: Have you been surprised by what your mathematical skills have opened up for you in terms of a career?  Could you have envisioned, you know, what you would be doing?
Speaker 2: No, I could not envision it when I was asking Dr. Claytor what do research mathematicians do.  He said, "I don't know."  He said, "You'll find out."  And he said, "You find out" (laughter).  He just died.  I would like to see him now.  But when I first started out, the work was very monotonous.  I read the cards, you know, that they put in computers, and I did this, this, and this.  The space work turned out to be the most fascinating that I could have done, but when I was working on airplanes, we worked on the job--they were bombers, and they had to calculate when they flipped over and could flip back.  And we had a job on, did a study of the position of the wing, on the airplane, whether it should be here or here or here or here.  And it was interesting, very interesting.  So I could have stayed with them, but I'm happier that I changed--that I was sent to a division having to do with space.  I enjoyed it so much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One thing about it, you don't have to convince anybody of something.  You have a job, and you do it, you know, and it's not up to you to convince them whether to do it or not to do so and so, but you just do your job.  So I was happy there, very happy.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Not at all (laughter).  Not at all.  Every time somebody gives me a big dinner or something, I'll sit there and say, "Who are they talking about?"  But I have taken pride in what I did do, but I was not searching for a reward of any kind.  And when they gave me this dinner lately, I was just as surprised as anybody.  Kathy showed you a program for that.  I was sitting there embarrassed.
Speaker 1: That's the program that Leland Melvin attended and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Nichelle Nichols was there too, I think.
Speaker 2: His thing is there on the wall, that he gave me.  I enjoyed the work that I was doing.  It was seemingly important.  It became important.  I did my best.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And I'd do it again some more.
Speaker 1: Okay, can't ask for any more than that.  Thank you, very much.
Speaker 2: And thank you.  You're terrific.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.

Speaker 1: Oh, we're rolling, okay.  Yes, Mrs. Johnson, can you describe this photo for us?
Speaker 2: Hand it to me first, and let me look at it.
Speaker 1: That's you at Capital College.  Can you just say that?
Speaker 2: I was the commencement speaker-- (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION):
Speaker 1: I was the commencement speaker at Capital College, receiving a degree as an honorary doctor of Science.
Speaker 2: About what year is that?
Speaker 1: Oh, just a couple years ago.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's probably here, yeah, 2006. (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION): (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Can you see this photograph?
Speaker 1: Yes, that was made at work for something special.  They just sent a photographer over to take the picture.  I don't know what the occasion was.
Speaker 2: About what year would you think?
Speaker 1: That's it.
Speaker 2: Yes, I said, about what year do you think it was?
Speaker 1: Oh, I have to look at it and see.  Well, it was back when my hair was dark, and it was before I retired, so it's at least 30 years old.
Speaker 2: This is 1980.
Speaker 1: Now, that's at NASA when I was working on the orbits.  That would have to be--those usually have the date on them.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's 1980.  Here's another one, 1980.
Speaker 1: That was at the same time.  That was right after they moved over to using the computers, and I, I'm picking up data from there. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, ready?
Speaker 2: This is 1976.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I cannot place that at all.
Speaker 2: It looks like it's at work from 1976.
Speaker 1: I, let me just look at it and see if I can determine who I was talking to.  Was it 1976?  I was teaching a class at that time to disadvantaged high school students.  And I went over once a week to conduct a class for that.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, this is you with a group.  Is that the--
Speaker 1: That is a class of disadvantaged kids.  Either they had graduated from college--from high school, and I was, they had the--NASA had a program to prepare them for the examination they had to take to get a job.  And they ran these classes and I taught the class over there for several years, remedial math.
Speaker 2: That's 1976.
Speaker 1: National Black College Alumni Hall of Fame.  I was one of many that they honored that year.  The names are in there.  You'll see how many, probably a dozen.  In 2008, they sprung that one on me.  I walked them some place and saw it.
Speaker 2: This picture here was made in Richmond. (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION):
Speaker 1: They picked those pictures out of other places and had a women's equality day at NASA.
Speaker 2: Winnie Warren has an entire book on black women scientists in the United States and I was lucky enough to have been chosen.  That's all I have to say about it.
Speaker 1: Now, here's a big one.  That's you and this is from the--
Speaker 2: Voices of Triumph.
Speaker 1: Voices of Triumph, right.
Speaker 2: They selected me as a representative of NASA scientists.  This is about that same picture, just about the same picture you had before.
Speaker 1: At a dinner given for me by the National Technical Association.  Leland Atkins presented me this collection.  The flag he had flown on one of his trips on the shuttle, he said that flag had actually flown 500,000 miles.
Speaker 2: Okay, and this is Leland Melvin, right?
Speaker 1: Leland Melvin, he was the black astronaut I was telling you about.  And Chuck Bolton is the other, another astronaut whom I knew personally.  He--and I was delighted when he became head of NASA.
Speaker 2: Now, is that Leland Melvin in space?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Is that a picture of Leland Melvin in space?
Speaker 1: I guess-- (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  I think Charles Bolton's name is on it.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's Charles Bolton.
Speaker 1: But he presented, he presented the flag and I don't know what the source of all the pictures is, but he put it together.
Speaker 2: This is the original four, Coleman clan, Horace, Margaret and at the bottom, Charles, Katherine and Charlie.  I'm the one with no shoes, and I was two years old.  And a photographer was going through the country, you know, and asking, you wanna have a picture made.  So my mother rushed in and dressed us and had that picture made.
Speaker 1: Nineteen twenty [1920].
Speaker 2: Nineteen twenty [1920], yes, so I was two years old.
Speaker 1: Well, these are all three.  I was just gonna shot this one of all of three of you.
Speaker 2: There are my three daughters.  And that was on a visit to the hospital to see my brother who was dying.  And we made that picture while we were there, Jolette at the top, at the bottom, Kathy and Connie.  Connie is now deceased.
Speaker 1: Now, these are your parents, I believe.
Speaker 2: These are my parents, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, just give their full names for us so we know what their names are.
Speaker 2: Daddy, Joshua, and my mother's name is Joylette.  They were the, my parents of whom I am very proud.  This is a picture of them when they were getting married.
Speaker 1: Now, this is just your mother, right?
Speaker 2: That's my mother, Joylette, Joylette Lowe Coleman and my dad, Joshua McKinley Coleman, and I was a daddy's girl.  Let me see what these are.
Speaker 1: That's you and your husband--
Speaker 2: And up here with my parents.  And I can't tell who, which one that is.
Speaker 1: Are those your sisters?
Speaker 2: That's me and one of the children.  Who's that, you, Kathy?  Who is that, 'cause I didn't put that picture together.  You don't know who it is?
Speaker 1: It's Connie. (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE):  That's the deceased sister.
Speaker 2: And this is my parents and my sister, and that's me and Jim.  Left to right, there's Jim and me on their way out to an affair, and to the right top is my dad, my sister--my dad, my mother and my sister.  And down at the bottom, I'm talking to Connie. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: That's Lieutenant Colonel James A. Johnson with his ever-loving wife, Katherine.  I don't need to say anymore about that.  That's about 20 years old.
Speaker 2: That's just a few years ago, right?
Speaker 1: Say what?
Speaker 2: That's not that long ago, right?
Speaker 1: That's a long time ago, yeah.
Speaker 2: All right, so I guess that's it. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, well, thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much for your hard work and for your patience. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  My pleasure.
Speaker 2: Let's shoot this for one last one.  This is the home where she grew up.  This is in White Sulphur Springs, [West Virginia]?
Speaker 1: That's in White Sulphur Springs.  That's the family house from 19--let's see, I was born in 1918.  That, we lived in that house--they moved into I think when I was two.
Speaker 2: That's a heck of a house.  It's nice.
Speaker 1: Yes, this was my room up here on the right-hand side.  My sister's room was back there, and the boy's room on the other side, and then my parent's room in the back.  Look like a pretty house, doesn't it?
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: It looks like that today.  We sold it a couple of years ago.  And the people say, who live on the street, say that the people who live in it keep it looking like that all the time.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, good, good.  Okay.
Speaker 1: I wanted to keep it, but I was the only one, and I knew that I would not be--
