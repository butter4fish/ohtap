Speaker 1: Okay, now before we get into depth, there are five "People" magazine-ish-type of questions that we always ask.  And they just require a short answer, really.  And the first one is, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: You know, I--you just want a short answer.  I was raised on soul food (laughter), you know.  My favorite food is soul food, but--
Speaker 1: Okay, so I mean, you don't have to name all of 'em, but, pick--
Speaker 2: My, my favorite food is soul food, like--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --straight up soul food.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a favorite color?

Speaker 2: No, favorite, no favorite vacation destination.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: When you don't know, and don't know that you don't know, you don't know, and it's a very sad situation in life.  I think that everyone, you know, because so many people are unaware of the things in life that they should be aware of, but they don't know.  And so, therefore, when you don't know, you, you cannot hold them responsible for a lot of things.  That's one of my favorite sayings now.
Story_ID: 78563
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I wanna ask you to tell me as much as you know, or as much as you wanna tell me, about your family history, you know, the family tree.  Not so much biographies of people, but, but your fam--how far can you go back, and do you know what your family was doing, say, you know, when the slaves or freed or when, you know, or beyond that or, or during Reconstruction even, or during the turn of the century.  What do you know?
Speaker 2: Well, I can go back--I've heard mostly of it on my mother's side.  Like, my mother [Mary Gilliam] was born in, in Mississippi.  She was born in a town called Benoit, Mississippi.  And there were, I would say she had, had three sisters and--three sisters and two brothers somewhere along the line.  But I had heard that her mother--I'd heard from the other aunt, which was her mother's sister, and several of the others that they go back to, back into slavery where they were on the plantation.  They were on a plantation, and there were two actually like, the slave master had two families.  On my mother's side there was a family that lived back out into the hills into the woods, and then there was another family which I heard was his original white family, which was I think his name was something like Mr. Thomason or Thompson, something like that; I don't, I don't recall.  But in talking to them, this is how they briefly--they are now in the process of trying to get a, you know, do our history, family tree, and stuff like that.  On my father's side, my father [Willie Holt] was born in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.  My mother, her name was--my mother's still living.  My mother's in a nursing home now.  She's 92, and her name is Mary Gilliam.  My father's deceased.  My father--
Speaker 1: Can you spell her name for us?  Can, can, can you spell your, your mother's name?
Speaker 2: Gilliam, Mary, M-A-R-Y, Gilliam, G-I-L-L-I-A-M.  She will turn ninety-two soon.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And she was born in I guess 1911?
Speaker 2: Somewhere, somewhere in there, but, but she will be, this coming February she will be ninety-two.
Speaker 1: Okay, about 1911.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 78564
Speaker 1: On my father's side, I don't know very much, but I know my father [Willie Holt] was from Hattiesburg [Mississippi].  He was born in Hattiesburg, and he, he passed away, I say at an early age, 45, yeah, I would say.  And the family, we, like, we moved here in 1941.  We came up from Rosedale, Mississippi, in 1941.
Speaker 2: Now, what was your father's name?
Speaker 1: My father was Willie, Willie Holt, Willie Holt.
Speaker 2: Okay, and was he born around the same time as your mother, or, or do you know?
Speaker 1: He was a little older than my mother.  Yeah, my father, I think my father was about four or five years older than my mother, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, put, put 'em around 1905 or--
Speaker 1: Probably somewhere in there, somewhere in there, yeah.
Story_ID: 78565
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well, did your--did you know your grandparents at all?
Speaker 2: Yes, I knew, I knew my grandparents on my, on my father's [Willie Holt] side, which was Lenora Tims, from the Tims.  And she was born, actually born in Rosedale, Mississippi, from what I understand.
Speaker 1: Now, now can you spell that for us 'cause every time we have a proper name, we try to--
Speaker 2: Lenora--
Speaker 1: --spell--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: L-E--Lenora, L-E-N-O-R-A; Tims would be the last name, Tims, T-I-M-S.  My mother's [Mary Gilliam] mother passed away when my mother was about two.  She was adopted by her mother's brother, which was Stewart, Ben Stewart.  He adopted my mother and raised my mother as his own daughter.  And we all, the whole family, kind of settled around Rosedale, Mississippi; Greenville, Mississippi; Scott, Mississippi, right around in that Delta area, that's where I would say. And like my father--my father's father, he never was able to find him when we came to Chicago [Illinois].  But I'm supposedly to be named after my father's father, which was Isaac Holt.  And so, my mother always told me that she and my father's mother decided to name me, the third child, after my grandfather, you see.
Story_ID: 78566
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, I just wondered, did, did any of your relatives pass down any other stories about, about the, the distant past.  Did they talk, you know, any stories about it?  I know you talked about the, the plantation where, where the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I guess the, the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The mas--the slave master had two families--
Speaker 1: He had a black family and a white family?
Speaker 2: A black family and a white family.  My--I had an aunt, Aunt Pearl--she's dead now, but Aunt Pearl, she lived quite a long time.  And she had that story where she would, she would go to the big house to get money to get what they need.  She'd go get supplies whatever they need.  She was the one that was chosen to go to the big house and talk to the master about what they needed back there.  She even said that some of his comments was "you're so much like me."  She would come and negotiate and deal, wheel and deal.  She was a wheel and dealer.  She traveled; she used to get on a bus, and she would travel all over, just come to see everybody.  I remember when I was a teenager, a little guy then (unclear) a teenager.  Aunt Pearl would be on a Greyhound bus.  She'd live here.  She'd go to Cleveland.  We had people in Cleveland; my mother's brothers was in Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio.  And she'd get on that bus, and she said just take me to, just take me to the bus station.  And she'd wind up there; then she'd go to Detroit [Michigan] to see the other people; she'd go to Dayton [Ohio], you know.  That's why usually over the last so many years my mother's side has been the one to have the reunions.  And they would have them, most time they would have them in Dayton.  There's a lot of people in Dayton, my mother's people.  Now, a lot of them are passing away now (unclear).
Speaker 1: What are their last names?  What name would they have the reunion?
Speaker 2: They, they were the Stewarts.  They were Stewarts, yeah.
Speaker 1: How do you spell the Stewart?
Speaker 2: S-T-E-W-A-R-T, Stewart.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  But my mother's father was Walker; he was actually a Walker.  But my mother [Mary Gilliam], when she was adopted, she took on the Stewarts, the last name of the Stewarts, because it was a side of her mother, yeah.
Story_ID: 78567
Speaker 1: Can you tell us something about your, your father [Willie Holt]?  What kind of person was he?  What did he like to do?  What, what, what was he interested in, you know?  Where did he work, that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: My father, he was--he loved his family.  And my father always had that dream--he worked in, he worked in a lumberyard.  He used to work in a lumberyard.  This is the job--he was a laborer, but at the time he had a job that he was a chauffeur.  He was a chauffeur driving for surveyors in the South.  They used to have the surveyors go out and survey the land.  Well, my father had a job driving, and then along came the Depression.  This is the story that they tell me.  'Cause my mother [Mary Gilliam] had pictures, have pictures of my father and this driving cab and stuff.  And along came the Depression and that job was taken away from him, taken away from him.  And I can remember some of the lean, lean times when we were--like, it was like winter, and that was, was so great, the closeness of the family, family on both sides, how they used to bring food to us.  My father was a proud cat.  He used to work like--I don't know if you've been South and you've seen these concrete pillars that they used to make to sit the houses on, sit the little wooden houses on.  They make 'em where you had to pour this concrete.  And my father, and we (unclear)--like a lot of times we go down by the lumberyard and go, and my dad would be out there, him and another man, Mr. John Smith, and they would make--I actually watched them make these concrete pillars.  And then the time where it got so rough, he felt that--he used always say my chil'ren.  He said I gotta get my chil'ren out of the South.  He'd tell my mother, Mary--my mother's name Mary--I got to get these chil'ren out of here.  I gotta get 'em out of here.  And forget what--it was like almost fall.  It was like August or something, and I'd heard talk, you know, we had heard talk that, hey, dad thinking about going North.  And Ma Ma [Lenora Tims Henderson], which was his mother, Lenora Henderson--she married later; she was a Tims and then she married Henderson--so, sent him a ticket.  My, my, my grandmother sent a ticket, but the ticket was from Memphis [Tennessee] to Chicago [Illinois].  So, my dad hitchhiked.  He got a ride on an Armour meat packing truck.  The trucks used to go Down South.  They come Down South then delivering meat there, you know.  And my dad--my mother's sister had a connection that she knew the guy, and when he come through my dad got a hitchhike ride with him to Memphis.  And Memphis is where he got on the train.  And it was, you know, like it was, it was feeling like, wow, man.  You know, it's a feeling like whoa.  When your dad leave you, you know, going to, to take care of business, but the word was I'm gon' send for you and the children.  I'm gon' send for you and my chil'ren.  That's what he used to say, I'm gon' send for you.  And man, he came to Chicago, and he got a job at Armer Radio working up north.  And I don't think it was four months or three months didn't go by when my dad sent that, sent the tickets, along with him and his mother, they sent them tickets, and we was catching that IC, that Illinois Central train that runs right, comes right down Roosevelt Road.  I think it was 1941.  I think it was '41' [1941] we hit that train and came here.  But that's--he was determined.  And he got sick, and in four years he was gone.  But he wanted us, he really wanted us to get out of the South because he say, my children got to get an education.  He--I love him, man, today, man.
Story_ID: 78568
Speaker 1: You know, me and my brother, my older brother, Ben, we always talk- hey man, we got a lot to be thankful for my dad [Willie Holt], man.  He had that foresight because--we had schools, we had schools, and we had, had a good school.  The school burned down.  You know, our memories of all that stuff I got.  And it was--and at that time they used the church, and we had, we had good teachers.  But the kind of education that my father knew that we needed, he had to get us out of Mississippi.  And he used to always say: Mary [Gilliam], I gotta get my children out of here.  We got to get 'em out of here, and we got out 1941.  I can remember we came and as--I think I had--I don't know if it was a half-price ticket or what.  You know, my, my--well, let, let me--there was three of us, three siblings.  My, my younger brother, who's passed away now, Charlie, Charles Holt; my older brother, Benjamin Holt, is still living; my sister, Willa Blue is living.  She married.  And the three of us--there were tickets like the older children paid.  The baby, Charlie, he was too small, and I was growing then, I was about nine, almost nine.  And I remember my mother, I had to sit over on the other side of my mother and kind of shrink down, man, shrink down like, hey, we don't wanna have to pay for you, you guys, you know.  And all that time I sat there, and the was gonna come along and kind of keep you kind of cover up, you know.  And we got here though, man; we got to Chicago [Illinois]--those were the days--and moved to the West Side with like, with my grandmother.  We slept on pallets at that time, you know, like, we, kids, it was fun for us 'cause I had two--we had the cousins, and we put that pallet down on the floor, man.  And that's, that's, that's the way we stayed until we were able to get, get a place, you know, to stay, before we could rent, you know and--
Speaker 2: So you just make you a pallet out of blankets or something?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, you take the pallets, you take it and lay it down; you take the blankets and put it on the floor, and you lay there and you tell spooky stories and enjoy yourself, you know.  It was, it was nice, you know.
Story_ID: 78569
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell us something about your mother.  Now, what's her name again, and can you spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother is Mary Gilliam, G-I-L-L-I-A-M.
Speaker 1: Okay, was that, that, that her maiden name?
Speaker 2: The maiden name, she used her uncle's, which was Stewart.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She used Stewart, but when she married, she married my father, [Willie] Holt.  And then he passed away, and she married another gentleman by the name of Gilliam, Buddy Gilliam.  It was Gilliam's--Buddy Gilliam was something like that, but it was Gilliam.  She's now, my mom is now in the nursing home.  It's the South Shore, South Shore Nursing Home, right over there at 75th, 75th and, and, and Exchange.  This February, like February the 18th, my mom will be ninety-two.  She'll be ninety-two.  She has to be there because she's diabetic, and heart is bad, but she still moves around.  She, she, she was mostly a housewife.  She was a housewife.  And we were teenagers when my father passed away, so therefore we were able to contribute.  My brothers and I, we were able to contribute.  And he had, she had those little odd jobs, a few little odd jobs, but she also worked as a nurse's aide in a hospital that used to be along Michigan Avenue here.  What was it called?  Lewis Memorial, she worked there for quite a while.  And then she was with the, she, she became a part of the arts, the Urban Gateways, like when I was there.  She became like--she went to Olive-Harvey [College, Chicago, Illinois].  I was proud of my mom.  She went to Olive-Harvey and took their, an art course, where she was--she did macrame, she, and she taught that for the Urban Gateway.  She would go to the schools.  I was doing a jazz program with the Urban Gateways, and so they were looking for someone.  And I said hey, my mom do all of that crocheted and all that macrame and everything, and afghans, she do all of that pottery and stuff.  And my mom did that for about, who, five years, you know.  And she's, she's quite a lady.  Like, if you go over there now, man, she's one of these little fast walking ladies, fast talking.  She go: I can do this, I can do that.  And she's funny because she, you know, she'll get up and start trying to move, and then she'll start to stumbling.  And you're gonna say hey, ma, you know, like hey, you're over ninety-two.  It ain't nothing but a word, ain't nothing, ain't nothing but a word.  That, that's, that's the kind of attitude she has.  I think she passed a lot of it on to me, I--you know, a lot of it, even though a lot of people say we look a lot--they see me and they say, man, you look like your mother's twin almost, you know, yeah.  But she's been quite a lady, you know, and quite, quite inspirational to us.  'Cause, you know, like being teenagers and without a father, you know, like--which was--it was a beautiful time though because, like, neighbors were like your--you know, like, you did something wrong, the neighbor was gonna, gonna pass it on and lay something on you.  By the time you get home something else was gon' be laid on you.  So, you know, we just came through, you know.  And so she, she finished raising us, man, till we were grown.
Story_ID: 78570
Speaker 1: So did your parents have a story that they told you about how they met?
Speaker 2: I think my father [Willie Holt] came to town or something some kind of way.  Well, you know it was the same story where he had to ask, had to go ask her uncle, which was her dad, he--'cause he had adopted her [Mary Gilliam, mother], you know.  And you know, they checked him out and they got married.  You know, they, you know, they didn't tell me too much into, you know, but I think it was about the same, you know, as the average person.  The light go on (laughter), you know, the light, hey, click and then, hey, whoa, it's all right, you know.
Speaker 1: Sometimes it's a big, it's a more involved story, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: We always ask if there's a story.
Speaker 2: Well, I know one thing she told me, you know, like, well, he had to be okay'd through the family.  You know, he had to be okay'd.
Story_ID: 78571
Speaker 1: See, like, also on my mother's [Mary Gilliam] side, right there in Rosedale [Mississippi], they did, the Stewarts, the Stewarts (unclear)--my mother's it was the Stewarts--the Stewarts actually owned a certain amount of property, because they owned two of the houses.  They owned the house where we lived in, where I was born in.  I call it the old house.  And then they built another house there they call the new house.  And like on the side I remember Uncle Ben, the old Uncle Ben, he had what was--what they used to do is they had--they make corn meal, they had the corn.  And I remember he had like a mill there, like a little small mill, and he would grind--my older brother would go over with him, and they would grind this corn meal.  You know, like, sometimes my brother would come back over to the house all white from corn meal, you know.  My mother's people in that little town, Rosedale, I would say they wasn't rich people, for the times, they were well off people, you know.  You know, some of them were carpenters in the family.  From what I gathered, they were men that had learned their craft.  Like the Uncle Ben was older that had the mill, they had learned that craft.  And I think some of that craft was learned from slavery, learned through that, and it was passed on to the others.  And like, my father, I can remember my father wiring the house, and he had like a fifth grade education.  But he could do things he, working at the lumberyard.  I remember him going up on a post.  They used to have them old wooden posts.  And he went up on that post, and he did something.  And he run the wire in the house, and he started--he wired every room in the house, you know.  There was no codes or anything that they had to follow, anything that they would stop him from doing, you know, so I saw him--he wired the house.  And I had a auntie, he used to--as a matter of fact, she had the first, she had the first indoor toilet in that whole section where we was at.  And I saw my father and a man, Mr. John Smith, who worked at the lumberyard, they dug it all out, concrete it, put it all together, put the commode in the house.  And man, that was a big deal.  That was a big deal going there, ssswwh, flushing it (laughter).
Story_ID: 78572
Speaker 1: I've experienced, I've experienced quite a lot of things, you know, and--
Speaker 2: Let me just take you back to early childhood, before we get further, and just, just give us a sense of what it was like in Rosedale, Mississippi, where you were raised.  You were there till you were nine, and then, you know, compared to Chicago [Illinois], what, what were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing there?
Speaker 1: In Rosedale, Mississippi, I would say, like, where we lived, you know, and of course at that time it was segregated.  You had--like, we had the black school and you had the white school.  There were different people that lived in certain sections, you know, like white and black.  Like, right next door to us there was a white family, but actually they were renting, renting the, the gas station there.  They had one son.  And he lived next door, but he went to one of--time to go to school, he would go up, up town, up town, and our school was south of the railroad track.  And at that time, it was a, it was, it was time when, like a lot of people would say you actually really knew where to go and where not to go, if you, if you follow what I'm saying.  You, you, you know when to cross the street, you know whose eyes to look into, you know to look that way.  And your mother and your father would tell you these things, and you knew how to do it.  So when you got to Chicago, it was a whole different story.  You didn't have to drop your eyes or don't look if a white person is coming this way or doing that.  It was a whole different thing.  You just--it was, it was like night and day.  Even though we had fun as children, it was still, if you had, if, if you had the know to think, you know.  Like, we had fun like get up in the morning, there was a lumberyard, you to go, go in the sand and you, in the sawdust, and you get wood out and bring it home and do all this stuff.  You play like a child; you roll your tire, and you have fun.  But, still, it's almost as if--your people would say like, hey, now you know your place.  Don't get out of place.  You go to the picture show, you gotta sit upstairs.  You sit upstairs at the picture show.  You understood that.  We go to the picture show, and the big deal then was "Hopalong Cassidy," because basically this is all what they showing.  It was the cowboy era, you know.  It was, coming to Chicago--and when I had--when you're here, here, man, you see these big buildings.  When you, when you come, when you come down that IC [Illinois Central railroad], and you, you're coming in, you're coming into Chicago, you're seeing all these big buildings and everything.  I didn't, I didn't like Chicago at first.
Story_ID: 79236
Speaker 1: Well, when I first came to Chicago [Illinois], you know, like, like I say, I had to get used to the buildings and stuff, but I really didn't like the alleys, and I missed my space.  I missed that space, man, where, you know, you could go out in your backyard, and we had a backyard.  We had that freedom, you know.  You could go and climb a chinaberry tree, you know; you can do things like that, man.  And, and the city was, you was kind of confined, and it was new.  And we had a couple of cousins here, but still my mother you--they be kind of protective of you--don't, don't go here, don't, don't go there, don't, you know.  And it was like, wow, man, but later on I got used to it.
Story_ID: 79237
Speaker 1: Because like, I actually, most of those early years, I grew up right there at Cregier School.  I went to Cregier after I left Gladstone Elementary.  Let me explain.  Like, I don't know if you know, the West Side you got Roosevelt Road and you got Taylor Street.  And we were like really centered between that Damen Avenue on the--yeah, Damen on the west, and like, Ashland--let's say Ashland east--you had Ashland, and then you had Taylor Street and Roosevelt.  And that was like, my grandmother was on Wolcott.  And like this was our area, Cregier's area, Cregier's schoolyard.  We would go there and play baseball in the summertime.  We'll play baseball, man, like we'll start at 9:00 in the morning during the summertime, and we'll be out there playing (unclear) until it get dark.  We'd go in to eat and come back, you know.  But this was our territory.  And at that time, really like, you take like Taylor Street all the way to Taylor Street down to Racine you had the Italians.  The Italians was like from Oakley all the way down.  It was very mixed.  We had Mr. Miles, who had a Jewish store there.  Then there was the McGuires, who were black, and Mr. McGuire was one of the first enterprising guys that I, I remember.  He had--as a matter of fact, they're affiliated with Seaway, Seaway Furniture.  That's a great gran--and was a grandson or either great-grandson that runs that Seaway Furniture.  But we all conjugated right in there.  I went into Gladstone Elementary School.  Now Gladstone was at Damen and 13th Street, Damen, 13th, 14th, right along there.  After graduating from Gladstone, I graduated from Gladstone in 1947.
Speaker 2: That's near where Malcolm X College is--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --around that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --all that area.
Story_ID: 79238
Speaker 1: Well, actually when I, when I went to Crane Tech--I went to Crane Tech [High School, Chicago, Illinois] in '47' [1947].  First I went to Cregier for a while, went to Cregier [Vocational High School, Chicago, Illinois], but at that time, Crane Tech was all boys.  And we wanted to be play basketball, and the coach over there was kind of like recruiting.  And it was either between McKinley High School or Crane Tech.  And myself and a couple of guys chose Crane, to go to Crane so we could play basketball, and I could get in the band.  That was, that was my dream, to go there, because I had always beat on some of everything, you know.  And when I went, when I went to Crane I was able to get in the band.  And I moved, I moved very fast in the band, and that's when I began to meet the different musicians, and we formed a little band called the West Side Clefts, yeah.
Speaker 2: And how old were you about that time?
Speaker 1: Let's see, we were still, still at Crane; I, I would say seventeen.  We, we formed that little group with seventeen and eighteen years old, you know, was just getting ready come out of high school, just getting ready.  We played dances (simultaneous).

Speaker 1: When you were coming along, when you were younger, did you, did you--were you taking drum lessons or anything, or were you--or did you--when did you get your first drums?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I had the dream of playing drums.  What really happened is in the South, before we left the South, my daddy [Willie Holt] took us to see a minstrel show.  And he used to save up--they'd save up a little money.  We would go see the minstrel shows.  There was one called "Silas Green from New Orleans."  Another was "Rabbit and Sugarfoot."  But I saw Silas Green--
Speaker 1: These are actual minstrel shows?
Speaker 2: Actual minstrel show, "Silas Green--
Speaker 1: With the black people--
Speaker 2: --from New Orleans."
Speaker 1: --black people--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --faces--
Speaker 2: Yeah, "Silas Green from New Orleans."  And he took us to see that, and man, I saw--they call him a trap drummer there--and I saw this trap drummer, and this trap drummer was playing.  And they had, and they took them spoons and had them spoons playing, and had the water bottles where the put so much water in the bottles, and they were playing them bottles.  Man, it tripped me out.  I said that's what I wanna do from that moment.  And another guy, that's the first time I saw this man, Peg Leg Bates, had that one leg.  He was dancing, dancing around with that leg.  And I went home, man.  I went home.  I remember my mother's [Mary Gilliam] clothesline.  I had them water bottles; I tied 'em all on.  My mother said (laughter) you get--the water bottles were all on it.  I had to take 'em off, cause we had this clotheslines that they prep up.
Speaker 1: Make the line sag down (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, and I was out there doing it.  But I was fascinated, and that's what--you know, 'cause I wanted to be an artist; I used to draw a lot, but that was my dream.  I said I wanna be a drummer.  And I went home, and man, the next--my dad never and everybody look at me and say oh, you wanna be drummer, huh, hm?  Yeah, okay.
Story_ID: 79240
Speaker 1: But I had one auntie, that auntie--see, Aunt Lula and Aunt Pearl were sisters.  I mentioned Aunt, Aunt Pearl earlier, but she had a sister.  She was like, she was like big Cherokee. She had a lot of Cherokee.  They had a lot of Cherokee in 'em.  She had, she was big and she had long hair down her back.  But she used to always say--she came some--to Chicago [Illinois] one time when I got my drums.  She said I told y'all that boy, I told you that boy was gonna be a drummer.  I told he was gonna be a drummer.  'Cause I used to just play on everything.  I got my first set of drums, man, when I was at Crane Tech High School [Chicago, Illinois].  My father [Willie Holt] had passed away, and I had worked all that summer.  I worked all that summer at--there was a chain of restaurants called Thompson Restaurants.  They were the Thompson Restaurants.  I used to do everything.  I used to bus the dishes, go out and bus the dishes, bring 'em back, push 'em through the window, come inside, rinse 'em out, and, and, and, and, and wash 'em.  They had these old dishwashers that you, you put the water--the water was in a hole.  And you had to put the dishes in a tray, in like a, like a little wooden thing.  And you stack 'em, you had to stack 'em a certain way, 'cause if you didn't stack 'em a certain way, they wasn't gon' clean.  And when they come out, when you take 'em out of that water and put 'em and rinse 'em and come out, and take 'em out if they wasn't clean, supervisor gon' come along, check 'em, and you got to run 'em right back.  I did some of the porter work.  And that was after my father died.  And I was able to play--it was kind of weird, 'cause (unclear) how could you be in the band, how could you play basketball, and still do all these things?  Well, hey, man, it was like I did it, but I had a lot of people helping me.  Because at one time, my manager, the manager of the store, he had gone--he was on a swimming team at Lindblom, so he was always--he say, go'n pay ball, I'mma punch you in anyway.  So I go play ball.  I remember one time we had to drive way out to Morgan Park from Crane Tech.  We had to ride way out there and play.  We got to Von Steuben, go places like that, and I would be late getting to the job.  But when I would get there, he would have the instructor to guy--the night guy to punch my card.  And so I would put in a few hours.  And that was like, I would say '48' [1948], '49' [1949].  Nineteen, Nineteen forty-nine [1949] I got that first set of drums or either 19--1950 I got that first set of drums (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 79241
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--like what, what position did you play in basketball when you--
Speaker 2: I was a guard.
Speaker 1: Guard, okay.
Speaker 2: I played a guard.
Speaker 1: And, and you--
Speaker 2: Crane Tech [High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Were you are starter on the team?
Speaker 2: I didn't start until that last year.  And I sat there on the bench.  And then the last year I was working, and I didn't wanna, I didn't wanna start anyway, you know, 'cause I wanted to--had to go keep them coins coming in because you're talking about graduation coming up, you know.  You gotta sacrifice this, or you gotta go to prom.  And like a lot of kids, my kids now, now--I said, you know, I never did get a graduation ring.  I never did buy my, my Crane Tech graduation ring.  You know, I, I just--and this why--that's what amazes me when a lot of kids today: I gotta have this; I gotta have that; I gotta do this.  And they say, well--I said well, you know, I went to my prom.  I saved my money, took a young lady, which is my wife, Marylean that--'cause you know that she was my sweetheart then, and we've been married forty-eight years.  And a lot of things she understood, you know.  And hey, man, (laughter), but I've been--but the drums--
Speaker 1: Yeah, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --that's my life, man.
Story_ID: 79242
Speaker 1: So that first set, what, what kind did, did you get?
Speaker 2: It was a Ludwig single tension.  And do you know I've been playing, I played Ludwigs just about all my life. I have two sets of Ludwigs now.  I have a vintage set that say is like '73' [1973], '74' [1974], that's vintage now.  I found--well, out of my garage I went and took it out of the garage 'cause it's a wooden one; that was about my third bass drum, and that was like from 1960-something.  I brought it in, I brought it in the house this summer, brought it in before it got real cold.  And I played, I played Gretsch.  When I got out of the Army, I played--I got a new set of Gretsch.  And a guy talked me into trading my Ludwig, which I regret today that I traded that first set of drums, man.  I, I--that, that wasn't my--you know, but at that time, man, a brand new set of Gretsch, and they shining and sparkling; and you know, hey, well, trade that in, I'll give you so much on that.  And boom, you know, so I traded it in.
Story_ID: 79243
Speaker 1: And then, there was that one time I played Rogers.  I got a set of Rogers because we were in Cleveland at a place, Ramsey [Lewis, HM], Eldee [Young, HM], and myself.  The first time we went to Cleveland [Ohio], there was a place called the Hickory, the Hickory Lounge.  And we worked the Hickory after the Theatrical Grill burned down.  It's a brand new--the Theatrical Grill that they have in Cleveland now is the last one that was built.  And I, I--it's been there quite awhile.  A lot of people think it's old, but that's not the first one.  I'm trying to think what year it was that Leonard Chess bought us that station wagon and, and you know, record companies in them days they'd buy everybody a station wagon.  You know, if you get you a station wagon, you ready to roll, hit the road.  It was in, well, let's see--we had did the first record in '57' [1957]; we did the '57' [1957], '58' [1958], so it--so it had to be '59' [1959]; it had to be about 1959 or '60' [1960].  We went to Cleveland.  We went to Theatrical Grill, and about the third day--going into the second week, the place caught on fire, just caught on fire out of the blue.  And man, it burned down.  We, we stood there--Eldee had a bass, a German bass.  And we begged the firemen.  I had my cymbals on the stage.  I begged the firemen, please, let me go in and get my cymbals.  Man, they said, we can't let you go in there, it's too dangerous.  I said, but the stage is right there, I'm looking at it, I'm standing there looking; I said, let me go.  He say I'm sorry, and Eldee stood there with tears in his eyes, crying because he had his German bass and it was right around in the coatroom, you know, and there we are, standing.  And we stood there until that place, ssshssp [sound effect], went down.  Leonard Chess, we called Leonard Chess up.  We said, Leonard, hmmp, we need some money, (unclear)--Leonard, we need some money.  Yeah, I heard about it.  I said we'll need a set of drums.  Well, Rogers Drums had just, they had just opened up, and the headquarters was Cleveland.  At that time, Rogers, Ludwig Drums, and everybody was fighting over a patent with these new mechanical, just use your drum key and it's the ball, it was that ball.  You see that ball a lot now in a lot of things, but that was the first.  Rogers was the first drum that I remember had that ball where you could loosen it and swivel your drums and roll it around on.  I think Leonard sent me about--what was it--300-some dollars or something like that, and I got a beautiful set of Rogers.  I enjoyed 'em for a while, but I eventually went back to Ludwig.  And Ludwig, over the years, I advertise for them, advertise quite a lot, you know, and I lean towards it.
Story_ID: 79244
Speaker 1: Like I say, any drum, any drum that you can start tuning it and get that tone and the play out of it, it don't really matter about the name.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--it's the right one, huh (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the right one; it don't matter.  Because, I can remember--what is it--I remember what is it, the Yamaha?  No, it was Pearl.  I was in Washington, D.C., when I played my first of Pearls, and to me then that Pearl Drum was just like the Toyota car.  I remember when the first Toyota car came to, it was out in L.A., and I looked at the Toyota--we, we looked at it and said, man, what is this, a toy?  It was like a toy, you know, but that's, that's telling my age.  You know, like I say, I'm blessed to be, to be this age, to be able to see these things, to be able to say--that's a lot of times now if you get to say oh, man, what did say?  Hey, just be cool, just be cool.  Everything's gonna be all right, because I have been blessed with this time to see things move in a circle, just go round and round; it just keeps coming back.  That's why some of them things gon' come back.
Story_ID: 79245
Speaker 1: Now tell me about how--now you had, you had a bad started, the Clefts, on the West Side, right?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And now, how did you--how long was it before you started associating with Ramsey Lewis [HM] and, and Eldee Young [HM]?
Speaker 2: We had, when I say we, there's a guy, Wallace Burton.  Wallace Burton and I, I think we was playing basketball one day, and I found out that Wallace played saxophone.  And I play the drums, and we said, man, we need to get together.  So he and I got together, hooked up, got another saxophone player, a guy by the name of Rosum (ph.) Pilette (ph.).  He was our first saxophone player.  Wallace was playing a little keyboard and saxophone.  As a matter of fact, I didn't know he played saxophone from, at, at, at the beginning of that.  Then later on, I finds out he played saxophone.  So we had a piano, we've had a piano player named Kirk Stuart.  Kirk Stuart wasn't but ss--he was like a genius, man.  He went with Sara.  Oh, man, he was just phenomenal.  He could, he could read comic--he could play, he could be reading a comic book, and sit and play the song with you, play the song with you.  He was, he was just like that.  That was a trio.  We used to do amateur shows.  We'd do the amateur shows, okay.  Later on, we added another piece, a guy, Peter Hall, bass player.  We got a job that was a 12:20, and we played on Roosevelt Road.  But eventually we got at--we were over at Union Park.  We got the gig on Friday nights playing dances.  During, during that time Eldee was playing guitar.  Eldee was a little cat played guitar, and he would come around with his little guitar--can I sit in man?  Can I sit in?  And so, we had a ruling where, man, we don't allow no sitting in; we don't, we don't do all that sitting in (unclear)--'cause Wallace and I had formed a band.  The band had--we'd eventually, we went to seven pieces.  We had got Booker Porter, saxophone - he passed away last year; a guy named Edward Morris, Dinky, who was with, he was with Jin--Jimmy Cheatham for a long time, you know, the--Jimmy Cheatham out there that day, had that hit, baby meet me with your black mm, mm on.  You understand?  So, he was with that group, but we were all teenagers together.  You know, we had a little guitar player named Francisco.  He's a little Filipino guy.  Eldee came in--the, the Korean War was just getting off, getting, getting off the ground.  And Eldee used to come around and beg to sit in.  We'd let him sit in.  We was at the Union Park, and they mis--they had put a stage up so we could set up.  And Eldee would come around, and hook up, and fly out, and, he, he playing a little bit; cats say okay.  Peter Hall was the first one to get drafted.  He was the bass player.  And we didn't know Eldee played bass, we didn't know.  But Eldee sat in one night, and Eldee played bass.  We said, man, I didn't know you played no bass, could have been playing bass.  And Eldee came into the Clefts; as a matter of fact, Eldee was the last guy into the Clefts before Ramsey came in.  Ramsey [Lewis, HM] was the last guy to join the [West Side] Clefts, because the piano player Kirk Stuart left and went out.  He was just doing all kind of gigs with everybody; he was in demand.  So Ramsey was going to the church over in Englewood where Wallace Burton was like a junior choir director.  And he told me, he said, man, we--he said there's this kid--we need a piano player.  So he said there's this kid over at the church.  He wants to play jazz.  He said he don't know much jazz.  He don't know that much about it, but he's willing to learn.  And we was playing a place called the Masonic Temple up on Lake Street one night.  And he said I got him coming by; man, he gon' come by, and you check him out, you know, we'll see what's happening.  So (unclear) came by, and at that time he was wearing those little old fingertip coats, them little coats we called them fingertip coats, you know.  He a skinny little cat, man.  He was standing there.  And he came, he sat in, and Wallace said what you think?  I said well, I think he'll be all right; he'll be okay.  And that was the beginning of hooking up with Ramsey, Eldee [Young, HM], and everything.  But it all came from the Clefts, all came out of the West Side Clefts.  That was the beginning of the whole thing.
Story_ID: 79246
Speaker 1: Then we began--we got that gig at Union Park every Friday night.  We'd play there every Friday night.  I used to pick Ramsey [Lewis, HM] up.  I'd go to the North Side on Orleans and pick him up.  And his daddy would say--you know that thing--what is it--Richard Pryor would say, be, be, be back here by 11:30, [singing] 11:30--
Speaker 2: He had to be back home.
Speaker 1: He wanted him to be back home--[singing] be here at 11:30.  We'll be a little late, you know--but he wanted him in, 'cause he couldn't drive, as a matter fact.  I don't think Ramsey--Ramsey, we went to New York the first time, and I--when we got back, I said, man, I'm gon' teach you how to drive.  I'mma teach you how to drive, 'cause I can't be driving, me and Eldee [Young, HM] can't be driving all the way to New York and doing everything.  We came back, but that was the beginning.  And after the Korean War began to break us up, Peter went, I got drafted, and, and it just brought the whole band down.  I think Eldee even went traveling with Jimmy Binkley, think Eldee with Jimmy Binkley.  He was out there with a couple of guys.
Story_ID: 79247
Speaker 1: And I stay--I was in the Army.  I did my two. And--
Speaker 2: Where did you go when you, you were in the Army--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I went, I took my--
Speaker 2: --(unclear)--
Speaker 1: I, I took basic training in Camp Chaffee, Arkansas.  I took basic training.  I waited around on, on tee--I waited around on job training.  I waited around to try to get into the band.  They were supposed to have a position.  After the whole post, everybody had their--had done all of they--we, we did everything, training, and then you got to move on.  I was sitting there with a couple more guys, and I'd had problems with my feet.  So a guy said well, look like, look like we're not gon' be able to, not gon' be able to do nothing for the band.  Man, I went over to the office.  I say hey, man, y'all got to get me out, everybody else gon' home.  So they say well, we got to send you to Fort Knox then, Third Army Division tanks.  They say you on your feet, you (unclear)--you're in infantry, but you can't deal with your feet, we put you in tanks.  So I wind, I wind up with, I got a tanker's MOS [military occupational specialty], but I got--I went TDY [temporary duty].  As soon as I got to Germany, when I was shipped out, I went TDY and was in the band, I was in the regimental band, 12th  Regiment, Fourth Division, I was in there the whole time I was over in Germany.  So I spent most of my time in the 12th Regimental Band, you know, and then we added, we formed jazz band, which was the best thing happened to me.  Music, music has really rewarded me well, being a musician.
Story_ID: 79248
Speaker 1: So when I got out of the Army, my wife tickle me, she said Ramsey [Lewis, HM], Ramsey used to call me every other month when it was almost time for you to say "When is he coming?"--she say I told you he ain't getting out until June or blah, blah, blah.  So when I got out, we got together, and we started to rehearse and do things like, man, we used take drums up.  I think Eldee [Young, HM] lived over there.  See, at that time, my wife was living in the Robert Brooks.  You know, you know those projects over there?  You got the Robert Brooks Homes, you had on the West Side there.  And then there's--that's when they first built them tall ones, them tall CHA [Chicago Housing Authority] houses.  They--
Speaker 2: Altgeld--I mean--
Speaker 1: They built--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I mean--
Speaker 1: And, and Eldee lived up--
Speaker 2: Henry Horner, Henry Horner--
Speaker 1: No, Henry Horner was later.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Henry Horner came later.  That's when--now, they built the Henry Horners where I used to live, at Maple, 20--2258 Maple Street.  That's when I was going to Crane Tech.  that's where the Henry Horners were built.  They tore all of that down, but this was before that.  Over like on Loomis, you got 13 in Loomis, those, those are the Robert Brooks, the Robert Brooks.  And then you had the others on Taylor Street, which is still there now.  You still got a certain amount of 'em going west past Racine.  That was all the, the, the West Side.  We used to take drums up, man.  I forget what floor Eldee was on.  The elevator wouldn't work, we'd take them drums all the way up to 12, 13th, floor.  That's right, we wanted to play and rehearse that bad.  The wives would have the kid.  I had one son then, Lamont; Ramsey and Jerry had two, Baby Brother, which is Ramsey, Jr., and Denise, that was the two he had; and Bobby had just the one, (unclear).  And it was a family affair.  It was a family affair.
Story_ID: 79249
Speaker 1: --Eldee [Young, HM] was playing guitar and stuff like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Eldee switched to bass.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And you say well, hey, he can really play.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and, and, and that's how Eldee actually started playing bass with us.  And we added different guys, and we formed the trio.  But I came back from the Army, and we started all over all, and we got--after rehearsals and stuff like that, we got, we got--there's a guy, I'm trying to think of his name because Daddy-O [Daylie, HM] actually got us, began to manage us--there was a guy named George.  He was a policeman.  I can't think of his whole name.  He's deceased now, but he originally took us to Leonard Chess when Chess--Chess, Checker, and it was Argo.  It wasn't Cadet yet.  I think Cadet was named later for Leonard's son, Marshall, and Phil Chess's son.  But he took us to Leonard Chess and told him this is a group, good group, you ought to listen to.  And I had this snare drum, and it had a hole in it.  You know, I'd play, man, I'd play, I'd play the drumhead in them days until it wasn't no drumhead.  I'd put some tape on it, this here, and that, you know and man, you know, and play it.  So the guy named John Lewis, he--we used to kid him--he worked in the back room for, with Leonard and them.  We used to say hey, man, you got the same name as John Lewis with the Modern Jazz Quartet, and he'd say yeah, I know.  He brought me out a piece of cardboard from a forty-five, from the forty-five record he brought me a piece of cardboard out.  And we put that cardboard on that drum, and I taped it.  And we went through some stuff that we, we done did.  Phil Chess was there, Leonard was there, and, and Phil was like always, always the guy who smoked a cigar.  He was always a, the good guy.  You know you got two guys.  He would, okay, and Leonard was the stern one.  Leonard Chess was like, mm, I don't know; I don't know about this here, you know.  But they decided to say yeah, we ought to do, we ought to deal with that; let these guys--hey, let's give 'em a shot, let's give 'em shot.
Story_ID: 79250
Speaker 1: And we were working a place called Lake Meadows Stelzers, it was called that was over there then.  And Daddy-O [Daylie, HM] had came in.
Speaker 2: What, what's the name of it again?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Over in Lake Meadows there was a place called Stelzers.
Speaker 2: Stelzers.
Speaker 1: Stelzers.
Speaker 2: Can you spell it?
Speaker 1: It was a lounge, ooh S-T-E-L-Z-E-R-S, Stelzers.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Later, they start calling it the Lake Meadow Lounge.  And there was some other lounge later they built over behind there.  It was like a big banquet hall or something like that.  If I recall, some of the first artist went over there was Oscar Brown, Jr.  He went over there.  But actually, Daddy-O first heard us in Stelzers.  Sid McCoy had heard us also, and the word was kind of getting around.  And before we did complete deal with Leonard Chess, Daddy-O had became our manager.  See, Daddy-O became our manager, and that was--we were very fortunate, as young musicians that didn't know any business.  All we know is we wanted to play music.  We wanted to play music, and we wanted to be able to make a living for our families.  We knew nothing about writer's royalty, publisher's royalty.  We didn't know any of this, and that's why today I feel sorry for a lot of young musicians that don't have the right direction.  And that's why I use--I say when you don't know, and don't know that you don't know, you just, man, you, you like a little lamb, you just out there.  And you're gonna be had unless you got somebody looking out for you.  And I'm thankful for the day--as there were mistakes made, there were mistakes made in the change of the name, you know.  Daddy-O made the mistakes.  We let it go because we were all there to make money, to change from the original idea that we had when we first started with Leonard Chess, with the Argo, with the Cadet label, with the whole thing.
Story_ID: 79251
Speaker 1: When we first started it was to say Gentlemen Jazz or either Gentlemen of Swing.  We decided upon that second album, which had pictures of us on it, all three.  And Daddy-O [Daylie, HM] had formed a partnership for us and had had papers drawn up, and we had all signed, so we had a partnership.  So it came to being that they felt like the marquee, the, the piano player was the front man.  That's the way it started off, saying well, the piano is the front man.  You got Ahmad Jamal, you got John Young, you got all these, you know, you got Oscar Peterson, Billy Taylor.  And we were saying, but no, Gentleman of Jazz is what we were talking about in the beginning, you know.  As old the words say, from jump street, from jump street.  That's what we were talking about.  Now it began to change.  And we used to have meetings.  We had meetings like, my wife, Ramsey's [Lewis, HM] wife, Eldee's wife, and the children sitting right there; they were little, little bitty ones there, you know.  And so we got through it.  So, for the benefit of the whole group and what Daddy-O was talking about, shortening the name, and the piano being this, Eldee [Young, HM] and I agreed.  We agreed because in order to say hey, we all gon' make some money. And so we agreed to that, and that's what it originally was supposed to be.  So tho--those were mistakes that were made.  And sometimes you say maybe it was inevitable, because look what happened with Young-Holt Trio, Young-Holt Unlimited, Redd-Holt Unlimited, Eldee Young Quartet, Trio--you know.
Story_ID: 79252
Speaker 1: And we both know the business now; we know about writing; we knew about publishing; we both have our own publishing companies; Eldee [Young, HM] and I had a publishing company, Yoho Publishing Company.  When you see that, that's Yo-Ho, meaning Young and Holt.  Since then, Eldee has formed another publishing company, but I still handle Yo-Ho because it's an established publishing company, you see.  So we, we--it, it came down the pike.  That's another old word, like from jump street, it came down the pike, man.  It's just, when God or the Creator--I say Creator.  Some people God, I say the Creator.  When the Creator's there for you, hey, man, (laughter) I feel pretty good, yeah.  You know, I feel pretty good.  I get a, I get a surge now.  I'm getting a--like some of the old folks say, I'm, I'm feeling something kind of like a Holy Ghost now.
Story_ID: 79253
Speaker 1: Holy Ghost is coming over me.  You know, you, when you get them little needles like, when you, when you get to thinking about it, when you get to thinking about--
Speaker 2: Tell me about the big hit, you know.  Now how--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That "In Crowd?"
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Man--
Speaker 2: Did, did you have any sense that that was gonna be a big hit?
Speaker 1: No, but you see--let me tell you--see, we had built an audience.  This is what I try to tell a lot of young musicians today.  Instead of jumping up trying to get that one shot, one big hit and go round, get out there and build yourself an audience.  We had been, man, we had been going like, we had been doing the circuit from when, when we started, '57' [1957].  We started that stuff when my first, Armani was born.  We was hitting Detroit; we was hitting Cleveland [Ohio]; Dayton [Ohio]; Cincinnati [Ohio]; Montreal [Quebec, Canada].  We got to Montreal.  We go to Toronto [Ontario, Canada], and we turn around and come back, and we'd be back here at this London House for Christmas, always there, the (unclear) (unclear) 'cause we gon' be here for the children.  We gon' be here so we can fix these toys up and everything else.  We gon' be there, and we gon' be there at prom time.  But we paid them dues.  And we spent a lot of time in [Washington] D.C.
Story_ID: 79254
Speaker 1: We had built an audience. And I'm trying to think.  I think it was one of the, one of the chicks, one of the barmaids.  We were getting ready to do an album, and one of them bar--what's here name?  Oh, Lord, what's her name?  I think her name was Nettie, Nettie, Nettie Gray, something like that.  And you know Dobie Gray had did "The 'In' Crowd."  He had did a--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --a vocal version.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so, this was at the Bohemian Caverns, man.  And the Bohemian Caverns was groovy place.  You come down in there, and you know, it's dark and they got these little heads on the posts and stuff, you know.  I hear they done opened it back up again.  I got to go to [Washington] D.C. and see this.  And like cavern--Tony Taylor used to run it.  It was two Tonys - one Tony was a white guy, and the other Tony Taylor was a black dude, and they was partners.  Nettie--we was getting ready to record.  I think she say, "Hey, Rev., hey, y'all, y'all know what?  Y'all ought to do this tune, "The 'In' Crowd," 'cause if you play it on the box, the people be moving."  And see, we was one of them kind of groups, we was one them groups we like for you to move, pat your feet, and dig us, dig what we're doing, none of that slick New York stuff, you know, and sit down so cool--hey, man, I don't know.  You know, what I'm saying?  We was talking about, hey, partly 'cause my wife was a dancer.  You know, we met on an amateur show where they (unclear)--well, and she was dancing, modern dancing, tapping.  And man, when people doing the boogaloo, they're doing the monkey time, twisting, and all that stuff, that was a kind of environment.  So when she said yeah, "The 'In' Crowd," and we listened to it, say, mm-hmm, yeah.  And see, we'd get on them vamps, doom, da-doom, da-doom, da-doom--[singing beats].  And see, the melody--but we had did songs.  Like, I used to call Rams [Ramsey Lewis, HM] up at 3:00 in the morning--2:00.  And I said, "Hey, Ramsey, dig this tune, man."  It was one tune we, we did, we'd already recorded--[singing] "Get off my ladder baby, I got to see my way around; get out my eyes teardrops, oh, I got to see myself."  We'd already been doing some kind of stuff like that.  'Cause I'd tell him, I said, "Hey, man, just play in the cracks."  We used to say play in the cracks like Ray Charles, play, play in the cracks.  And when, when Nettie dropped that tune on us, and we start listening to it, we said oh, yeah, okay, and we threw it in.  And it was live date, 'cause the spirit was there, but we didn't know, (Laughter), we didn't know.  Later on, (unclear) you gon' come back and that was the song.  Like, we went to New York.  When it hit we went to New York.  My wife, she, nowadays, she still tell people how shocked she was--we was in a cab.  Man, you be in a cab, and you know in them days they play the record, they used to play the record outside the record store.  They had speakers, and they'd be blasting.  Man, we was in a cab.  We're coming down Broadway, coming down Broad--[singing beats]-"I go where the in crowd go."  We said, "What?"  (Unclear) Called up--I think Leonard Chess called and said, "Y'all got a hit, y'all got a hit."  And Chess called and said, "You got a hit-" "Say what?"  "Yeah, y'all got a hit, baby."
Story_ID: 79255
Speaker 1: And [one clap], it was then on.  And then, you know, we, we like to pick songs like people like. From then on, we did "Hang on Sloopy,"--[singing]--Hang on Sloopy, Sloopy hang on.  See, there are certain songs that lend themselves to what we call, used to call "middle of the road," MOR, middle of the road songs.  A lot of jazz guys, they lean away from it.  And a lot of 'em lean to be so-called hip.  That's too pop; that's too much pop; that ain't--but I think, like I, I always been like, if you feel it, you wanna play it.  And, and, and I'll thing was getting in touch with your audience.  That's the way I am now.  I'm not just, I'm not just a drummer.  I don't think I'm just a jazz drummer.  I look at myself like a performer.  See, guys don't even use the word "show business" no more.  When I was coming up, it was show business, man.  It's like, usually Duke [Ellington] and them were show biz too, cats was clean.  Duke and them used to get clean and be (laughter) doing things, and them horns would be moving, you see.  But an entertainer, you can't be too selfish, you can't be too selfish.
Story_ID: 79256
Speaker 1: And, and I, I just believe you wanna reach people.  And those songs, there's so many songs today that a lot of guys say well, I'm not gonna trust that because that ain't enough jazz, or that's not this or that's not that.  I always believe in this when I was with--by the way, when I--with that program, the Urban Gateways program.  I always believe, and I talk to kids, jazz is not only a music; jazz is a way of playing other music, jazzing that music up.  Jazz is changing it.  Hey, you can jazz it, but then you gotta a lot of guys that don't have the versatility.  And so, by not having the versatility, no fault of his own, play what you know, but don't put down what another jazz musician, or so-called jazz musicians, have the versatility or have the ability to do, to play.  Listen to all the music and enjoy it.
Story_ID: 79257
Speaker 1: And tho--those, that was like--people say later on you, well, you guys sold out.  You sold out.  Wait a minute.  What do you mean, sold out?  Well, you sold out.  You stopped playing all of that stuff and all of this here.  So, wait a minute, man.  Well, it's commercial.  You say oh, you mean it's sellable, huh?  Oh, it's a sellable item.  You say yeah, okay.  You, you understand?  But, and see, that's the problem, has always been with a lot of jazz cats.  Right now today you got guys are down on Kenny G.  But to me Kenny G now is turning a lot of people around to listen to the jazz and listen to things that we have already done and created, already--he's, in other words, he's opened their ears up.  And that's what the Ramsey Lewis Trio, the Young-Holt Unlimited, the Redd-Holt Unlimited, the Three Sounds, the Les McCanns, these are the things that we felt, because we had that feeling on it.
Speaker 2: I, I understand what you're saying.  My, my first introduction to John Coltrane, who people would argue is as pure as they come, you know, was when he played "Favorite Things."
Speaker 1: There it is, my favorite--
Speaker 2: My mother had a copy of "Favorite Things," that's right.
Speaker 1: [Singing] Snowflakes that fall on your eyelash they say now ooh, de, de, de, and Trane knew it.
Speaker 2: From "The Sound of Music."  That's from "The Sound of Music."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and Trane knew, Trane knew.  Didn't he, didn't he do Chim Chimney, Chim Chimney, Chu, be, de, da, la, de, de, de, de, de, de doo.  Hey, man, that's catchable, hey, wow, and you can communicate with people, is what you wanna do.  And you gon' say no, man, un, baby, that ain't hip enough.  What is hip?  Let's go back then, go--what is hip?  You hippin' people to something, aren't you?  I, I, you know, I, get out there, man.  Hey, man, (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, you got to talk about it.  That's what you should, you should do, you should be talking about this.
Speaker 1: Ooh, man, you know, like, hey, man, and, and life is so short.  It's 'cause life is so short, man, and we have such a small length of time to do these things.  And you gon' sit around and, and--well, naw, I don't, that, that ain't cool to do, or this ain't that.  Do you feel it?  Is it in your heart?  Let yourself feel it.
Speaker 2: Roland Kirk was another--
Speaker 1: Ooh, I loved him, I loved him.
Speaker 2: --who, who nobody would argue that he wasn't cool enough, or he wasn't hip enough, but Roland Kirk would play anything.  He played--
Speaker 1: Man--
Speaker 2: --my, "My Favorite Things," at--you know (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 79258
Speaker 1: There's a story on him, man, when I first met him, (laughter) Roland [Kirk], but we can get--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but that, but that, that's another whole story.  When I saw him in Indianapolis, I woke Ramsey [Lewis, HM] up and told him.  I said Ramsey, there's a cat down here, man, at the Hubbub Lounge playing with no mouthpiece.  Ramsey said ah, man, come on.  I said yeah.  And later on, Jack Tracy--he told Jack Tracy, and Jack Tracy, on Mercury Records, cut him.  I used to go down to Hubbub.  See, I was one of these cats, a lot of times when those cats sleep, I'll go on to one of the joints I the town.  That's why, like, I work, I work in Indianapolis [Indiana] a whole lot now, man.  Indiana period has been, been very, very good to me.  Indiana, like, it goes back to a little place, Pizza King, down there in Lafayette, Indiana, man.  We traveled all up there.  I go down there now.  I did the festival down there the other year.  I done done two of their festivals, then I do the Elkhart Festival.  I go to Indianapolis, and I do a thing for Rap Adams 88.9, 88.7, public radio.  But, and then I got two sons down there, and I got all my little grand--my youngest grandchildren are down there.  But Indianapolis has been good to me, so has Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 79259
Speaker 1: But gigs are drying up all over the world, gigs are drying up.  And what a lot of guys don't understand also is it's a weekend world.  It always has been a weekend world.  There were just periods of time like in those fifties [1950s] when they had Blue Mondays, you had creative club owners, you had created entrepreneurs.  See, this all go together.  See, that's another thing musicians have got to learn.  The club owner and the musician have got to learn to work together, so in order to create work, artists, everything we do, it's a--that's why the Ramsey Lewis Trio was so successful, is because we were together; we were together as a family; we were together, you know.  We let no forces come in on us.
Story_ID: 79260
Speaker 1: That's why doing the hit--when we broke up, that was the most devastating thing for me in my life.  That, that was the most devastating thing to ever happen.
Speaker 2: Now what happened?  How, how, how long did you all stay together as the--
Speaker 1: Man, we had been together--
Speaker 2: 'Cause you--
Speaker 1: --from them teenage, we had been together from them teenage years, man, to 1965.  And, and when we had the partnership, you know--
Speaker 2: So at least ten, fif--yeah.
Speaker 1: So that's like--
Speaker 2: That's ov, ov, over ten years, right, you--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, ah, man, yeah, fifteen years and we--every bit of fifteen years, and then because Eldee [Young, HM] and I had Young-Holt.  We had Young-Holt twelve years I think, after that twelve years.  And when I look back over it I say, wow, man.  I get to thinking about thirty and forty years and stuff, and it's almost like it went so fast.  But, back to the point, we were, we were together on it.  We had meetings; we discussed things.  I was the bookkeeper.  I was the man that used to say, well, it'll take us so long to get to so and so, and this and that.  But, when you get those hits, you got a lot of people get up in your ear.  The parasites moves in, parasites moves in, and they begin to have the parties, the parties begin to happen, cashbox people come around, billboard people come around.  What was that other one, that cat that used to be--Record World, you know.  They had all these, all of the different people getting up in your ear and telling you--so what basically happened, we had the partnership.  In '65' [1965] we were at the London House.  So Ramsey [Lewis, HM] and his associates, attorney, who happened to have been all of our friends, who was my attorney first.  And Ramsey say, I wanna form a corporation, I wanna form a corporation, and this is what we wanna do, and this is what we're gon' do: you can get this; you get that.  And we sat down and we had a meeting.  I'm a say, that's not right.  We had a partnership.  That's not right.  We've been one-third, one-third for the little money.  Let's do one-third, one-third for the big money.  Well, that's what he wanted to do.
Speaker 2: He wanted to take more--
Speaker 1: And take control.
Speaker 2: --take a--okay.
Speaker 1: And take control, he and the lawyer, they wanted to take control.  So we heed and hawed and heed and hawed, and no, no, that ain't right.  Well, I gotta do what I gotta do.  We say you can't do that, 'cause we gotta partnership.  You gotta partnership till the end of December, which is a fiscal year.  Any partner in this year, which was there, any partner that want to dissolve or go away could at the end of that fiscal year and any fiscal year.  Now we didn't know, me and Eldee; we wouldn't even think that.  We--oh, we got a partnership; you gotta still do it.  No, I ain't.  So the next thing we get is the Letter of Dissolution, this letter was--but you can work for me.  You can come and work for me for $500 a week or you--and if anything's left over at the end of the year, then we'll do blah, blah, blah, bonuses.  And so we said naw, naw, that ain't right, that ain't right, ain't supposed to be that way.
Story_ID: 79261
Speaker 1: Well, John Levy, the manager who had took over for Daddy-O Daylie [HM]--by the way, John Levy did a book recently.  He had Nancy Wilson, Cannonball Adderley, but when he, when he had us, he didn't have all of those people, because John--Daddy-O turned us over to John.  Daddy-O says I can only take you so far, and he told us that.  He said John can take you further, because John is in New York, and he has all of the connections.  And it was beautiful, man, because John and Daddy-O made a deal that they wouldn't take no commission, take no more commission from us until they got us to $1,500 a week or something like that.  It was a, it was a figure.  I don't know, but they said you, you guys got families to take care of.  And John said I'm gonna do what I think I can do, but I won't take a commission until I get you to 1,500 or 1,750 to two grand for three guys.  Man, hey, that's beautiful.  And John, I think, on the end I think Ramsey [Lewis, HM] settled fif--about 50 grand for him.  Because he split from everybody.  He split from that, and then he sent us the notice.  John came and talked to us.  He said well, fellas, I hate it happened like this, but the best bet for you to keep you head above the water, maybe you better sign this paper.  And y'all go back and try to figure out something, make it.  It lasted, man, for two months, 1966.  It lasted because it just wouldn't work where you see all the money going in one direction, and (laughter) you getting $500 a week.  You going out doing this concert, concert, and you know, we just couldn't handle it, man.  And he finally said well, here's another letter.  You guys are through.  Because he had Maurice White, he had Maurice White and Cleve [Cleveland] Eaton for a minute.  And then he said well, when we decided to go back together and do it again, he said well, I gotta pay these cats off, 'cause now you guys gotta help me pay these cats off because these cats gon' sue me, or they did, saying like, you done already hired, he's already signed a contract with them, then he turned around and gon' do one with us.  And then they said wait minute.  You gotta give me--you gotta compensate me.  So we did, we compensated 'em something.  But ours didn't last but two or three, about two or three, three months.  And then Eldee [Young, HM] and I say hey, man, we--I sat down--we gotta do something.  We just cannot, we cannot just say, boom, the career is over.  And that's when we decided on Young-Holt, using our name, Young-Holt, no more of the other stuff, no the Chicago Trio, or the Chicago this, or blue, blue, blue, Young and Holt.  And that's the way we, we had to go, and there's nothing like using it (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 79262
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--amount of genius to that in a sense that everybody knew there was a Ramsey Lewis Trio, three, and it's well publicized that it split up.  And people naturally wondered what happened to the other two.  Who are the other two?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so it, it makes sense and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and, and we were able to--book, but some of 'em, some of the agents say well, you know, we wanna--we booked the Ramsey Lewis Trio.  Now, we had to leave ABC [Associate Booking Corporation], and we went over to Queen Booking Agency, the one that they named after Dinah Washington.  And we were over there for a while.  And we stayed until, what, I think--actually, Joe Glaser came to Chicago.  Eldee [Young, HM] and I went to London House.  And he said I wanna sign you two guys up to Associate Booking Corporation.  And he, and Joe said you are a show drummer, you are a show bass man, he said.  'Cause he handled Louis.  He told us stories about how Louis was ashamed.  Louis Armstrong was ashamed of his, ashamed of his teeth.  And he'd take that handkerchief, and he say [mimicking Louis Armstrong's voice]--start using that.  Joe Glaser told us that he was behind Louis--said he said, man, no, that's, that's your show business.  Don't be ashamed of that, you know.  When we were with Brunswick Records, Joe Glaser sat on Michigan Avenue along here.  He sat there by Brunswick.  And he sat and he told us a lot of stories.  He told us that he and Abe Saperstein, they used to drive a Model T Ford, and they crossed the country and set up all of the bookings.  And he got the booking agency for entertainer at the same time.  They did it in a Model T Ford, making direct contact like I said we did with our audience.
Story_ID: 79263
Speaker 1: We worked, we worked, oh, man, we worked many, many years before that, that hit, before that '65' [1965], but we had built an audience.  We had places, like there were place in, in Washington, D.C., called Abart's, Abart's Jazz Mecca.  They were one of the first, first clubs brought us in before we even played the Howard Theater.  They, these guys, all the--in them days you had, people were so, so humane.  I mean we would be late coming up off that old highway coming through Virgin--coming up over there, that they would call the police and find out if anything had happened to us, man.  We was just that loved.
Story_ID: 79264
Speaker 1: We were talking about that personal contact.  You were telling me about--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were telling me about Abe Saperstein and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and Joe Glaser.
Speaker 1: --Joe Glaser (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, they (unclear) their--
Speaker 1: He had the Model T Ford going--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --town to town to place to place making these--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --contacts.
Speaker 2: Right.  And see, and see, and them contacts, contacts in them days, man, they had to deal with some shady characters.  They told me they had to, they had to deal with some shady cats.  Some of them club owners, some of them cats then, (laughter) you know, you know, it was only certain cats that owned them joints, you know, that owned the places.  And they had somebody fronting it, you know.  But yeah, it's, it's, it's been a long, long little old trail for me.  It's been, been up the river.  Speaking of joints, my mind just jumped to Don King when he had the joint over there in Cleveland.  You know, we used to work for Don, man, oh, man, some days.  Boy, we--you know, when I say we, I'm talking about Young-Holt, me and Eldee [Young, HM], and stuff like that.  'Cause later on, like--how many years--we spent, I think--yeah, well, it was about the same amount of years with the Ramsey Lewis Trio and the Young-Holt Unlimited.  It was about the same thank, man, you know.
Story_ID: 79265
Speaker 1: Well, you know, after the hit, after--I mean, you all is--well, Ramsey Lewis Trio was officially named that, I guess, just before y'all had the hit, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Just--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, just before we had the hit.
Speaker 1: Knew you had the hit, then it wasn't long before--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Long before it was breaking up, man.
Speaker 1: --breaking up, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But Young-Holt, as such, probably lasted longer than the Ramsey Lewis Trio actually.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, you, you, you see, yeah.  You see--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you, you see, like, a lot of times Ramsey [Lewis, HM] would tell people, well, yeah, it was like a marriage.  And we just broke up, and this and that.  No, it was about the song that I just told you about, "Ain't There Something That Money Can't Buy."  It was about that, money can buy you silks and sables, false religion, fame and favor.  It was about the money, man.  Me and Eldee [Young, HM] wasn't, we wasn't gon' walk away from that money (laughter).
Speaker 1: What do you call it, wade in the money?
Speaker 2: Yeah, wade in the money.  You know, you know, well, I think I, I, I, I told you that earlier.  Did I tell you that?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I told you that, yeah.  Money change from hand to hand, my oh my when it change the man.  Why oh why, oh, tellin' me why ain't there something that money can't buy?  Money can buy you silks and sables, false religion--now dig it, man, that's strong--false religion, fame, no, and favors, that love is there willing and able, whoo, long as the cash, solid and stable.  And the money was coming in, the money was coming in good then, man.  And the--of course, people heard about Redd and Eldee suing Ramsey for a million dollars.  We did, and that's my brother.  I love him still as a brother, but right has to be right.  Eldee, my brother, we love--you just have--God blessed us all to right the wrongs.  And by the suit--I have to tell you, honestly, the partnership, Ramsey is living up to our shares and stuff as this day go long.  I mean the records are reselling again, and he has been honest feeling, and we still have that bra--he pays us.  He makes sure that the money that we got coming to us comes to us, the one-third.  So, you have to give credit where credit is due.  And like--
Speaker 1: So it, it took some pain, but it's--
Speaker 2: It took some pain, but, but we all--it's a funny thing how you're raised in life.  And we all was raised right.  Our mothers and fathers raised us right.  Two wrongs don't make no right.  And do right, do right by each other.  You know, one thing that that bothers me today is you never hear people really mention the golden rule anymore.  You never hear people talk about the golden rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you and things like that.  (Laughter) You understand what I'm saying.
Story_ID: 79266
Speaker 1: But it's a wonderful world, it's a wonderful world, and the world is what we people make it.  We have to make it.  I did have another passion, as you probably have discovered.  My wife say no, this is one thing she will not allow.  She will not allow me to become a preacher (laughter), a minister.  My wife says, no way.  I've been married to a musician 48 years, man, no way.  Every time I get--I say you know, I think I might go to the seminar--seminary--no, no, no, no, no, no, forty-eight years of this, as a musician's wife, she said no, I won't be able to.  But there are things that you want the world and you want people to know, and I, I get that feeling sometime.
Story_ID: 79267
Speaker 1: But I love playing drums too.  That's why--let's get to drums now.  Because I do use my drums as a means of communication to people.  Like the pantomiming thing I do with the tambourines.  I got a thing that I do called the talking tambourines, and I developed that.
Speaker 2: Now what is that?  I've, I've never seen it.  What is it?
Speaker 1: It's, it's--I play my solo and as a--they call me, they say Redd is a very melodic playing drummer.  And like, I play this--I'm thinking song; I'm thinking all the time, you know, like playing, not only staying in the pocket, but to be able to accompany--but then, when you solo, you have a message; you have something to express.  And all down through, all down through my early years I hated--the people say oh, that drummer getting ready to play now.  It's getting ready to get loud, and people go to the toilet.  They would get up in a joint.  You get up--oh, I go--they start talking loud.  But I developed, playing with my hands, and the tambourine, I started with a little song called "Little Liza Jane"--[singing] oh little Liza, little Liza Jane--and I'd play the tambourine.  So it developed into like two human beings.  And it's like, I do pantomime with it when it get, get through having a solo, play one and one comes up, and one is a male and one is the female.  And they talk to each other, they talk, they talk. And one sometimes (unclear) and say I love you, I love you.  And at the end they kiss and they make up, and that's, that's life.  And I, I love doing it with Urban Gateways, 'cause I had the, I had the little kids too.  So, I could, I could get the two of 'em up, and then I could use the bass drum as--I do it in three, four.  I use the bass drum with the boom, one, and it would be two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, and bring 'em down, and I make 'em say I love you.  And the little kids, they really get it.  But in the club it's, it's like a showstopper, because people have to stop and really listen.  And this, this is a big, big high for me, I mean like a big thrill that I can--you can hear a pin drop sometime when I'm gradually coming to it.  One of these days I'm gonna have to--I have a video of it.  One of these days I'mma have to put the video--let people see more because it's, it's been--it's developed over the years.  It has did a little bit--gave me a little arthritis here.  I can't, can't hold it up as long.  But it's, it's some, it's something to see.  But it comes from here, and the wanna say I love you, I love you with all my heart, and you just rub it.
Story_ID: 79268
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now, the question I just asked when we weren't rolling, now we're rolling, but I was ask you, I wanna ask about your drum technique as a--well, you said you've been described as a melodic drummer.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a melodic drummer, and, and they do say that about a lot of drummer.  But, if you see Redd Holt, when you come to see Redd Holt, it's like, I'm hearing like, like I say, "But Not For Me" one was one of the first songs that I began to play with my hands.  And when you, when you got a tempo going, it's like singing--[singing beats], and you can get that impression with your--[singing beats], but the time is there--[singing beats].  Now, you can solo.  Now you go [singing beats], and the you can come right back to that.  So when I come back to it, the cats got, the cats be listening.  Bam, they can come right in.  I can tag with it too.  Oh, it's, it's something that's developed over the years.  You have to see it.  You have to 'cause, man, you know, that's why I guess, you know, I had to start singing too.
Speaker 1: 'Cause it's wonderful to hear it, you know, the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the best percussionist that I've ever met have been the guys that just did what you did; they, they, they, sing it, they, they sing their percussion out--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, see, that's--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--(unclear).
Speaker 2: Man, you know, drums, it's a voice, it's a voice.  It's, it's not just a pound and beat.  It's a voice, and if people would just stop and listen.  And see, and once you established, once you establish the two and the four, [singing beats], once you get that sock cymbal established, you can play anything you wanna, 'cause it's there.

Speaker 1: I had a kid call me the other night from Atlanta [Georgia], and he played some drum things for me and asked me did I recognize it.  I said it sounds familiar, but it was on other records.  He said that's you.  He said you and Bernard Purdie has a pulse that--he said they use a click.  I forget what it is.  They use a click when they wanna sequence your stuff.  The cats--so what they've been doing is lifting my drum tracks, and they can come back.  And, and they've been doing it.  Well, the publishing company, they have been sending several license out for it.  That's, that's what a lot of young guys do.
Speaker 2: So the, the, the guys that sample music, that's sampling--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --your, your pulse--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, man.  It's so many tricks now with, with electronic.  They can do--my son was the first--my son, Reginald, down in Indianapolis, he has this, I guess this old CD [compact disc] of lights and tracks and stuff.  Man, he picked out any number of 'em.  He told 'em that's you.  He said that's you, and then he would play 'em back without that, now smile.  That is, and when a guy told me that the other night, it blew my mind, man, and he played it, twenty-six-year-old kid.  And they have dance clubs down there in Atlanta, man.  They're redoing the Old Girl CD on Atlantic that Young-Holt Unlimited did, and they're re-releasing a--they, they gon' do it all on vinyl, all on vinyl, like the Japanese.  The Japanese now doing vinyl records, selling 'em thirty and forty dollars apiece, man.  And that's why vinyl, vinyl, it didn't leave.  I sometimes wonder you see simply because we have such an older generation.  But then you've got young people who like the sound.  You've got some of 'em like the, the hiss now, you know, that drum [sound effect], they got that man.  And 'cause that's that feeling; that's that real, that's that real earthy thing, man (laughter).  You know, it's that earth, eh, that you don't get from the digital, you know, you don't get it.  You understand?  Hey, it's just moving in a circle.  This thing is just, this music, this thing is moving in a circle.  They gon' bring--and those of us who're blessed to stay here, man.

Speaker 1: But what I wanna do once again, too, also, I do wanna kind of like start my little gumption-type thing again.  My little workshop was called the Gumption Performing Artists Workshop over there on 71st and Oglesby.  It's where we gave all of the, all of the aspiring artists and stuff like that an opportunity, you know.  I got a couple of grants.  I got from Chicago from Fine Arts, and then we got one from the NEA [National Endowment for the Arts], a matching grant.  And we did quite well over there, from '80' [1980]--I, I started 80--1980, over there and '85' [1985], 'cause Geraldine de Haas [HM] was right across the street--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --from me.
Speaker 2: Jazz Unites, right?
Speaker 1: Jazz Unites.  And it was wonderful.  That, that, that's most--other than the, the Urban Gateways, the Urban Gateways program and that Gumption Performing Artists Workshop was really highlights in my life, man, after the traveling and the ro--because see, when you reach a certain age burns out.  It burns out like I'm gonna do two months in Bangkok's--I'm leaving here Thursday.  I'm gonna two months there, but I only wanted to do the one.  I had kind of got the guys down there, well, hey, man, after I did the Singapore Jazz Festival, I only had to do play two days.  And then three or four days I just stayed over for vacation.  Then I can come right back home to my wife, Marylean, and my grandchildren, and all of the problems of home.  I like the problem--and other words, I like the problems of home better.  Is the hot water heater working?  Oh, you gotta go down.  The faucet is this, or this or that (laughter).  That's my enjoyment now.  You know, a lot of guys look at--that's my enjoyment, but I wanna try to get my Gumption Workshop going again.  And you can't do, you can't, you just can't do it traveling and staying two months this or that, and it's, it's late in the day for me now.
Story_ID: 79271
Speaker 1: You know, there's something about Chicago [Illinois] that I don't know if other cities hand this as much, but it seems like their, their--the musicians in Chicago--and a lot of 'em a really dedicated to the community.  I can't say all of 'em are.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But a lot of 'em are, and then--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --they come back a lot of the guys are AACM [Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians], you know, and how that was developed, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --with, you know, you know, that, that Oscar Brown, Jr. [HM].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was such a community person.  You, you had a community thing--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --stuff, I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it's just, it seems like Chicago has, you know, the musicians wanna give something back to the community all the time here.
Speaker 2: You got to pass it on.  You got it pass it on, man, and that's why I call it the Gumption [Performing Artists Workshop].  (Unclear) man, why, where you come up with a name like Gumption?  Well, I remember my mom and everybody used to say that boy with that--you better get some gumption.  Boy, you better get some gumption in you now, get, get, get, get, that mean get a move on now, get to--(laughter), let's get it rolling.  That's why I told 'em all--we had like a little membership.  I said if y'all got any kind of gumption, y'all would get on in here and get your thing together.  And used to have, we to have like, we had some good sets over there, man.  We had--and some of the AACM cats come in.  What's his name?  Andy, Handy, Mandy, Mandy Wan--
Speaker 1: Mandy--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: I, I, I know--
Speaker 2: You know, you know whom I'm talking about?
Speaker 1: Yes, I--
Speaker 2: And the cats would come in.  Asju (ph.) Rama (ph.) would come.  Asju Rama was there with the cats.  As a matter of fact, I got some beautiful pictures with, with a lot of the people who was there.  Asja had his little, I think little grandson.  A little boy was with him.  He was teaching him--they was all over there, and I had what's her name?  She was, she had a class there, Ann Ward--
Speaker 1: Ann Ward--
Speaker 2: Ann, Ann, Ann, Ann, Ann, Ann, she--
Speaker 1: Ann Ward, right?
Speaker 2: That, she had a little class there.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Who else?  And I used to let 'em have it for rehearsals.  We had the big band, had the band.  Ted Saunders come over there, yeah, Red Saunders' son.  They were doing something and they had the big band.  We had--they had to rehearse the big band over there.  So I used to let 'em have rehearsal and stuff like that, man, and it went well.  We had poetry, we had poetry, we had a singers' workshop, you know, and we had jazz, you know.  I mean, hey, it's a community thing.  And, and the only thing about Chicago and the only thing about--well, we live in a capitalistic society, so that's--it's (unclear)--but rent, rent, the cost.  You know, like, I--when I started there, I fixed it up 'cause they had had a fire, because the other artist had had it, had had a fire.  There was a record store next to me.  The guy just said oh, man, cats come in here, and we painted, you know, like I say, hey, we're gon' do this like down in the Village.  We paint the ceiling black.  I said we paint the ceiling black and keep the lights down, just keep the red pretty lights and stuff on.  Ain't nobody never gonna look up in the ceiling (unclear) you know.  We put a second bathroom in there and everything, man, you know.  But then after we fixed it all up, the cat that owned it, man, went up on the rent.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: You see, so, he went up on the rent on us.  We said ah, man, and really that's what took us out of business, the rent.  It just took us out.  So, and I see all these nice buildings.  I see storefronts, man.  I see things.  And my wife say, don't you think about it, don't you think about it (laughter), say you're too old now.  I say yeah, I say you know I'm thinking.
Story_ID: 79272
Speaker 1: But I got my two sons down in Indianapolis [Indiana].  They thinking about it.  My oldest boy, he works for different groups, and, and he's, he's more into the, this multi-marketing and different thing, you know, along with his music.  And he has this bus company that dri--takes the kids to school and stuff.  So he was saying like--but the other two guys down there, the one that's doing the engineering and all of the stuff, they're thinking about it.  I told 'em when dad come back, I said when dad comes back, man, from Bangkok, we gotta sit down.  You know, I said we gotta sit down.  Because I wanna be able to, like, play one or two nights in the community, and not to have to drive all the way to the burbs.  You know, you gotta drive all the way to the burbs.  And at my age, coming back late at night, man, coming back, man, it's, it's like when everybody is like, they're driving like they're playing a computer game [dual engine noise], you know.
Speaker 2: That's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: You're, now you're a Southsider in a--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I live 89th Place and Calumet.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there're so, so many great musicians on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You got the AACM [Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians] over there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You got the Bill Koran, Oscar Brown, Jr. [HM].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: All, you know, and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I live--
Speaker 2: It seems like we can get a venue to, to really--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I live, I live right around the corner from Ed Harris used to live.  We built our house, built a house when my third son, Reggie, was born in '63' [1963].  I've been there ever since, 89th Place and Calumet.  And Eddie used to--Eddie was on 90th almost at King Drive.  He sat out on his porch, man, playing, playing saxophone with a trombone mouthpiece.  I used to hear him around.  I say Eddie, what you doing, man?  That's, this a great cat.  I sure miss him.  I miss him, boy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, time moves on.
Speaker 2: He was great, he was great.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, it's a lot of cats, man, that--
Speaker 2: A lot of innovators in the Midwest for some reason--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, Roland Kirk from Columbus
Speaker 1: A different bunch--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--from Chicago, you know.
Story_ID: 79273
Speaker 1: Well, see, a lot of cats that went to New York, they went to New York and thought they had to be like the New York cats that was there.  Like the first time at Birdland, man, went to Birdland, you know, and they got what they call the bleacher section.  And that's where most of the musicians pay a price and come over there and sit in them seats or either stand at the bar, and you on the bandstand.  And you got these cats that sit there, they look at you.  And you playing, cats be looking at you, man.  Cats (unclear) playing (unclear), cats look at you.  Sometimes the cats look at you and shake their head and say, mm-mm, no, baby, you ain't cutting it, you ain't cutting it, man.  Nall, that ain't it.  In the meantime, you gotta gig, and they don't got no gig, you know.  They sitting up there saying it ain't happening, my man, nall, baby, nall, you know.  And you're saying, what?  Then you learn to wake up to the fact that, hey, I'm not here to appease you, to please you.  These people out here is digging it.
Story_ID: 79274
Speaker 1: Man, it's, it's, it's something.  Like now, speaking of the cats that you was talking about, Oscar Brown and them.  You know, John Levy--we had a, we had a package, 1963, Oscar Brown, Jr. [HM], Floyd Morris was playing piano with him then, Cannonball Adderley had use of Lateaf (ph.), Joe's Avenue, Louis Hayes, Sam Jones, Nancy Wilson [HM], and we had the Tommy Johnson Dancers, and the Ramsey Lewis Trio, original Ramsey Lewis Trio.  And they would use us a lot of times to open up, 'cause we were like, middle of the road.  You know, we'll come on theater, and we'll go out, they say--you know, a lot of times Cannonball used to look out there, would say, man, rigor mortis out there, you know, look out from behind the curtains--man, rig!  That was--Cannon say rig is out there.  We say oh, yeah.  Cats say well, who's going on first?  Ramsey Lewis Trio going on first.  Ram--we say ah, man, y'all wanna put us on first.  And Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], man, that, that, that, that uptown theater in Philly used to be coldblooded.  You know, they're like, man, we, we near New York.  We, we say yeah, y'all nothing New York (laughter)--y'all ain't New York.  Ah, man, we had some, we had some times, but it was called "Free Sounds of '63' [1963]."
Story_ID: 79275
Speaker 1: Then we did another one.  I don't know if it was in '64' [1964], but we had 'em--at the Howard Theater [Washington, D.C.] we had people going around the block, man.  It was just, it was a good show, it was a good show.  Nancy was doing--we opened up, we had opened up with--we had a couple (unclear).  See, we had a scrim that they would have in front of the stage, and they would be out front and we'd be in the back.  I would play on Nancy's "Guess Who I Saw Today."  I do the trio thing.  Then we come out and play.  Lewis Hayes would play on that--[singing] never, never will I marry; never, never will I roam.  I was born to wonder solitary--and he would play that track.  I would come off--he'd play that track, and then I would be right there to take his place, boom.  He'd go back and get ready to get with Cannon and them to play their thing, and I would play "Guess Who I Saw Today."  I'd play that chart.  I also played Oscar Brown's [Jr., HM] chart, "One Foot in the Gutter" and "Rags and Old Iron."  I think I played that, bang, bang.  And that was, that was, that was a beautiful show, man, and we did it for two, we did two shows like that.  And John Levy and another guy, they sponsored it.  They put the, they put the money up for it, because they believed in it.  Nat Adderley wrote a piece (unclear) (unclear)--[singing] we got swinging sounds; we got groovin' sounds, [singing beats], like a real show man, like a jazz show.  And that was an era, and I think it can happen again, you know, like mostly with the Chicago cats, man, yeah, because they're community-minded, as you say, community-minded.  And that's the route to go, to build, to get back to where we were.  We gotta, we gotta get back to where we was at, man.
Story_ID: 79276
Speaker 1: Sir, could you tell me what, what, what advice you would give to young musicians coming along today?
Speaker 2: Well, love what you're doing, keep it fun.  When the fun stops, don't let it be fun indulging in things like drugs, smoking, all that kind of stuff.  Keep it clean, keep it clean, be serious, and try to have you something today to back you up.  Because until this music, until it can change, I would not advise no young musician, no entertainer to just say I'm gonna rely upon music and entertainment alone.  Don't--get you a backup, minor or major (laughter), you know, and learn, learn.  Go to school; get you some paper and know what you're doing when you got the paper.  Learn your music, learn it, so you got something to back you up.  There are no clubs like it used to be, no theaters like it used to be.  It'll come back maybe eventually one day.  But it's no little free ride; it's not little--a lot of the things that happened for me, I don't see it happening for them for a long time or just for another era.  When the fun stops, as they say, it's time to stop almost.  It's time to stop when it stopped being fun, when it stopped being enjoyment, because that means that you gon' look for some other means.  You're gon' start to take a drink; you gon' start to take a smoke of something; you gon' start to do something, 'cause I've seen so many musicians get frustrated.  And I've seen 'em get frustrated because they wanted to be in a certain bag in a hip bag.  I'm gon' say this, and I'll use ain't: Ain't nothing really hip about trying to be hip.  What's so hip about trying to be hip?  I've seen cats go all out of their way, man, to do the thing, to supposed to be hip.  And what they're doing hip ain't hip.  If they just go ahead on and do the right thing, that's what's hip.  But they pattern themselves after some cats or some cats that's done went on years, and I, and I don't want no musicians to pattern themselves after some old cat that's done went on made some mistakes, even though he became famous.  They'll say, well, so and so did so and so and so over there.  He was fortunate; he was lucky; he was really lucky, you know.
Story_ID: 79277
Speaker 1: So, I, I, I try to tell all young musicians, you know, like, it ain't easy.  It's not, it's not half the way it was when I came along.  And the reason why--we paid some dues.  We paid some dues, but we didn't even realize it 'cause we was having so much fun.  But the gigs were there, the gigs were there.  It's, it's hard.  I had a little boy tell me--he just called me a little ago--he said, man, I'm back from Europe.  He says, like you said, number one is, he was saying, man, it's dangerous for me now, I'm an American, you know.  And you he said yeah, it's not that many gigs.  'Cause like I tell 'em, you take, you take Chicago.  Chicago got more little gigs, man.  Chicago got more little gigs around here and that, than a lot of the cities got.  And when you got to New York, you're in competition with all of the, all of the cats that's really, really stomp down playing, man, (laughter) playing.  Some of 'em got their degrees.  It's, it's very competitive, it's very competitive.
Story_ID: 78445
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about the live music versus the electronic music now.  It seems like the most popular music now is all electronically created.  And I guess a musician, and the, the musicians are actually becoming fewer and fewer, young musicians--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --people that actually play music--
Speaker 2: You, you know, that brings to mind of the follow-up on advice to young musicians.  First of all, there's a group I haven't really heard them, called Soulive.  Soulive, they say that they were influenced by Young-Holt, Three Sounds, and who el-Cannonball [Adderley].  Well, they realized that Cannonball had recorded the "Mercy, Mercy" with an audience, but they set it up.  Now, Soulive--one thing I'd like to say, I hope and wish that Soulive keep the name, and don't let anybody interfere with that name, with their cohesiveness that they appear to have from my reading about them.  I wish them all well, and I'm gonna, this week I must go get a record and listen to 'em.  But they insist--they swung a deal.  I think they were--Verve and Blue Note were bidding from them.  And from what I read in the "Downbeat," Blue Note won out, because Blue Note is allowing them to go across the country and record all of their shows live, let them do it live.  They say that's where their energy, that's where the pulse--I totally agree with them, because I know with the Ramsey Lewis Trio and the Young-Holt Unlimited, that live, that live music, you can't beat it.  But still it comes to, down to promotion, the record companies, with the guys going in the studio doing a lot of things.  See, we live cats are dwindling down.  Once again, the deejays are becoming to be the stars.
Story_ID: 78446
Speaker 1: The deejay's are mixing and putting all this stuff together, it's like now people, they don't even want a live band for, for a wedding sometimes, you know, especially the brothers and sisters, man.  Brothers, brothers and sisters, they be talking about get the deejay, get the deejay for the wedding, get--a you know a good deejay?  And I can remember a day when the union would go in there and say you get this stuff out of here in fifteen minutes.  That's when (laughter) James C. Petrillo was still in charge of the musicians, all of the American Federation of Musicians.  And they were saying no, you don't, you don't be bringing that in here, not (unclear) live music.  But it's what you are doing--what they do to the youth's mind, okay.  If you get somebody used to listening to a certain thing--I watched it--'cause with the Urban Gateways I had certain tunes I would play for my audience.  It's the same as if you indoctrinate a generation with electronic music.  They get used to electronic music.  And until a period of, time period comes by, that whole generation is gon' be digging it because they programmed to it.  They're programming into 'em.  Every time you turn you turn on the radio, every time you get certain stuff, it's a program.  It's, it's the same way as with smooth jazz came in, all right.  But electronics, it's here to stay.  It's just that I think a matter of time, just like we're talking about the vinyl records, just when we was talking about that, it's a matter of time, but for those who can wait it out, that can wait it out.  But it's, without a doubt, they are gradually eliminating a lot of us live musicians.
Story_ID: 78447
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, and what the kids are buying into now--like, my son took, he took one of his teen, he took his took his teenage daughter out here to the Rosemont Horizon or something to see somebody.  I forget who it was.  And my son, they all play music.  He's a drummer.  He said, dad, you wouldn't believe this.  He said, dad, they packed in there, jammed up.  And these cats run up on the stage.  They got the deejay back there, scrr, scrrrl, sratching, scrrrwaruru--and he say, they be saying yeah, yeah, and then walking, and walking, and walking.  And he say they don't try to end the song, vamp, or play a turn-back, they just stop--heybloombloomblom, brrh--it's over.  Kids say yeah, okay.  So they done sold 'em into it.  You see what I'm saying?  So, it's a matter of how much you program the different generations.  If you give somebody a study guide, you know, they eventually become like hey, man, I was in the Army, and I was in Camp Chaffee, Arkansas.  And when I went there I was a bee-bopper.  I was digging Bird [Charlie Parker].  About the third week, I was singing [singing] it's a yellow rose of Texas, and droom, droom, I said whoa, what am I doing?  Whoa, yellow rose of Texas, that's what they were playing all the time on the radio.  That's what's going down.  You understand what I'm saying?  Nineteen fifty-four [1954], [singing]--I'm a yellow rose of Texas, be-be-doo-de-doo.  See, because I'm open to things, I'm open to things.  Next thing you know, I was swinging it, [singing beats], (laughter), you know, and like, talking about the funk beat.  Like the kids say, he say, man, you was playing the funk beat.  He said 'cause I listen at your record with Ramsey [Lewis, HM].  He say, but that was Bernard Purdie.  I say yeah, I'm older than Bernard Purdie, so I'll (laughter)--(unclear)--say yeah, (unclear) Bernard, but everybody know Bernard.  I say that's because he was on Atlantic Records, and Bernard was doing all the record.  I said I was in Chicago, and I was doing another thing.  So, that's just like they say about who started the jazz?  Where did the jazz start?  Where did this come, you know.  It was a bunch of cats in Mississippi doing the same thing probably some of the cats in New Orleans was doing.  Who was promoted?  It's about promotion, you know.  And it's been that way, and it's gonna always be that way, you know.
Story_ID: 78448
Speaker 1: Now, sir, what are your hopes and concerns about the black community?
Speaker 2: You know, I came to Chicago when there was a black community.  When we were--when we, they, who were allowed to say you can move anywhere you wanna move, you can go anywhere you wanna go, the community lost.  It's no, it's not to me--what I think about it sometimes, when it comes to saying the black community, sure, we have some stores that some of the black businesses and different people have.  But is it--the community, black communities are everywhere now.  It's everywhere, and you don't have the little shoeshine parlor no more; you don't have the little ice cream thing; you don't have the bowling alley there.  Like 87th Street, the bowling alley used to be there.  You had the shoeshine place there Daddy-O Daylie [HM] and them was walking through; everybody was coming through, same as in Detroit.  We had--what was it--the Gorham Hotel--no, the Gotham; we had the Gotham.  The Gorham was in New York.  But we had the Gotham.  You could walk in the Gotham, there Joe Louis is sitting in the lobby.  You could walk there, there's somebody else, (unclear)--Sugar Ray and somebody.  You walk in the black community now, nobody know nobody, nobody speaks to nobody, so I'm about--I'm saying what black community?  What happen to, what, what about it?  What black community?  You, you understand what I'm--the, the feeling that I have, because being that the age of seventy, almost seventy-one, I had, I, I had a black community.  I was with a black community.  Now, and, and, and, and it's, it's no putdown for wanting good things or wanting the best things in life, but, man, you know?  I, I don't know if I'm answering it, but my hopes, my hopes for it, I don't think I'll see it in my lifetime.  I don't think it'll come back to what I had and what I would like to feel again.  But now there are those who never felt what I felt.  They won't even miss it.  They won't know.  See, there's that and don't know again.  And it's like they--you know, like when you mention Martin Luther King [Jr.] or when you--Medgar Evers, or either Harold Washington, or either--it's like, it's just flying over the head to some of the young people that I talk to.  You know what I mean, man?  It's like, it's scary, and you asked me that question.  I'm really afraid, man, and like, cats done gone into--any time you can promote thugism, any time you can promote thug--I'm a thug, man.  I saw a little boy with a little piece of tape on his face like a cat the other day.  He wasn't cut.  This was a sign of the thugs, the thugs, the cats that supposedly be making the millions of dollars that they say on the rap, supposedly.  Now, do they know what publishing is?  Do they know what--half of 'em was ripping off the tracks and didn't know that they wasn't creating it--sad, it's said; I mean, it's sad.  So, for the black community, I hope, I hope for the good and for the best, but I don't see much hope now.  And I hope that I see it before my time is up.  And according to what I have been taught about three scores and ten, or however I believe, didn't go wrong because God have blessed my mother to be ninety-two now.  And I hope that I can stay healthy.  I would like to stay health, like I say, and be able to come back and do some more community stuff for myself.  That would be one thing I think that could be--(unclear)--if I can be a good example, that's my hope, if I can come back from this trip, Bangkok, and am been blessed to come back, that I can help to come up with something, anywhere.

Speaker 1: Now, sir, what would you see as, at this point, as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Boy, musically?  You mean musically?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--as a whole.
Speaker 2: Yeah, musically, well, I, for forty-eight years have had a wonderful wife, Marylean--she was Marylean Green when I met her.  I met her when she was 13; I was 15.  We were on the amateur shows together, the Willard Theater over here at 51st, and the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], with the marriage we have, three wonderful sons who plays and performs, interested in music.  They two gonna definitely--well, they say they will carry on my legacy.  The work that I've done for those who know, like with the Urban Gateways, with my workshop, with--I hope that I've been able to spread the joy and love that I felt for my drums, and being able to say the times that I didn't worry about making a lot of money, but just to be able to give, and just, you know, like--well, like you say, when you've done all you can do...  When I've done all I can do, and, and, and I don't think I'm completely through yet, you know, like the song [singing] just stand when you done just stand.  But my children, I got, whoa, six granddaughters, one grandson, oh, and they all love me.  I love them.  We--I have records.  Oh, man, I got records under the Ramsey Lewis Trio, the Young-Holt Unlimited, and now the Redd-Holt Unlimited.  I'm still doing things, you know--A legacy.  I have a full--it has come--what do they say--full bloom.  You know, it's I've been so fortunate; I've been so blessed; I've been blessed.  My mother taught me things, and so I say lucky - I've been blessed, let's put it like that.
Story_ID: 78450
Speaker 1: Now, what is your--how has your mother [Mary Gilliam] felt about your success?
Speaker 2: My mother has always encouraged me to perform, you know.  She let me have my drums.  I can remember the days, and those were during the days when some of the preachers thought that music and jazz (laughter) was really sinful, you know, really sinful, even going to the movie on Sunday after church.  My mother stood by us.  My mother said nall, and she used to say, nall, you gifted; God gave you a gift, use your gift.  And (unclear)--God gave me a gift.  He blessed me with a gift.  He blessed me with a gift that have taken me around the world, and people love me, people that can't even speak English.  They can't speak English, but, man.
Story_ID: 78451
Speaker 1: Sir, this is a little bit different from legacy, but how would you like to be remembered?  I know it's, it's sometime off before we'll have to do that, I hope.
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  Isaac Redd Holt, jazz master drummer, vocalist, singer, entertainer, a great showman that was able to reach many people, many people with my art.  That says it, I mean, you know, my art, my music I leave, I, I leave behind, just remember my good music; just remember what the Creator gave me to be able to spread and give to somebody else; you know, my children, my grandchildren be happy.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you, sir.
Speaker 2: It's been, been my pleasure.
Story_ID: 78452
Speaker 1: SCOTT STEARNS:  Back when we were talking about high school and everything, you talked about how you really wanted to play drums and so you were all over it when you had an opportunity to join the band at school.  But I don't think I remember hearing like what, what music or what musicians influenced you or inspired you to want to play drums--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: SCOTT STEARNS:  So that would be the first.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: In, in high school, when I, when I reached high school, when I reached Crane Tech [High School, Chicago, Illinois], I was in beginner's band for, oh, the first semester.  And before it was over, teacher say, listen, I wanna move you up.  I wanna move to the adult band.  So I went directly--he say, but you'll probably need a teacher.  And I went to the uni--I went to Chicago School of Music, Chicago School of Music [sic, Cosmopolitan School of Music, Chicago, Illinois] and began to study.  And after I graduated, when I left Crane Tech, when I left Crane Tech--no, wait a minute, hold it, cut it, cut it, 'cause I forgot what you asked me about music--
Speaker 2: [TAPE INTERRUPTED]
Speaker 1: --Guys that influenced me.  Oh, in my earlier career, my early part of the career, some of my first drummers during that period, during that period, of course, there was Gene Cooper and Buddy Rich.  These were the first drummers that I began to, began to really hear.  I'd heard some Basie things, heard some Basie things early.  Later, as I, as I developed, I got into Max Roach and Art Blakey.  Art Blakey was a big influence on me and so was Max; they were, they were a big influence.  And I think sometimes when people hear me play sometimes now, they say I lean more towards Art, Art Blakey.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do.
Speaker 1: But there was also Chico Hamilton and Shelly Manne.  They were very, like, a lot of the mallet stuff that I do now, that's when--I got some of that from Chico.  Now, the first guy I saw play with the hands like I play with my hands now was Papa Jo Jones, old man Papa Jo Jones that was with Basie, the first drummer with Basie.  And that was a big influence on me, but later on I began to really, really get into, I think I, I really got into Art.  I got into Max, Max, I got into a lot of things Max would do technical.  Max had--like a lot of us still play some of Max's licks.  We'd play a thing, like we'd be swinging along--[drum beats] dang, ditty-dang, ditty-dang, ditty-dang, ba-da-da stickum boom, ba-da-da stickum boom, ba-da-de-da, ba-dubbin-de-mm, mm, ba-dobba-de-mm-mm.  That's Max.  Whenever I walk in a place and hear a cat say, ba-dobba-de-hoom-boom, ba-dobba-de-hoom, ba-dobba-de, ba-dobba-de, ba-dobba-de-hoom-boom, that's Max.  And then I had a guy that used to live next to me named Oscar, Oscar Larkins.  When I was living on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] at 2258 West Maple Street, we used to sit out on the stair.  They had these tall stairs.  He played with Memphis Slim.  I'd do a gig at night and I'd come in, we'd be sitting out.  And he would say she-hoom; I'd say da-hoom, she-hoom, boom-boum, she-hoom-da-hoom, skicky-doom, skicky-doom, we come those drum vowels--we used to do the drum vowels--[singing drum beats], you know, we used to do all that kind of stuff, man.  But I--those were good days, teenage days, when I was in high school, you know.  And we moved on, just moved on.
Story_ID: 78453
Speaker 1: During the early years of the original Ramsey Lewis Trio we patterned ourselves a lot similar to the Modern Jazz Quartet.  We had the little classical nuances and little things that Ramsey [Lewis, HM] would come up with, like we did a thing from "Carmen," see, Ramsey's classical training for that.  Eldee [Young, HM] and I, we had more the earthy, funky sound, that earthy funkiness that we would put on the bottom and lay down--I would lay the beat.  You know, like Eldee has that fat, that fat sound.  Like Ray Brown called him--Ray Brown used to call him little stick, and Ray Brown was the big stick, you know.  And Ray used to always mess with me about my sock cymbal.  He'd come in the club and say [singing beats], 'cause he know that sock cymbal was gon' be there.  And I would lay down that, that funk thing, that--[singing beats]--and we were swinging and still playing fun.  In them days we used to play funk.  We were some of the first cats did that kind of thing, that funk thing.  And so we'll take the classic and the church, see.  Now, all of us went to church.  All of us went to church, so what we're church--we'll take that church thing, and we'll blend it in.  And with the little classical ideas--like we did a thing--Ramsey did a thing called "Tres," "Tres" or "Tres" or "Tres'" or something like that.  And all it was, was like a few like, like, like a classical exercise--[singing beats]--bang! [singing cymbal beat].  And we'll stop.  And we had our arrangements, what we would feel.  What do you feel there, man?  What you think ought to go there?  I think this here out to go there.  I think--we did a lot of arrangements like that.  We did head up stuff like that.  What do you think gon' fit here?  We wrote a lot of stuff together.  We did a lot writing together, your idea, your idea; we put all that together.  And we'll take it--after we get through with it, then we'll take it--sound good.  Hey, let's record this.  What we gon' name it?  We did a lot of stuff like that.  And that's how we began to develop.  There were times when we would listen to the other musicians, but when it came to the style, and we would suggest, we all suggest--like I was always suggesting them funky soulful songs, you know, like I say the one the guy say get off my ladder, baby, got to make it to the top, [singing]--something you got baby make me work all day.  Well, I was considered the soulful preacher type cat, you know.
Story_ID: 78454
Speaker 1: That was, that, that was me, which later on, you know, even after Redd-Holt Unlimited became--you know, there was a period of time when they called me a spiritual leader at one time, you know.  And it was, it was when I had the little funk band.  I called them the funk band.  After Eldee left, I recorded for Jewel Paula.  So I would pick tunes, man, like--I don't if you remember these songs like "Do It Baby"--[singing]--do it, do it, baby [singing beats].  And I did a thing, "I Shot the Sheriff."  Remember "I Shot the Sheriff?"  [Singing] I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot the deputy [singing beats]; I shot the sheriff.  And I had some cat, and they had the bag.  That's when they had the wa-wa sound, wa-wa pedals and stuff like that, man.  We was funking it up, man.  We were doing it, baby.  You know, I've been in a different asset.
Speaker 2: What did you think of George Clinton?  I just, I just thought--
Speaker 1: The funk man, Jack.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Funk man.  George Clinton, man--eh, man, I don't know--George is about my age.  I think George--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, y'all are--
Speaker 1: Well, you know, hey, that's--it was in, it was it, that was happening, man, and it still is, the funk, man.  You know, you gotta play a little funk every now and then.  You know what I'm saying? (Laughter).
Story_ID: 78455
Speaker 1: I have one last question.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I don't know why I didn't ask this--(unclear) to be.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But how did you get the name Redd?  Now what--
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, now you know what?  This was asked of me a long time ago.  This was asked of me, it was asked by Mike Douglas, Mike Douglas and Martha Ray, Mike Douglas and Martha Ray.  We were on that show in Cleveland, and say, how come they call you Redd?  And this is a true story.  It always was--especially if you was in the South-- if you're born in the South, and you was the lightest child in that family, if you were the lightest one, and you had a little red--now they say what happened, I used to play in the dirt too.  Now this friend of my mother's and them--what was his name--they say J.D.  Yeah, J.D. used to work at the, work at a station.  Come along--and one of 'em come along and they used to say where that little old red boy?  Where that little red one at?  The lightest child in any black African-American family--
Speaker 1: Right--
Speaker 2: --in them days, he was automatically the red one.  Hey, Red, that's Red.  Then they went to Dirty Red, playing in that dirty, Dirty Red.  That's how I got my name, man, and it followed me all the way to Chicago.  My brothers and them, all of 'me tell me--all the cats say Redd, yeah, Redd, hey, Redd.  That's it.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: My pleasure, once again, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: All right.
Story_ID: 79461
Speaker 1: Now I think we have one other question here, so--
Speaker 2: SCOTT STEARNS:  Yeah, there's one regarding Phil and Leonard Chess.  They certainly signed a, a lot of artists and they're important--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: SCOTT STEARNS:  --for that reason.  And I think maybe your situation was slightly different because you had a manager.  But--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: SCOTT STEARNS:  --they were accused of exploiting a lot of their artists.  And I just wondered if you could comment on your relationship with them and whether you felt that you were treated fairly.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, when it came to Leonard and when it came to Phil, by us having Daddy-O Daylie [hm] as a manager, we were treated, we were treated, I would say we were treated fair.  However, we all knew that Leonard had three sets of books.  We knew that Leonard had a set of books for us, a set of books for the IRS [internal revenue service], you understand, and a set for Leonard.  Now, by us having Daddy-O Daylie, we were able to kind of like steer clear of a lot of problems that the other musicians ran up against.  One thing I did, I learned some stuff from, from, from Leonard.  I learned stuff from Phil.  I learned, in watching them, in watching the business is the reason why like right now like I try to do my own little record company, my own, my own little record company, press up my own stuff, do my own CDs, and control my own stuff.  Those guys, they were truly--I mean some of the guys, when you look at it, they wouldn't have been recording anyway, some of them would not.  They had foresight.  They really had foresight, and, and, and like I say, they worked as a team.  One was good guy, and one was a bad guy.  Leonard, you, you go to Leonard's office, Leonard be sitting in their mean; Leonard's sitting in their looking at you.  You walk in, he know--and call you a bunch of them, you know what mf's, you know.  What you want?  You want some money now, don't you, ba, ba, ba, blah.  And so, we, we really did have, we had a relationship with them when they knew, they knew Christmas was around.  And Leonard knew--he'd say go get my books.  Because we'd go to him like--right today--not skipping and jumping, but right today, Ramsey [Lewis, HM], you know, like with the money that comes to all three of us, Ramsey likes to make sure that he tries to get the money to me by Christmas or before Christmas.  Because it's such a reminiscent thing, that we used to go to Leonard.  We'd go to Leonard at Christmas, and Leonard know he's gon'--yeah, I know.  We say hey, man, the kids needs some toys, man, the baby--you know, like old days when the old crap shooter say my baby needs some shoes, man.  My baby needs some shoes, come on let's hit 'em.  But we'd go to Leonard and say hey, man, Christmastime.  Leonard say yeah, get, get, get the, get the books out and come on in.  It's always, you so and so's owe me so and so money now, you know.  I mean, if, if he didn't call you that mf or a name like that, Leonard didn't like you.
Story_ID: 79462
Speaker 1: It was a funny thing about Leonard [Chess].  That was his way.  You know, he might stand up and call you a bunch of whole blah, blah, blah, but there was another side to Leonard, you know, and when--like, like, and when, when he passed, you know--I think they had VON then at that time--it was a lot of cats, you know, because, okay, you got ripped.  Everybody was rippin', but we were taken care of because Leonard was doing--like I say, I learned business. Leonard was--had deals, man, that he would work with, with record distributors like Maxie Waxie's up in, up in D.C.  Maxie Waxie and what was that distributor over there, used to be over there?  Leonard would say you buy one, I'll give you one.  And he had his artists, and he did those things for the Ramsey Lewis Trio, so when we got that hit, there was a lot of things behind this promo, you understand, promotion wise.  You don't know, that's why you say you don't know about the hit, and you don't know which one gon' be it.  But promotion--and one thing Leonard did start to do was he promoted us in certain ways that we were able to build and establish a following, you see.  He established that.
Story_ID: 79463
Speaker 1: The trick--what happened, there's another little thing that happened people don't know.  Ahmad Jamal was on the hit, was coming off a hit; Jack Tracy, who was with Mercury, he was working for Downbeat; Max Roach and everybody was doing records for, for, for Argo.  They were doing records and stuff down there.  And this is how we found out something.  So, Jack Tracy, I got an email from him every now and then.  He remembers.  Jack went to Leonard [Chess] and he say hey, man, you got my artist; you got Max Roach.  Max Roach done did something.  There was a lot of acts doing it.  He said what?  He said yeah, they signed to Mercury.  He said you gotta, you gotta do something for me.  I gotta use one of your artists in place of that, or the, or the company is gon' come after you.  So he said yeah, well, well, who you want?  He said I want Ahmad Jamal.  And Leonard went up and called him all kind of names and say, but Jack played a trick on him.  Jack wanted us, and that's when we did an album on Mercury called "Down to Earth," one of our best albums we did, had a big black arm going down into earth, coming up.  And if you look on that you'll see a lot of the publishing, there was--what we had--New Roads then, and John Levy.  But that was the beginning of us breaking into owning our own publishing, during that period.  So, thereto, again, all I can say is we were blessed that we did have Daddy-O [Daylie, HM], that we did have other people in our corner to lead that way, to show us the way, you know.
Story_ID: 79464
Speaker 1: And we used to have, we used to have quite a lot of fun at Chess, man.  We'd go down there for recording.  There was a place around the corner called Bats.  Bats was like a restaurant right there--I think Mr. Ricky took that place, Mr. Ricky, right there on Cermak, right there at 22nd Street and Michigan.  We used to go through this big hotel, the Michigan Hotel that, that Al Capone supposed to had that vault in.
Speaker 2: 2222 South (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'd walk through there, man, and go through there.  And we'd always go through there, and we'd, we'd wait till Leonard [Chess], wait till Leonard be in there.  And we'd go in there, and we'd put it on Leonard's tab.  We'd go in there and get, man.  Leonard be looking over there, he say, yeah, all right, put it on there, all right put it on there.   And Bats had some of the best corn beef.  Man, they had some best pastrami sandwiches, ooh.  And at that time, in my life, a corn beef sandwich, pastrami, with mustard and the pickle, and a Heineken's beer, that was one of the greatest things in the world (laughter).  Boy, you know, it's a lot of things about--you know, I just reminisce, man, on a lot of the stuff, you know.  They say when a man get old, if he don't have no memories, man, I feel sorry for his soul (laughter), when he get old.
Story_ID: 79465
Speaker 1: SCOTT STEARNS:  Well real quick, a chance for a plug.  Is "Down to Earth," is it reissued, or is it still available or?
Speaker 2: No, the reissuing right now they're getting ready to come with vinyl.  It's going to be "Oh Girl" by Young-Holt Unlimited.  You know the one--[singing] Oh, girl, I'm in trouble if you leave me now?  That's gonna be a reissue, but I'm gonna tell you, I'm gonna tell you what to expect and what to look for.  The Young-Holts, those are my sons.  They are recutting all my stuff; they're recutting, my young son down there.  And all they don't play, they're gonna do it with some of that digital stuff, 'cause that, that, that, that little son I got, man, Reginald Lamar Holt, look for Reginald Lamar Holt, talking about legacy.  This cat, and this cat, man, he's something.  He's my son, man, but the cat is something, the stuff he can do.  The cat can play keyboards, he can play base, he can play drums, and he can take and put all that stuff together.  And people say, man--I say, man, I, I don't have no talent.  That cat's got the talent, man, because he--never, never could I do that.  Man, he got a thing--the thing Ken Chaney wrote called "Young and Hopeful"--man, he put that thing together and it's monstrous--[singing beats].  And he put horns on 'em, man, put horns on there, he be--man, how you sequence?  How you get that--how you do that?  And he sat there with his keyboard, man, he sat there with his keyboard doing it.  So, like I say, I'm very proud of my sons.  I did a thing at the Cultural Center with 'em.  It was the first time all four of us were on a stage.  I had four sets of drums up there.  My wife swore up and down before she died, she was gonna see all four of us on a stage.  I might be able to get you guys a copy of that.  I might be, yeah, man--
Speaker 1: That'll be great.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all four of 'em, man, and we play--they played, they played my songs and stuff, man.  It was fun, it was fun, yeah.
Story_ID: 79466
Speaker 1: SCOTT STEARNS:  The, the split occurs.  Ramsey's [Lewis, HM] gone his way, you and Eldee [Young, HM]--
Speaker 2: A team.
Speaker 1: SCOTT STEARNS:  --are together.  How did your music change, or what changes took place as a result?  How did you reform your, your band?
Speaker 2: We, at that time, we were looking for piano players, and, and we were fortunate to find Don Walker out of Evanston, Illinois.  Don Walker was our first piano player coming with us.  And man, he duplicated Ramsey so much that people heard us and, man, they thought it was the same group.  And they, you know, the guys was writing in the newspaper--I got an article over there from Houston.  We were all in town at the same time.  We were at a place; Ramsey was at a place; Nancy Wilson was (unclear) place there, I think.  And it says will the real Ramsey Lewis Trio stand up?  You know, they, they printed stuff like that in those days.  But Don was the first piano player; Ken Chaney was the next piano player; Bobby Lau, out of Minneapolis, was the third piano player; Eldee and I before we broke up the Young-Holt, we had a young man on guitar named Marcus, Marcus Curry, out of Rochester, New York.  And there was another guy named Ringo, playing keyboards in Oregon.  And that was the last as Young-Holt.  Then came the Redd-Holt Unlimited when I went to Jewel Paula, Jewel Paula Records, of which I will be getting those--my son will, will be redoing it, 'cause I had the--like it was a fun group, like I had a little boy, Eugene Curry, out of, right out of Harvey here, keyboards.  I had Jose Holmes from the West Side playing just Wes Montgomery and Randy Ford, another young--these were all young cats, man, their 20s.  And I took 'em on the road; I worked a whole circuit that I'd worked with Young-Holt, and people loved them.  People loved them, man.  So we're gonna--all that stuff is gonna be redone.
Story_ID: 79467
Speaker 1: So who are these guys that you're playing with now (unclear)?
Speaker 2: These guys are very--well, the Japanese boy, Taku Akiyama, is very well known around here now.  Taku, Taku has been playing--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, he's--Taku is that alto player.  He plays everything.  But I'm gonna use Ken Chaney tomorrow, because John Collins is sick.  He's got a little sick.  He changed medicine.  He a diabetic, and they've been changing his medicine and stuff.  And so he says he's been feeling very weak.  I used another boy the other night, John Rhoton (ph.).  I just see--I use all, give 'em all a chance, all an opportunity, everybody.  Like when I'm at Teibel's, I give all of the cats an opportunity, what nights they wanna work with me, what nights they wanna do that, you know.  And it's been a, it's been, it's been enjoyable, and it's been a good experience.  And this is gonna be a good experience when I, Thursday, when I leave here.  I'll be in Bangkok, and I'll be playing with Eldee [Young, HM] and the Chinese boy, Jeremy Monteiro.  See, Eldee has a quartet there now.  And Eldee is there until--well, he went in June.  Yeah, he's, he's been there.  And I'll come over.  I was supposed to just gon' do Chinese New Year's like (unclear).  And when I go over, the band becomes the band of band leaders.  He sends his saxophone player home and it's just the three of us, he and the Chinese boy, because Jeremy Monteiro, we've been doing thing with him, Monteiro, Young and Holt for quite a while.  Eldee might have told you guys that while he was here.  We did the first Montreux that, that Jeremy was able to do.  Jeremy was trying to get on the, on the Montreux Fest.  And Claude Nobs, who we had known, we went over there '67' [1967].  Chaney had went with us.  And Claude Nobs--we did it when Claude Nobs was on his third Montreux Jazz Festival.  We did the third.  He came to New York and saw us, and he asked Queen Booking Agency.  He saw us.  He needed some talent.  We went over.  We got--how much money we get?  We got like $200 a week or something.  We got little money, but we got three meals a day, and they fed us the French way, man, with that little croissants and jive, man.  You get up for breakfast you thought--you said where the breakfast?  Where the eggs and where the stuff?  They say oh, croissants.  Come on, you know.  It was, it was, it was, it was an experience, man.  That was the first experience.  Boy, we used to crack up.  We had to go to the store.  We said we gotta go to the store and buy some food.  But Claude Nobs--Jeremy was trying to get it in '86' [1986], so Jeremy wrote him back.  He had been trying to get it from Singapore.  So, he say, who you got with him?  Jeremy told us this.  Jeremy say, he was talking on the phone, he say, well, who are you bringing?  He said well, I'm bringing Eldee Young and Redd Holt.  Claude Nobs told him, you got the main stage, baby.  Why didn't you tell me you was (unclear), why didn't you tell me you was bringing--and ever since that time and Jeremy, we've been doing things and playing together.  We did the one in, we did one later, twenty-three years later.  And that's a, they did a live date.  And he say it's like, man, Redd Holt and Eldee Young came through for me.  And this man's a millionaire now, Claude Nobs, you know, who do the Montreux Jazz Festival; he does the whole thing, man.

Speaker 1: SCOTT STEARNS:  Well, just if your style changed or what.  I think you answered it.
Speaker 2: Oh, the style?  Yeah, but, but I really--we got funkier though.  We got a little heavier, like the guy--the kid brought that out the other day.  We became a little bit more--I think our personality--I think sometimes some of the first stuff that you hear with Ramsey [Lewis, HM], you might have heard us holding back more, you might have heard us holding back more.  When that happened, we opened up, we opened up, and we--the--those two instruments had to come on up to where they won't--where there was almost struggling to stay kind of like down, you know.  Because during that time a cat say, hey, the drugs might be too loud.  We better bring 'em down, bring that track down.  But it's a whole different program.  Like, as far as advice to a lot of musicians, once again, it's like drummers, a lot of drummers, before they will ever, ever, ever be able to express themselves, they will have to eventually form their own group and become a leader.  They will have to because the way, the way the music is structured, has been structured over the years, it has always been structured, no matter even you had the great drummers, who I always say they had more band drummer--band drum--leaders than piano players and other stuff, and they gave everybody else an opportunity to shine.  But being a drummer, being a drummer and to be a band leader, you have to be not forceful, but you have to set a precedent, you have to set a direction that you're going in and that you wanna go in.  Other than that, all of the other instruments really actually always wanna hold that drum back to an extent to where you are only here to accompany me.
Speaker 1: To keep time.
Speaker 2: To keep time.  And that's not what a drum is supposed to be about.  Now you had other musicians that feel with one another.  Alvin Jones and Trane [John Coltrane] was a perfect match.  You know, you got these perfect match, and we were a perfect match at that time.  But that, that, that fate, that finger of fate, like they say, it snatched it out.
Story_ID: 79469
Speaker 1: So what it really did was, was--the, the strength in us that wanted to do and wanted to lift it to another--we went to another level.  We went to another level.  We went to a more freehearted level.  We went to a more fun level.  We picked songs like "The Call Me Mellow Yellow" and, and all of that kind of stuff, man.  And hey, and we would do stuff on the bandstand.  Like, we had a jawbone of an ass, the real jawbone of an ass, you know, with the bells on it.  And Eldee [Young, HM] would beat it, and beat it, and say hey, this is the jawbone of an ass.  We was at the Bohemian Caverns doing all this kind of stuff, man.  And, and it was like one big party.  He say this is what Sampson slew the Philippines--no, no, I mean the Phili--Redd what?  I said the Philistines, the Phili--you know.  We--you know, that's why Joe Glaser came and he say you cats are an act.  He said you're not just jazz musicians; you guys are an act.  And that's why I tell those young cats, hey, baby don't forget the words show business, you know, show business, reaching out to the people, touching the people.  I like to see people moving and dancing and having fun.  You know, you come out on--you might be like on prom night, your wedding night and stuff like that.  People didn't come out for you to make 'em feel bad, you know, you come out on your anniversary, man, you know.  We--God put us here--we, we entertainers.  We're in show business.

Speaker 1: SCOTT STEARNS:  One last, one last question.  This is a short one--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: SCOTT STEARNS:  --(unclear)--musical legacy.  We're putting something in a time capsule.  It could be a composition, an album, a performance.  Which one would best represent Redd Holt?
Speaker 2: I got, I, I want a couple of them in there, man.  Can I have, can I put more than one in there (laughter)?  I got drum solos.  I got, I got solos like "The Other Side of the Moon."  I'd like to put that in there, but I would like to put my tune in there, man, that--I'd like to put that, that money tune in there, so that it would be left for these, these cats to, cats to know, man, ain't there something that money can't buy, baby, come on now.  You know, money can change from hand to hand, but don't let it change you; don't let it change this music; don't let it change, man; don't sell, don't, don't, don't sell your soul out, man, you know, buying false religion, fame, and favors, man.  You hear music, put it in a capsule.  If you feel that music, and you put up for music, that's it.  You might die broke.  You might die poor, but you know what they say?  You can't take none of it with you no way.  You ain't taken nothing with you.
Story_ID: 79471
Speaker 1: Well, that's Isaac Redd Holt there as a little guy.  He must be about four years old there.  And that was taken in Rosedale, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: This photo is a picture of the original West Side Clefts band.  And you see Redd Holt there sitting on the drums, had it all painted.  That's when he was just using 1D, that first set of drums there boy oh boy.  That's a Ludwig.  On the saxophone from left, from left going right, that's Booker Porter, tenor saxophone, now deceased; also, next to him, Edward Morris.  We call him Dinky.  He is deceased also.  And if you see the little guy's head sticking up in the back of that photo behind the base, that's Eldee Young on bass, stretching his head to try to get into the photo.  And the last saxophone player there is Wallace Burton, who plays a lot of piano around town now down at Andy's.  And if you look right at the tip of the bell of his saxophone, you will see another figure's head leaning over the piano.  That is a piano player by the name of Kirk Stewart.  We used to call him Kencholow (ph.).  He's deceased now.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, the one on the top, that looks like that could be Isaac Redd Holt there, Isaac Redd Holt with his wife, Marylean Holt, who was we'd say Marylean Green Holt because she was a Green before Redd Holt met her.  That's me, Redd Holt.  I met her and we married 48 years ago.  And--
Speaker 2: SCOTT STEARNS:  And when was this photo taken?
Speaker 1: That photo, that's a photo that was taken in 1990--1996 or 1997 out at the Philanders, Philanders Restaurant out in Oak Park.
Speaker 2: Underneath there is another picture of the young Redd Holt there, Isaac Redd Holt.  I was, I guess I was at Gladstone School at that time.  I must have been around, between 11, yeah, 11 or 12 or 10, somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: There's Redd Holt.  That's his, one of his first set of drums endorsement, where he was endorsing, he was an endorsee for Ludwig Drums, which was located in Chicago at the time out on Damen Avenue.  They have now since been sold to Selma Saxophone.  Redd, at that time, that was--if you notice, Redd has all his bells, little triangles hanging; there's some Greco cymbal.  At that time, we were really into some, a lot of the Modern Jazz Quartet.  Redd, I would say then that must have been around the year of 1959, 19--about 1959.
Speaker 2: Who was drummer for Modern Jazz Quartet?
Speaker 1: Connie Kay, Connie Kay.
Speaker 2: Oh, this is a picture of Redd Holt at the Hot House in 1999.  They--he received his 1998 award from the Arts Midwest.  That's an organization out of Minne--Minneapolis, Minnesota.  They presented me, they presented me with, with the award along with $5000.  And that was one night at the Hot House down on Balboa in Chicago.
Speaker 1: This is Redd Holt, and this particular picture was in Montreux, Switzerland.  And this picture was taken in 19--I think it was 1967, our first trip to Montreux.  And I have a recorder there in my mouth.  I used to do a lot of little, little gimmick trick things.  People would say gimmicks, but these are things that I felt, I enjoy them at that time.  Also, those bongos on there was an idea of mine.  I was the first drummer to go out to Ludwig Drums and insist upon them using the bass drum holder to cut into that drum, put it in, and it would balance it.  The flute sometimes--at that time I would use it as a snake coiler for the tambourine that I would sometime bring up.  See, I was really, like I liked to pantomime and create things.  And that, that, that was in Montreux in 19--what I say--about 1967.
Speaker 2: Ut-uh, this here, if you see on the right, this is the 12th Infantry Regimental Band, which was a part of the 4th Division, when I was rotated out of wrote--out of Fort Knox, the 3rd Army Division.  With a tanker's MOS, I was able to go and be TDY for the rest of my period, which was just about 14 or 16 months in the Army in the 4th Infantry Regimental Band.  In that band also, somewhere in the background on the other side, is a very famous bass player by the name of Gary Peacock.  Gary Peacock was in this band with me.  He says I'm the reason for him being a bass player.  That's another story.
Speaker 1: SCOTT STEARNS:  And what was the year for this?  Did we get the year--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, that, that was in 1955, yeah, 1955 or 19--or '56' [1956].
Speaker 1: This was one of the beginnings of my storytelling, Redd Holt and his talking tambourines.  That's what they getting, one tambourine talks to the other.  I was--
Speaker 2: SCOTT STEARNS:  And when was this taken?
Speaker 1: This is in 1975.  That's a 1975 photo.  I was--I had already developed--the picture was taken then.  And I was just getting started into my pantomiming.  It was just getting started, but later on it develops into a real story.
Story_ID: 78467
Speaker 1: That's Redd Holt there, once again.  That's Redd Holt there in Singapore at the Westin Plaza Hotel with is talking tambourines.  He's, he's doing a little talking there to 'em.  I can't tell you what he's saying right now, but he's, he's kind of fussing at it there.  And that background you see is a very famous painting by one of the artists in Singapore now.  When you walk into that hotel, you'll see that painting.  And those little bells you see down there, I went to Little India, over by my sock cymbal, the little bells hanging, and picked those bells out in a little section called Little India in Singapore, bought it for sound.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  And did we get a year for this or do you recall?
Speaker 1: That, that year will actually be 19--1987.
Speaker 2: That picture is another picture from the Montreux Jazz Festival of 1967.  That's when the Young-Holt Trio went to the third Montreux Festival that had been presented by Claude Nobs, who is now on about his 30th festival.  And that's Redd sitting there.  And somebody called me and say hey, I wanna shoot your picture or do something, so I just happened to give 'em that glance, that pose.
Speaker 1: Ah, that's Redd Holt there, the spiritual leader.  This was in 1974, the end of '74' [1974], leading into 1975, when I formed the group Redd-Holt Unlimited.  At that time I was going through sort of a like a change.  I was more, and so I would say more of a spiritual, spiritual bag.  Because I was, not only had I, I formed a group with younger musicians, as I said earlier, it was Eugene Curry on piano, Randy Ford on bass, Jose Holmes on guitar.  I was sort of one--a mentor for them, because they looked up to me to tell them the things to do.  But I also, at that time, I myself went through some changes.  I wrote the songs like "Takers" - "Takers," please don't take all, leave something, save something for the givers to give.  And it was a very spiritual time.  It was a very spiritual moment for me at that time.  People began to call me the spiritual leader.  And I guess at that time I had the album "Isaac, Isaac, Isaac."  There were three of, there were three of me, and that was a spiritual leader there.
Speaker 2: This is the Redd-Holt Unlimited, the, the young men that I mentioned, three fantastic young musicians, could play jazz, could play funk, and we just had a lot of fun playing.  From the left is Eugene Curry.  I gave 'em all little nicknames, little names.  I call him Baby Lamb Chops.  If you remember the little character of Baby Lamb Chops.  That's Eugene, Baby Lamb Chops Curry; Randy Ford with the big natural.  I call him Randy Ford the Mandingo.  And that's me in the middle.  The spiritual leader is in the middle.  And moving on over to the right, that's Jose Holmes.  We call him Jose Holmes, the black Mexican.  My man, the bass player used to call him Guadalupe.  We had fun.  We had lots of fun.
Speaker 1: And what was the year for this?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What year is this?
Speaker 2: That year is 1975.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Could you also spell Curry and Holmes for us, just to be sure we have--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Holmes is H-O-L-M-E-S.  Curry is C-U-R-R-Y.
Speaker 1: That's Redd Holt in the year of 1988, about 1988, '87' [1987] or '88' [1988].  Let's guess at it like that, '87' [1987], '88' [1988].
Speaker 2: That's Redd Holt of today, sitting on stage in Singapore doing a performance.  And that was the year of 1990--what is now?  What year is this?
Speaker 1: Two thousand three [2003].
Speaker 2: Okay, that was the year of 2002, 2002, 2002, that's it.
Speaker 1: Now, this is Redd Holt.  And this picture was taken for the Urban Gateways program, where I took the arts into the schools with the program Urban Gateways.  That picture had to have been taken in about 1976, about 1976.
Speaker 2: Well, well, this is a picture of Redd Holt at the Blue Note, the old Blue Note of Chicago.  And that little guy on the drums happened to be Isaac Lamont Holt, the little guy that plays drums, piano, keyboard, and everything.  Now, I have to look at his age and try to remember how old was I at that time and what year.  That year had to be 19--1960.  That was 1960.  He was about--Lamont Holt was about--1963--'60' [1960].  He was three years old, right.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Ah, this is Redd Holt at the Elkhart Jazz Festival in the year June 24th, 2000, that's right.  They said a little night music, and we had a ball.  This is a good time.  I always have a good time.  That's John Bany on bass playing beside me there.  And we had a good time, very good time, always.  I usually work the, the Elkhart Jazz Festival every year now for the last three years.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Great.  Is that the one when during one of the breaks you were telling Larry you think that's still pretty relaxed and--
Speaker 2: Yes, this is--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --the one, this is the one, you really would like to catch this festival, yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  When is that held?  What time of the--
Speaker 2: That's in June.  That's held in June.  The last--it's the third weekend of June always.
Speaker 1: This is a write-up, "Redd Holt and Son presents 'Listen to the Drums'."  This was--we did a concert at the Cultural Center in the year of 2000.  My wife, Marylean Green insisted that all four of her men, the Holt men, be on a stage at one time in her lifetime.  And with her help, and only with her help, was we able to pull this off, and it was wonderful, came off wonderful.
Speaker 2: And this photo is at the [Chicago] Cultural Center.  And not only did we open up with four sets of drums, and we was making sure--we said, well, we--four sets of drums was the first time you ever had four sets of drums like that in an auditorium like that.  And it came off well.  And each one of my sons, we played to each other.  It was beautiful, but each one of 'em switched instruments.  My oldest boy switched to the keyboards, my youngest--my oldest boy at left--let's go from left to right, that's Isaac Lamont Holt on drums on the left; that's me, that's dad, Redd Holt; next to him going further, going on over, on the blue set, the third one is Ivan Desmond Holt; and the last is my baby son, the youngest one, Reginald Lamar Holt.  He's also a keyboard player and bass player.  They all play different instruments, and they all switched, got on their instruments.  And I stayed there and played awhile, and then I turned it over to my middle son, Ivan, who took over, and we finished the show.  We played all of my hits, all of the hits, "I'm in with the 'In' Crowd," "Wack Wack," "Hang on Sloopy," "Mellow Dreamin'," all of that stuff.  That's why I say look for that in the future.  They will be here.
