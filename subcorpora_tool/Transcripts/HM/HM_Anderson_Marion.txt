Speaker 2: My favorite food, that, that, that would be a combination of things because I just had roast chicken down on the island as we speak; string beans, corn with it and macaroni and cheese and cornbread, all that stuff I make myself. And then of course, I love fish and that we had fish yesterday. I like tilapia.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite time of year?

Speaker 2: Favorite phrase or saying: the highest value of work is not what you earned necessarily, but what you become after it. I think that was the slogan that I had in my classroom. The highest value of work is not what you earn, but what you become.

Speaker 1: And what about the dress and the top there, or the skirt--
Speaker 2: Oh these, yes, this is some, this is called a wrap skirt and we made a few of these and it was--the construction is very simple because it mainly deals with darts and (simultaneous)--

Speaker 2: A dart is material that is taken in on, on the, on the garment to make, to make it conform to the contours of the body.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course this is a top that goes with it, a very simple type top.
Story_ID: 507354
Speaker 1: So I thought we'd have some discussion about your family. So, please tell me about your mother? If you could start off by telling us her name and spelling it? Tell us where she was born and where she grew up and what you knew about her background?
Speaker 2: Okay. My mother's name is Ethel Anderson of course, E-T-H-E-L. She was formerly Ethel Mannaco [ph.]. She was born and grew up in Charleston, South Carolina. I did not know my--her mother, my grandmother nor my grandfather, but I guess--then, then of course she married my mother [sic.], that's how come I got to know her (laughter).
Speaker 1: Does your mom tell you any stories about her coming up when she was growing as a kid or young woman?
Speaker 2: My mother had a sister and they were two, two members of the family because she and her sister were the only ones and her sister of course, had a lot of children, it's like seventeen children.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And my mother was called Edie originally, or Edith, rather. She was sometimes referred to as Edie, but when my sister got--her sister got married, she married a person whose name was Eddy [ph.] and people began to become confused with the two names, Edith and Eddy, so my, so my mother changed her name to Ethel. My mother became a beautician and she was a hairdresser for years, that's how she earned her living. In fact, she taught me how to shampoo ladies hair. I found myself at the age of seventeen shampooing ladies hair. I accepted it as just another household chore until I began to realize that this is not, not nothing for a boy to be doing. A decent--in those days it wasn't fashionable for a boy to, to, to do women's hair, later on of course, it became different. However, I began to rebel against it and my sister [Inez Anderson Simpson] was old enough to take over, so my mother had, had no problem there. But as I said, she was a very trade minded person.
Speaker 1: Do you know where she learned her trade?
Speaker 2: You know, I really don't know the details of where she, how she acquired her training, but she always spoke of a school, a Poro school, she, as she referred to it, but, but gives me, leaves me, leaves me to believe that she attended some kind of school.
Speaker 1: And do you know, you said you didn't know her parents, but do you know anything about her parents, where they were from?
Speaker 2: Nothing, nothing at all. I remember, remembering pictures of my grandmother, her mother, but that's about all.
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mom?
Speaker 2: My mom was a very industrious person. She began to have children at the age of thirty-four and she, she always talked about her travels prior to that time, traveling as far as Canada and I believe that experience was--made us better for it. One thing of course she realized a need for, for, for one to have a trade and she insisted that I take a trade as I was entering high school [Burke Industrial School; Burke High School, Charleston, South Carolina].
Story_ID: 507355
Speaker 1: Please tell us about your father, if you could start again with his name and where he was from and where he grew up?
Speaker 2: Well my father's name of course, was William Anderson. He grew up from what I could remember in the Charleston [South Carolina] area, yes. I have records of his father and, and, and mother and of course other siblings of that group. We did some; we did extensive family research on the father's side.
Speaker 1: So how far back did you study your father's side?
Speaker 2: Well we go, went back to the great-grandfather.
Speaker 1: And who was he and where did he live?
Speaker 2: Also in the Charleston area. In an area of Charleston called, called Liberty Hill [South Carolina] and I believe from, according to history, that area was named by Andersons.
Speaker 1: Oh wow, so what did they do in Liberty?
Speaker 2: Just learn, well, my grandfather operated the grocery store. It was called a delicatessen type store and of course, my--yes, and his sons, not my father, but one of his sons continued that business. My father acquired the pressing skills, that's how to press clothes and I've never sat down with him to find out exactly how he acquired that skill. I really became anxious and curious in later years, but he did acquire that pressing skills--
Speaker 1: And you said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and operated, and operated a dry cleaning business in the Charleston area. We called it the Okay Pressing Club [ph.].
Speaker 1: You said that you had researched his family back to your great-grandparents. Do you know what they did in Charleston?
Speaker 2: No, not, no, I don't know what they did. I know that they owned a lot of land in that area, that's about all. They were landowners; I guess you could call them.
Speaker 1: That's something.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: How would I describe my father? Well, he was a very quiet, caring person, churchgoing person. He sang in the choir, that, that, that, that's all I can say.
Speaker 1: Did he tell you any stories about his upbringing? I know you didn't hear about the pressing skills (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: --but maybe when he was a boy?
Speaker 2: No, no, that's one thing that we didn't get from my father, background history.
Story_ID: 507356
Speaker 1: What was your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest, earliest memory of growing up, well, well, of course, going to school, going to elementary school [Henry P. Archer Elementary School, Charleston, South Carolina] and then to high school [Burke Industrial School; Burke High School, Charleston, South Carolina] and of course, being one of three siblings, the oldest of three.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us the names of your brother and sister?
Speaker 2: My sister's name was Inez [Inez Anderson Simpson] and my brother's name is Fred [Fred Anderson].
Speaker 1: And where did you all live, you said Charleston, South Carolina (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in town.
Speaker 2: Yes, well there was a time when we lived at the place that I called Liberty Hill [South Carolina], which is about ten miles from the city proper. And then there was a time when we lived within the City of Charleston.
Speaker 1: And what were your homes like, I mean the, the main home that you grew up in perhaps in Charleston--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what type of place was it? Was it a stand alone house, would you just tell us a little bit about it?
Speaker 2: I was--we were in the, probably in the category of, you know, middle class people because we had pretty good homes. We had, we had our own property so it was just a matter of building on the property. And even I have a house which I built sometime recently on, on that property, and I visit it occasionally now.
Speaker 1: So the house that you built is it, is it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's a trailer type house, yes.
Speaker 1: And does the house that you grew up in still stand?
Speaker 2: No, it was rebuilt, yes, rebuilt. The original house was not what, is not there anymore.
Speaker 1: And you said yours is a trailer type house?
Speaker 2: Mine is a trailer, yes.
Speaker 1: So that's a house that you brought onto the property?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, could you tell us just about as children with you and your brother and sister, what kind of things did you all do in your neighborhood? Did you play games? Did you like and hang, and hang around each other? How did that work?
Speaker 2: I know we were very serious about life. I, I do remember doing a lot of skating and my father [William Anderson] taught me to ride the bicycle. That was his main means of transportation. And as far as my mother [Ethel Anderson], well she spent time teaching us all the, all the household chores. I was, being the oldest was introduced first to everything. She taught not only the cooking, but also the shampooing of ladies hair.
Story_ID: 507357
Speaker 1: And where was your mother's [Ethel Anderson] beauty shop?
Speaker 2: Every place where we lived and we lived in, in, in the city [Charleston, South Carolina] we lived--I recall our living in two different places and each time my mother would find an area to built her workroom. That was part of a porch, as we called it, she would build a workroom that she would, be, be able to, to do the hair.
Speaker 1: And who would come and get their hair done by your mother (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She had customers, oh, she had customers, some people that would come, just that she, that knew her and she knew them.
Speaker 1: And what about your father's dry cleaning business [Okay Pressing Club (ph.)]?
Speaker 2: Yes, my father's dry cleaning business was located at a, at a, at a place I guess we would call it on the outskirts of the city. And he also would have a vehicle on which he would build a kind of an enclosure to his clothing, clothes delivery, but this business was carried on during my early growing up.
Speaker 1: You said a clothes delivery?
Speaker 2: No, it like a truck, he would build a, a, an enclosure on, on the back of a vehicle and he would hang the clothes, the clothes, the suits of clothes inside in and, and that's how he would do his delivery.
Speaker 1: And you were telling me a little bit earlier about what your father [William Anderson] would literally do with clothes. You said he would steam clean them?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, my father, was as I said, considered himself a presser and he would press clothes that was either dry cleaned or steam cleaned. Dry cleaning is when you use a solution, a chemical solution, to dry clean, but steam cleaning is when you use soap and water to actually wash the garment, scrubbing it really and then allowing it to hang to dry and usually those garments that are what do you call, steam cleaned, are more difficult to press. But he would be able to press those garments. He would have two irons that, that, that he used for the pressing, while one iron was being used, the other one was on the stove being heated.
Speaker 1: And did you use those irons with a special kind of a grip or something to keep you from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, it was, was well padded, well padded because they were very hot and heavy.
Speaker 1: And does your father work alone?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then your mother worked with you all as--
Speaker 2: Doing, doing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) as support doing shampoo and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and other, other auxiliary responsibilities?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 507358
Speaker 1: So where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: Oh they called it, the school was called Henry- Henry P. Archer [Henry P. Archer Elementary School] and that was located in this City of Charleston [South Carolina] and of course, after I graduated from Henry P. Archer we went to Burke High School [Burke Industrial School; Burke High School, Charleston, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: And when you were in elementary school, what kind of a student were you?
Speaker 2: I guess an average, an average student.
Speaker 1: Did you have any teachers who particularly influenced you, or were you--
Speaker 2: In elementary school I don't recall any particular, any particular influence, but--
Speaker 1: And, so you said you said you went from elementary school to right into high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So how many grades were included in your elementary school?
Speaker 2: Eighth grade, eighth.
Speaker 1: So first through eighth grade (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --and then you graduated and went on to Burke Industrial high school?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 507359
Speaker 1: And then talking just a little bit more about your family life. What were the most important holidays and special events and how did you celebrate them at home?
Speaker 2: Well, the usual Thanksgiving and Christmas, and you look forward to special foods.
Speaker 1: Which foods?
Speaker 2: Oh, naturally well, Christmas was always the turkey and, and of course Christmas also had special foods and gifts, you know.
Story_ID: 507360
Speaker 1: Why don't we talk about your experience at Burke High School [Burke Industrial School; Burke High School, Charleston, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: What did you study there?
Speaker 2: Well, as I was entering the high school, my mother [Ethel Anderson] insisted that I take a trade and the Burke had all the trades, the auto mechanics to construction trades, bricklaying and so on, but I didn't like any of the trades, somehow I didn't want to get my hands dirty. So I evaded the issue for the first year, then during my sophomore year they starting tailoring and I said to myself that this might be an opportunity for me to shut my mother's complaining and tell her that I would take tailoring and that which I did. And of course she was very pleased, not that I was so enthused about tailoring, but after taking it and making garments and getting, and, and experiencing the reaction of people to, to garments that I made, you know, it really gives you a great feeling.
Speaker 1: What was the first garment that you made and what was the reaction that you got?
Speaker 2: The first pair, the first garment was a pair of pants. I remember very well, a pair of plaid pants and, and among my friends in the school and associates, they'd always say, "Oh, he made those pants." And of course my mother was, was, was enthused to no end and she started drumming up business and so already I'm a pants maker because I made one pair of pants.
Speaker 1: And were they pants that you wore?
Speaker 2: I wore, yes. I was wearing--
Speaker 1: So you wore them to school?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And what, or where, who did your mother get for you as clients?
Speaker 2: Oh, the ministers of the church, people in the church. She said that my, my son is a tailor and all--not only that, one of my father's [William Anderson] brothers was, was, was, was very supportive and, and bought material from places as far as Chicago [Illinois] for me to make pants for him.
Speaker 1: For him?
Speaker 2: For him, yes, and so I was able to measure him and make--and he was a big guy too. I was able to measure him and I made the, and drafted the pattern and made the pants.
Story_ID: 507361
Speaker 1: What church did you all attend?
Speaker 2: We were Methodists in those days.
Speaker 1: And did you go to church regularly? Was that a part of your weekly (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We went to church, oh yes, very, very much.
Speaker 1: --weekly thing?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. In fact, we went to church while I was working because as a result of my exposure to sewing I was able to get a job after school and the after school job was with a Jewish firm and they operated on Sundays and we had to get an understanding. I said that, "Your Sabbath is Saturday and mine is Sunday, so we have to share." So they allowed me to attend my service; of course after service I went to work on Sunday evening.
Speaker 1: And did you work for them on Saturday while they were at their services?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, on Saturdays of course, they didn't have much to, to do because they were like off on Saturdays until, until evening.
Speaker 1: And then you would go in, in the evening?
Speaker 2: I would go in in the evening, yes.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Um-hm it was one of the things that--one of the first jobs I, I got as, after getting involved with the sewing was at this place as a tailor doing, hemming pants, you know, and it was one of the first times I began to realize that you don't have to ask for a job as (background noise), as a janitor, excuse me (pause), as a janitor because you have a skill and you can apply for a job as a skilled person.
Story_ID: 507362
Speaker 1: Were there any particular teachers that you worked with at school [Burke Industrial School; Burke High School, Charleston, South Carolina] who were helpful in developing your skills (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, there were teachers who were very supportive and who employed me, employed me to make their prom suits for them.
Speaker 1: Oh wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: A little bit earlier you were telling me about a teacher who you said was quite good, who not only enabled you to learn the, the tailoring, but also was able to teach it, do you remember his name?
Speaker 2: This was, this was the tailoring teacher. As I was saying that it was like a godsend for him to come with that combination of, of industrial skills as well as academically astute, so as a result of his, of his, of his teaching, you know, then it paved a way for my thinking that I could also teach.
Speaker 1: And you say you were talking, you were talking about him having the both industrial and the ability to teach--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --how is that different from working with someone who just has the industrial ability, who could sort of show you how to do it?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, first of all he's a college graduate, which was a rarity in those days, for a, for a person to have industrial skills and, and be a college graduate. And with his college training I'm sure he was, was exposed to a technique for teaching, which made a, made a difference, as opposed to someone, as opposed to acquiring the skill as an apprentice with, with, for the skilled person, who can only, he will show you and tell you do this, do that, but you, you may not know why, that's, that's the difference.
Story_ID: 507363
Speaker 1: So once you were in Burke Industrial high school [Burke Industrial School; Burke High School, Charleston, South Carolina] and you're getting training in tailoring and you have multiple clients, did you simply graduate from there and move on to your next job?
Speaker 2: Yes, except that I was interrupted by being drafted into the service during the, during the first, the last part of my senior year I received a draft notice and had to leave school.
Speaker 1: And so you had to leave both school and your job?
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: And did you let the people at your job know that you were leaving?
Speaker 2: Well somehow the Jews that I worked for had great influence in the town and when I received the draft notice the thought of leaving Charleston [South Carolina] didn't bother me, in fact, I sort of kind of welcomed the idea, getting away from Charleston and, and having, having the opportunity to get away from Charleston. So I refused to tell my boss thinking that--it was a weird thinking of course, that they would use their influence to keep me in Charleston from going to the service that was nonsense. At any rate, I told them--I waited until the last couple of days to tell them that I was drafted into the service.
Speaker 1: And once you were drafted, what happened, did you go to training? While--what was--how did that, how did that work?
Speaker 2: Yes, well you're drafted and you go to, go training. I would travel from Charleston to Missouri and there would be six months on, onto, to go in the basic training.
Speaker 1: And after basic training, where did you go?
Speaker 2: Well after basic training, after six months in the service--
Speaker 1: And what was your, what was your rank or, or--
Speaker 2: I was private first class in, in the branch of the [U.S.] Army called the Engineers [U.S. Army Corps of Engineers], whatever that means.
Speaker 1: What does it mean (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well it means--
Speaker 1: Did you do engineering?
Speaker 2: Yes, engineering means that you build roads and run electrical wires and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: So where did they deploy you to?
Speaker 2: Well eventually I, I got notice to be shipped to--overseas. They were going to the Philippines and I recall that we were thirteen days at sea when the Japanese surrendered and that of course made the rest of the journey a little easier, but we stayed in Manila [Philippines] and then of course I had the opportunity to make use of--and what do you call it, enlistment plan.
Story_ID: 507364
Speaker 1: The [U.S.] Army of course, was a segregated army, you know.
Speaker 2: What year is this that you're, you're leaving (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This was in '45 [1945].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. And I had--I was to travel from Charleston [South Carolina] to Missouri and they provided us with, with a car all to ourselves (laughter). And so, but even after we ended up overseas, doing duty in Manila [Philippines], we were still a segregated army. All black units were, were with blacks and so on, so on.
Speaker 2: And so everything you did, your eating, your training, your sleeping was done in segregated areas?
Speaker 1: Oh yes, most definitely. While I was in Manila, naturally the war [World War II, WWII] is at a standstill, so there's really nothing much to do and I chose to attend the University of Manila [Manila, Philippines] where I took a course in small business administration rather than just to sit around doing nothing.
Speaker 2: And did you--was that course taught in English?
Speaker 1: Oh yes, yes, in the Philippines they are very much English speaking.
Speaker 2: And so this was during the third--the short period of time that you were--
Speaker 1: In Manila.
Speaker 2: Before the war ended, the Japanese surrendered?
Speaker 1: No, this was after.
Speaker 2: Well, we were--
Speaker 1: I was thirteen day at sea.
Speaker 2: You were thirteen days at sea.
Speaker 1: On my way to Manila.
Speaker 2: And--so the Japanese surrendered and then what did you chose to do subsequent to that in terms of your enlistment in the Army?
Speaker 1: Okay, well, after we landed in Manila, they came out with a reenlistment plan and the plan involved that if you reenlist for one, two or three years, then certain things would happen. First of all you would get your mustering at pay; secondly, you would get a thirty day furlough and what was the third thing? At any rate, you'd get your thirty day furlough. So I said I was in the Army already just for about nine months and I didn't like the possibility of going, of going to Japan, so I said, I'll reenlist for one year and, and, and I'm sure that after the, I served the one year, they're not going to send me overseas. So, so I reenlisted and the reenlistment period started just as I reenlisted, right where I was in Manila. It took about a month to get a boat from Manila to, back to the states, so it's already a month gone out of the twelve months, and I'm back now to enjoy the month vacation, so that's two months, so I'm back now to serve the remaining, the remainder of, of ten months.
Speaker 2: And what did you do for that ten months?
Speaker 1: Well, that's a good question because they asked around, what would you like to do? And if you didn't find anything worthwhile they would assign you to certain things. So I told them that I would take a job cooking and they--and I did.
Speaker 2: Were you a chef, did you know anything about cooking?
Speaker 1: Well, Ethel [Ethel Anderson], my mother, taught us how to cook and most southern boys learned to cook, to iron, to do laundry and that sort of thing. It was like six--second nature to us. So I knew something about cooking. So I chose cooking. It was clean and it was a nice way to spend the remaining nine, ten months in the service. First of all I remained at Fort Belvoir, Virginia and on weekends we were able to go to Washington, D.C. on trips and travel to the schools in the area to visit, so, and in the meantime I was married because I got married while I was still in the service.
Story_ID: 507365
Speaker 1: Where did you meet your wife [Aleathia Johnson Anderson], on one of those trips to a local school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, we both attended the same high school.
Speaker 1: And what does, what was your--did your wife take a trade at Burke Industrial [Burke Industrial School; Burke High School, Charleston, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: No, no she was just a student there.
Speaker 1: And so you met her at high school and--
Speaker 2: In high school, yes.
Speaker 1: --decided to get married?
Speaker 2: Right. We, we decided to get married. We decided to get married while I was in the [U.S. military] service and primarily because I was in the service.
Speaker 1: And why is that? Were you concerned about your welfare?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess, I suppose the main reason was that that, you know, you don't know what the future will bring and I was--when I came home for, on furlough, then I think much of it was encouraged by my wife's family because they said they got a good catch here, so let's take advantage of it. And, and let's, at least you, you, it was all--they're thinking the marriage would be all set and so, although they're in--I'm in the service.
Speaker 1: And did you get married in Charleston [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: In Charleston.
Story_ID: 507366
Speaker 1: And I wanted to ask about your service as a cook since you were in segregated unit--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) did you only cook for black soldiers?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: How did that work?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh really?
Speaker 2: It was a black, complete black outfit, yeah, everything.
Speaker 1: And as a black soldier how did you feel you were treated? Did you--was it relatively comfortable?
Speaker 2: Sure, oh yes.
Speaker 1: And how were you treated by your officers?
Speaker 2: Well, many--although the--many of them were white officers, yes. We were treated very well. In fact I was being encouraged to, toward the end of my reenlisted period, I was being encouraged to remain in the service by the white officers to make a career out of, of the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Why come? What were their arguments for--
Speaker 2: They just said I should stay in the service, just to stay there and become an officer.
Speaker 1: And did--were there any other black officers, were there black officers there?
Speaker 2: Well there were black officers around, yes. In fact when we were overseas in Manila [Philippines], there were black officers around. Surely, with a segregated army you have to have black officers too.
Speaker 1: That would make sense.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 507367
Speaker 1: So after your term of [U.S. military] service of ten months, what did you do then?
Speaker 2: Went back to school.
Speaker 1: And what about your family, did you move to a new home? How exactly (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, we were all back in Charleston [South Carolina] and I'm back in school and that's, that's, that's, that's, that's how it went on.
Speaker 1: And, so you--what did you--did you complete your tailoring?
Speaker 2: Yes, I completed the--I took my high school training and, and in, in fact, this was now 1947 because I'm a graduate of the class of '47 [1947] and completed my high school [Burke Industrial School; Burke High School, Charleston, South Carolina] and now I'm working full time in the clothing industry.
Speaker 1: Where are you working?
Speaker 2: My first job was with a very exclusive custom tailoring firm called John Rugheimer [Charleston, South Carolina]. They made very expensive suits. In fact, their suits were so expensive that they would not make a suit for a black man. But their tailors and they, and their, their tailors, all of whom were--the, the black tailors were all pants makers.
Speaker 1: So they had an integrated (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A segregated--
Speaker 1: --workforce?
Speaker 2: --workforce.
Speaker 1: An integrated, yet segregated, they had black and white workers?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: But the work was segregated--
Speaker 2: The work was segregated.
Speaker 1: --and the black folks only made pants?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What were the ramifications of only making pants?
Speaker 2: Well, the black--the pants is the less complicated of the two garments and of course, the less pay. Coat makers made more money with--than the pants makers.
Speaker 1: Coat makers?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So how long were you there making pants?
Speaker 2: I was there until I decided that, that I wanted to make coats. And then I was telling my fellow workers--like if you had--the, the workshop was a two story building, and, and, and the ground--first floor was all the black workers and there were only about eight or ten of us. And upstairs were the white workers who were the coat makers and the only time we'd see each other when we'd come walking--this building was about fifty feet from the main store. The main store with--had its front on the main street, you opened up--the opening is on the main street and as you entered on either side of the walls there were bolts of cloth and in the center these huge tables where customers would come in and they would pick out their fabric that--spread it out on the table, make a selection, then further on into the store there was a administrative area, but it took--then beyond that was the, the cutting area where they drafted the patterns and cut the garments out and then this workshop, as I said was about fifty feet away, toward the back area of the yard area and that's, that's where we worked.
Story_ID: 507368
Speaker 1: What's the difference in the skill level involved in making pants versus making these coats and do the people who you work with making pants, do they know how to make coats?
Speaker 2: That's a good question because some of them probably knew, but since their job is relegated to pants making, so why, why even think about it, you know, because this, this, this is the job for which they're going to be hired. So why, why even think about coat. Some of them probably grew up in, in a situation as, as an apprentice where they were exposed to coat making, but this particular firm hired them as pants makers and the whites were hired as coat makers.
Speaker 1: So when you decided to think about making coats, what did you do? Did you talk to your fellow workers about that?
Speaker 2: I told them that I was thinking about asking the boss to, to start me on coats. And they, some of them took exception because they thought that you're going to upset this boss and we don't want to make the boss mad, as they would say. Anyway I took, I pursued my effort and I made a request and they said they would consider me next spring, but since the request was made they had to allow one of the other workers, black workers, to start, like one of the other blacks, yes.
Speaker 1: To start doing which?
Speaker 2: With the coats. They were going to start somebody on coats, but was I--I wasn't going to be the one. But I, but the, the other black workers didn't make the request, but they said that they would start this person on coats and I would wait until the next spring.
Speaker 1: So when you asked they decided that they needed to take someone senior, or who had been there longer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: --as a black person up into coats--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --and then later you would be able to do so?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And did you stay there long enough?
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: Did you stay until the spring?
Speaker 2: I told them no. I told them if I was not allowed to work, to be allowed to make coats that I was quitting. And you don't quit Rugheimer [John Rugheimer, Charleston, South Carolina] (laughter).
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: They, they would probably lynch you. (Laughter) At any rate, I, I did quit. Pants making was like slave work. You got paid according to the number of pants you made. And there were many of us who would be working Sundays at home taking those kinds of work, the part of the work that we could do at home, we would take it so we, we could make, make a decent salary at the end of the week. This is piecework. You get paid according to the number of pants that you made. So, I, when I didn't get the request to work on coats. I said I told them that I was quitting. And they made some threatening remark, "Well, you know if you quit we'll consider this when you want a recommendation," da, da, da. So, I didn't care about that either.
Story_ID: 507369
Speaker 1: I, I left that job and went to work for a ready made clothing store which was also in the downtown area of Charleston [South Carolina]. This clothing store sold suits that were highly expensive and one thing I learned about Charleston, or in the South for that matter, and although at that age I was, I was only twenty-two years old, but once you're able to prove yourself, they don't care, the age doesn't matter because I held a position at this clothing store that taught tailors with years--the many years of experience that I've lived, had, and but I was accepted because I was able to do the work.
Speaker 2: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And I worked there.
Speaker 2: --so, so unlike Rugheimer [John Rugheimer, Charleston, South Carolina]--
Speaker 1: Unlike Rugheimer, yes.
Speaker 2: Rugheimer--
Speaker 1: Rugheimer, yes. I was paid by the week, a salary, by the week. And this salary was comparable to any salary to, to the salary that was paid to any tailor in the Charleston area.
Speaker 2: And did you work alongside white people?
Speaker 1: No, no, I was the manager of the tailor shop.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: If anybody came in I would be the one to explain what to tell what to do. I did the fitting on the floor. In fact, I have a letter that I received from them describing my work. At some point I will show you that letter.
Speaker 2: Okay. So could you tell us a little bit about the ready to wear--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --you know, is this like a department store today, where you can go in and buy something off the rack?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: How ready is it?
Speaker 1: Yes, it's, it's, the suits are all made, completely made, high quality workmanship and different sizes and of course, it's, it's the tailor's job to make the suit fit perfectly, hem the pants, take in the waist, whatever has to be done.
Speaker 2: And so were you not, were you not actually doing those things at--
Speaker 1: Rugheimer?
Speaker 2: No, no, at, I think it's called--is it called Sam Berlin [Berlin's, Charleston, South Carolina]? Is that, this place (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is Sam Berlin.
Speaker 2: At Sam Berlin are you actually doing that work? You said you were the manager, so you were delegating to others?
Speaker 1: I was the manager, yeah, I was, in fact, for the most time, for most of the time I was the, the tailor.
Speaker 2: And how long were you there?
Speaker 1: One year.
Speaker 2: And why did you decide to leave?
Speaker 1: I always felt the need to broaden my experience beyond what I was--beyond what was available in Charleston. And I felt that I could do this somewhere down north and so I gave Berlin a two weeks notice and I came, I came to New York [New York].
Speaker 2: And is that when they gave you the letter describing your responsibilities with them?
Speaker 1: The letter, the letter came later, but I had problems with a job, with a company in New York, that necessitated the letter.
Story_ID: 507370
Speaker 1: So you move to New York [New York] and what year do you move to New York?
Speaker 2: This was in '47 [1947], '48 [1948], '48 [1948], yeah.
Speaker 1: And how do you find New York as compared to Charleston [South Carolina] and in terms of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, first of all I had relatives here in New York. I went directly to a cousin, one of my cousins and I lived with, with them until I was able to find a, a, a room for myself. In the meantime I arrived in New York on a, on a Wednesday and that Friday my cousin took me down to 34th Street to the employment office to get a job.
Speaker 1: You say, the employment office.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So is it a state or city (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) State, yes.
Speaker 1: --agency, okay.
Speaker 2: And we're sitting there, it's this, this employment agency's--thumbing through this big book trying to find someone who would hire because at that point, I was like twenty-three years old and, and black, how much, and coming from the South, what could you possibly know. That would--that, that is the general consensus. So, so finally, he decides that, "Okay, we'll arrange for you to get subsistence." So I'm here two days and they're putting me on welfare (laughter). So I said that I didn't come here for that. I said, "I want to work." And so he went back in this big book again and that was it and found a place that would hire anybody for, for nothing. I think the wages in those days was a dollar an hour.
Speaker 1: And how was that compared to the cost of living?
Speaker 2: Well, how is that compared with what I was getting in Charleston? I was making much more in Charleston, but I was warned by my teacher what to expect and he said, first of all, accept certain situations, but be able to look beyond. And so this agency at the employment office came across a company that would, that would hire me. They were making--they had a government contract to make what we called Eisenhower jackets, army jackets. And, but I--and so this was the Popular Manufacturing Company [New York, New York]. And so when I walked in there they too said what could this black boy possibly, possibly know. So they pointed to a table on which there was a pile of jackets with basting threads in them, white threads, he said, okay, clean those jackets, cleaning meaning to take the basting threads, stitches out of it. At that point I had enough knowledge to make a jacket if I had too, but I'm taking basting threads out of them. And I was doing this for two days, making a dollar an hour. Sitting near where I was working at this table was a woman sewing buttons on these jackets. These jackets required one hand sewn button. All the other buttons were sewn on by machine. But this woman was absent this particular day, so one of the bosses came to me and asked me could I sew on the button and I'm, I'm applying for a job as a tailor, right, but that, that's, that's overlooked completely. So they asked me now could I sew on a button? So I said, "Yes, I can sew on a button." So they said okay, so I sew, I'm sewing on buttons for another two or three days. One of the bosses came to me with a problem. It seems that these Eisenhower jackets had a belt with a snap fastener; the extension on the belt had a snap fastener. Some of the presses were bamming down so hard on this, on, on the garment that they damaged the snap fastener, so the, so the snap fasteners had to be removed and replaced. Now, the way this thing was constructed, you could replace the other, the, the, the old snap fastener, but when you put the new one in this, then this end of the belt has to be re-stitched, but no longer by machines, so it had to re-stich by hand. And it takes one with a great seat of skill to be able to do it by hand so that it resembles the machine, right. So this guy came over to me, seeing that I was handling the needle and sewing on buttons, seeing that I know how to handle a needle and I'm using my thimble and all the necessary tools of the trade. So he asked me could I sew this part of the belt. So he left it there came back, looked at it, "Oh, oh, you're schneider." Schneider is a Jewish term for tailor. So they moved me down into an area where they're doing examining garments and repairing those garments that needs to be repaired because the government inspector was very strict and like many manufacturers, they would try to get away with murder.
Story_ID: 507371
Speaker 1: So I'm working among these examiners now, most of whom were Europeans and they were highly paid, I'm still getting my dollar an hour and I'm sure they were getting much more. And over a few days, a few weeks, and I'm patience and I'm not begging or sweating I figured, I figured that they would be fair and the, and, and in the South they would tell you whether or not you're going to get it and if they told you you're going to get it, you'd get it. In the North, they'd BS you. They'd make you believe that, they'd try to get as much out of you for nothing as possible, much, as long as possible. So I'm working among these people, we are all repairing damaged garments and I notice that the tailors--these are European tailors now, every day there's one less and finally after maybe two or three weeks they are all gone and replaced by females. Most of the females were Spanish speaking. And many of the, the female workers didn't know what to do and they would come and ask me and out of kindness I would explain and sometimes it was so difficult to explain and I knew they couldn't do it, I'd say, "Oh, don't worry, I'll--," I would do it. And that pattern kind of developed and over a period of time I was considered a foreman, not realizing it of course, but other people, others in the area considered me the foreman because and, because there were times when I would have to go to a machine operator and telling the machine operator because they work--because they were using a special kind of machine, I'd say, you have to adjust your machine because your, your stitches are not correct because it's creating a problem for them and they'd say, okay. I would sometimes go to the presses, but out of--for me it just was being kind. But I'm still being exploited because I'm still getting a dollar--months were going by and I was still getting a dollar an hour. So the boss was having a problem with the inspectors so he said this one particular day--so, so all these Europeans were gone, replaced by twelve to fifteen females, most of whom I said were Spanish speaking and there was one, only one Jewish tailor and I left. The Jewish guy was at the machine and I'm at the table. So the boss was really angry because the inspector rejected the shipment. So he said to me, he said, "Listen, if these girls can't do their work, fire them!" I'm supposed to fire them. At any rate, I worked overtime. I was, I was getting a dollar and a half an hour overtime, right, so that would boost my salary and so I worked there for about three months I think until--
Speaker 2: Do you remember the name of that place?
Speaker 1: Yes, Popular Manufacturing Company [New York, New York].
Story_ID: 507372
Speaker 1: So after three months.
Speaker 2: Then I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You decided not to stay at Popular [Popular Manufacturing Company, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: No, after three months, I--my plans to go to school developed and that's when I started attending American Gentleman School of Design [New York, New York]. You see when you attend school you get subsistence and that was able to keep me going. So I was able to attend school. They couldn't understand how I was going to quit a job and go to school, but that was the--those were the circumstances.
Speaker 1: And where was the school located?
Speaker 2: 111 5th Avenue.
Speaker 1: Oh wow. And what was that like? What was it like there? Were there other--were there black and white students there? Who was there? What were the teachers like?
Speaker 2: This, this was the designing school--American Gentleman School of Design which gave courses in designing man and ladies garments.
Speaker 1: Did you have to apply there?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, sure you applied, but in those days this school, like many other schools, trade schools, catered mostly to World War II [WWII] veterans as their students.
Story_ID: 507373
Speaker 1: When you came to New York [New York] were most of the tailoring shops owned by Jewish people?
Speaker 2: Yes, most of the factories that, we called them factories, were owned and operated by Jewish people. In fact I've worked in at least four factories during my years of working in that industry and they were all Jewish.
Speaker 1: And where were they mostly located within the city?
Speaker 2: In the Garment District [New York, New York] anyway from the, from the 40s onto the 20s, from in the 7th Avenue area over to maybe, maybe over to 6th Avenue and maybe as far over, as far over as 9th Avenue.
Speaker 1: And are the majority of those factories still there?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no I think most of the factories have disappeared from the number of those, from the number--and, and doing business when I came to New York.
Speaker 1: And why, why aren't they there anymore? Are we not--
Speaker 2: Just the clothing industry, I would imagine that because of offshore manufacturing it affected the clothing manufacturing industry in, in New York.
Story_ID: 507374
Speaker 1: So could you continue to tell us about the design school that you went to?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I went to the American Gentleman designing school [American Gentleman School of Design, New York, New York], that's where I learned how to draft patterns for ladies and men garments. This was one of the schools that cropped up in those, at that time to cater to World War II [WWII] veterans. And I of course, was a World War II veteran, so I was able to attend that school and the tuition of course, was covered by the government.
Speaker 1: Is that something that would have been covered by the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944]?
Speaker 2: It was the G.I. Bill, exactly. Yes, the G.I. Bill.
Speaker 1: And what else was available to you through the G.I. Bill--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --or to you and to others?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess the housing, perhaps, but that was the only thing that I made, made use of, the training. And at the American Gentleman school of designing I met a number of people, weird people because a lot of the students took the course in order to get the money, not because they were--unlike me, in the field professionally. And many of them were drafting patterns and didn't know what they were drafting, but they would ask me, so I became quite friendly with a lot of them. But it's amazing how a friendship could develop because I recall we use to have lunch, during our lunch period we'd go into Union Square [New York, New York], I would talk and many of these guys would tell me about the stories--the street stories about weird happenings, weird to me anyway. And I remember one particular day we'd decided as a group, there were about five of us, to walk over in the east side.  Someone said let's walk over in the east side where it's a little more secluded and they started smoking marijuana and I, I realized this was what they were smoking because they started passing it around. When it, when it got to me I said, "No I'll walk ahead of you guys because I don't need that stuff." Now, I told this story because we've got to go back to my, my prison experience at Rikers Island [New York, New York]. I worked at Rikers Island as an institutional trade instructor. This is many years after this American Gentleman's exposure. And at Rikers Island, we had young inmates and I recall telling them this story about my experience at the American Gentleman School and they argued that, how could I be in a position to advise them when I didn't actually use the stuff myself, if I had used it and said well, I don't want it anymore, that's one thing, but to not to use it at all, not to experience it at all, they claimed that I don't have the--they questioned my authority to advise them against it. So I said, "You know, it's very simple. First of all, if I'm going to ignore all that I've read in newspapers and magazines about the ill effects of this thing and I'm going to ignore all of that," I said, "it would be ignorant of me to, to, to then use it." I said, "You used it, you're here as an inmate because you were curious. I'm here as your teacher and I did not use it, didn't have to, didn't think of using it." It was, it was one of those discussions things that we had on Rikers Island.
Speaker 1: So getting back to the American Gentleman School of Design, how long was that training and--
Speaker 2: The training was, it was a six month course, six months, right.
Speaker 1: And you said you learned patterns and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Yes, patterns, learned how to draft patterns for ladies and men.
Speaker 1: And when you graduated from there did you have a special title?
Speaker 2: I was, I already had my title as a tailor and being able to, to design patterns is just another aspect of that skill.
Story_ID: 507375
Speaker 1: So after you graduated [from American Gentleman School of Design, New York, New York] what, what did you do after that?
Speaker 2: I must have gone to work in that industry. I know I had a few jobs in either in trade schools, I now I did have a job at a, at a trade school because a, a cousin with whom I lived was taking this tailoring--was going to this tailoring school and he told them that he has a cousin who knows something about tailoring and they told him to come and let him come and see, see them, so I went and they hired me. This is at the Empire Trade School [New York, New York]. That's a--this is another school that catered to World War II [WWII] veterans. And I joined them at the very beginning of, of their so-called business development and, and of course, it, it, it went well.
Speaker 1: What did you do for them at the Empire Trade School?
Speaker 2: I taught tailoring, taught sewing.
Speaker 1: And, so did you continue to teach after you taught at the Empire Trade School (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Empire. Yes, well I worked there for about three years, yes. And it became a good, a great source of income because at that time the school became unionized and as a result of the union, the salary really increased to an impressive amount, so I, I worked there until the school closed.
Speaker 1: And did you have a sense of the impending formulation of the unions before the unions actually were created, I mean, was there a need for people to have representation?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, well, there were unions around and they made themselves present at any situation where they could, where they could exist. And the Empire Trade School was one of those, one of those places where they, they would come in and organize the staff and by the time they became--the school became unionized, the staff had already increased from the four or five students that, that was existing at the time I joined to now about twenty-five students.
Story_ID: 507376
Speaker 1: Now, what about your new wife [Aleathia Johnson Anderson]?
Speaker 2: My what?
Speaker 1: What about your wife, while you're spending time in New York [New York] working and training?
Speaker 2: Yes?
Speaker 1: Was she still in South Carolina?
Speaker 2: No, my wife came to, to New York after about two months. I was able to get an apartment and then I sent for her.
Speaker 1: So after you were at the Empire Trade School [New York, New York], what position did you take next?
Speaker 2: After Empire Trade School--I need to look at my--
Speaker 1: I have here that you were at Harry Irwing, Irwing Manufacturing Company [Harry Irwing Manufacturing Company, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes. In fact, I work at Harry Irwing at the same time that I worked at Empire Trade School because the trade school was an evening school and Harry Irwing was a, a clothing manufacturer and I was able to work there during the day.
Speaker 1: And so did you stay there for very long?
Speaker 2: I probably worked there for maybe a, a year or so because it was during that time that I began to develop a family, children were coming and I wanted to get out of the, the hustle and bustle of manufacturing. Out of all the uncertainties that these jobs presented--you're, you're always, there's always a fight for your position, for your, fight for your salary, so I said why not get into civil service and I saw this ad and The Chief [The Chief-Leader], The Chief was a, is a government newspaper that specialized in, I think, in government job offers. So I saw this job in The Chief, they wanted, they wanted a trade instructor for the department of corrections and I took the exam--they had two positions and there were eleven people applying for the two positions, so I managed to get that.
Speaker 1: And this was at Rikers Island [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: This was at Rikers Island.
Speaker 1: What's the population? What's the inmate population like at Rikers Island? Is it mostly black?
Speaker 2: Mostly black.
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Mostly black and Hispanic.
Speaker 1: --are people mostly getting arrested for marijuana offenses?
Speaker 2: For narcotics, yes, for, for drugs period.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Mostly for drugs, yes. At Rikers Island I was a teacher in the clothing industry where we made garments or uniforms for inmates throughout the city as well as their linens, such as their sheets and pillowcases and things of that sort.
Speaker 1: And, so did you have--was your staff made up of inmates?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And did that enable some of those inmates to go on and become tailors later, or--
Speaker 2: Unfortunately it wasn't set up for that kind of vocational training, you know, it was an activity kind of thing. Unfortunately, it wasn't, it didn't provide the kind of, of experience that I was exposed to, which would have enabled them to pursue a job or something like that, although many of them had, had opportunities for other skills, but, but they chose to break the law.
Speaker 1: What were the conditions at Rikers Island like at that point?
Speaker 2: In terms of?
Speaker 1: I mean, was it over-populated? Was it, was there enough room for everyone? Were people treated well, or was it an ugly, negative kind of environment (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it, it, it was I guess, the usual prison type situation. My relationship with the inmates was very good because they saw me as their outside contact or representative of the outside, as far as they were concerned. And I had no fear against them because there was always, always the correction officers around. My thing was to train them and they had the time and the interest.
Story_ID: 507377
Speaker 1: So how long did you stay at the department of corrections?
Speaker 2: I was there for seven years and in the meantime I started taking courses, educational type courses that would prepare me for licensing by the board of education [New York City Board of Education; New York City Department of Education] and so I left the department of corrections to work for the board of education and my first job was with special education, they called them 600 schools at that time, the high school for socially maladjusted youth. That was my first experience with the board of education.
Speaker 1: And did you teach tailoring to those students?
Speaker 2: I taught tailoring, yes. I started a tailoring program at Sterling High School [P.S. 85, Sterling High School; P.S. K753, School for Career Development, Brooklyn, New York].
Speaker 1: And was that your idea to teach tailoring to students in the New York [New York] education system?
Speaker 2: Oh, it wasn't my idea. They had sewing at this school all along, but it was taught by a female, but again, it wasn't real tailoring, it was just a sewing course. Well, the idea was there because I came with that, with that kind of skill.
Speaker 1: I see, and so once you got there that's when you began.
Speaker 2: That's when we developed a tailoring program.
Speaker 1: I see. And how did that training go over with the 600 students, those students (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very well.
Speaker 1: --who were maladjusted?
Speaker 2: Very well. These were youngsters who needed special, special attention, which they were not getting in, in the regular school situation. And the solution was to put them--to take them out of the regular situation and just put them somewhere other than where they were so that these regular students can progress uninhibited by these so-called disruptive students, but these disruptive students needed special help and smaller classes and, and people who were seriously interested in them and the small classes and, and expose them to a skill that was interesting and satisfying, this, this, this helped a great deal.
Speaker 1: And about what year are you at--arriving at Sterling High School?
Speaker 2: We, we're going to like 1960.
Speaker 1: And what's the political environment in New York like, you know, is there Civil Rights Movement that you are privy too, or are you basically working and not--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --affected by the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not really.
Speaker 1: --greater environment?
Speaker 2: Not really--busy working and busy keeping families, children growing up and the, the school situation can be very demanding and occupies a lot of your time.
Speaker 1: So how long did you teach at Sterling High School?
Speaker 2: I think for thirty-five years.
Speaker 1: And where was it located?
Speaker 2: It was located in Brooklyn [New York] at a place called Sterling Place, at the corner of Vanderbilt Avenue and Sterling Place [sic.].
Speaker 1: And at that time where did you live?
Speaker 2: I lived in, I lived in the Bronx [New York] first because while I was at Empire Trade School [New York, New York], where, where my salary was good, I was able to save enough money to buy a brownstone in, in the Bronx on Alexander Avenue and that's where I lived.
Speaker 1: And did you travel on the trains and so forth to get to work?
Speaker 2: At that--yes, in those days I simply traveled on the train until we were able to afford a vehicle.
Story_ID: 507378
Speaker 1: So once you worked for thirty-three years at Sterling (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Thirty-five years.
Speaker 1: Thirty-five years--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at Sterling High School [P.S. 85 Sterling High School; P.S. K753 School for Career Development, Brooklyn, New York]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --what did you decide to do next and why did you decide to leave after thirty-five years?
Speaker 2: After thirty-five years it was time to retire and perhaps even before that I had a dream of operating my own school and that's what I did. I started the Manhattanville Needle Trade School [New York, New York] and at that time I was living in an area of New York [New York] called Manhattanville.
Speaker 1: So is that over by Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes, it, it runs from 125th Street. It goes north at--
Speaker 1: 130th [Street].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And where did you live in that, in the Manhattanville area?
Speaker 2: Here at, at 41st Street [141st Street], yes.
Speaker 1: I see, I see. And was this considered--this seems a little high in my mind (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --for Manhattanville.
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: So this is more--
Speaker 2: More--
Speaker 1: --Harlem [New York, New York], West Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: No, Heights.
Speaker 1: Oh, Washington Heights [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Washington Heights.
Speaker 1: So, how did you formulate your school? You said you called it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay the--
Speaker 1: --the Manhattanville Needle Trade School?
Speaker 2: Needle Trade School, yes.
Speaker 1: Manhattanville Needle--
Speaker 2: Needle Trade School
Speaker 1: --Trade School?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And how did you encourage students to come?
Speaker 2: Okay, first of all we have to start a school. And anytime you want to start a school, you have to write to the New York State department of education [New York State Education Department] detailing your intentions and, and that's what I did. My intention was to, to, to set up a tailoring school and with that they sent me all the necessary forms and I was required to include details of the kind of, the curriculum that I was going to teach, the space where the teaching was going to take place and all the necessary tools and equipment that I needed to carry on, on the program. And the state department of education monitors every aspect of what, what my school was all about.
Speaker 1: And does the state fund you at all at that point?
Speaker 2: Oh no, this is a proprietary (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They just give permission?
Speaker 2: They only give you permission. They, in fact, they, they charge you. There's a fee for, for becoming a licensed--for the school itself to be licensed; for me as the director to be licensed; for my teachers to be licensed and I had to send my teachers to special schools to, to acquire the necessary basic training so that would qualify them to become licensed.
Speaker 1: And so was this all money that you had saved yourself, or did you do any fundraising? How did you--
Speaker 2: No, I used my personal funds, that's all. I started in the Bronx [New York] and it was at 138th Street and, and 3rd Avenue. I occupied the fourth floor of an industrial type building. It was about 2,500 square feet. And I used my personal money to acquire the machineries and all, and all the necessary equipment that I needed and, and set, set the school up.
Speaker 1: And how many students did you start with?
Speaker 2: Well I set up with--could have accommodated as many as twenty students at any given session.
Speaker 1: And how did you select those students?
Speaker 2: By advertisement--I advertised in the newspapers, the, the New York News [New York Daily News], the Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News] and developed--and had flyers to distribute around.
Speaker 1: And was--did you teach black students? Or did you have a mixed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Most of, most of the students were black. In fact, the, the school really started at, here at 141st Street at that front area where we were.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That's where it really started. And then we moved into the Bronx.
Speaker 1: This was your first classroom and then you moved it into the Bronx?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: And you were living here with your whole family?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you, do you have three floors here?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It's quite an impressive building.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So how did you--did your kids perhaps (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, my family, no, my family was--did not live here at the time.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: No, they had their own apartment elsewhere.
Speaker 1: In the Bronx?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I see.
Story_ID: 507379
Speaker 1: So you began your own school [Manhattanville Needle Trade School, New York, New York]; how long did you have the school, or you just still have it?
Speaker 2: I still have it and I had it what, started twenty-five years ago.
Speaker 1: But did you teach anywhere else while you were maintaining the school?
Speaker 2: No, this was just my main, main involvement and I probably started it full fledged about two years before I retired from the board of education [New York City Board of Education; New York City Department of Education].
Speaker 1: And when you say full fledged, what educational experience are you providing for people, you're teaching them pants obviously; but are you teaching them everything through creating patterns? Just tell us a little bit about your curriculum?
Speaker 2: Okay, the courses are on at, at least six different levels starting with beginner one and beginner two, then intermediate one, intermediate two and so on; beginner one--advance one that's sort of--and of course the main project for a beginner one for example, would be a tailored vest, but leading up to that are a series of projects and experiences, like for example, they would start, start off learning how to operate the sewing machines because many of my students would not, would have not had any exposure to industrial type sewing machines. They were--along with that would be hand sewing and then pressing; then textiles, all of this is involved in that course, that beginner course on, on, on that particular level.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and of course they would make a series of projects giving them experiences and that they would need for the actual garment making. For example, they would do--make, they would do projects that would require them to make pockets of different types. They would learn how to make darts before they'd get to the garment that would require darts. So, so aside from the machine operation, the pressing, then you'd have the cutting room operations. This is where they would learn how to do--how to take measurements. They would be exposed to the use of commercial patterns and these are patterns that they--you could buy in the stores.
Speaker 1: Something like out of a magazine?
Speaker 2: No, these are patterns--like some of them are called like Simplicity [Simplicity Pattern Company, Inc.], Vogue. These are all commercial patterns and they--this, my first effort as far as garment cutting is to expose them to commercial patterns, as, as opposed to the actual drafting of the patterns themselves, which is a little more technical.
Speaker 1: I--we spoke with [HistoryMaker] Leonard Davis about the patterns, and so when he were calling it Vogue, it made me think of Vogue magazine, but this is like when you go to the, to the textile store and they actually have the, the--
Speaker 2: The Vogue patterns.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Yes, patterns that are produced by the Vogue company [sic. McCall Pattern Company, Inc.], patterns for various garments, mostly your--for men, women, children and some accessories, yes.
Story_ID: 507380
Speaker 1: And as an advanced student [at Manhattanville Needle Trade School, New York, New York], do you learn to create your patterns or--
Speaker 2: Oh yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to build the pattern from scratch?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes as an advanced student they would learn to, to take the measurements and from those set of measurements they would produce a pattern, such as what we see on the wall over there.
Speaker 1: We're going to take a look at it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (SHOT OF DRAFT PATTERN)
Speaker 2: And how long is the program? So, if I were to attend your program from beginning to advanced to--
Speaker 1: It would probably take about two and a half years because we have our instructional period and segments of six weeks, with the classes meeting three times a week.
Speaker 2: How long per time?
Speaker 1: For eighteen sessions.
Speaker 2: But I'm saying each day when I come, how long am I here (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh three hours, three hour sessions, yes. So each course you take beginner one, is a, is a six weeks course and of course after completing that, then you take the next level and so on.
Speaker 2: And what do your students go on to do after they've completed your courses?
Speaker 1: Well, many of them go on to, well, go on to work in the industry, others refine their, their own skills because they've been probably doing a little contract work themselves. And two of my students--one is now working for Coach [Coach, Inc.]. He started with me from scratch and he, he's now working doing designing at Coach.
Speaker 2: And he's making clothes with them, or is he working as with leather?
Speaker 1: He's designing--leather, with, with leather. He was, also along with working with me, he attended FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York] and that's where he was exposed to accessories, and which include leather bags and shoes and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: You were mentioning that in your course you learned to use an industrial sewing machine.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Is it significantly different from--
Speaker 1: Oh yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) the kind of sewing machine that you would have at home?
Speaker 1: Definitely different, definitely different, more powerful, that's why they call them power machines. Then we have special machines of all different types, you know.
Speaker 2: To make specific stitches?
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly.
Speaker 2: And did you continue your education in any way after the American Gentleman school of designing [American Gentleman School of Design, New York, New York] and after you started teaching in design and operating your own school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, from that point on it was just a matter of practice and developing the skill that you have, improving it and so on and working with students and, and developing your teaching techniques and, and of course there is no end to the instructional material that's required in teaching you know, to make the teaching more palatable for the students.
Story_ID: 507381
Speaker 1: We were talking a little bit about your attending Adelphi University [Garden City, New York] and you said that you might explain that?
Speaker 2: Yes, when I applied for the board of education [New York City Board of Education; New York City Department of Education] job my experience in the industry and my educational background qualified me to, to accept the position and a master's degree, so I continued to work over the years and decided I think back in the mid-'70s [1970s] that I'm going to go to school and get me a bona fide degree and so that's what--that's why I, I attended Adelphi and it took me about two years, no, it took me about a year, Adelphi and graduated.
Speaker 1: With a master's or with your--
Speaker 2: With a B.A. (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) B.A.?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes. It didn't affect my job in anyway it's just that it was a thing that I personally wanted, personal satisfaction of having gotten a bona fide bachelor's degree.
Story_ID: 507382
Speaker 1: Your children, have they followed in your footsteps? Did they, are they tailors, or textile persons?
Speaker 2: That's a good question. Sewing was mandatory around my house.
Speaker 1: You sound like your mom [Ethel Anderson].
Speaker 2: Well, that's right, I never realized that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: All--as soon as they got old enough they--I maintained a job on weekends so that as they got old enough I could bring them with me, and, and they started doing the hand sewing, and when they got strong enough to get behind the machine, I taught them that. The oldest boy, Marion Jr. [Marion Anderson, Jr.] began to rebel. He, he lasted long enough to make a pair of pants, but then you--his rebellion was such that okay, I'm not going to force you anymore, but you have to do something. And across the street from this little tailor shop where we were was a grocery store operated by a Jamaican woman, her name was Sis [ph.], so I went to Sis and said, "Sis, I'd like you to employ my son." I said, "You don't have to pay him, I will give you his salary, but I do want you to put him to work." She said, "Okay." So Marion Jr. went over to Sis; Mark [Mark Anderson] came, came with me to the Riley [Mark Riley Custom Tailor, New York, New York]. Riley was the small tailor shop where I maintained the work on, on weekends. So I--at the end of the first week I went over to Sis to give her Marion's money. Sis said, "Oh no, you don't have to." She said, "He's a great worker. He earns every cent that, that he gets." She said, "No, no he's good," so that was that.
Speaker 1: That was fantastic.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then what about Mark?
Speaker 2: Mark went to the High School of Fashion Industry [sic. High School of Fashion Industries, New York, New York], graduated from that school. While he was, while he was taking the--and he took the tailoring course and people were criticizing him saying, "Oh you're following in your father's footsteps," but he took it in stride, but while he was taking the tailoring course he was exposed to the related subject of textile, so he became fascinated with textile, so I said, "Okay, you like textile," and I arranged for him to attend a textile college in, in--Philadelphia Tex [Philadelphia College of Textiles and Science; Philadelphia University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] so, that's where he ended up with Philadelphia Tex.
Speaker 1: And you said that you taught for a time at the fashion industries high school, was that true?
Speaker 2: Evening.
Speaker 1: In the evening, so you didn't cross paths with your son while he was attending?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, not at all, not at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, so go ahead through your children?
Speaker 2: So he graduated from Philadelphia Tex and as luck would have it during his senior year the school was visited by a representative from a textile institute [Institute of Textile Technology]. This in, institute is located in Charlottesville, Virginia. It's a textile institute that's supported by the textile industry that benefit from the resource, or research rather, that, that the school do.
Speaker 1: And I have an idea, I mean, I think fabric, but can you just tell us what's a textile?
Speaker 2: Well, textile is anything that is woven, knitted or felted into fabric. You either weave it or you knit it, or you fuse it together and it's all textile, anything that can be--you don't really want to include leather into that, into it, but that's textile. When he entered Philadelphia Tex he could have chose textile chemistry, textile math, textile something else, but he chose textile engineering, which was the smattering of all of it, and so, but as I said, while he was there the school was visited by a representative of this textile institute. This institute located in Charlottesville, Virginia, they have a two year graduate program, tuition free. The school--the curriculum also includes a--two weeks in Europe. So Mark was chosen that year to attend this textile institute.
Speaker 1: Fantastic.
Speaker 2: They'd never had a black face before so they had to make all kinds of adjustments. Even when they were, they were--as a student, the new students, they, they select twelve students each year from various textile colleges throughout the country, only twelve students because their, their staff--their enrollment is twenty-four students. So Mark is among the, the students at this particular year and they were explaining to the group the various resources around the town that they could enjoy and so on, country clubs and this and that. So, but Mark put a new twist on that because he was the first black student and they didn't have any programs, anything to accommodate black people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No black people.
Speaker 2: --(laughter) so, so anyway Mark chose to live off campus first of all. He acquired a trailer for him and one of the other students, and so they lived off campus. But upon graduation from this school he had at least five job offers, but they were all in South Carolina, North and South Carolina, so that's how he ended up in South Carolina.
Story_ID: 507383
Speaker 1: And what about your daughter, Alva [Alva Anderson Weinberger]?
Speaker 2: Alva graduated from C.W. Post [C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University; LIU Post, Long Island University, Brookville, New York]. She majored in music. Her main interest was, was the viola, but she also sang, she, she sings jazz on the side, but she teaches music at one of the, one of the second, secondary schools in Queens [New York].
Speaker 1: Audrey [Audrey Anderson]?
Speaker 2: Audrey is, became a schoolteacher and taught here in the city [New York, New York] for a number of years and then decided to move to Atlanta [Georgia] and as luck would have it, she's now one of, the director of the program they have at the aquarium [Georgia Aquarium, Atlanta, Georgia]. She's director at the new aquarium.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah that's what you said.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then Adriene [Adriene Anderson]?
Speaker 2: Adriene--and I have pictures of Adriene went--who, she participated in all the fashion shows that I put on at, when I was at Sterling High School [P.S. 85 Sterling High School; P.S. K753 School for Career Development, Brooklyn, New York]. We'd put on a fashion show every year and Adriene, from a little tot, she use to--participated in those fashion shows and so she became quite close to the sewing world, aside from the mandatory thing at home (laughter).
Speaker 1: At home (laughter).
Speaker 2: So, in fact, there was a time when--right in this very room, she did a contract, you know, what a contract meaning, she manufactured a set of garments for, for a designer; but she graduated from, not Adelphi [Adelphi University, Garden City, New York], upstate university--anyway, her job now is clothing manufacturer's rep. Now, what is a clothing manufacturer's rep? Okay, she has a showroom in the Garment District [New York, New York] and in her showroom she carries the lines of several manufacturers, as many as twelve. And a line (cough) with a manufacturer consists of maybe three or four garments. Buyers come to her, she takes the orders, forwards them to the various manufacturers and she gets the--she gets a fee for every, for every order that she takes. She also travels extensively out of town, Boston [Massachusetts], Washington, D.C. and all around to small and large specialty shops where she sells these garments for different manufacturers. She has great sales skills.
Speaker 1: You have some successful children.
Speaker 2: She is--we are in fact real--quite fortunate, quite fortunate, yes.
Speaker 1: And your children's mother [Aleathia Johnson Anderson] what did she do while you all lived in New York (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was a housewife. It was enough; it was enough for her to raise five children, it was quite enough.
Story_ID: 507384
Speaker 1: How would you articulate what you'd like people to learn from your life, from your life's work and what do you plan to do, what are you doing now, or what do you plan to do in the future?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, I, I want people to appreciate the value of scholastic training, particularly when it comes to the trades, as opposed to acquiring this skill in any other fashion, apprenticeship or whatever because that is what got me through. I was able to stand my grounds because I was trained by a professional person. He didn't--he didn't just show, he just didn't tell me how to do a thing, but he also explained to me why and I think this is very important. And when I compare my skill level, even with those of other black workmen that I was associated with in the beginning, my first job, I can see the difference. I was able to maneuver, to leave that one job and go to another job, work on a different level and so it's important, scholastic training I think is absolutely important and of course, I enjoy teaching. I get a satisfaction out of sharing and, and then this has really carried me through. Right now we're trying to get young people because tailoring itself is such a dying trade and we're trying to get youngsters into it, that's why on my flyers I have a, a line saying that seventeen to twenty-one may apply for a scholarship and I will give them free training.
Story_ID: 507385
Speaker 1: My name is [HistoryMaker] Marion Anderson and this is a picture of me with my daughter, Adriene [Adriene Anderson], and we--she's participating in a fashion show at Sterling High School [P.S. 85 Sterling High School; P.S. K753 School for Career Development, Brooklyn, New York] where I, where I as a teacher, would put on a fashion show every year and she would participate in that fashion show.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay, this is a, this is a picture of my three children, or three of my children I should say, the oldest boy Mark [Mark Anderson], and Marion Jr. [Marion Anderson, Jr.], and, and Ad- and Alva [Alva Anderson Weinberger].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is an article that appeared in the news on, on Sunday, nineteen seventy--
Speaker 2: Twenty-sixth, 1975, January 26th, 1975.
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-five [1975]. They, they did a thing on our school and it shows the principal and it shows me giving instructions to one of the students as we appear in the tailoring class.
Speaker 2: Now this is a picture of my father, William Anderson. I don't have an idea of when this was taken, but it's a picture of him.
Speaker 1: Now this is a picture of my mother, Ethel Anderson.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Do you know when the picture was taken?
Speaker 1: This was taken in Charleston [South Carolina], I'm sure and yes.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): At the bottom it says Korea.
Speaker 1: What happened is that they took an original photograph and it appears that's some company in Korea embellished it and mounted it on, on the form that we see.
Speaker 2: This picture shows three shots of my brother Fred Anderson, one, two of the shots shows when he was in the [U.S. military] service and the other two dressed as a civilian.
Speaker 1: This would be left?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Yeah, the way we look at it is this way, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): So, left to right.
Speaker 1: Left to right, okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Or right to left, it doesn't matter. Just say any way you want, say which way you're going.
Speaker 1: Just say which way you're going.
Speaker 2: Right to left.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, go ahead. So on the right? Go ahead. Who's on the right side in the pink?
Speaker 2: Okay, this--on the right side we have Audrey [Audrey Anderson] and next to Audrey is Marion Jr., next to Marion Jr. is Adriene, next to Adriene there's Mark and next to Mark is Alva, the four, or five children.
Speaker 1: This is a picture that was taken at one of the fashion shows at Sterling High School. It shows Adriene being helped by one of the, one of our students. Adriene must have been about eight years old at that time.
Speaker 2: These are irons used by my father; I had watched him press suits. While one iron is being used the other was on the stove being heated and the iron is quite heavy and it is the weight of the iron, the heat of the iron and the time spent on the fabric, that combination is what results in the, in the (unclear) pressing.
Story_ID: 507386
Speaker 1: What do you grow in your garden?
Speaker 2: Oh, different, different flowers, plants that are--come back every year and others that we have to grow, for example, the live forever is always there. The hostas, which you will find in the center, the, that huge plant, that, that comes back every year. And we--there are other plants that we have to plant, like gee-whiz, petunias, for example, we have to plant those every year, you know. The begonias we, we also will have to plant them, but if we want to save some of the begonias we can bring them in and keep them in the house, protect, that will protect them and, and, and after the winter's over we can put them back, back outside.
Speaker 1: And how much time do you spend in your garden?
Speaker 2: Oh plant, or just developing it, every chance I get. I like being out there, yeah, yes. The main plant is the impatiens; those are the red and whites that we have out there. We have to plant those every year. And someone asked me, they said, why don't you get a plant that will--and annuals that you don't have to plant--but I enjoy the effort to, to, to put the plants out. Other plants that, that will come back every year, are the lilies, they will come back every year.
Speaker 1: And when did you start gardening?
Speaker 2: When did I start? Oh, soon as--since I, I came--oh my mother [Ethel Anderson] was very much of a gardener.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, in the front of our country home we had all kinds of plants, including a fig tree.
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That you eat off of?
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm sure I did.
Speaker 1: Right, thank you.
Speaker 2: You are welcome.
