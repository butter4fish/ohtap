Speaker 2: My favorite food, actually I would like to say I just like good cuisine.  I like food well prepared with, with a little bit of a spicy touch, so--

I love you, Daniel, is like something I really love to hear myself say and love to feel.
Story_ID: 307439
Speaker 1: So we'll start.  We'll talk about your mother and your father, but separately as much as you know about them, but we'll start with your mother.  If you can state your mother's name and spell it out for me.
Speaker 2: My mother's maiden name is Yvette Mystal, M-Y-S-T-A-L.  My mother is seventy-eight years old, born October 6th, two--was it 1923, I bel- twenty, twenty--so that makes it.  You do the math.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She's seventy-eight in 2005.
Speaker 2: She's seventy-eight, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your mother is from--originally from Haiti.
Speaker 2: From, from Haiti, yes.
Speaker 1: What do you know about your mother's origins, her mother and father?
Speaker 2: I knew--I know somewhat about my mother's origins because it's very important to me.  I mean, we were--I was born in Haiti and my mother was born in a place called Anse-a-Veau [Haiti] near--
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for me?
Speaker 2: Anse, A-N-S-E, a, like the vowel a, Veau, V-E-A-U, Anse-a-Veau, and it, it was a--it was a countryside of, of, of Haiti and my mother was born on a farm.  Her father was a gentleman, gentleman by the name of Napoleon [Napoleon Mystal].  That was his name.  He was a big land owner and wound up I think producing about forty kids.  So my mother and--I think it was forty-nine to be exact.  My mother was the first batch of forty--for--within forty-nine kids.  So the thing that with my mother, she was born alongside about seven or eight other sisters that followed rapidly.  She was either third or fourth in, in line, and so she grew up in Anse-a-Veau and took care of the farm, lived with my, my, my father or my grandfather, and, and then ultimately when she was in her teens found a way to Port-au-Prince [Haiti], and Port-au-Prince was the capital of, of Haiti.
Speaker 1: But your--but your, your--Napoleon--
Speaker 2: Napoleon, yes.
Speaker 1: --was father of forty-nine children with one woman?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: No, no.  With, with probably a dozen.
Speaker 1: A dozen.  So he had--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --several wives.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He had several mistresses--
Speaker 1: Mistresses, okay.
Speaker 2: But only one wife.
Speaker 1: And his wife was your grand--your mother's mother?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: No.  My mother--my mother--what was interesting is back then in Haiti and in--particularly in, in the farming areas of Haiti was that if you--if a person were wealthy, if a man was wealthy enough, well he could have as many children as he wanted and then if he could care for them, which he could, they'd live with him.  So some of the ones that lived with him were the product of the marriage relationship and some of them were the product of other relationships.  And then in my mother's case, it was a product of another relationship that he had and, and so it produced my mother and, and one other sibling that my mother had, and that was about the size of it.
Speaker 1: So your, your mother and your mother's mother, your grandmother lived on the farm with Napoleon until your mother left and went to Port-au-Prince.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was living on this farm with his children, his mistresses, and his wife.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They were all living together.
Speaker 2: His, his, his wife more directly.  His mistresses were kind of scattered along in the--in--on, on the prop- because--
Speaker 1: It was huge property.
Speaker 2: --he, he owned about 100 acres of land.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: All right.  So he, he owned a small--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it's a small--
Speaker 1: Farm--yeah--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Town size--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: Village, basically.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What else do you know about--now was Napoleon black or white?
Speaker 2: Napoleon was black.
Speaker 1: What, what did he look like?
Speaker 2: He was a man of smaller stature--
Speaker 1: Dark skinned?  Light skinned?
Speaker 2: Dark, dark--darker skin--darker skin, not very, very dark, but dark skin, so--
Speaker 1: How did Napoleon--how did he amass his wealth?  How was he able to own a hundred acres?
Speaker 2: Some of which was inheritance because he grew--the family--now, these are good questions.  The, the family and his, his father before him was a farmer, a land owner, and I think my grandfather was raised in that kind of environment, made his own way, and ultimately acquired more land and that's how it happened.
Story_ID: 307440
Speaker 1: So once your mom [Yvette Mystal Gaston] arrived in Port-au-Prince [Haiti], what happened with her life (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She lived with her older sister and she was working I think in a factory.  My mother was never educated formally and so she was working in a factory and, and, you know, with, with her older sister, Philomene [Philomene Mystal], and Philomene is very relevant because she helped to, you know, find--help my mother find her way in, in Haiti.
Speaker 1: Can you spell Philomene's name?
Speaker 2: Philomene is P-H-I-L-O-M-E-N-E.  And so--
Speaker 1: Philomene was also the daughter of Napoleon [Napoleon Mystal].
Speaker 2: Of Napoleon, yes.
Speaker 1: So it was the two of them.
Speaker 2: The oldest daughter of Napoleon.
Speaker 1: The oldest daughter, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So your mother is the, the baby.
Speaker 2: My mother is probably fourth or fifth in, in, in--you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in that range.
Speaker 1: Her--your, your mother and your sister were--
Speaker 2: And her sister from--
Speaker 1: --and her sister were Napoleon's children?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So he only had two children that, that would, would--that you are connected to?  Let me--let me ex--
Speaker 2: Oh, like we're--
Speaker 1: Let me--let me understand it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So it was your mother and how many other siblings that were--
Speaker 2: On the fa--
Speaker 1: --products of Napoleon that, that are directly related to you.
Speaker 2: Directly related--
Speaker 1: I mean--
Speaker 2: --that were of the same mother and father?
Speaker 1: Of the same mother and father.
Speaker 2: I think two or three and Philomene's not one of 'em.
Speaker 1: Oh, and Philomene's not--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --one of them.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  So, Philomene is--all of these brothers and sisters consider each other brothers and sisters regardless (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.  That's the beauty of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Particularly the first group.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, because they were all--they were all raised together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so continue.  She was supportive--
Speaker 2: See, now you're reminding me of how much I don't know about this and, and need to know.  But it's a--it's very rich history.
Speaker 1: So, Philomene and your mother move to Port-au-Prince together (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --and they're working in a factory.  What type of factory?
Speaker 2: I think in, in my mother's case--yeah, I, I was--I'm not sure.  But she was basically a laborer in, in--you know, in Port-au-Prince.
Story_ID: 307441
Speaker 1: And your father?
Speaker 2: My father was from Port-au-Prince [Haiti] and his father was a gentleman by the name of Merion, M-E-R-I-O-N, Merion Gaston, and he had a lending business not unlike what we would call today like a loan shark except that there was no, you know, crime associated with it.  It was very legitimate, but he had that, so it was much more--you know, so they were more of the more sophisticated crowd.  And my father was--grew--when he was born lost his mother at, at birth.  My--Merion had about eighteen children and my father was, was his--my father's mother was his second marriage and then she died and then he married again, and then my father was partially raised by his--
Speaker 1: The third or fourth wife.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the third or--third wife.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so my father grew up in an environment where he didn't know his mother.  His fa- his fa- he was educated man.  He was sent to good schools in, in, in Port-au-Prince.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about his education.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Where did your father go to school?
Speaker 2: My father went to mostly Catholic school--Catholic schools, so it was a--
Speaker 1: Do you know the names of any of them?
Speaker 2: I believe he went to a school called theatre and--
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for me?
Speaker 2: T-H-E-A-T-R-E, and he also went to seminaire, both of which a--are, are religious schools.  So back then in, in Haiti, you don't have a university system per se, so most people who--and it's a French educational school system.  It's a French-based system, so they graduate and they go through what they call baccalaur- they do the baccalaureate, and so my father went all the way through that and then ultimately started to work with his father in the lending business, and then odds and ends.  He was a little bit of a political strategist, too.  I mean, he knew Duvalier [Francois Duvalier] before Duvalier was elected--was elected president in nineteen fifty, '57 [1957].  And so--and he knew other political candidates with whom, you know, he would have regular discourse and talk to them about the political strategy, et cetera.  So he was very much a, a thinker and a planner along those lines and he dabbled in pol--he loved it, that stuff.
Speaker 1: So where did your father live?  He lived in Port-au-Prince also?
Speaker 2: He lived in Port-au-Prince.
Speaker 1: And his lending business was in Port-au-Prince?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So what sort of--was he considered middle class?  Upper middle class?
Speaker 2: We--
Speaker 1: Working class?
Speaker 2: My father would've been considered middle class and, in fact, when he met my mother [Yvette Mystal Gaston], he met my mother--and my father by the way was like the, the sharpest dresser, you know, Humphrey Bogart, you know, revisited in, in Port-au-Prince (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did your father look like physically?
Speaker 2: My father was a, a more stocky, shorter version of what I would look like except, you know--yeah.
Speaker 1: So both of his parents were African.
Speaker 2: African, yes.  I think somewhere along--within either my mother's family tree or my father's, there were--you know, there was--if you go back one generation, there was somebody--somebody's--was white there.
Speaker 1: So your father was a very sharp dresser.
Speaker 2: Oh, sharp, classy man.
Speaker 1: Classy.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 307442
Speaker 1: That's how the circumstances that my mother [Yvette Mystal Gaston]--my mother fell for him [Gaston's father] was she saw, saw him, and he knew my mother--my mother's sister, and they knew that he had a reputation as a ladies' man and so they tried to keep my mother away from him.  But when they met, it was literally like love at first site.  And so they met and, and then, then didn't see each other for another year.  And then when they saw each other again, it was sort of like--and then, then the, the friendship and relationship ensued.  And back then, there were chap- such things as chaperones and, and things like that, so it took him a long time before he was able to really get my mother out dating and that sort of stuff.
Story_ID: 307443
Speaker 1: Any, yeah, legends in your family?  Were there any stories back like slavery stories or, or did you--or you ever shared any stories of, of old timers, people that you wouldn't have known but--you know, like your great-great grandad did this or great-great-great uncle did this.  Any stories like that in the family?
Speaker 2: Actually, I think that's a good question, Shawn [Shawn Wilson], and to be--I don't remember those stories.  And I, I have to tell you, it wasn't until I came to the United States that I, I found out that we were--we--you know, we were once slaves.  I don't remember that being in, you know--we might--we probably knew that slaves existed, but it was never in the context, in the vivid context that it's presented here where, you know--I mean, it's, it's a very real part of history here for African Americans and others.  But it wasn't so in Haiti, so there was never any emphasis on, you know, how we got to Haiti.  Because Haiti was very much the place we were from, you know, and, and I think that's an interesting--it's, it's, it's an inter- interesting in how it contrasts with my experience here.
Story_ID: 307444
Speaker 1: You were born.  Your mother [Yvette Mystal Gaston] and father became a couple, you were born, you were raised in Haiti.  What are your earliest memories of Haiti?
Speaker 2: Oh, paradise.  I can remember, you know, as a--
Speaker 1: Now, what years are we talking about?  Nineteen fifty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was born in 1957.
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven.
Speaker 2: I was born in 1957, so--
Speaker 1: So let's say in nineteen--
Speaker 2: --so 1960s--
Speaker 1: Early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Yeah, early '60s [1960s], start to remember.  I mean the--first of all, it's--back then, Haiti was actually a, a much better place, you know, to be.  It was--there were less problems and so I just remember schools, preschools.  I remember my first day in school.  I remember studying very, very hard.  I remember Sunday schools.  I used to love kites.  I remember playing in the backyard.  And, by the way, very small settings.  You know, 'cause we, we said middle class in Haiti.  You know, we didn't--we didn't--we didn't really have much, much, but I remember palm trees, vegetation, flowers.  I remember the taste of these sweets that we would have.  They called--they were called dous.  I remember tablet, which is like a--another kind of cookie slash, you know, what--whatever.  And--but the thing is, all the memories are so vivid and they're so full of happiness, and yet we didn't have a television, you know.  There was just one radio in the house.
Speaker 1: What do you remember listening to on that radio?
Speaker 2: Generally, my father's--my, my father was a guy that listened to a lot of news, news--political news and da, da, da, and French stations that we could get.  So that was it.  Not, not a lot of music.  Not a lot of music.  Some music, some, you know, Haitian Creole music.
Story_ID: 307445
Speaker 1: What were considered special events when?  We're still talking about when you were a kid.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean, was there was Christmas?  Thanksgiving?
Speaker 2: Christmas.  I still remember my first (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was Christmas like?
Speaker 2: Christmas was--there was--I don't remember--yeah, I think we had a Christmas tree, I think.  Okay, but Christmas was decorations, lights, the promise of Santa Claus, and, and, and toys.  And my father would--and I remember, remember--I remember distinctively when my father would write on the little card that's attached to the present and how, how closely it resembled my father's handwriting, and I would--I said this--I said, you know, Santa Claus has the same handwriting as my father.  And--but, you know, it was like the innocence of youth and, and, and all that it offers.  And so I, I can remember those vividly.  And I grew up with three sisters, so the--I remember playing with them and I remember being the only boy and always seeking out, you know, other little boys to play with and that sort of stuff.
Speaker 1: What is--what is a traditional sort of French holiday that you would've celebrated that we necessarily wouldn't have celebrated as African Americans here?  I mean, you, you did Christmas, Thanksgiving, was it very much like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We didn't do Thanksgiving.
Speaker 1: Oh, you didn't do Thanks--
Speaker 2: We don't--no, we--that, that was irrelevant in Haiti (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, right, right.  Okay.  So no Thanksgiving.
Speaker 2: No Thanksgiving.
Speaker 1: What about Easter?
Speaker 2: Well because--I was just--because it's Christian based, because as you know Haiti was a former colony of France, so when it--so the--there's a su- a super imposition of, you know, the, the various religious traditions that would necessarily be considered Western, in the Christian based traditions.  And so we were--we grew up Catholic so, you know, the--I, I was confirmed--I was confirmed--I was baptized, I was confirmed, but I remember Easter was a big, big deal.  Christmas was a big deal.  Mardi Gras was a big deal which is not Christian based but it's another big event throughout the year.
Speaker 1: And what is the--I mean, it escapes my thought.  What is the essence of Mardi Gras?  It is--tell me.
Speaker 2: Celebration.
Speaker 1: It's a celebration of what?
Speaker 2: Celebration, culture, folklore.
Speaker 1: Folklore, but what's the folk--it's based on what?
Speaker 2: It's based on--what's--it--it's--well, it's called Fat Tuesday, right?  Mardi Gras is Fat Tuesday, so a very similar tradition to what--Mardi Gras here.
Speaker 1: And it has to do with you giving up something for Lent and then this is the day--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: Mardi--Mardi Gras is all about celebration.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's all about partying.  It's carnival.  That's what it's all about.  It's carnival, the--what do you call that?  You know, when they--you know, West Indian Carnival here?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: It's very similar, so they call it Mardi Gras.  And so it was a--it was a--it was a big deal.  And I can remember, you know, we, we weren't allowed to go there per se, but you could hear the music and the bands and everybody else and, and so that was a big, big deal in Haiti, Mardi Gras.
Story_ID: 307446
Speaker 1: What other big holidays or events that you can think of or even if you can explain for me like the daily life and what was daily life like in Haiti for you as a child?  Did you wake up?  Did you have chores on a farm?  Did you--
Speaker 2: No, daily life was very--for us was structured.  I think probably education occupied 70 percent of our time.
Speaker 1: Even during the summer?
Speaker 2: During the summertime was something different.  Then, we were allowed to play.  My father would take us for day trips, et cetera.  That was--that was a different deal.  But--
Speaker 1: Daily life was 70 percent (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Daily life was 70 percent schooling.  I was--I was--I had as an objective that I had to be either first to fifth in my class.  So, for example, class size--
Speaker 1: Who imposed the objective on you?  You did?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: For me.  And the class size by the way was about sixty-two kids.  So you're talking--that's a high bar.  So I had to--in order for my father to reward me with, "Oh, you're doing really well," da, da, da, I had to be top three out of sixty-two, you know?  And, you know, that occurred quite a bit.  And so, so for us, there was an emphasis placed on that and there was emphasis placed on family, family meals, et cetera.  And as I think about it and really those were very important in terms--kinds of practices as it--because it shaped, I think, our values and who we are, and even I think held together when we got to Haiti--when we got to the United States.
Speaker 1: First grade, what was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: My, my school's name was Frere Andre, Frere Andre [Ecole Frere Andre, Port-au-Prince, Haiti].
Speaker 1: You're gonna have to spell that for us.
Speaker 2: Frere like F-R-E-R-E, Andre, A-E-N--A-N-D-R-E.  And I still remember the first day of school and, and, and, and--
Speaker 1: Talk about the first day of school.
Speaker 2: Jesuits were tough.
Speaker 1: They--
Speaker 2: I'm talking about from--
Speaker 1: They--could they provide great education (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From day one, you start feeling the, the whip or the ruler, and we learned how to write with an ink well.  So it was basically, you know, and then, then you couldn't--you couldn't have an ink spot on your paper or else you, you would--you would be--you know, it would be the ruler on the knuckles kind of deal.  So it was very strict, you know, French educational system.
Speaker 1: Which means what to you?
Speaker 2: Strict means that--
Speaker 1: No, I mean French educational system.
Speaker 2: Well, which--basically which is the, the traditions of the--of, of the French system, which means you--that you, you have elementaire, preparatoire, moyen.  The same kind of grade system that exists and you--in some cases, you would use the same books.  So we weren't--we learned--the first book we learned with was 'La Lecture Courante' ['La Lecture Courante et Le Francais'] which was all in French, which is a series of short stories that kind of--that all had some kind of life lesson and some of which I remember by heart, you know, still today.
Speaker 1: What are some--what were--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, 'Respectons les infirme' which was about being good to the disabled, 'Enforce reconcilier' you have to--you have to make up, 'Le Souhait (unclear)' which was about the, the unfortunate dream, wishing that you had something that you--you know, wishing that you had something more than you had but then you find out what you had is all that you needed.  So it--it's just a lot of life's lessons.  'La Bonne Vache' 'The Good Cow' and et cetera, et cetera.  There was just a number of them.  So, my father used to read them to us and--so, literacy which interestingly enough is what--you know, we're, we're focused on here at the Verizon Foundation, literacy is--was a real foundation for me growing up in Haiti.
Story_ID: 307447
Speaker 1: So first grade [at Ecole Frere Andre, Port-au-Prince, Haiti], you were talking about you remembered the first day of school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was so important?  Why, why do you remember the first day?
Speaker 2: Okay, so I remember--I remember my father took me and then left me (laughter).  And so all of a sudden I was by myself amongst many other kids and, and I was in a little uniform in, in a very structured setting, and sitting in class and having to learn and absorb and just, you know, Frere, Frere Jean [ph.], was--Jean was the name of our teacher, and just remembering how imposing a figure he was, maybe even more so than my dad even, but, but imposing figure.  And then--you know, and then the, the requirement to learn and sit--you know, sit and learn was very powerful for me.
Speaker 1: And what year did you attend first grade?
Speaker 2: I'd have to go back--
Speaker 1: And calculate it, yeah.
Speaker 2: --and calculate, so--
Speaker 1: You must've been six (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was about six years old, yeah.
Speaker 1: So like sixty--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were born in '57 [1957].
Speaker 2: Seven, yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So, '63 [1963]?
Speaker 1: Sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that's '63 [1963], first grade.  Like between the first and fourth grade.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In the early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you two things.  In that time, who was important to you?  Who did you look up to as role models?  We'll start there.  As far as teachers, were there teachers or people in the community?  Who were--who at that time were making impressions on you?
Speaker 2: The teachers.  Because the teachers in, in--the model in Haiti is that the teacher is the most important person in your world at that time.  You have to be accountable.  He has the power to reward, to punish, both I think emotionally and physically, so that you have to pay attention.  And so--and the teachers all had this unique thing about them.  There was always like, oh, this guy, this is what he does.  This is his mode of operation and this is why you have to fear him and you have to do your homework.  So every teacher as I can remember had a very, very powerful impact.  And of course at home, there was my father.  He was definitely the presence, you know?
Story_ID: 307448
Speaker 1: What did you wanna be at that time?
Speaker 2: I wanted to just be--I wanted to be successful in school [at Ecole Frere Andre, Port-au-Prince, Haiti]
Speaker 1: What did you hope to be as an adult at that time?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't think I thought much.  I mean, going--if I can go back that far, I don't think I thought much about becoming an adult and then becoming successful.  I just thought about doing well in school and then, you know, when we have recreation or whether it's playing with my friends and, you know, and what that--what comes with that.  My father used to read to us about just a variety of things, whether they'd be, you know, zoo animals or wild animals or planes and automobiles or politicians or world history, et cetera.  So I think I was exposed to enough to say, you know, to create this sort of image that, wow, this is--you know, it'd be interesting to go and be Tarzan in the jungle or things like that, but I really didn't get very specific about, you know, professionally what I wanted to accomplish when I was that young I don't think.

Speaker 1: At what age did you move to the United States?  You said, I think nine--
Speaker 2: That was 1967.
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven [1967], okay.
Speaker 2: The caveat here is that my mother [Yvette Mystal Gaston] moved here before we did--
Speaker 1: And why was that?
Speaker 2: --in, in 1965.  My mother was a little bit about the instigator for us to come to the United States.  My fath- my mother thought that we could get to a better place 'cause she was struggling.  And my father, by the way, it should be noted also had children out of wedlock and wound up having children with four different women.  So he had four with my mother, four with another woman who's name is Ann [ph.], one with one other woman, and one with an--one with another.  So, so it was--my father's situation was a little complex which--
Speaker 1: But he was married to your mother?
Speaker 2: He was married to my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so we really never knew--we didn't really know who these--the other kids were except for the case of Ann and so we had met their families, and my father would sneak us there and have us visit and sit down and eat as a family and--
Speaker 1: With the other children?
Speaker 2: With the other children.  But not enough so that we really grew up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Knew them.
Speaker 2: --and got comfortable and knew each other.  So my father was a little bit attached to Haiti.  He was educated in Haiti and he saw himself as, you know, living in Haiti for the remainder.  My mother, you know, was a person who was much more of a risk taker, wanted to see what Haiti--the United States offered, had had friends of hers who had come to Haiti--to the United States, and one of which--one of whom, Marie Therese Came.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for me?
Speaker 2: Marie, M-A-R-I-E, Therese, T-H-E-R-E-S-E, Came, C-A-M-E, offered to sponsor her.  Now, the nature of the sponsorship is that they would go out and they would find a family for whom to work as a domestic.  So basically Marie Therese was working as a domestic and found another affluent family that was willing to support my mother, the Kenzer [ph.] family, and so they then offered to sponsor my mother.  My mother then, I guess, agreed with my father and I think reluctantly--my father reluctantly agreed to let my mother go.  My mother came, she was thirty-seven years old at the time in 1965, and began to work as a domestic.
Story_ID: 307012
Speaker 1: --Mom [Yvette Mystal Gaston] was sponsored and she came here in '65 [1965], so it was very difficult.  'Cause my, my youngest sister was about three years old or two or three years old, and then the oldest who is Marie [Marie Gaston (ph.)], Marie (unclear), is--was one year older than me at the time.  And so when my mother left, it was 1965, I was seven, Marie was eight, Monique [Monique Gaston (ph.)] was five, and Tina [Tina Gaston (ph.)] was two, Tina was two, so very young children.  My mother was, by, by the way, a very engaging mother, although working very hard in Haiti, now is, is off to, to the United States.
Speaker 2: Where in the United States?
Speaker 1: In Cambridge--she went to Boston, Massachusetts.  And when she got there, she worked for the Kenzers [ph.] and she worked as a, you know, a--
Speaker 2: A nanny, a domestic and a nanny (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A domestic and a nanny.  And so she took care of the family.  She took care of everything.
Speaker 2: And she took care of their children as well.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And she was getting paid forty dollars a week and then wound up then--she decided to--she started to work a second job which I believe was at a place called the Algonquin Club [The Algonquin Club of Boston] in Boston, Massachusetts, and was working that job, and so was able to accumulate enough savings so that in two years she sent for us, for the entire family, for my father and our three sisters, my three sisters.
Speaker 2: What was your father doing with you guys in Haiti at that time?  Do you remember your mother being away?
Speaker 1: Yes, I do.
Speaker 2: Do you remember being told that she was in the United States?
Speaker 1: It meant--we missed her tremendously, but it meant that we--it would--we would have more opportunity as a family.  And every--of course every month, my moth- my mother would send us a check and--the, the money order.  And we would look at the, the envelope and we would be anticipating it because it was gonna feed us, it was gonna send us to school, it was gonna clothe us.  My father was working on and off for the department of public works [Ministry of Public Works, Transportation and Communications] in a--in a--in a--in a desk type, type job but not enough to take care of his nine children.
Speaker 2: So he wasn't doing the lending business anymore.
Speaker 1: No, he was not doing the lending business.  My fath- my [paternal] grandfather [Merion Gaston] had been--was deceased at the time and everything else, so that was not what he was doing.  He was really taking care of the family.
Speaker 2: He was a home dad, yeah.
Speaker 1: He was--he was a, a stay--a stay at home dad.  And so, so, but we knew that my mother was in, in, in the United States and we knew it was for a very good reason.  We missed her and so when--in 1967 was the year that we were all prepared to go to the United States, and that was the year that I got on a plane for the first time, that I wore long pants for the first time.  And it was April of 1967 when we--when we took the American Airlines flight to, to New York [New York] and then from New York to Boston to meet my mother.
Story_ID: 307013
Speaker 1: What did you think of Boston [Massachusetts] when you arrived?
Speaker 2: I thought it was just the most fascinating place.  I mean, it's--we're--I was coming from a place where the tallest building I'd ever seen was maybe about seven stories to a place where now I'm in the big city and then my mother [Yvette Mystal Gaston] came to greet us.  I just thought it was literally like metro- the, the great metropol- metropolis.  So it was fascinating experience.  And it was literally like being, being in a modern day Disney World because we had never experienced anything that breathtaking, that modern, that big.
Speaker 1: What street did you live on?
Speaker 2: We lived--the first street--we lived on a street in Somerville, Massachusetts, called Malvern Avenue.  My mother was able to get a three, three bedroom or two bedroom place on Malvern Avenue where we would live.  It's a--it was a two-family house and we had the first floor.  And that's where we lived.  And we didn't speak a word of English.  You know, we had never seen anybody white in our lives.  Everything was fascinating.  And it was just--it was all discovery.  And so we, we got--we got there in April, so we weren't able to go to school right away.  So we got there in April and so between April and September, we spent, you know, listening to records--
Speaker 1: English records.
Speaker 2: English records, watching television, which taught us--basically started acclimating us to the English language.
Speaker 1: So the Jesuits didn't teach you English as a second language in Haiti?
Speaker 2: Oh, in Haiti?  No, no.  It was all French.
Speaker 1: So your dad spoke no English.
Speaker 2: My dad spoke no English.
Speaker 1: Well, how did your mom fare when, when she came over?  She didn't speak any English, correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Well, mom is mom.  So mom is a survivor and mom will find a way, and so she found a way.  So within a few months--I mean, her English never was that good, but she was a communicator.  She knew how to get along.  She was a hard worker and she was able to do it.  So when we got here, so my mother had been paying her dues for two years, and now my--it was my father's turn to start to work.  She--he couldn't find a professional job because he didn't speak English, couldn't find a, a--not only that, but didn't have a law degree or a doctorate or anything like that, so basically it was like what do you do?  Well, he had to work in an assembly line.  Well, that lasted about eight months (laughter) because back then, if you remember, 1967, '68 [1968], this was like at the height of the Civil Rights Movement, so there were a lot of chal- there was--a black man in this country would experience a lot of challenges, things that I wouldn't even dream--I mean I can't even dream of today, my father was experiencing in a--in 1967, '68 [1968].  Now, the problem with that, with my father and the challenge for him was that he, he, he had too much pride.  He had just enough education not to wanna do assembly line type work.  He had commitments in Haiti and he just never could make the transition here to the United States.  I mean, it was--I remember my father would say proudly if somebody came to visit once we were in the United States after quite some time, somebody'd come visit, let's say, you do--you do, Shawn.  You go, "Hi, Mr. Gaston."  He goes, "I don't speak English."  And he seemed to take pride like--it was like a, you know, something that he took pride in.  And I'm like, it didn't help, though, in terms of, you know, our opportunities for survival here in the United States, so, you know, it put a lot of burden on my mother.
Story_ID: 307014
Speaker 1: You said something before that I wanted to just visit for a moment again.  You said when you arrived in Boston [Massachusetts], that was the first time you'd seen a white person.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What did you think about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fascinating.
Speaker 1: What was fascinating about it?
Speaker 2: Fascinating.  Well, first of all, I--the hair more so than the color because, you know, we, we, we have thicker hair and so I was always fascinated--I remember even like when we started going to school and then we started meeting other little white kids that they could go like this, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I thought it was--I thought it was fascinating.  I'm like, okay, this is pretty cool.  I wanna be able to do that.  And--but I got, got over that quickly.  So it wasn't really like I wanted to be white per se, but it was just that I was fascinated with some of that stuff.  And, and we didn't even know about color distinctions until, you know, the, the--
Speaker 1: Until when?
Speaker 2: Until we got to the United States and started experiencing life in the United States.
Speaker 1: Everyone in Haiti was black--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that you'd seen.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You had not seen a white person.
Speaker 2: Except on--except at the movies.
Speaker 1: Except at the movies.  So you knew that white people existed.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so when you arrived in Boston and you saw white people--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you were fascinated by 'em.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: When did you become aware that there--that black people were fighting for civil rights, to be equal to white people?  When was that apparent to you?
Speaker 2: Well because if you remember--Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy (RFK)] was assassinated in 1968, I believe, right?  And I can remember that the whole thing was televised, the funeral, et cetera, the life of the Kennedys, and, and in school learning about the legacy of JFK [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] and the legacy of RFK.  You know, you, you knew that it was attached to a, a large movement around, you know, the equality and fairness for, for, for blacks in America.  So the more that we were--we became aware of that, that, that history and those stories, the more we started relating to, you know, the experience of being--of being a victim to a certain degree and, and, and the notion of inequality.  The other phenomena is that, you know, and the probably much more painful experience was being in school and being called nigger or, or names of such, and all of a sudden being made aware through the way that you're being treated that you were different, and so that was difficult to take.
Speaker 1: Because in Haiti, you were just ordinary (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was just Patrick Gaston [HistoryMaker Patrick R. Gaston].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Patrick Gaston.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And here you were--so how did you--how did you relate to, to being a victim or, or what--let me see what I'm trying to say.  You said you started to relate to this--to being black or being discriminated against.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  That's probably a better word than being a victim--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so I, I think that's probably--that--that's a better choice of word.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that, that was your word.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How did that--like, what was happening in your head, though, to, to count--or to say but it was different than--but I'm French.  I'm not--I mean, did you give up the fact that you were French and, and you accept that, okay, I'm a black American now.  I'm not French anymore.
Speaker 2: You know, it wasn't--we weren't in a place where we could intellectualize this very--I mean, it was sort of like an emotional gut reaction.  I can tell you that I never fell for it.  You know, I--for whatever reason, whether it was because of the fact that I grew up in Haiti amongst--you know, where I was--it was never an issue, whether it was because of the rich, I think, values that were taught to us or the love that we were given earlier on, it was just never, never true to me that, you know, oh, you are--I am a nigger or--it was never true to me.  It never rang true so I never really spent a lot of time on sort of trying to understand why that occurred.  I just sort of--you just went on and, you know, you kind of brushed it off and life goes on.  So it didn't really harm my ego's structure very much at all nor did it make me want to hate or, you know, or anything like that.  It didn't trigger I, I think--the, the only thing some--sometimes that it triggered was sadness, you know, because I was not being accepted.
Story_ID: 307015
Speaker 1: What was school life like for you here in the states?  You started in what grade?  Fourth grade (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I started in, in the fourth grade and school life was very much trying to understand--learn English the first year and then make friends and be part of the, the system in the classrooms and be accepted.
Speaker 1: Were--now were you seen as like an exotic black kid because you obviously early on had a French accent, I would imagine.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Or maybe not.
Speaker 2: There was always that one person who found you exotic.  In my case, it was Lisa Fornier [ph.] (laughter).  But I don't think the other kids found us exotic.  And there were a couple of other black kids I think some of whom had--were--you know, had Haitian descent.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's what I wanted--that's great.  I'm glad you said that.  Were there other Haitians in Boston [Massachusetts] at the time?  Was there a community of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: So you could survive in a Haitian community in Boston.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  My father's entire--
Speaker 1: Your father did.
Speaker 2: --you know--
Speaker 1: Existence was Haitian.
Speaker 2: --was, was Haitian.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we--he had Haitian friends that played dominoes.  And in, in the earlier stage--years, you know, the first three or four years of being here, he actually did make an attempt at being here and developed--and, and to develop a lifestyle here that maybe he was comfortable with.  So we'd--there were social gatherings of Haitians, et cetera, and, you know, so, yes, we did have those experiences.  But for us, the kids, we had friends all over the place.
Speaker 1: Of course.
Speaker 2: So we weren't really caught up in that, you know, sort of preserving that Haitian experience.  We had friends who were, you know, white, who were black, you know, et cetera.
Speaker 1: So when you--when you--when your--when your father came to the states, can you remember like the Haitian gatherings like in Boston?  Like was there a barbershop that he went to or were, were there--did people come--like, what was this--what was the Haitian community in Boston like in the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Well, in--I can speak for, you know, the, the community that we were 'cause it was much bigger than us.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean, there was a much larger Haitian community, but we became friends with those that were in the Cambridge [Massachusetts], Somerville [Massachusetts] area, friends of friends of friends, so probably about a--you know, critical mass of about 30, 40 people that were part of my father's networks.  My--we never really went to sort of the bigger events that involved the Haitian community.  I just don't think the Haitian community was necessarily that, you know, sort of--
Speaker 1: They were immigrants so they were trying to assimilate.
Speaker 2: So they were dispersed--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and if they, they found out about each other.  Then, that was great and they became part of that network, but, but by and large, it was a smaller subgroup of, of a larger group and I think that kept my father from, you know, completely--you know, from going back the very first year.
Story_ID: 307016
Speaker 1: When you became affluent [sic.] in English and--fluent in English, and you go into high school, what was life like for you in high school?  Where did you go to--or junior high school?
Speaker 2: Well, my experience in junior high and high school was a little bit different because what, what happened was, when I was just about to go into eighth grade, my, my, my mother [Yvette Mystal Gaston] had decided that she had had enough of the, the American experience for me because I was starting to--she said, oh, you started hanging out with this person and that person, you're starting to walk funny, you start to tip, and start to wear hats and everything else.  You're becoming, you know, some, some--somebody like, you know, that I can't--I can't understand.
Speaker 1: But what did she call you?  You're becoming--
Speaker 2: Like a black American, right?  She goes, you're becoming like a black--and if you remember being a black American back then was sort of like, you know--
Speaker 1: An afro--
Speaker 2: --an afro, the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) or braids.
Speaker 2: --braid--that, that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: The thing--yeah, black--okay.
Speaker 2: You know, so all the stereotypes.  So, so her, her issue was, well, I--and, and she--we were growing up in very much I think lower middle class, you know, conditions in the United States, and so that's the--that--that's the environment that you're in as, as protective of my--as my parents wanted to be, that's just the way it was.  So she said, well, you're gonna go to Montreal, Canada.  You're gonna go back to a French educational school system and then that's that.  And (laughter), and so I--that's what happened.  And so I wound up--and my three sisters continued to live in, in, in Cambridge [Massachusetts] and, et cetera, go to school there.  I was sent to Montreal to a boarding school and, and French school system called College Laval [Laval, Canada] in 1969, I believe it was, '69 [1969], '70 [1970].  And so now, it was, again, just another transformation--transformational experience that I, I can't even--you know, I mean, begin to describe.
Speaker 1: But you were still, now you were probably the only black kid in Montreal (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was the only black kid.  Yeah, I was the only black kid in that school.
Speaker 1: And you spoke French.
Speaker 2: Eight hundred boys, one black boy, me.  So, the first six months, I--all I did was fight for my life.
Speaker 1: Why?  Why was that?
Speaker 2: Kids didn't understand, you know, the--first of all, they hadn't seen black people, so, so I would get picked on, I would get challenged.  I'm supposed to be--they think I was supposed to run like [HistoryMaker] Gale Sayers.  I was supposed to be fast in track and everything else.  And so the--I would say the first three or four months were very, very difficult because all I did--you know, I didn't know anything, right?  All I knew was I landed here and I'm supposed to be going to school and all, all I'm doing is--and then now I'm back into a French system after having been--learning in a English system, you know, the, the previous three years.  So it was very difficult.  So I mean, you know, basically I had to get into these fisticuffs and assert myself, et cetera.  And I think that the beauty of this is after three or four months of fighting everybody, ultimately I was--sort of like I became the most popular kid in school.  And I didn't have a place to go on weekends 'cause my parents lived in the United States, so the kids would invite me over to their, their homes.  I learned how to play hockey.  I learned how to horseback ride, ski--skimobile.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Et cetera.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 307017
Speaker 1: At this point, you had sort of--you'd immersed yourself into a white French culture.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you were getting an experience [at College Laval, Laval, Canada] that you perhaps wouldn't get from white kids in Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But you'd learned about sort of the struggles of black people in the Unites States and you'd spent those years here during the height of the Civil Rights Movement.  So you knew on some level or you had these feelings that people may perceive black people as being second-class citizens as they did in the United States.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you go to France [sic.] and you learn all of--what impact did these white events like hockey--not necessarily that they're white, but these experiences have on you having come from the United States where you were considered or fighting to just be a first-class citizen?
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  Well, I think that it had the effect of helping me to even--to accept people who were different and, and, and to be able to be flexible enough within an environment to go with the flow and to play--to play hockey.  And it was--and hockey is still today one of my favorite sports.  I love hockey.  And I still love Montreal [Canada].  It's one of my favorite cities in the whole world.  And so I think it had the effect of making me, frankly, like it and embrace it.  And so--and the experience was very rich for me and so I--so--I mean, you contrast that with the United--with the experience in the United States, I think in Canada, there was just much less what I call hate.  It was not a hateful culture.  So the fact that I was different was not necessarily always--it was, was not perceived as bad, you know?  And I think what I--what, what--the, the contrast in, in, in the United States is that, you know, it was--it--I, I think it had more negative overtones.
Speaker 1: So your mother [Yvette Mystal Gaston] has succeeded in, in a funny way, I just wanna say, of making sure you didn't become a black American.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, and, and, and, by the way, and, you know, the word black American and of course, you know, I think I need to talk about that because I think and my mother knows this, that we stand on the shoulders of, of, of black African Americans.  So I think when she put it in that context, when she used the term black American, I think what she was doing was saying, you know, what's bad about--what, what, what black Americans are stereotyped as being, right?  Because the truth of it is, we wouldn't be here, my mother wouldn't be here without, you know, the hard work and the sacrifices of, you know, African Americans and black Americans.  So today, I think what she's done and I think she's succeeded in making I think a more complete human being out of me so that it's much more difficult to sort of say, well, Patrick [HistoryMaker Patrick R. Gaston] is a black American or he's a Haitian American.  I think I am truly a citizen of the world and somebody who thinks, you know, that broadly about issues and, you know, the complexities of the human spirit.
Story_ID: 307018
Speaker 1: So did you graduate boarding school and--
Speaker 2: No, I wound up going to boarding school as an experiment, worked for a year, and then my mother [Yvette Mystal Gaston] thought, well, you know--
Speaker 1: Worked for a year?
Speaker 2: Worked for a year because I didn't stay at College Laval [Laval, Canada] beyond that.  I went to College Francais [Montreal, Canada] after that.  Because my moth- the, the idea of not having a place to go on weekends was a real issue, right?  So we couldn't--that, that model was not working.  Most of the--all the kids, their parents were there.  For me, I had to stay in the boarding school on weekends or else find a place to go.  So then my mother was able to find a guardian for me, a friend of a friend who had already had two other kids living with 'em so then I--and who were Haitians going through the same experience, (unclear) and, and his sister, Chantal [ph.].
Speaker 1: Now, were they from Boston [Massachusetts] area?
Speaker 2: They were from Boston and they had known my mother and we had known them from, from, from Boston and they were sent to Canada for the same experience and now we were all together going to College Francais.  So that was much better for me because now I had--you know, I had somebody--someone who was--shared experiences and so it was--it was--it was a little--a little bit of a change.  But College Francais was very much the French educational system and, you know, mostly white school.
Speaker 1: So I--what year did you graduate high school--
Speaker 2: I graduated (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) or boarding school?
Speaker 2: --in 1976.
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-six [1976] and you do what?  You come--but, okay, you--I guess during that time, you must have some idea of what you want to do after high school.
Speaker 2: My, my mother wanted me to be a doctor and so, therefore, I wanted to be a doctor.  But I--but somehow I knew that was not my calling, but I wanted to do it to--you know, I wanted to do something to please my mother.  So when I came back from Canada, I had--from Montreal [Canada], I had--I went to a place called--a school called Matignon High School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and went there for six months and then finished my degree 'cause I came back before finishing the degree in Montreal, so I went back into a school system which was now in English in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and finished the degree there.  And then, then I got my high school--my high school degree.  As I remember it, I wanted to be a child psychologist.  That was my thing.  Because I believe in children.  And, and I've always--I've always loved kids even when I was a kid, you know, so I thought I was gonna be a child psychologist.  And then when I came out of high school, I wound up working for the Gaebler's unit [Gaebler Children's Center] at Metropolitan Hospital [Metropolitan State Hospital, Waltham, Massachusetts] and it was a, a unit for children who were emotionally disturbed, et cetera, to start to get a feel for that practice, and so that's--that was kind of like the experience.
Story_ID: 307019
Speaker 1: How did you decide to go to the University of Massachusetts [University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: By necessity.  I started going to--my first year out of high school [Matignon High School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] was--well, after the Gaebler's unit [Gaebler Children's Center, Waltham, Massachusetts], I stopped doing that and then I wanted to go to school now and go and study psychology, went to Northeastern University [Boston, Massachusetts].  But I was working--I had to work to put myself through school.  Northeastern University was expensive, so I couldn't afford it.  So after a year of going to Northeastern, I wound up working another year at the Kennedy memorial school for children.
Speaker 1: What did you do there?
Speaker 2: I was a child counselor, what they call a milieu therapist.
Speaker 1: And what were some of the--what were some of the things kids came in to talk about?
Speaker 2: Well, the kids by and large came in with generally behavioral problems, self-esteem issues, et cetera, that causes them to have problems in school, so they come here as a place where they can, you know, sort of be part of a behavioral modification approach to doing things both in physical activities and reading and writing, et cetera, et cetera, so I was just one of the counselors, teachers there to, to, to assist in doing that.  And so that's--
Speaker 1: You did that for a year.
Speaker 2: For a year.
Speaker 1: You went back to Northwestern?
Speaker 2: And then I, I--
Speaker 1: Or Northeastern?
Speaker 2: I, I didn't go back to Northeastern.  I went to Boston State College [Boston, Massachusetts] 'cause that I could afford, 'cause I think it was about a, you know, a couple hundred dollars a, a semester.  And then I was--as I was do--as I was doing that and I would--you know, the experiences I had because I had to work is I would work and then stop and go to school, work, stop, and go to school.  And so as I started Boston State College, all of a sudden--I think I was about twenty-one years old at the time, twenty or twenty-one, and, and all--I don't know what happened, but all of the sudden I said to myself, I really wanna be somebody.  I started to think much more purposeful and I said--I started to think--I said Boston State College is a state college, it's viewed as a community college.  I gotta get outta here and go to a university.  So then that's when I started thinking about the University of Massachusetts and then ultimately went to the University of Massachusetts.  Then, I, I started also thinking, geesh, you know, I really would like to explore business 'cause I think I could do well at it and I wanna be somebody that's important in business.  And so I decided to study business and, and, and right around that time, too, I had like a six, eight months' timeframe where I worked in corporate America for a company that's a subsidiary of Colgate-Palmolive [Colgate-Palmolive Company] called Kendell Corporation [The Kendall Company], and the nuances of that environment intrigued me because it was almost like--I, I guess, I don't--I'm, I'm, I'm not--
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: I'm gonna try not to psychoanalyze myself, but--
Speaker 1: No, but go ahead.  It was almost like.
Speaker 2: But it--it was similar to like when, when I landed in boarding school [College Laval, Laval, Canada] or in Montreal, Canada, or any place where I was different and made to feel different where I felt like I can work within this system and, and be successful, you know?  So I said to myself--you know, I, I didn't take corporate America very seriously and I'd walk in late, I was young, et cetera, and--but something said to me, you know, these guys were all wearing suits and ties, and I--you know, and they were running things and they're flying here and every--I said, I can do what they're doing.  And so, anyways, that experience sort of made me much more intrigued with the corporate world and the business environment.  And so when I wound up, you know, back at school at UMass, then I--then I knew--I, I said okay, I want a business degree.  I wanted to be focused on marketing and I started, you know, playing--placing much more emphasis on this.  And then--and then I got a part-time job that I was doing--I had to, to get up at about five in the morning to make it to The Boston Globe at seven a.m. in the morning.  I was working for a guy by the name of Tom Winship [Thomas Winship] at the time who was the editor in chief of The Boston Globe.  I was his office assistant and--
Speaker 1: What year is this?
Speaker 2: This was 19--let me see, I graduated from UMass in 1984.  It was probably 1981, 1981.  And, and Winship really liked me, you know.  We--he took a liking to me and, of course, I thought he was great.  And then he came up to me and he asked me if I wanted to write one day.  He says, "Do you wanna write, Patrick [HistoryMaker Patrick R. Gaston]?"  Of course he could've made it happen.  I mean, that would've totally changed my, my path in life and I said, "No, Tom, I wanna be a businessman (laughter)."  Now, after that--immediately after I said that, I said am I nuts?  This guy just offered me a job to be a writer for The Boston Globe.  And so--but in any case, I just sort of followed my instincts and said, okay, I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna get my, my degree in business and then--and be successful at it and then--and then after that, I'm gonna get a business type job and, and, and be successful.
Story_ID: 307020
Speaker 1: You were completing the story at The Boston Globe.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I, I forget exactly where, where I was with that.
Speaker 1: You--well, we'll just take it back a little.  He said--you says, "No, Tom [Thomas Winship], I'm, I'm going to be--"
Speaker 2: Yeah, I said--I told--I said, Tom, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I wanna be a businessman.
Speaker 2: "I wanna be a businessman.  I don't wanna be a writer."  And so--you know, and by the way--and I think the, the thing is, the opportunity to write for The Boston Globe is a huge opportunity and I didn't have anything else to show for it but my--you know, I didn't have anything else in contrast except going to school so, and working for Tom.  But something said to me, stick with your guns.  Go to school and get your business degree, which I did.  So when I finished--you know, I graduated in 1984, one of the things I'd always wanted to do was go live and work in Paris [France] which--and, and I remember I was up for this job and I was interviewed for Carol Remick who was the director of our student office, right, at, at UMass [University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, Massachusetts], you know, said to me you should apply for this job and it was a group called International Weekends.  And so I said, okay, I'll apply for the job.  I applied and I said, I'll probably not have a chance on earth, and I applied for this job and I wanted it so bad to be working in Paris, oh.  You know, at the--at, at twenty-three, twenty-four years of age and then eventually I got the job.  So I wound up in Paris as the tour director for International Weekends, lived in Montparnasse, the Montparnasse Hotel, which is now the Meridien [Le Meridien Montparnasse; Pullman Paris Montparnasse, Paris, France] and, and just went about doing my thing in Paris--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --for eight months, which was fascinating, fascinating.  I thought I'd never come back.  Of course, you know, I, I had to come back.  A couple of things, though, about that experience, is back then I was traveling, I had--I, I was still--I still had Haitian citizenship.  So and go--in traveling through Europe, particularly Switzerland when--they would scrutinize my passport a whole lot more.  I mean, do--if you had a--an American passport, you just go right by.  And in my case, you know, they would make a stink out of my Haitian passport.  And I said--I was thinking, I said, you know what, I--when I get back to the United States, I need to become naturalized.  I need to get--to become a citizen.  And so, you know, after eight months of that experience, I had an opportunity to go to--because the way International Weekends was, is you would do six to eight months there, then you go six to eight months there and et cetera, and that becomes your career.  And I was thinking, I said to myself, you know, this is not much of a career.  I mean, I'm not gonna go, go to the Caribbean.  It may seem like a wonderful lifestyle, but I wanna start my career in earnest, so then that's when I came back to the United States.
Story_ID: 307021
Speaker 1: Going back just a little bit.  What type of a student were you at UMass [University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: I think I was probably a B student, you know?  I think--and I--and I make no excuses for that but I was a B student and, you know, I think with work and everything else that was going on in my life, I think, you know--
Speaker 1: What type of a student were you at--in--at the boarding school [College Laval, Laval, Canada] in--
Speaker 2: I was--in high school, I was a B type student.
Speaker 1: What type of friend to people were you?
Speaker 2: I was a very, very good friend, very loyal and, and, and almost always, you know, the center of attraction and popular.
Speaker 1: What made you popular during this time?
Speaker 2: I think I had a, a good sense of humor.  I made people feel comfortable when I was around them.  I, I always had something to say.  I was a good conversationalist and, you know, it was--it was a whole lot of that.  I--
Speaker 1: Did you--go ahead.
Speaker 2: I also think I was a very, very loyal friend.  I think one particular story was, like when I first came to the United--with--came to the United States, we started going to school, elementary school, and there was a little white kid.  His name was Andre Forten [ph.] who was being picked on all the time.  Now, imagine of all the people that he would have as a bodyguard, I became his protector.  And all the--I mean I'm, I'm another guy who's like targeted, right?  Black kid at school.  But I was protecting Andre Forten.  Why?  Because I thought it was the right thing to do.  I, I don't like to see and even back then humans suffering.  I don't like to see injustice.  And, you know, and that's the way it played out whenever I was--as, as a kid.  Whenever I had a chance to have--to fight, it was always because it was something unfair, either unfairness towards me or unfairness towards somebody else who bullies or whatever.  So, so--you know, that's kind of was my approach.
Speaker 1: Did you play any sports?
Speaker 2: I played basketball.
Speaker 1: You were a basketball--
Speaker 2: I played hockey.
Speaker 1: Hockey.
Speaker 2: I played--
Speaker 1: On the school teams, I mean?
Speaker 2: On the school--
Speaker 1: Any, like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In high school?  No, I was not on--
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But you did all of these sports additionally.
Speaker 2: I did all these sports, yeah.
Story_ID: 307022
Speaker 1: What happened with your father during this time?
Speaker 2: My father in the early '70s [1970s] decided that he was no longer going to live in the United States full-time.  So then he decided that he was gonna go back in Haiti and live a portion of the time in Haiti, six months out of the year 'cause he couldn't take the winter in the United States, and then come back in the spring and summertime, nice deal.  So he did that for a while.  He also suffered from hypertension.  And so during that time that he was in Haiti, I think that his lifestyle was not as healthy as it needed to be, and so he stopped taking his medications and then wound up suffering a stroke when he was about fifty-five.  So that then left him partially paralyzed on his left side and so the following twenty years of his life was, you know, with that disability.
Speaker 1: And then he lived in Haiti the remainder (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He lived in Haiti--no, he still came back.
Speaker 1: Oh, he did, back and forth.
Speaker 2: He would still--yeah, he would still--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --come back to, to the United States.
Story_ID: 307023
Speaker 1: When you decided that you were not going to do the International Weekends, that you needed a real career, where did--what happened?  And this is 1984?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-four [1984].
Speaker 1: What happens next?
Speaker 2: Well, I come back to the, the United States and I start--
Speaker 1: And you also decide you're gonna become a citizen.
Speaker 2: Right.  I decided I'm gonna be--become--so I start that process right away.  Then I start to look for work that's more like a, a career management job with major corporations.
Speaker 1: And who were the major corporations you were looking at?
Speaker 2: I was looking at Digital company [Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)], American Airlines [American Airlines Group, Inc.].  I looked at New England Telephone [New England Telephone and Telegraph Company; Verizon Communications, Inc.] which eventually hired me.  I looked at Chase Manhattan Bank [JPMorgan Chase & Co.].  I looked--I mean--so I had a lot--Procter and Gamble.  I had a lot of interviews, some of which went well.  Some of it didn't go well, et cetera, et cetera.  But I was determined, so it took me about six months 'cause I went back to living with my mother [Yvette Mystal Gaston] and I'm like, here's this guy, high flyer, came back from Paris [France].  Now I'm having to, you know, stay with mom for a while until I get my, you know, my feet planted on the ground.  So ultimately, I had two job offers when it--when, when it all happened.  One was from New England Telephone, which is one of the pred- the predecessor company to Verizon [Verizon Communications, Inc.], and then the other one was with Digital Equipment Corporation, DEC, if you remember DEC way back when.  And DEC was in Maynard [Massachusetts] and New England Telephone was in downtown Boston [Massachusetts] on Summer Street, the, the--where I would have the job.  And I wanted to be able to dress up in a suit and tie and go downtown and be a business man, and then New England Telephone was offering a thousand dollars more 'cause they started you at I think 21,000 [dollars] and then the DEC--the, the, the DEC offer was 19,800 dollars.  That's what it was.  And so I--so I decided--I picked New England Telephone and so the, the--that started my twenty-one year career at, at New England Telephone--at, at New England Telephone, which became NYNEX [NYNEX Corporation], which became Bell Atlantic [Bell Atlantic Corporation], which became Verizon.
Speaker 1: So you started as what, nineteen eighty--
Speaker 2: I started as an assistant manager and, and as a customer point of contact in nineteen--1984, April of 1984.
Speaker 1: And, and what did that job entail?
Speaker 2: More or less dealing with, with what we call long distance customers who were trying to purchase access to our network so that they could build their network and their telecommunication system and com- and either compete with us or provide phone service.
Story_ID: 307024
Speaker 1: What else was--now this is nineteen eighty--
Speaker 2: Four.
Speaker 1: Eighty-four [1984].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What other things were happening in the outside world that concerned you in '84 [1984]?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see, in 1984, what was the environment.  I think Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] was the president, right?
Speaker 1: Reagan was the president.
Speaker 2: Reagan was the president in 1984.  What else was going on in the, in--I don't know that there was anything in particular in the outside world.  I have to say that in terms of like, you know, social consciousness, I mean there are certain things that, you know, obviously the issues around fairness and equality always were of concern to me, but I don't--there, there was nothing, you know, specific in 1984.  I think once I got into the company, then I became aware of, you know, just totally different sets of opportunities and challenges that, that resided within, you know, the company and within--you know, within, within the industry--
Speaker 1: So how did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) within the business world.
Speaker 1: You--I'm sorry, it was a twenty-year ride--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to get to Manhattan [New York, New York], the thirty-second floor, wherever we are.  So how did all of that transpire?  Nineteen eighty-four [1984], you start with New England Telephone [New England Telephone and Telegraph Company; Verizon Communications, Inc.]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in downtown Boston [Massachusetts] as a representative.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You worked in that position for how long?
Speaker 2: For a year.  Then, I became a billing supervisor.
Speaker 1: And what was a billing supervisor?
Speaker 2: I was basically supervising service reps whose job was, was to interface with very large carriers and, and account--explain their bill, change their bill, make it right, collect--you know, collections, et cetera, et cetera.  So I was responsible for about I would say 80 million dollars' worth of, you know, revenues.  So--
Speaker 1: Did you--at this point, were you feeling like the businessman you had hoped to feel like?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No.  I felt that I was in an entry level job doing something that I hope to God I don't have to do for the rest of my career, but--you know, because the thing is, when I--when I came in, I looked around and the place I was working--and there weren't many faces like me.  And I was used to being different, but in this case, you know, it seemed as though there was no one that was really interested in my career interests, my career goals, et cetera, et cetera.  So it became--I felt as--a little bit like, you know, in certain times--at times that I didn't belong and I felt challenged and I felt like, you know, it was not necessarily the most supportive place.  You know, people had their own agendas and, and, and so it was difficult for me to start to, to, to feel comfortable in that environment.  You know, I think I was much more--I came from a formal place, that, that environment like was a culture that was like, you know, sort of good 'ole boys, everybody's friend, da, da, da, da.  But I just didn't feel, so I was like--you know, what's your name?  Patrick Gaston [HistoryMaker Patrick R. Gaston].  Well why can't we call you Pat?  Well, you can't.  You can call me Patrick.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And so I think in some cases, I was a little bit inexperienced and had had some measure of difficulty finding myself within that culture.  And it was a culture that was more or less made up and run by, you know, white Irish males in, in the early--earlier stages of, you know, what I now call, you know, the, the, the history of our--our history as Verizon or at least a portion of that history, the one that resided in New England.  And then, you know, New England itself as you know is pretty--is, is a different culture, pretty conservative culture itself.  So, so it was--it was tough the first couple of years.  So I couldn't--I couldn't tell you for sure where I would wind up.  I just knew in my heart that I could do bigger things, you know?  I knew that I could do bigger things and I never gave up that belief.
Story_ID: 307025
Speaker 1: And then during the course of many, many jobs at the same level, no promotions but always different opportunities, you know, I had--I had some setbacks with, with where, where I was in a job where, you know, somebody might've thought, oh, his performance is so-so, well he's too focused on promotion or da, da, da.  But I just--you know, I persevered.  I think--I don't know, my mother's [Yvette Mystal Gaston] textbook about perseverance, I just believed in myself and I--and I persevered.  And I made the right friendships too.  There were people like David Wilson who, who was one of the guys that started this organization within New England Telephone [New England Telephone and Telegraph Company; Verizon Communications, Inc.] called the Minority Management Association.
Speaker 2: What year did he start that organization?
Speaker 1: He started it--it was started before I joined, so I think that was started about '92 [1992]--1982 or '83 [1983].  But it made it possible to begin to identify and provide an opportunity for blacks and other minorities who were in the enterprise that were isolated, didn't think they belong, and then provided them with an opportunity to network, to meet people, and to build, you know, relationships, and then to get more confidence around what it is that they do, and to know that other people might've had those experiences.  So I mentioned his name because he was a real, you know, supporter as was, you know, people like Brendon Healy [ph.] and other folks because I became involved in things that were outside of my normal work like, for example, diversity seminars that I would attend and would have conversations with senior managers who were--
Speaker 2: About what?
Speaker 1: About developmental issues, the experience of being black in the corporate world.
Speaker 2: What was the experience of being black in the corporate world?
Speaker 1: Very much--I think if you're--if you're black then, you know, it's one where you don't feel like you have opportunity, where you might be stereotyped, where once given those opportunities, you might not be--get the right level of support, all of the things that, frankly, are things that need to happen in order to be successful in corporate America or any place because, you know, we never--we never--we don't get here alone.  We don't--I mean, I'm the head of a foundation, but unless I have the support of my CEO, my boss, my colleagues, my peers, you know, I'm not gonna--I'm not gonna be successful, so the idea is to help us to better understand how to, you know, at least the man--this, this organization was trying to address some of those things.
Speaker 2: So you attend seminars and diversity groups, so you took it upon yourself to seek out I guess these diversity groups or individuals, people that you thought would help you survive in this--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --corporate environment.  What was your next step?  You did several of these--when did you receive a promotion that meant something to you that meant that you were going to become the person you wanted to be?
Speaker 1: Okay.  I--that's, that's a good one.  Well, when--that occurred in nineteen--and I even remember that it occurred in 1991, '92 [1992], and there was a job opening at our training center, and it was a promotion.  It was what they call an associated director, whatever, or staff director job.  And it, it involved teaching, you know, management, leadership, communication skills, to the employee base.  So it was, was like literally, you're a super thinker, so you get put out to this wonderful center where now you espouse your, your knowledge and you teach folks.  And, and I remember I went for that job and made all the calls I needed to make, you know, I interviewed well with the job and got the job.  And that was like such a big deal for me because it said okay, well, there is opportunity to move up.  You know, you--this is a great job, you're gonna learn from it.  You're gonna be able to teach others.  And the idea of teaching is something that I always have liked.  And so I got to doing that job and, and it was just fascinating.  I had the chance to learn about organizational development and things that I think really have continued to benefit me inside the corporation.
Speaker 2: Who are some of the people that you met on that job that made a difference in life?
Speaker 1: Deanna Riley [ph.].  Deanna Riley.  And, and she was my boss.  She was a director and I was a staff director.  But for some reason or another, Deanna had--her DNA was like she immediately believes that her job is about developing you to become a better person and a better manager; that's her instincts.  And when you run up--when you run into somebody like that, you know, take full advantage of it because they, you know, they--they're just wonderful and they're supportive and they're helpful.  And so Deanna was just a person that comes to mind that was extremely helpful in that regard.  And, and the other guy was Dave Wilson who I mentioned earlier (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Continued to--
Speaker 1: But he had a role in HR [human resources] and was watching me, you know, peripherally as to what was going on with me and then I stayed at that job for about three years.
Story_ID: 307026
Speaker 1: What point, I mean, in Verizon's history are we at now?  We said early on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) NYNEX [NYNEX Corporation; Verizon Communications, Inc.].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: We're at NYNEX now.
Speaker 1: Nynex.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So the name had gone from--
Speaker 2: New England Telephone [New England Telephone and Telegraph Company; Verizon Communications, Inc.] to NYNEX.  So we're now NYNEX which is basically the combined companies of New York Telephone [New York Telephone Company; Verizon Communications, Inc.] and New England Telephone together.
Speaker 1: Now, do you know why that came about?
Speaker 2: Oh, the, the, the merger of the two?
Speaker 1: The merger of those two?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the--I think in order to, to, to answer that, you gotta go back and--you know, if you remember, AT&T [AT&T, Inc.] was broken up into pieces, right, because of anti-trust issues and, and that sort of stuff.  So they broke them up into what they call regional Bell operating companies.  So these regional Bell operating companies had to operate independent of the parent company, which was AT&T, and AT&T was sort of--continued to be AT&T but had to spin off the regional companies, which then took on a life of themselves and became, became separate companies.  So as they matured and as they were able to demonstrate to the regulators that they were not being anti-competitive with regards to providing access to the local network, then there was, you know, some flexibility to do more, so that's how New York and New England came together to form a larger interest, which covered the northeast, and so that, that was the rationale.
Speaker 1: So they had started to rebuild AT&T--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --the same way that they (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's your conclusion.
Speaker 1: So they--so what point--what role had this--how had--I mean, I, I wanna talk about diversity--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at this point.  Had it changed from what it had been when they were at New England?  When they became NYNEX?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Because--
Speaker 1: Were they--were there outreach programs?  Where were they in their development of diversity?
Speaker 2: Right.  So basically you saw a maturing minority management association, right?
Speaker 1: At New England.
Speaker 2: At New England, which is now--also involved New York--New York, right?  So it took life inside the corporation.  You also saw the emergence of the Hispanic support organization of the Asian focus groups, so you had a number of ethnic groups within the company that felt it--that wanted to help the corporation along and, and, and understanding how to fully utilize and embrace its minority employees.  So then I think it became--you started developing--you started seeing more women at the middle management level, moving up as a consequence of much of what was put in place by the--by, by these movements inside the company.  And then at this--at the most senior level, you started to see more enlightened leadership.  So, you know, that's how--
Speaker 1: What's enlightened leadership?
Speaker 2: I think leadership that looks at sort of--at, at corporate responsibility in a broader context that looks at, you know, what our relationship is to our communities, that looks at its employee base and wants to make sure that we have a quality of life--of work life inside the corporation that is, is good for, for, frankly, all of its employees and that embraces values that were very much espoused by a lot of the folks that help to promote the Civil Rights Movement.  So, for example, that can mean Ivan [Ivan Seidenberg], our CEO, I believe he's a child of--somewhat a child of the '60s [1960s]; he's fifty-eight years old.  You know, so you had a number of those players start to move up the hierarchy that began to listen and pay attention and care about some of these issues.  And so then you started to see a--I, I think there was really a transformation inside the corporation where we went from folks who were--initially were reluctant to do this and to folks that inside the company that were embracing that kind of change.
Story_ID: 307027
Speaker 1: So you did your training job for three years.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What followed that?  And now we're in 1988?
Speaker 2: No, for three (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, that was '92 [1992].
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it was--
Speaker 1: So now '96 [1996].
Speaker 2: About ninety--we're ninety--ninety-four [1994].  It was '91 [1991]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ninety-four [1994].  So '94 [1994], the training job is getting a little stale.  It's time for me if I'm gonna have a career, right?  I'm like in my early thirties, so if I'm gonna have a career, it's time for me to do something, and because nobody's achieved--ever, ever become CEO by sitting in a training job for a long time, which I was reminded of often.  At that point I was--
Speaker 1: Who?  By whom?
Speaker 2: By, David Wilson, other folks, you know, Brendon Healy [ph.].  I mean--the, the--
Speaker 1: So people wanted you to--people were pushing you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in a direction.
Speaker 2: Yeah, to say--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, you--that's not what you wanna do the rest of your career, then, you know, you need to--at that point, I was really at a turning point in the training job at the tail end because I was thinking that I had enough skill base in terms of organizational development and training and development that I could go out and do it on my own.  So I was thinking really hard about that.  Right around that time, too, by the way, is I started--in, in 1989, thereabouts, I forgot to mention, I started going to school at nighttime to get my advanced degree, my M.B.A.  I went to Northeastern University [Boston, Massachusetts].  So that took me three and a half years.  So right about '92 [1992] or so, you know, I was graduating with my master's degree and then I'm starting to think, okay, I've got my M.B.A. now, I've got this stuff under my belt, I think I know this stuff, I'm doing well at it, you know, I can contin- and I can be a consultant, you know, in the open market for this kind of stuff.  And I started to develop some, some confidence, and I was a pretty good trainer by the way.  So--and then in '93 [1993], you know, this opportunity came up because this is--this was another part of the transformation of the company [NYNEX Corporation; Verizon Communications, Inc.].  This opportunity came up to be part of what they call a process re-engineering team.  This was a team that was assigned to, if you will, re-engineer the company from how it does business, looking at all the--all the operations, all the marketing, all the HR [human resources], every single function, looking at it soup to nuts, ensuring that, that, you know, there is a strategic alignment, making sure that you're taking inefficiencies out of the business.  It was a huge undertaking.  And there were probably about three hundred people or so, were selected to be part of that.  So I got to be a part of it, not on a promotion but I thought it was a good opportunity.
Story_ID: 307028
Speaker 1: But, let me just backtrack a second.
Speaker 2: Okay, do it.
Speaker 1: In '92 [1992] when I was doing training and development [at NYNEX Corporation; Verizon Communications, Inc.], a couple of people came through my class.  I used to teach a diversity at work class.  A woman by the name of Suzanne Geyer [ph.] who was back then an executive director in our government affairs office in Washington, D.C.  Suzanne Geyer came through the class with another guy by the name of Cal Carrington, and I was like, oh, I have flyers from D.C. in my class, oh my goodness.  It was such a big deal so that I had them in the class.  And I was like--and then after the first day, she said to me, "You know," she goes, "you're pretty good."  She goes, "Why aren't you in D.C.?"  I go--.  "I want you in our government affairs office."  I was like--to me, that was kind of like saying to me, why aren't you in--you know, why aren't you the president of the world?  I mean, it was a really--I mean, the--if the chances of doing that was like miniscule.  So I said to her, "Well, you know, I said I don't think I have, you know, these opportunities.  You know, other people get these opportunities; I don't."  She goes, "Well, you know, if there's a job that ever comes up in D.C., I'll let you, I'll let you know."  I said, "Oh, fine, you know.  Oh, good."
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So that was the end of that.  So anyways, fast track to '93 [1993], now I'm embarking on a different job, process re-engineering, and it is brutal.  You're working fifteen, twenty hours a day, you're traveling to New York.  I mean, it was--I, I had just bought a home.  My first home I just bought in Watertown, Massachusetts.
Speaker 2: Were you married at this time?
Speaker 1: I was not married--
Speaker 2: No, you've only been married for two years.
Speaker 1: --at the time.  I had a girlfriend--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --by the name of Sheryl, who--Sheryl Williams [ph.], who eventually passed away from breast cancer, but she was my girlfriend at the time and I was going back and forth.  And, and it was a brutal job.  And, and, and at the end of it, I was like, well, you know, after a year, I said, well, you know, where am I gonna go from here?  I'm in this job that's really demanding a lot of my times, it's a short-lived job 'cause it's a process re-engineering initiative.  It's not a specific--you know, so it's gonna end.  I've gotta start to think about--so I went back thinking about consulting and everything else.  And just as I was in that place, I got a call from a guy in Washington, D.C., saying to me that they had a job as a director of strategic alliances, which is--you know, in, in our government affairs office in Washington, D.C., and that Suzanne Geyer told them about me.  They've already identified their last four candidates, but she said to interview me because, because it might be worth the while.  So she--I said, okay, great.  He says, well, let's first start with a phone discussion, so I had a phone discussion with him.  And then--and then--
Speaker 2: What did you talk about on the phone?
Speaker 1: I think--
Speaker 2: Do you remember?
Speaker 1: We talk--I talked about what I knew, obviously what I had done, you know, my, my, my career--my--in my career, why I thought it prepared me for the next job opportunity in my--in--that might avail itself.  And then--but the thing is, I wanted to on the phone connect with this person as a person--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --as an individual.  And I was like, I said, Patrick [HistoryMaker Patrick R. Gaston], if he gets to know you as an individual, if he knows your heart and soul, you, you have a chance.  So then I said--so at the end--'cause he was asking me questions about public policy, which I had no clue about, right, 'cause I had never been in those jobs.  So I said I don't know how, how--you know, I don't know much about public policy, Mike, I said, but I can tell you that you will find no one better in this job than me.  I said I know.  I said, so you--we--you--I, I would just ask to meet you and have a conversation face to face.  So he said okay.  And so--you know, flew to Washington, D.C., had a conversation face to face, and I immediately became one of the three can--final candidates, and then eventually it was, you know, one candidate and everything else.  And I had to interview with a range of people, one of whom was a, a gentleman by the name of Tom Tockey [ph.] and Tom runs this entire organization and reports to the chairman.  And so that, that was a defining time in my career.  And so because it then landed me in Washington, D.C., which was in my--such a wonderfully rich experience to land in D.C. as somebody who was this kid from Haiti, and here I am in D.C. working with these high flyers that are dealing--members of [U.S.] Congress, dealing with the president, dealing with this and that, and within weeks and, and months, I was meeting like everybody in the country--
Story_ID: 307029
Speaker 1: Mr. Gaston [HistoryMaker Patrick R. Gaston] goes to Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 2: So now, Shawn [Shawn Wilson], I get to D.C., and it's the most--
Speaker 1: What year is it, though?
Speaker 2: This is 1995.
Speaker 1: Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] is president.
Speaker 2: Clinton is president.  It's April of 1995.  I get to D.C. and, and, and I'm living in a corporate apartment the first couple of months and I feel like, okay, I'm becoming an executive.
Speaker 1: But let me ask--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --before you go on.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You have become a citizen at this point.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So not only do you go to Washington, you go as a citizen.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So now you--from Haiti, you're a citizen (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I'm a citizen--
Speaker 1: --in Washington.
Speaker 2: --naturalized.
Speaker 1: Natural--
Speaker 2: Things are falling into place.
Speaker 1: You're in this corporate apartment.
Speaker 2: Right.  And I'm in a corporate apartment and I start my job which was a, a job what they call a strategic alliances director [for NYNEX Corporation; Verizon Communications, Inc.], which involves building relationships with organizations like the National Urban League, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], the AARP [American Association of Retired Persons], the National Education Association, just a range of major national organizations that are thought leaders in their specific areas.  The--most of the job focus, it was a combination of emphasis on diversity, right, and, and emphasis on public policy development through those relationships.  So what I needed to do is understand our, our public policy positions much like any lobbyist would, but rather than to--you know, rather than to lobby [U.S.] Congress--
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you--
Speaker 2: --I would work with these organizations.
Speaker 1: You'd work with those--what was your public policy?  What did you learn that you can share with me about what your public policy was as it related to the NAACP, the Urban League?
Speaker 2: Most of these groups were interested in two things, the elimination of the, the digital divide and universal service.  So--and those two things are addressed in the Telecommunications Act of [Communications Act of 1934]--where we would hope would be addressed in the body of the Telecommunications Act [Telecommunications Act of 1996].  Back then, there were some--we were trying to get a major rewrite of the Telecommunications Act--
Speaker 1: What does it say (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) by Congress.
Speaker 1: --and what did you want it to say?
Speaker 2: Well, we wanted it to be much more to provide us with a greater opportunity to deploy our services, to offer products and services without being regulated.  We wanted a construct that looked at universal service and, and looked at that funding mechanism and said, well, who else should be providing into the fund and who should that fund go to?  People like the NAACP and the National Urban League and those organizations were very interested in the deployment of advanced telecommunication services like DSL [digital subscriber line], for example, or telephone service to minority populations.  And so there were construct of the laws as it existed, it was a very antiquated model, which really didn't allow us we thought the full opportunity to get out these services to those communities.
Story_ID: 307030
Speaker 1: When was that Telecommunications Act [Telecommunications Act of 1996] written?
Speaker 2: Rewritten in '96 [1996].
Speaker 1: In '96 [1996], and the original [Communications Act of 1934]?
Speaker 2: The original was 1934.  But the campaign, what we realized it was like basically--in Washington, D.C., when I got there, there was literally a ten-year campaign being waged to rewrite the laws because it really was--they, they were very antiquated.  They, they didn't fit--they didn't even address the Internet, and who knew that the Internet was going to exist back in 1934?  So they didn't address the Internet, access to it, what the responsibilities of different companies would be versus the responsibilities of incumbent, you know, carriers like we were, and then the notion that we were a monopoly was very much an antiquated model based on these old laws and they needed to--these laws needed to catch up with the reality of the marketplace.
Speaker 1: How did these laws affect--how did these laws affect, affect minorities, the 1934 act versus the '96 [1996] act?  Was there a difference in the way minorities would be perceived or reached out to?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--yes there would be in terms of the requirement that we deploy advanced telecommunication services to all communities.  So, you know, the, the '96 [1996] act had those provisions that said that, you know, we needed to get services to these communities and make sure that we do it within a timeframe.  The other major thing, too, was something called the E-Rate [Schools and Libraries Program], okay.  And I don't know if you're familiar with that, but it was basically discounts, deep discounts that schools and libraries were provided on--for telecommunication services.  So for example, so you had inner city schools, et cetera, that didn't have Internet access, that didn't have the right infrastructure tele- and telecommunications that could now get these things at a discount and draw from this--at a different rate and draw from this subsidy that was created by the FCC [Federal Communications Commission].  So, so that was in itself, was a major change in how things were done.  And then you just had much more enlightened companies like ours who saw this as a market opportunity (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And how did--
Speaker 2: --to, to get services out there to the underserved.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: How did your company [NYNEX Corporation; Verizon Communications, Inc.] see this as an opportunity?  I mean, and even you as--how did you see it as an opportunity because it was your job to go out and--
Speaker 2: Well, I think if we--I mean, the basic thing is if we ignore 40 percent of our marketplace, then we ignore 40 percent of, 40 percent of revenue potential.  We view--no matter who you are whether you're black, white, poor, rich, whatever it is, that you're in fact a worthy customer.  So if we can get the services out--services out to you, we will.  The other thing--the other thing that was going on is that there was a re- there was a re- the requirements in place that we resell our network at very deep, deep discounts, so it, it, it was a problem with regards to deploying DSL [digital subscriber line], so if we deploy DSL, that means that we have to offer at our competitors--to our competitors at, at a deep discount.  So that, that--you know, that, frankly was incenting us to do more of this.  So we view it as a market opportunity.  We view it as a--as a way of being a good corporate citizen.  We view it as a--you know, I mean, it's just the right thing to do to, to get this out.  But I think eliminating those road blocks--this was a great deal of work in Washington, D.C., to get enlightened organizations like the National Urban League, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], LCCR [Leadership Conference on Civil Rights; The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights], disability organizations, educational organizations engaged in that debate.  And so once that happened, I think--you know, it yielded ultimately a change in the laws in 1996 and a rewrite of the telecommunications laws.  But when I got to Washington, D.C., much of that was the big thing.  You know, it was--so, so the angle that the National Urban League and a lot of the minority organizations were looking at as was eliminating the digital divide.  So I said, okay, I think that's important.  Now, the other thing is and I felt as, as an import--as a good--an ambassador because, you know, how many--how many times, like--how, how much do you know, for example, of telecom policy, right?  And the average individual African American doesn't but yet it impacts you, it does.  You know, it's--in a sense, it's not unlike civil rights laws, it's not unlike, you know, who--like the debates over who gets elected to the [U.S.] Supreme Court that are much more sensational, but at a very basic level, if we don't have a construct around policy where we can get services out to people, that they understand what they are and that--and informed organizations are going out in their communities and making sure that there's access and making sure that we're making people literate in technology and communications, et cetera, then what we wind up is, we wind up with, you know, the--an exacerbated situation with regards to the digital divide.  And so I've al--I always felt we, we were coming from a place where we were doing the right thing, and I believe we are.
Story_ID: 307031
Speaker 1: So we--I was doing that in, in '95 [1995].  I was--I held the governor's group--or the national governors were under my responsibility, Republican governors, Democratic governors.
Speaker 2: When you say they were under your responsibility, what did you have to do to reach them or to serve them or to--how were they on your radar?
Speaker 1: Right.  For example, the National Governors Association has a range of issues that it looks like in the area--looks at in the area of healthcare, education, technology planning, telecommunications, commerce, et cetera.  My job was to basically monitor what's going on, go to the meetings that they would have, and then take copious notes and make sure that, you know, my folks inside the company [NYNEX Corporation; Verizon Communications, Inc.] knew about things that mattered--that, that mattered that would influence our business decisions and our decisions around policies.
Speaker 2: What were some of those things that mattered that would influence your business decisions and policies?
Speaker 1: Well, in the area of telecom, I, I think--you know, I mentioned a few, but I think that, you know, obviously in the area of, of, of commerce and telecommunications, if the governors were going a certain way with regards to legislation that we're trying to pass, we would--we, we needed to be aware of that and for, for what reason.  So if it--
Speaker 2: And if they were not going the way you wanted them to go, what would happen?
Speaker 1: Well, we would need to make sure that we had a chance to have somebody like Tom Tockey [ph.], our senior leaders come in, and talk to the governors.  So part of my job was to provide also a forum, a platform for our executives to come and talk to some of these governors and their staffs.
Speaker 2: So that was a big job.
Speaker 1: It was a huge job for a guy that just landed in Washington, D.C.  So--and, and in--so then in '95 [1995] when I got the job, I remember distinctively--this is a--I was horseback riding with Governor Mel Carnahan and a couple of other people out in Aspen, Colorado, and then--that was the weekend that my father died.  And so it, it--it's sombering because here I was with like now the biggest job that I've ever had, you know, in my career, and then I got a call later on that day that my father was sick and he was in Haiti at the time, and he had potentially suffered another stroke.  My mother [Yvette Mystal Gaston] was not being very clear about what was going on.  I said, "Well, do I need to fly back right away?"  And she said, "Oh, no, no, you know, there's not much you can do but, you know, you need to know that."  And so the following day when I got back to my--I flew back on Sunday, I got back--got back to my office on Monday morning and I got a call from my sister, Monique [Monique Gaston (ph.)], who was in Haiti at the time, telling me that my father died.  So I, I say that because, you know, it's kind of interesting the way life is, you know?  You just--for one moment you have it all and in the other moment, you know, you realize that, you know, what, what, what I really would've liked would've been to, to be with my father by his bedside when he died.  So that occurred in, in June--June 12th of 1995.
Story_ID: 307032
Speaker 1: How long did you stay on this job?
Speaker 2: I stayed on this job--
Speaker 1: And what was the title again, the exact title of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Director of strategic alliances.  I stayed on this job for about a year and then a promotional opportunity came calling--
Speaker 1: Again?
Speaker 2: Again.
Speaker 1: After only a year?
Speaker 2: After a year, in New York [New York] to help launch our entry into long distance.  So back then, which reminds me, that was another major element of the--of the law [Communications Act of 1934; Telecommunications Act of 1996] that we were trying to get rewritten was to be allowed to provide long distance service.  So isn't it interesting as I was trying to get the policies changed?  All of a sudden now I have a chance to become the assistant vice president of operations for our entry into long distance out of region.  We weren't allowed to provide long distance service within our region, within New York and New England, Maine and, you know, the--but we were allowed to do it in Arizona and California.
Speaker 1: But at this point, were they--were they Nextel [sic.]?  I mean--or--what was it?
Speaker 2: Back then it was AT&T [AT&T, Inc.], MCI [MCI Communications Corp.; Verizon Communications, Inc.], Sprint [Sprint Corporation].
Speaker 1: But the company Verizon was not Verizon then.  What--
Speaker 2: We were--we were NYNEX [NYNEX Corporation; Verizon Communications, Inc.] still.
Speaker 1: NYNEX still.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We were still NYNEX.  And then--and then I went--I went to do that for a year in--for a year in New York.
Speaker 1: So you came to New York for a year.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yep.
Speaker 1: And you did--and this is '96 [1996].
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, exactly.  And then I was the AVP of operations for NYNEX long distance.  And I installed the first NYNEX long distance line in Arizona and talked on the first line--long distance line.  And my boss at the time was Kelly Bloss [Kelly C. Bloss] and who's no longer--who is retired from the company, but she, she was there.  That was a--that was a fun job, a lot of autonomy.  And then right around the time--that time, the tail end of '96 [1996] is when we started--we merge with Bell Atlantic [Bell Atlantic Corporation; Verizon Communications, Inc.], so NYNEX merged with Bell Atlantic to form Bell Atlantic.  And so then the conditions started to change and the players started to change, and the job wasn't really as much fun and et cetera, et cetera, because there was just a lot of people doing some of the similar jobs, and when that happens, then people have to go.  So I knew that I needed to go do--find something else to do, so--
Speaker 1: Why did you not want to stay in Washington [D.C.] and do that job?  Because it seemed like such a great job.
Speaker 2: Oh, the strategic alliances job?
Speaker 1: The--yeah, director.
Speaker 2: Because I was looking for a promotion.  I, I wanted a promotion.  And--
Speaker 1: And the job to start up the long distance was a promotion over the strategic (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: Director of strategic--
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 307033
Speaker 1: What's interesting, is then, the guy who headed up the long distance company--I mean, the guy who headed up strategic alliances [at Verizon Communications, Inc.] and who I reported to got a job, was getting a job working in--as the president of our--of New Hampshire, so then his job became open.  So I called Tom Tockey [ph.] and there were, again, a whole bunch of candidates for it.  I said, "I'm your guy.  I wanna come back and run this group.  You know, you take a chance on me."  He's like--and then eventually I got that job.  So I went back now to run the group, all of strategic alliances and all the directors that have the various segments, et cetera, et cetera, so I went back to Washington, D.C.
Speaker 2: After having spent the year in New York [New York]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you went back to head up all of the--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --directors of strategic--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And what was the title of that job?
Speaker 1: It was executive director of strategic alliances.
Speaker 2: And how was that different from being--how did that differ from the job you'd done two years earlier?
Speaker 1: Honestly, it was less fun.  You know, it was less fun because all of a sudden I had--you know, I had to--I had to be accountable for people, budgets, et cetera.  When I was doing the job as a director, you know, I could go anywhere in the country and I didn't have anything to do other than submit my expense voucher and that was it, so--
Speaker 2: So as you moved up, like now you were pretty--your career is pretty solid by '95 [1995], '96 [1996].  At what point do you start taking on responsibilities outside of your job, and by that I mean becoming a trustee on the board of trustees at the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or some of the outreach programs you're involved in?
Speaker 1: The--
Speaker 2: How were they developing at that--alongside of your career?
Speaker 1: When I came back in ninety--'97 [1997] to Washington, D.C., then I started, you know, getting much more engaged in boards.  I think I had been in--I'd been on the St. Jude's Children's--I, I was on the American Society board--American Cancer Society board when I was in Boston, Massachusetts, so I had done a couple of board work, but--placements, but nothing significant.  So my, my predecessor on this job is a woman by the name of Suzanne Dubose.  So when I got back in '97 [1997], I had known Suzanne because in '96 [1996] when I was in strategic alliances prior, we helped to structure the first one million dollar grant to the National Urban League.  So she and I were sort of like--we were simpatico.  And so it was interesting, very prophetic that, you know, I wound up on this job.  But--so when I got back in '97 [1997], I got approached to do a number of boards, one of which was the World Institute on Disability because I dealt with a whole lot of disability issues.  The other one was the Generations United which, which is a--which addressed intergenerational issues, right?  And then--and then over time, Suzanne was on the NAACP board of trustees and she wanted to jump off, and she said to me I think you'd be a great candidate for replacement, so I got that--I got that placement.  And then got involved with the National Latino Children's Institute, and just, you know--and now I think I'm on, on, on seven different boards, America's Charities, the National Coalition of Cancer Survivors [sic. National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship], et cetera.
Speaker 2: And on these boards, what do they want?  What do they expect from you?  What do they want from a board member?
Speaker 1: I'll give you an example.  I, I was on the board for many years of the National Hispanic Caucus of State Legislators.  One of the things of--major thing was strategic thinking, strategic ability.  The other thing was resource, being able to point, point them to resources or provide resources in kind or otherwise.  And I think the other one is commitment, frankly, and commitment to be there and to engage in the dialogues and discussions that occur.  Among the American Foundation of the University of West Indies board, very similar kinds of things.  I tend to be--my skills are, amongst others, I'm a strategist.  I think strategy.  I look at the, the landscape and I, I can figure out what needs to be done.  And then I like to roll up my sleeves and try to get it done.  So for, for me, so boards are a wonderful place to be (laughter) in that regard.
Story_ID: 307034
Speaker 1: You're in Washington [D.C.], you're the executive director of strategic--
Speaker 2: Strategic alliances, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you--it's not as much fun as having been there before.  What happens next in your career?
Speaker 2: Well, what happens next is I start to mature in my career, acquire much more knowledge and confidence, and I start to work on things like, for example, the, the realignment of our community relations functions across the corporation, the development of corporate responsibility strategic plan.  So I start to get engaged in things that are more internal, right, than external.  Because I--I've done--I--you know, I've done the external thing, so in doing the internal things, I think that it brought attention to some of the things that I was capable of.
Speaker 1: Now, was philanthropy a part of Verizon [Verizon Communications, Inc.] before?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You--so someone else was serving (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Suzanne Dubose.
Speaker 1: Suzanne was doing this job [president, Verizon Foundation]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --as you were off doing the same sorts of things out--outward.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Good.  Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: So how did you get to have Suzanne's job here in New York City?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the external experience coupled with what I--the things that I have done internally that shows that I can get things done, I can manage a budget, I can produce outcomes, I can manage people, I'm thoughtful about what has to happen, you know, good team player, et cetera, et cetera, so I think it positioned me well--and strength of character, and it positioned me well to compete for this job.  Now, there were a lot of people competing for this job.
Speaker 1: How many?
Speaker 2: I gotta say there was--there were fifty and there were probably very--there were probably at least twenty very, very good ones.  So, I mean, you know.
Speaker 1: What--how did you get it?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that--you know, I think in some cases, you know, there is--it's like you're just the one, you know what I mean?  It's just like--I, I don't know if I got it or whether it got me, but I just think that ultimately when I interviewed, you know, I was to--I knew the job.  I had some thought about what needed to happen with, with this--with, with, with this engine that we have, this, in philanthropy, and I had I think the commensurate experience and then, you know, just maturity, you know, in the business.
Story_ID: 307035
Speaker 1: So do you come in with your own platform?  Or Verizon [Verizon Communications, Inc.] had a platform that you had to work within [as president of the Verizon Foundation]?
Speaker 2: It--it's a little bit of both.  I think in America--in corporate America or even, even in society at large, you know, it's like you may come in with your own platform, but it'll get tweaked just a little bit and then you should be prepared to, to work with it.  And so I think in my case, I obviously I came in, I think--I knew that we had to make sure that we align ourselves with technology, that we leverage our technology to be able to deliver on the grants that we were making, you know--
Speaker 1: But give me an example of that.
Speaker 2: I'll give you an example.  For example, if you are in the business--let's take literacy, right?  Literacy--basic literacy is, is a skill that we're trying to get people to acquire.  There are ways in which you can acquire that skill.  I can read a book to you or I can provide you with a computer connection, an Internet connection to the web, I can deliver applications that fit your learning style, it can interface with you in a way that allows you to learn without having to have a person be there to do that to guide you.  So that is one way of leveraging technology, connectivity, applications, et cetera, to be able to get you to learn.  And then by the way--and that has the--you have the ability to replicate it and to scale it.  So the idea is how do you have a much more strategic and thoughtful approach to social investments that we make?  So I was thinking it along those lines and I was thinking, well, you know, we--it's, it's philanthropy but it should be run with, you know, using business like disciplines, you know, and, and using management disciplines to get it done and leveraging our core competencies as a business.  We should also make sure that we have more people behind us with regards to our social investments.  It's not enough that ten people that work for me in this room know about it, the entire corporation should know what we're trying to do.  They should be ambassadors.  They should embrace it.  They should be ambassadors out there in the communities around some of the things that we're trying to do.  There was also a knowledge that, you know, having been--coming from a place where I came from, right, where, you know, I--Haiti and, et cetera, where I remember learning how to read (laughter) and I remember not having.  And I remember what it's--the--that a dollar invested somewhere made a big difference where I came from.  So I saw it--I mean, I have--we invest about $48 million of the $72 million budget that I have.  So that $48 million I think can make a difference.
Speaker 1: You invest it--
Speaker 2: Social investments.
Speaker 1: Social investment.
Speaker 2: Meaning we, we, we invest it in--
Speaker 1: You--
Speaker 2: --organizations.
Speaker 1: Communities.
Speaker 2: Communities, yes.  So I--so that--it, it--it's more or less an entire approach.  Now, my predecessor [Suzanne Dubose] did a fantastic job at, you know, mechanizing our system, professionalizing it and I think I'm just basically building on what she's--the platform that she's provided.  But the entire thing is--in my view is how do you bring your heart, your soul, your competencies to bear when you're doing a job, your commitment and, et cetera, to bear when you're doing a job and to be smart at it?
Story_ID: 307036
Speaker 1: So in corporate America, for example, I inherited, you know, about five or six or seven different, different priorities that the corporate--giving priorities for the foundation [Verizon Foundation] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Can you--is it okay to list them?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Arts and culture, health--
Speaker 2: Okay, but, but we're gonna talk about each of these.
Speaker 1: Workforce development, technology, literacy, and domestic violence prevention.
Speaker 2: And these were the ones that were considered top.
Speaker 1: These were the top.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Okay, so arts and culture is the first thing you said.
Speaker 1: So arts and culture is a wonderful thing to be able to do and I think we should continue to do it, but it's to what degree?  So if you do arts and culture, what social outcomes does it yield?  What are you after in society?  What are the social issues that you're trying to solve with philanthropic dollars?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, so in my view is I don't see arts and cultures as, as we--as solving a whole lot of--or at least being--as solving a whole lot of major, major societal problems, to be blunt, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now let's take--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Let's take another one.  Workforce development.
Speaker 2: Okay, but I want--I wanna just stick with the arts and culture.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: How are they--how are they--what--how are they planning to solve problems through arts and culture?  What were you told?  They say we're gonna use this and this is how we're gonna use it and this is gonna be the benefit of it.
Speaker 1: Well, one of the things that we have done, okay, is we've gotten them to think more strategically.  And by the way, while I--when I say I don't think that they solve the--I don't--as compared to other things we might go--undertake 'cause remember, this is about strategic thrust, so it's not about--it's not that arts and culture doesn't benefit somebody.  I mean, I am big on arts and culture.  I love it.  It, it helps me to, I think, to be the person that I am.  And I didn't talk to you about how, how much I love film, I love theater, I (laughter)--you know, so I love music, so I see that as playing a role, but I--if, if you're looking at solving literacy issues, solving the healthcare crisis, you're gonna be hard pressed to utilize arts and culture as a vehicle primarily.  You might wanna--you might utilize other resources is what I'm saying.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So arts and culture, the way--where we've come with arts and culture is like it's a wonderful thing, it really helps to build a, a sense--a sense of--define us as a culture, it increases your educational levels, probably points you in the direction of--I think helps you to understand life a little bit better, appreciate life and, and all its offerings and creativity, and all that notion, so I see that as a value to the world and society, okay?  Now, so I'm not eliminating it, I'm just placing less emphasis on it.  Workforce development was an area that we, we have been focused on quite a bit.  Now, as a social issue, as a social issue, workforce development in my view is not a social issue.  It is an activity to get at a social issue.
Speaker 2: And what is workforce development?
Speaker 1: Workforce development is to--training of your--training (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Of your workforce?
Speaker 1: --preparing people to enter the workplace.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So entry level training people to come on board in any capacity.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, I go into a high school and I start a, you know, a workforce development initiative that's geared towards teaching you a skill in high school that you're gonna come out of high school and then apply--
Speaker 2: And be able to work at--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Verizon [Verizon Communications, Inc.].
Speaker 1: So, now, workforce development is no longer a, a key emphasis of ours, but it is something that, frankly, is--can be embedded in the--in, in--as, as one of the tools that we use to address the social issues that we care about, right?  So workforce development.  So, so basically it is an, an issue--it is something that matters, but it's a different emphasis.  Healthcare, healthcare is an important issue but then you got--like, you name it, right?  You got AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome], you got lupus, you got cancer, you got this and then there's so much space in this healthcare world, right, in terms of what you can do, so to say, you know, we're tackling healthcare, I think you gotta be much more clear about what you're going after when you say healthcare if you were gonna be able to make a measurable dent in whatever issue you're after.
Story_ID: 307450
Speaker 1: Now, technology is one of those things that we used to call a funding priority, right?  So it's, it's a funding priority but how do you fund just technology?  So we had to rethink that [at the Verizon Foundation].  So we went through, I mean, a strategic planning session to try to figure this out.  So I said, well, technology is not necessarily a social cause, right, it is something that helps like--much like workforce development or otherwise, it's something that helps to address a social cause.  So we had to put it into sort of practical, strategic context.  And then we said, okay, well what are we left with?  We are left with domestic violence prevention and we're left with literacy.  Now, literacy is a social issue.  Domestic violence is a social issue.  If we agree in the company [Verizon Communications, Inc.] and we can get agreement from the company that this is something that we care about, that it is something that we believe can leverage our core competencies as a corporation, as a broadband technology company, it's something that our employees can get behind, then let's do it.  Let's, let's do it.  Let's commit to it.  Now, 100 percent of the people are not gonna agree with you on this 100 percent of the time.  On any given day, there are probably ten thousand people that think that they could sit here and figure it out.  But the bottom line is leadership is about, you know, determining strategy, aligning people behind it, et cetera, which is what we're doing.  So with regards to literacy, basic literacy is what we've been focused on.  We've been focused on literacy awareness.  We think we need to evolve that approach.
Speaker 2: Does this have anything to do with Laura Bush?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: At all.
Speaker 2: I'm just joking.
Speaker 1: It has all to do with--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --Patrick Gaston [HistoryMaker Patrick R. Gaston] (laughter).
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: It--
Speaker 2: We--you--we--you've aligned--
Speaker 1: We--so basically, we make sure that there's, there's alignment with our business.  So, we look at literacy and we say this is a basic issue because without that fundamental skill, you can't acquire math and science skills, you can't acquire technology skills, et cetera, et cetera.  So basic literacy is something that we need to continue to address and we are.  But we also know that we have to be able to make sure that we're changing the reading proficiency levels of the organize--of, of the communities that we're targeting.  So now what we're doing is we're introducing programs that work, some of which we're doing it in partnerships with other corporations like IBM [International Business Machines Corporation], like something like reading companion where you have the software that's web-enabled that can help you to sort of read the text and it'll, it'll challenge you--challenge you on the--on the mistakes that you make and tell you to read it again so it'll take you through an interactive process of--and then we can measure how well, how much your, your, your reading skills change.  That's what it's all about.  Then we also are measuring what, what happens to you after you learn how to read?  Do you go--do you graduate from grade school?  Do you go to high school? Et cetera.  So a lot of this stuff is performance driven in the way that we look at it.  We also look at that evolution as it occurs that we ought to leverage technology and people to be able to get at that issue, so that's what you'll find, and the grant making that we do is that we're looking for partners that have the ability to understand this, understand what works, identify the right programs, make sure that you're using technology's tools that--where, where possible, and make sure that you're getting people to volunteer, da, da, da in the community, get the teachers, the parents, the community involved.  That's what we're doing with literacy.  With domestic violence, this is something that have, frankly that came out of the wireless unit that we have, but I think it's in large part because of the courage that our, our the C--the, the president of our wireless group had and tackling that issue, right?  And so we said, okay, well, how do we make sense of it for the entire corporation and we're, we're looking at developing the right partners, figuring out a way where we can monitor the impact that we have on this issue and then over time.
Speaker 2: How do you monitor the impact you have?
Speaker 1: I think is something that's being learned.  I mean, we--one way is to figure out when you finish--when you leave that home--that domestic violence shelter, are you--do you go back into the same environment or do you break the cycle?  Do you find yourself a job?  Do you stop your dependency on this and that?  So those are the outcomes that we would think make sense in that area, but we're still learning.  So I think the approach that we have brought here is it's very strategic, it's very focused, it, it involves--you know, it's--it reflects our values, it reflects our core competencies as a business, and we're committed to it and in--and in sustaining it and, and then eventually scaling it.
Story_ID: 307451
Speaker 1: So being in the position that you're in now and being able to make decisions [as president of the Verizon Foundation], those were the ones that are--that are closest to Verizon's [Verizon Communications, Inc.] heart.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Which are closest to your heart?
Speaker 2: I think these things are both close to my heart, really.  I--'cause--because I think about things--we--one, one of the programs we did was we have a relationship with an organization called ProLiteracy in the Dominican Republic.  I--they invited me and I went to see how our funds are being used.  We got there.  It is like one of the suburbs of Santo Domingo [Dominican Republic], a little one, one level brick classroom, sits about forty kids with little chairs and little blackboard, et cetera.  That classroom didn't have sufficient number of, of books.  Now, all the kids have books.  That classroom didn't have parents involved.  Now, parents are involved.  We give 'em a meal, et cetera, et cetera, when they go there.  That classroom didn't have the right infrastructure.  We're starting to--we're gonna build a computer--put, put in the computers so kids can understand what that means.  When you see that and when you see what's possible when kids are able to be helped by that kind of grant, yes we're addressing literacy, but there are a whole bunch of other life issues that it addresses.  So sometimes when we say literacy, literacy can mean much more than just literacy.  It's the--you know, who's doing the teaching, et cetera.  So it has the impact that is exponential in terms of addressing, I think, some fundamental needs in society.  So I think literacy and I think--if I think domestic violence, obviously it's something that is a major, major issue and, and one that's a quiet, quiet issue that people are suffering from.  So those two things, frankly, do tug at my heart--
Story_ID: 307452
Speaker 1: Anything else you can think of in this position that, that is important as an oral history to be recorded today so that fifty years from now it will mean--you know, mean--it will make sense to someone, you know, or--I mean, I guess I should ask a basic question.  You know, are you the first African American to, to, to sit in this chair, to have this position [president of the Verizon Foundation]?
Speaker 2: I'm the first African American male.  Suzanne Dubose is--was an African American and, and, in fact, she's a good candidate as a--to interview for, for this, this, this purpose as well, tremendous history and--with her as well.  But I think the thing that I would say to folks watching this fifty years from now, et cetera, you know, sometimes you never know where you're gonna land, but wherever you land, whether it's the head of--and I don't know how long I'm gonna be on this particular job, but whatever it is, I think you ought to bring a passion to is, you ought to bring respect to the job and the people that you're doing with, the, the people that are helping you to do this job.  I think that you also ought to keep in mind that with a job like this, it has--you have the responsibility to communities in a real way, not just because you, you, you sit on $72 million, because $72 million can make a difference in the lives of people.  They can make a difference and advance the kinds of things that, frankly, my predecessors who would've looked at us, you know, fifty years from now like Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] in terms of like understanding what the future was that people like Martin Luther King were trying to create and so many of his contemporaries and those that went beyond them that we, through this small investment can make a difference.  The other thing is to understand that no matter where you are, you have the responsibility to lead.  And by that, I mean--from where I sit, I get thousands of people coming at me for funds, et cetera, et cetera, and my view is no idea is a bad idea.  If I can't give you money, I can give you some kind of resource that'll help you to translate that into some kind of effort in the society to continue this momentum.  We all have a role to play in that regard.
Story_ID: 307453
Speaker 1: So what does your wife think about what you're doing [as president of the Verizon Foundation]?
Speaker 2: I think she--she says to me, "You have a great job.  You--I know you love your job and you're great at it."  She's--and by the way, and I'll just give you the ultimate example is, when we came to get this job two years ago, two years ago we--I think it was about--well, actually it was a year and a half, we moved from Alexandria, Virginia.  She was working as an HR [human resources] professional at the time, so she gave up her--she--and she was pregnant at the time--she gave up her job, we came here [New York, New York], settled into a smaller home so we can make this happen on one salary, so--because she knew that this job was important to me, it was important to my career.  She also knew I could make a difference to people in that job.  So she's very much a full partner and a supporter and without whom I couldn't do that, you know.
Speaker 1: And what does she do?
Speaker 2: She's an HR professional.  She's worked for Allied Signal, Honeywell [Honeywell International Inc.], and Tyrel Price and a number of major firms.  And she is--essentially either deals with organizational development issues, benefits issues, a whole range of functions that occur within human resource--resources.  So she's--you know, she's very good at what she does.
Story_ID: 307454
Speaker 1: So I can't see this job [president, Verizon Foundation] being a resting place for you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, meaning I see you wanting even more than--
Speaker 2: Does it--does it come across that loudly (laughter)?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) No, but I just see you in, you know (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --so I'm, I'm asking, what are some of your other desires?  Doesn't mean you're not happy or comfortable where you are, but I think it's okay--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to have other desires beyond where you are.
Speaker 2: Well, I think I'm happy and comfortable where I am and I, I also think that I think that--I believe that the way I got here, I, I--it was not a--you know, it was not my grand plan, it was somebody else's grand plan and I believe it has to do with God and God's purpose for me.  I think that I always try to shine the best light in whatever capacity that I'm in.  So if, you know, I can continue to do that in another place and do great things, then I--that's probably where I'll land.  I, I--you know, I try--I'm a person that tries to not deal with fear in my life but look at everything and every opportunity as an opportunity to learn, to grow, to give, to be so, to me, this is an important part of the journey.  Like you, I don't think--you know, my view is, you know, whatever's in store is in store, but I think it starts with getting this one right (laughter).
Speaker 1: It's true.  It's like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, doing it well.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's, it's like the advice Bill [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] gives to Hillary [Hillary Clinton].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You gotta win that election--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: The, the upcoming one before you can think about--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --being the president.
Speaker 2: You can't--yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you gotta--
Speaker 2: Because, you know--
Speaker 1: --win this election.
Story_ID: 307455
Speaker 1: So when you think about history and, and what we're trying to do at The HistoryMakers, why do you feel history is important?  Why do you feel sitting down with me today has been important enough for you to give me half of your day?
Speaker 2: Well, I think history is, is important.  I can tell you that it's never been more important to me because I think without a point--without a reference point of history--history is, frankly, who--much of who we are.  It makes us who we are, whether it's be--it be our personal history and what we've experienced in, in life or whether it's been the history of our forefathers, et cetera.  In my case, for example, I've been doing a whole lot of reading around Haiti's history, which is--which stems from, as you know, the 1800s, the revolution of 1804, what happened as a consequence, Haiti's role in, in transforming, frankly, and helping different countries to obtain their, their independence, Haiti's role in eliminating slavery and its influence and, and all of that, all of which matters.  Because it provides me with a perspective that says, okay, this is the landscape.  This is how change occurred.  So, therefore, if this is how change occurred, now I'm, I'm at a platform today where I can learn from how it occurred, but as a point of reference, this is a little bit different, but I can use that to create more enlightened change, and I think it's about enlightenment.  If you're enlightened, you're informed and educated, and God has given you education, has given you the competence, the skills, then you can do much more, and I believe it's about getting much more done.  So I think history and what you're doing is critically important.  The thing is and obviously it's gonna be making sure that folks have access to this, that it becomes--it's delivered to them in a way that's relevant, that, that you're able to get the funding that you need to in order to support this initiative because I, I think--I think it's, it's, it's very important, and I think, you know, it's--it, the, the brainchild of--and I--and I--
Speaker 1: Julieanna [Julieanna Richardson].
Speaker 2: --Julieanna.  And I commend her for doing that and I cert- obviously commend her for having great interviewers like you.
Speaker 1: Aw, thank you (laughter).
Story_ID: 307456
Speaker 1: We'll start to wrap it up and close and I wanna shoot the photographs.  Do you have any hopes for the black community?
Speaker 2: I have hopes for the world community.  I think that--I think that if--when we look at it as a--as, as a black community in my view is that's okay, but I think I have hopes of the world community.  Because I think if the world community whether it's black or, or Hispanic, et cetera, can come together and agree on the issues that we need to go after, aligned ourselves and go after those issues, and I think you can then get at the critical mass that you need to get--to get to.
Speaker 1: As we are in 2005, what do you think are issues we need to be really pursuing and making changes at, making things happen as, as far as minority communities?  What should we be working towards to make things happen?
Speaker 2: I think jobs and education.  I think--and let's start with education.  Obviously, you know, with our emphasis on literacy, it's never been more important.  I think we're seeing major disparities now.  We're becoming an economy that looks like a third world--in some cases in some cities, like a third world economy than it is a, a first world economy.  So I think we have to do--there has to be a whole lot done to address the, the issues around public school systems, the flight to the, the suburbs and private schools, et cetera, creating a permanent underclass in America.  I think that all--you know, that--that's a major issue.  I don't wanna just speak to the issue.  I certainly think--I think that corporations need to do their part in being--in helping to resolve it, the public sector, community based organizations need to come together and very--and, and define intelligent ways of approaching this issue and depoliticizing that, that, that--the, the, the issue of education, right?  So that was--that's one.  The other thing, of course, good education leads to good jobs, right?  And so my view is unless you have--I've always felt that that was a problem in Haiti.  Haiti, nobody is gonna go to Haiti, you know, to, to, to start a big firm or a big production outfit so that you can produce sneakers or whatever; they're gonna go to India, okay?  The thing is, though, if enough--if that kind of economic investment started to occur in Haiti, you'd probably see some changes.  That dynamic is the--is the--is, is true in the inner cities, in the inner cities where kids don't have job opportunities when they, you know, fin--let--let's say that they're going home from school, where do they go?  Do they go to--now, it's sort of like, well, they may go to a Boys and Girls Club [Boys & Girls Clubs of America], but we need more jobs inside--in, in the inner cities.  We need skilled jobs.  We need, you know, those kinds of--so I think in the absence of that, you know, we're gonna have problems and we're gonna have a, a continued strain and in our--obviously drugs and crime will continue to be a problem in the inner cities.  So again, I think the various elements that need to be brought to bear are the, the public sector, the private sector, corporations need to do more things like that with their philanthropy and, you know, and I think there needs to be more accountability on everyone's part and, and teachers and parents, and corporate community and otherwise.
Speaker 1: Well, you're doing your part and we thank you.
Speaker 2: Happy to do so.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Thank you for the interview.
Speaker 2: Yeah, thank you.

Speaker 1: -- Now this is a picture of my lovely wife and two children, and you would never guess that my wife had just given birth to young Christopher Pierre Gaston just about four hours earlier, so--and she looks fantastic and the, the little boy on my lap is Daniel Patrick Gaston.  And this is my family and, and Christopher Pierre is the most late--latest addition and, and now he's already six weeks old and Daniel Patrick is sixteen months old.  And they're a terrific family and I've gotta tell ya, this has been a--just a tremendously happy, happy moment for me and for all of us.
Speaker 2: This is a picture with Kweisi Mfume who was then president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and he and I had developed a very positive relationship.  And I was--I am on the board of trustees of the NAACP, and this is I think at one of the meetings that we were having, and he and I were having a nice chat, and always had a, a very, very good rapport with Kweisi.  He was an outstanding leader for this important organization.
Speaker 1: This is a picture with President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] and this was really during the early days of my--of my work in Washington, D.C., and had the opportunity to meet him on numerous occasions and, and this was one of 'em.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is well actually a very favorite picture of mine.  This is before President Bush [President George Walker Bush] was elected president and he was governor then.  And we were--one of my jobs was to have a relationship with national organizations, one of which was the Republican Hispanic National Assembly, and they held a reception for then Governor Bush at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C.  And from right to left is a very good friend, Ed Senn [ph.], who was one of our chief lobbyists in Washington, D.C., of course Governor Bush, me, and then Tom Tockey [ph.] who heads up all of our external affairs and public policy activities, and I think I mentioned Tom a little while ago.
Speaker 1: Is that the Tom who was instrumental in helping you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's the Tom (laughter).
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next please.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my--one--of my, my other favorite lady, my mother [Yvette Mystal Gaston], who I spoke of, and we were--in '97 [1997], I took her to Paris [France] and we were in the Bateaux Mouches, these long boats that go along the Seine River and this is a picture of she and I at--on a dinner cruise.  And, and this was '97 [1997], so much has changed then and she--she's terrific, continues to be in our lives and was just there for the birth of my--of our--my second son, so I love mom a lot.
