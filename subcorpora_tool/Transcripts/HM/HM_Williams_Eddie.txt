Speaker 1: All right.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five, lightweight, 'People' Magazine-ish type we always ask.  And they just require a short answer.  The first one is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Chuckle) You stumped me coming out of the shoot here.  What is my favorite food?  I have a lot of favorite foods.  Fish, favorite meat.
Speaker 1: Color, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, blue.

Speaker 2: I haven't taken too many vacations as such.  When I, when I do, I like to go down to the, to the Caribbean and visit various places in the U.S. [United States]
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Some of my staff would probably say that I do.  I've, I may use them subconsciously.  One I think, one I think, that I'm told, is "Let's put a pin in that", meaning let's hold that for the moment, and let's move on to do something else and we'll come back to it.  Other than that, no, I'm not thinking of something off the top of my head right now.
Story_ID: 15400
Speaker 1: Okay, well, let me ask you about your family.  How far back can you trace your family history?
Speaker 2: I once did a, some archival work on that.  And I can trace it back to my mother's [Georgia Lee Barr Williams]  parents and little before that.  And I started this project because a cousin of mine who is from Mississippi once told me that, this is when I was a college student at the University of Illinois [Urbana-Champaign], that our family, my mother comes from Pontotoc, Mississippi, and that her family had, some parts of her family had at one time been servants to the Faulkner family in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Faulkner, the writer?
Speaker 2: William Faulkner, the writer.  And since as a college student, I was studying William Faulkner, I found that fascinating but I never did anything about it.  Some time later I, we may talk later about why this came on, I received a MacArthur Prize Fellow's Award [John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation grant] and decided what I'd like to do is use some of that money and time to trace my family roots.  And just at the--almost at the same time, a book by a professor from Columbia University [New York, New York], a biography of William Faulkner came out and I bought it.  And I said, well, let me check this reference out too of this so-called relative of mine.  And I looked in the book.  I was told that her, her name was the same my mother's maiden name, which was Barr.  And I opened up the biography, and I went, you know, to the index and looked up Barr.  And sure enough, there were a number references to, to Barr, a woman that, who was called Mammy Callie Barr.  And she's mentioned in just about every biography written about Faulkner because she had a significant influence on his life.  And I looked her up in the census archives and found her in the Faulkner household back in the, shortly after the [U.S.] Civil War.  So that's about as far as I could go.  I talked to some historians, and they said, "Well, it would be difficult to get records because so many records of African Americans were destroyed.  And since Mississippi was not located on the ocean, it was highly unlikely that the family of slaves came into Mississippi.  They probably came in through the Carolinas and got imported to, to Mississippi and other places."  But as far as I personally know, I can go back to my mother--my grandparents.
Story_ID: 15401
Speaker 1: Okay, well, can you tell me about your father's history?  Can you give us his full name and place of birth, date of birth?
Speaker 2: I'll have to reflect on date of birth.  My father's name was Ed, E-D, Williams.  And there are a number of stories that relate to that. And he's from Clarksburg, Mississippi and subsequently moved to--well, I said, was run out of Mississippi for insulting a, straw boss, a white man, by hitting him with a bucket because the man was abusive toward him.  And so, if you can remember these times, back in the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s], he had to get out of town before he got lynched.  And he wound up in Memphis, Tennessee and where he subsequently met my mother.  But before that time, he was a piano player.  And he played the blues up and down the Mississippi River on riverboats.  And that's what he was doing when the [Great] Depression hit.  And, of course, that took the bottom out of a lot of that.  And so I came along in 1932, sort of the depth of the Depression.  My father was working for the Public Works Administration, working on a bridge.  What was significant was that he was, he had one arm.  And when he was a young man and the Depression hit, he had to give up his music or supplement his music income by working. He worked on a cotton gin.  And since he was a very young man, they gave him the job of feeding the cotton into the conveyor where the seeds were separated out.  And, unfortunately for him, one arm got caught in the conveyor belt, and it was ripped off.  And so that sort of ended his professional music career.  And when I was born, he was the pianist and Choir Master for Mount Zion Baptist Church in Memphis, Tennessee, where he played with one hand and directed the choir.  And he used to take me with him to choir practice.  And I would sit on the other side, you know, while he, while he played the piano.  He died when I was four, four and-a-half years old.  But I was--have very strong recollections of him.  And my mother never remarried.  She went to work and raised me.
Story_ID: 15402
Speaker 1: You said there were some stories associated with his [Ed Williams, father] name?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it was just humorous.  His name was Ed Williams.  Now, we know that Ed is kind of a diminutive.  So they must have said, well, if you have a son now, let's get this name right cause Ed is not--it's kind of a nickname.  And so they named me Eddie, E-D-D-I-E.  And so I said, "Well, they didn't get it right, and if I ever have a son, I'm going to really name him Edward and get it straight."  So I did have a son, and I named him Edward, Edward L. Williams.  And low and behold, everybody calls him Larry.  So (laughter)-- his name is Edward Lawrence Williams, and everybody calls him Larry.  If you called him Ed, he probably wouldn't, wouldn't acknowledge it.  And so that was my little story.
Speaker 1: That's a--you know, I don't if you have any reflections or any thoughts on this.  But often, especially from Mississippi and Tennessee for some reason, people are named one thing and called another.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I, you know, I've seen this happen over and over again.  Do you have any thoughts on as to why that's true?
Speaker 2: No, I, I would--I'm surprised to hear you say Mississippi and Tennessee.  I think that's universally true, that in families and among friends, there's a tendency to make names a diminutive when you're very close to people.  And I notice with my son now, even though he's called Larry, his very close friends call him Larr.  And, you know, how close, how small can you get with a name?  I think it's a mark of friendship and a feeling of fellowship that when you--my wife's name is Jearline and she's called Jerry.
Speaker 1: But that's one thing, I guess.  But there are names I know from that part of the country, and I've had relatives that, from that part of the country and friends, where someone's name was--for instance, I have a brother-in-law named Joseph, but they call him, Terry, which has nothing to do with Joseph (unclear) (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: Oh, what's, what's middle name?
Speaker 1: He doesn't have one.
Speaker 2: Well, my son had a middle name, and that's where he gets the Larry.  It was Edward Lawrence Williams, and so he switched to--somehow his friends started calling him Larry.  I don't, I don't know why.  But anyway that was the story tied behind that.  I remember when I first started my career as a Journalist, I, became a little bored with just plain old Eddie, so I called--my, first name deplume was E. Nathan Williams.  I thought that had a big, you know, historic or literary sort of quality to it.  And later, I just said, to heck with that (laughter).  It's just Eddie N. Williams.
Story_ID: 15403
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your mother.  And can you give us her full name and date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name was Georgia Lee Barr, two r's, Williams.  Her maiden name was Barr.  And she was born in Pontotoc, Mississippi--.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: Pontotoc?  P-O-N-T-O-T-O-C.  And I can add the date of birth, which I don't recall specifically, but it was obviously back in the late 1800's.
Speaker 1: All right, now, what was she like and what did she do?
Speaker 2: Georgia Lee Barr was one of thirteen or fourteen siblings, born in Pontotoc, Mississippi.  And most them migrated to Memphis [Tennessee] to get jobs.  And, you know, then Memphis, in that part of the world, was considered the big city.  You move up to Memphis, you know.  That, that's where much of commerce took place because it sits right there on the Mississippi River.  And so she came to Memphis and that's where she, where she met my father [Ed Williams].  She, she worked in the home.  She was a mother and a, and a wife when I came along.  But, as I said, my father died early in my lifetime.  And then she had to work.  She had about a seventh grade education.  And most of her work was in, as a maid in Memphis, either in private homes or in hotels.  She was a very strong-willed woman, a very determined woman.  Out of all of her--well, she was strong willed.  She had a--and she had one child.  And she invested most of her life and will in that child and wanting him to succeed, wanting me to succeed.  And so that's what I know about her.  She would, you know, she would often--in the homes where she would go, she would learn things, depending on who the people were she was working for.  And she would quite often bring home books from, their household when they threw them away and what not for me to read.  And I kind of resented that a little bit, but I remember she would say to me, "Well, if it's good enough for that white boy to read, it's good enough for you to read."  And I, quite often I did, I read a lot of it, most of it, as a matter of fact.  And sometimes, I found myself talking about things in my own classroom in the segregated school at Memphis, that other students didn't know or weren't generally aware of.  And the teacher would always ask me, well, where did you learn that?  It wasn't in our book, you know.  And I would tell her, well, my mother brought some books home for me to, for me to read.  In Memphis, she, she had four of her sisters who were living in Memphis.  And they were all very, very close.  My aunts, and when my father died, you know, they, as families will do, they surrounded me and sort of helped to raise the, the kids.  One Aunt, Aunt Cora, lived in, you know, the same general neighborhood as my mother.  And she had two, two kids, a boy and a girl, slightly older than me, but not very, not by very much.  And so when my mother would go to work in the mornings, she would drop me off at Aunt Cora's house and I would sort of be, you know, cared for with their two children.  And then we'd go off to Hyde Park Elementary School [Memphis].  And then I'd come back to their home until my mother picked me up at night.  So when some people say, "Well, you're really an only child, you know, you must be spoiled."  I say, "Well, I was kind of raised with two cousins and we sort of acted as though we were siblings.  We had the same squabbles and friendships and loves and dislikes as brothers and sisters."  So I really didn't, didn't miss that kind of a relationship.  What I missed, being an only child was that when I--my mother would make me come in at sundown, you know.  "You have to come in now," and most of the parents did.  But what I could do was--and some of the homes nearby, I could hear other kids with their brothers and sisters laughing and talking and having fun inside the house.  But inside of my house, it was just me and my mother, you know.  And we were, we were very close, but she would often say to me, "Okay, it's time for you to hit the books now, you know."  So--.
Speaker 1: So she had--she could exercise a lot of control over your (inaudible)--.
Speaker 2: Most mothers do or most mothers certainly did then.  She totally controlled my time.
Speaker 1: And she no, even competition for your time in that situation, I guess.
Speaker 2: You mean once inside?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  And I don't mean to say it was, it was, it was tantamount to imprisonment, but it was--my point was that other kids had other kids to play with inside, and I, did not.  So I created my own environment, you know, being imaginative and creative like most kids can be when they, when they need to be.  I created some of my own worlds and toys and whatnot to, entertain myself.  It wasn't all books.
Story_ID: 15404
Speaker 1: Can you reflect back on your growing up and give us a description of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I grew up in--I was born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee.  And I lived there until I finished high school [Manassas High School, Memphis]  And once I moved, went, left to go to college in Illinois [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign], I never really lived in Memphis again.  I would go back for visits with my mother [Georgia Lee Barr Williams] and relatives.  What are some of the sights that I reflect on?  I remember the experience, many of the experiences that I had with my two cousins, that I grew up with.  I remember attending Hyde Park High School [Memphis], which we walked because it was in our general neighborhood.  And I remember some of the very close friends I, I grew up with, a boy named Charles Scott and one whose name was Earl McKinney.  And Earl McKinney and I still see each other from time to time.  He's, he's retired and lives in, Florida.  I remember how the teachers used to always ask us, you know, "What do you going to do when you grow up?"  And most kids, "I don't know."  You know, and they probably didn't.  And I just thought it was so unfair to sort of put us on the spot and say, "What are you going to do?"  So I thought about it.  And, after that, and I said, well, "What, what would I like to do?"  And I remember reading books about writers and journalists and photographers and what not.  And I fascinated by something called [radio program] 'Casey Crime Photographer' and reporters and what not.  So I said, "I'd like to be that.  I'd like to be a journalist.  I'd like to go out and move around the world, talk to different people, interview them and write their stories."  I was always fascinated by writing.  And I remember one time, and I think I was about the sixth grade, that question came up again, well, Edward, what are you gonna do when you grow up?  I said, "Well, I'm going to be a newspaper reporter."  Well, it shocked the teacher so much that here was a kid with an answer that she sort of used me as an example for all the kids, you know?  And I got kind of stuck with it.  I couldn't back off of it.  And I kept saying it, whenever anyone would ask me, that's what I wanted to be.  And that followed me through, high school, when teachers sort of adopted me and said, "Well, if you want to do this, here's some things you need to do.  Here's some things you need to read."  And I got into high school and was adopted by a, the senior English teacher there, a woman whose name was Bebe Bowers Fingall.  And she made sure that I got involved in all of the writing competitions and the--we created something called the Speakers and Writers Club.  And she got me involved in essay contests and in plays and what not.  And she would even come to school early in the morning with me and sit in the back of the auditorium if it was a play or a speech or something.  And she'd say, "I want you to enunciate and articulate those words so that I can hear them clearly in the back of the auditorium."  And so I went on, and then my high school was filled with getting ready to go to college to be a newspaper reporter.
Speaker 1: Now, what was--how did she spell her name so we can--?
Speaker 2: She's now deceased, recently.  Bebe, B-E-B-E, middle initial Bowers--I assume that's her maiden name, last name was Fingall, F-I-N-G-A-L-L.  Perhaps, the one individual, other than my mother, who had a very, very strong influence on my life choices and my thinking about life and the world that I was to inherit or to move into.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so she was your mentor in grade school basically?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  And one of my great honors, this is related to that, although you didn't ask the question.  Some years later, after I'd been in the [United States] military--finished college and been in the Military and had worked as a journalist, I was Vice President of University of Chicago [Illinois].  And I was invited to give the commencement speech at LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis, Tennessee.  And so I said, well, one of the conditions in my giving this speech, is that you must find and invite Be--Mrs. Bebe Bowers Fingall to be present.  And they did.  And it was a very joyful reunion.  I had not seen her for many years.  She had, kept up with me through friends and through clippings and things like that.
Speaker 1: Well, that's good, that's a good (unclear) story.
Speaker 2: That's good.
Story_ID: 15405
Speaker 1: Now, any--what did your neighborhood look like when you were growing up?  I mean describe it for us because we weren't there, and we, you know, and what the people were like?
Speaker 2: I grew up in, a community on the North side of Memphis [Tennessee] called Hyde Park on a street called Springdale, which ran perpendicular to a major thoroughfare called Chelsea Avenue.  People there were, low income.  It was a black community, as is often the case, that was adjacent to a white community.  There wasn't much integration as such, but, you know, you saw white people in the neighborhood and they saw black people in the neighborhood.  As a matter of fact, where I lived, the neighbors on the backside were white because I was sort of at the, you know, the end of the line.  I've often thought about how to describe that community because I, I've gone back to it now.  And I'd go to there, and I said, "This is a terrible place.  I would never like to live here.  It has just gone down."  And the people there don't have the same hopes and aspirations.  And they may not have had the same educational level.  I'm not sure about that.  But certainly, you can look at the place and see that it was quite different than the place I knew, where people kept their homes up and their grass trimmed and whatnot.  It was a place where people may have been--had low incomes, but they had middle-class values and middle-class aspirations, and certainly very high aspirations for their children.  My mother [Georgia Lee Barr Williams], with an eighth grade education, and who worked as a maid, had her own home and managed to keep it up, managed to keep me in school.  And her hope was that I would go to--I would go to college and I would become a professional.  And she was so proud of that.  And, you know, she didn't always tell me that, but I remember one time coming home from college [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign] and going to visit the--going to the drugstore to pick up something.  And the, the pharmacist, who was an African American, said, "Oh, Ed, good to see you."  He said, "I understand you did such and such and such and such."  And I said, "There's no way he would know that."  I said, "Well, how did you know about that?"  "Oh, your mother comes in and she tells us all the things you're doing and, you know, and how proud she is of you."  Squad forty-one was something that I remember from Memphis.  It was, a police car.  And the number on the police car--white policemen--and they patrolled my neighborhood.  And they were known to be very brutal people.  And being a, a youngster, you know, with the other fellows, I'd hang out at the drugstore at night, talking about baseball, football, girls, school, whatever, just, you know.  And I remember they would often come screaming in for no reason at all, with the siren blasting, and sometimes with gun drawn just to break us up, chase us off.  That was sport for them.  And that's a searing memory that I will never forget.  I remember the Cotton Carnival of Memphis was the--Memphis was the place where cotton came in from Arkansas, Mississippi and whatnot and then got bailed up to go on boats.  And they had a Cotton Carnival.  And I remember going to it one time because my cousin, the one I grew up with, was in high school.  And she beat the drum in the band, and she was going to be marching in the parade.  It occurred in the fall.  And they took me down there, and I got tired of waiting and sleepy.  And I saw all these people coming by.  So I said, "When am I going to see my cousin.  Oh, she's coming.  Don't worry, but the white bands have to go by first, and then the black bands come, you know."  I said, "It doesn't make much sense to me." But anyway, that was, that was life in segregated Memphis, Tennessee.  One thing that shocks a lot of my friends now who see me running a research institution, giving speeches and doing all these things is that I was on the boxing team at Manassas High School in Memphis, Tennessee.  And I boxed in college as well.  I took it up because my, one of my very good friends was a boxer.  We had known each other in elementary school.  And his brothers had done quite a bit in boxing.  And when we got to high school as freshmen, and the first day, they told us about classes and, and they said, "Those who are interested in the band, go here.  And those who are interested in, you know, in extra-curricular activities, and those who are interested in football, and those who are interested in boxing, meet in the dugout after school."  Well, my friend said, "I'm gonna go down there and go out for boxing.  Would you go with me?"  And so I said, "No, I'm going to go home."  He said, "Well, you know, we're in a strange neighborhood, and I don't want these guys to beat me up.  Just go with me and wait for me, and then we will go, get on the bus together and go home."  So that's fair enough. So we get down there and there're all these guys down there.  And the coach is looking at people and fanning them up and putting gloves on them and--so they could spar or work out.  And as he would say, "Let me see what you got," you know.  So I'm just standing around waiting on my friend to get through, you know, and getting ready to go.  And he came up--the coach came up to me, slapped me in the chest a pair of boxing gloves, said, "Okay, you're next.  Put these on."  And I tried to explain that I wasn't there for boxing, and some of the guys started laughing and snickering about that.  And I, put the gloves on and was sort of fiddling around a little bit.  And the other guy, you know, sort of popped me a pretty good one.  And so I said, "Well, I'd better at least defend myself."  Anyway, I was selected by the coach to, be on, the boxing team.  And later on, became a, a member of the Amateur Athletic Union, a Boxing Club in, in Memphis and took it up as a sport my first year in, college.  But the University of Illinois had banned boxing.  Somebody had been hurt, in fact, it was banned throughout the Big Ten [collegiate conference] as a, collegiate sport.  But you could take it inter-as an intramural sport.  And so I took it for, not more than a semester just to--what I thought would be an easy A, you know.  And it was.  What other strong recollections from Memphis, Tennessee?  Well, I'll leave there, and you can lead me wherever you want me to go at this point.
Story_ID: 15406
Speaker 1: Well, you know, thinking about what you do today, I guess, you know, from this vantage point, what was the political and economic climate for black folks in Memphis [Tennessee] then?  I mean, as you look back now.
Speaker 2: Politically, they were not significantly involved, except as--right now I'd call them political cannon fodder.  In Memphis, you probably recall from reading Memphis, in that, at that time, was controlled by one of the major political bosses in American history, [Memphis Mayor Edward Hull "Boss" Crump] Boss Crump.  Crump ran Memphis.  And what he did with the black community, only you really couldn't vote as such, but to get political loyalty I guess they did vote or at least they gave them political support, he would send truckloads of watermelons into the community during voting time to curry favor.  And, of course, if you were a teacher or something like that or in the professional area, you had to give your support to Boss Crump because he and his lieutenants ran things, you know.  And I was too small to fully understand what was going on, but my mother [Georgia Lee Barr Williams] would tell me some stories about him having a dominant influence on the town.  And it wasn't until I grew up and then got to college and started reading about political science and, and the whole era of bossism in American politics where one individual sort of dominated the machinery in Missouri and in Tennessee and in many other, places.  And it took quite a bit to break the back of, of Crump.  On the economic side, you asked me about my neighborhood, one of, one of my neighbors was a man whose name was Mr. Gales.  Mr. Gales was a deeply religious man, but I remember him because he was our insurance man.  And he wore a shirt and tie in his work every day.  He didn't wear jeans like most work-a-day people in my neighborhood.  And he would come around, and he would have his little policy book and my mother would get one of these, like dime policies or whatever they were at that time.  And he was writing for, this was Atlanta Life Insurance Company.  And so he--one--there was a person on my block who became one of the first black postal workers in Memphis, Tennessee.
Story_ID: 15407
Speaker 1: We were talking about the insurance man--.
Speaker 2: Well, you asked me about the political life and economic life [in Memphis, Tennessee]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, economic (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: Obviously, I didn't know very many--didn't know whites who were in politics, and I didn't know very many who were involved in economics.  But the people who I have recollections of and who had some influence on my thinking about who I wanted to be and what I wanted to be, and what I didn't want to be, were people like the insurance man on my block.  He was highly respected, and in a sense, he was an entrepreneur.  There was one person in my neighborhood who became one of the first black--blacks employed in the post office; one who became one of the first blacks employed in the Police Department of Memphis.  And then there was a man that I met once, but I'd read a lot about.  He was always involved in the black press.  In Memphis, we had the, 'The Memphis World' newspaper and the 'Tri-State Defender' [newspaper], which was an offshoot of the Chicago Defender [newspaper].  And this man's name was George W. Lee, Lieutenant George W. Lee.  Interesting story.  He was called a Lieutenant because you remember in, sort of in political life in the South, if you were somebody, you're Colonel, right?  You remember, (laughter) Colonel--"It's Colonel, son."  So the white people were a Colonel.  Now, this guy worked for them and sort of patrolled the black neighborhood and corralled the black votes and what not, but they weren't going to call him Colonel.  So they called him Lieutenant (laughter), Lieutenant Lee.  Well, Lieutenant Lee had a lot of influence, and he was very popular and very well known.  And he was always in the newspaper and what not.  And I guess I met him once, but I did not know him.  I knew of him.  I knew him as a major figure in the political life of Memphis, Tennessee, and there were others too.  But I'm just talking about the people that I, know.  And he--
Speaker 1: So he was with the Tri-State Journal?
Speaker 2: No, no, I don't remember exactly what he did professionally.  He may have been in insurance as well. I don't remember.  But I remember in the 1950s, he gave a seconding speech at the Republican National Convention for [U.S. Senator Robert A.] Taft.  He was a Republican.  Now, I remember that about him.  I remember when I went into the [United States] military, I went through ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] during the era of the Vietnam War, and I had to go in, go into the [United States] Army as a Second Lieutenant once I finished school.  And I, I went in and I got to Fort Bliss [Texas]--I was in artillery.  I didn't think much about the branch of service or anything.  I wanted to stay out of the draft.  And so I followed a friend who was very much interested in Artillery.  And he said, "Well, let's sign up for Artillery."  I said, "Fine," I didn't care, you know.  And so I went through that program.  And I wound up having to go to Fort Bliss, Texas.  And I found it very boring.  Here's where the name comes in again.  My first check in the military came to me addressed as Lieutenant Edward Williams, and I couldn't ash it.  That wasn't my name.  And I had to get the name corrected.  So I said, "Well, you know, I really shouldn't be out here with all these guys doing all this digging and running and shooting canons and whatnot.  I've been trained as a journalist, you know, and I should be in intelligence or something like that."  I was always intrigued by Intelligence work, spies and whatnot.  I wrote Lieutenant George W. Lee and told him who I was and said that I would; I really thought I was better qualified to do something else in the military.  Maybe I was venting, you know, but I wrote the letter.  I got a letter back from the Secretary of the Army saying that my letter had been transferred to him and that he would look into the matter.  Within two weeks, my Commanding Officer and my--we called them the TAC [Tactical] Officer, the one who really controlled our lives, had gotten some word down from his superiors about some disgruntled officer in his unit.  He chewed me up one side and down the other and said, "We don't do that.  If you've got a problem, you come to me.  You don't write letters."  And he put me on extra duty.  He made me do more running than anybody else.  He made me (laughter) do more push-ups.  And so that's the way the military helps you to understand the discipline and how to follow discipline.  Lieutenant Lee played a role in that too.  So he, was kind of a political figure.  There were, there were other very influential people in Memphis.

Speaker 1: Memphis [Tennessee] is interesting.  Then and now, if you were an African American, and you lived on the North Side, you -- where Manassas [High School] was, these were work-a-day people.  If you lived on the South Side, these were, middle-class or upwardly mobile African Americans.  This is where Booker T. Washington [High School] was.  There were two--the greatest rivalry in Memphis, Tennessee among black schools was between Manassas on the North side and Booker T. Washington on the South Side.  And on the South Side is where you found a lot of the black professionals.  Ministers lived there, teachers lived there, businessmen lived there.  A businessman that I once worked for was a guy--man whose name was Clifford Miller, who lived on the South Side.  Clifford Miller, it was rumored that he had made a lot of money in the underworld, gambling and whatnot.  And he put a lot of it into legitimate fronts, businesses.  He had, he bought he taxicab business.  I think he had a mortuary business.  And he bought a newspaper.  And I come into his life when I'd finished college and was back home in Memphis, waiting to go to Fort Bliss, Texas.  And somebody came to me and said, "There's a guy looking for somebody who knows something about news papering, and you've got a degree.  Why don't you go talk with him?"  So I got an interview, and he hired me as Managing Editor of his newspaper, right smack out of, out of college.  And as partial payment, he didn't want to pay me much of anything, but as partial payment, he gave me an old rebuilt taxicab that had been painted and all the taxi stuff was off.  That was my first car, you know.  And I got a few bucks.  But, anyway, quite an entrepreneur.  He got involved in a lot of things and made a lot of money.  He also made some mistakes at that time.
Story_ID: 15409
Speaker 1: Now, we were talking during the break.  I had mentioned the police in Memphis [Tennessee], and criminologist now saying that a lot of the policing in the South is modeled after slave control.  And you were getting ready to say something about--
Speaker 2: Yeah, what I was going to say that--I talked to you about how the police used to harass kids in particular, for just hanging out, doing what kids do.  They were also abusive of adults if they caught you doing something.  It wasn't a matter of just taking you into custody.  They would, beat you, literally beat you.  But I find this thing of harassing kids, tantamount to today what we call profiling.  They would argue that if these are hanging around on the corner, they're probably going to be breaking in somebody's house tonight because they're black.  So break up the crowd and disperse them.  And then maybe they won't do anything, profiling.  If you fit a certain profile, you, probably have been speeding or have been doing something wrong.  It's highly discriminatory.  I just happened to make that association.  I'd never thought about that before, but they treated, young blacks at that time, much the way people do now with profiling.  But they were abuse--an abusive lot.  I, as I've gone back, it, you know, so much has changed there, that you don't find that kind of thing.  It's not as blatant as perhaps it once was.  But you can find abuse--abusive police in every city, every time.  Not that they're all abusive, but you find some bad apples.
Speaker 1: Sure.  And it's certainly true in the North as well.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's true.
Speaker 1: Similar--
Speaker 2: Of course, where in Memphis, as we say, up South (laughter), the North is up South.
Story_ID: 15410
Speaker 1: Okay, when you were in high school [Manassas High School, Memphis, Tennessee], what were some of your activities in high school?  You were on the Boxing Team--.
Speaker 2: I was on the Boxing Team.  I was part of a group called the Speaker and Writers Club.  I was in the Drama Group.  I was pretty active.  I was, I was a pretty good student, not a straight A student, but a, probably a B-plus student.  As they tracked, you know, I, sometimes I was in, I was in 9A or 9B, but always up in the upper, upper track.  Football would be in 9F or something like that, you know.  I didn't know much of what a tracking system was.  I thought it was just interesting they had letter attached to all the grades.  And I never asked why.  That way if I was told, why, I didn't remember.  I took a lot of the high, fast track stuff, Latin, mainly because I was always interested in English, every English course there was around to take.  I did fairly well in Math, although that was not one of my favorite courses and didn't--and did not and has not ever been one of my favorite Sciences today.  Those were the things that I, remember in terms of groups.  I was involved, active in a number of groups within the high school class.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Did not play football, did not particularly aspire to play football.  I mean the football players compared to my size were huge.  And I played a lot of sandlot football, sometimes with the, actual football players, but without the togs, you know.  And I did not--I was not particularly interested in, track.  I was not that fast, as fast as some of the people there.  But once I got into boxing, I enjoyed that.
Story_ID: 15411
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any mentors in high school [Manassas High School, Memphis, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: I told you about one, Bebe Bowers Fingall, my English teacher.  She was my principal mentor.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry.  I thought she was grade school rather than high school.
Speaker 2: No, no, she was high school.  In grade school, the one was the one male teacher I had whose name was Mr. Kesch.  And Mr. Kesch taught Math.  And he, I cannot tell you his biography now, but he was a reasonably attractive man.  He had a--he was balding and he was very dapper in his dress.  He seemed to be fit.  And so he may have been exercising.  And he was--he had a stern face about him, but not mean, but you,  knew at a moment's glance, he didn't take any nonsense.  You did not mess around with (laughter) Mr. Kesch.  And he was someone I always interested in, didn't have that much contact with him.  I took courses from him, but we didn't have that much of a relationship, except just his presence and how I saw his presence.  And another woman in elementary school is Ms. Creswell, who taught English, who was, to me then, you know, a very beautiful, attractive, physically attractive woman, you know.  But no, my experiences started when I hit, when I hit high school.  And Mrs. Fingall adopted me.  I mean she, to the point where the other kids would tease me and call me mama's boy, you know.  But that ended after I wound up on the Boxing Team, (laughter) it didn't, I didn't get much mama's boy after that.  But, no, she was, she had a very important influence on my life, including, you know, well, you know, telling me I had to take typing.  And, of course, among the guys who were on the Boxing Team and whatnot and all, "Typing?"  You know, "That's for girls and gays," you know.  So Mrs. Fingall said, "You know, but if you want to be a journalist (unclear)."  She said, "You're going to have to learn how to type.  And if you want to get in the University of Illinois [Urbana-Champaign], you're going to have to know how to type because if you look at the requirements," and she had looked, "it said, before you can be admitted to the School of Journalism, you must know how to type," you know.
Story_ID: 15412
Speaker 1: So you had already targeted the, with her help, the University of Illinois [Urbana-Champaign] as a place where you wanted to go to school?
Speaker 2: No, no, I hadn't targeted it yet.  Just the fact that I wanted to be a journalist.  She didn't get involved in the selection.  That was another process.  The, selection of the University of Illinois--I finished high school, I knew what I wanted to do.  I applied to a number of schools.  Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], University of Michigan [Ann Arbor], University of Illinois, and maybe a few others.  Why?  One, at that point in time, I didn't know of any school in the South that either taught Journalism or would accept me as a student.  So I said, well, I've got to look beyond this.  And I got accepted.  And so then the question was, where can I afford to go?  And I made the decision about the University of Illinois because of all those schools I just mentioned; it was closest to Memphis [Tennessee].  And my mother [Georgia Lee Barr Williams] had a dear friend who lived in Champaign-Urbana, Miss. Sykes [ph.].  And when I left home, she had worked out with Miss. Sykes that I would come live with Miss. Sykes and her family.  And I never will forget, I went through four years of college living with Miss. Sykes, and paying her seven dollars a week for room and board.  And I worked at least two jobs, and it got to the point where I was sending money home to my mother to help her with bills and whatnot.  So that's how the school was selected.  Champaign is only about four, five hundred miles from Memphis, due north.  The City of New Orleans [train]--leave Champaign-Urbana on the City of New Orleans [Louisiana] and take you to Memphis, Tennessee and then go on down to New Orleans.  So that was--and I didn't, it had a, good reputation for its Journalism School.  It had a good reputation generally.  My dominant recollections on it is that it was, it was also a very racist campus.  And it was a cold place.  I had never been cold in--I thought I had been cold in Memphis, but when you're sitting out there in the cornfields of Illinois, it is cold, bone cold.  So I had to get adjusted to that.  During the wintertime, I kept a cold, you know.  But there, again, I met some individuals who became very influential in my, in my life.  But that's how I got to the University of Illinois.
Story_ID: 15413
Speaker 1: Who were some of the people that influenced you there [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign]?  I mean were there very many other black students on campus?
Speaker 2: There were quite a few.  Remember now, of course, it's a State school, and kids from Chicago [Illinois] would come down there.  And there were some of us that were, there were, a handful from the--and more than a handful, from the South.  I remember one time there were three of us from Memphis [Tennessee] and we happened to know each other.  So we spent a lot of time together, and we knew that not only did we have to put up with whites who were sort of looking down on all blacks, but the kids from Chicago looked down on the southern blacks, you know.  I mean these country guys from Tennessee and Mississippi and Alabama, you know, (in a low and rough voice) "What do they know."  So many of them would come in, and they were very, I guess in their own way, very sophisticated.  And they felt that, they were from Illinois and so they felt at home.  And some of them came to party and to play.  There was one room in the [Student] Union Building where some of the, black kids from Chicago hung out so much that some of us called it the ebony lounge.  I mean it was just (laughter), you know.  But I learned one thing about that, some of them partied and you didn't see them around the second semester.  There was no, there was no affirmative action.  There was nothing that lead them to keep you if you didn't cut the, if you didn't cut the mustard, if you didn't make the grade.  But then I'm, you know, in time you make a lot of, a lot of friends.  Some of my closest friends were kids that were--who I was in college with at the University of Illinois.
Story_ID: 15414
Speaker 1: Who do I remember [from University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign]?  I remember, probably three or four people who had a significant impact on my life, for good or, ill.  One was a Spanish teacher.  I took Spanish, and, you know, maybe because a friend said, you know, "You've got to take a foreign language."  I said, "Well, you know, some people have said, once you take French or German or Russian, that's good for you if you go to graduate school."  He said, "Man, that's hard stuff."  "Get, get in Spanish and I'll help you" cause he had studied Spanish.  Well, I got involved and took a Spanish class, got an A.  I took another semester of Spanish.  I got an A.  And that helped with some of the B's and C's I was getting too.  So I said, well, you know, this is good stuff.  I might as well stay in for a while.  And I did.  I took more than, than twelve hours of Spanish.  And the Professor told me--wrote me a letter, he said, "You really ought to reconsider your career goals and consider becoming a Spanish teacher.  You're--you have a very good--you're very good at it and very natural with it."  And I'd often done very well with languages including Spanish and, and French, which I'd learned in the [U.S.] State Department [Washington D.C.].  But I said, "No, I'm going to stay on and become a Journalist."  So I got in the [University of Illinois] Journalism School in my third year.  And there was a man there who taught Reporting.  He was from Kentucky.  And he talked like he was from Kentucky.  And I said, "Oh lord, that's all I need is another white southerner up here that I've got to study under."  Well, his name was Joe Sutton.  It turned out, he was a good teacher, talked with this drawl.  He was a fair teacher and turned out to be one of my best friends and supporters at the University of Illinois.  He later retired from teaching but got involved in alumni relations.  And he got me involved in alumni affairs.  And sometimes when I'd have to get a reference, you know, from a teacher, I would use him.  He'd write these glowing references.  And so, he had a very positive influence on my life.  Another was one of his colleagues at, in the [University of Illinois] School of Journalism, a man who had been a reporter for the 'St. Louis Post-Dispatch' [newspaper].  His name was Jack Tribillcock, he was from Missouri.  And he was my counselor.  And he also taught Reporting or something.  And I remember one time we were in class, and we had done a reporting assignment.  And it was something about cars or something.  I don't remember the exact reason.  But the word "Cadillac" was involved in the article.  And I misspelled Cadillac.  And he, called me out, singled me out, and said, "Mr. Williams, you better pay attention to your spelling."  He said, "You, you misspelled the word 'Cadillac.'"  And he said, "Given your people's history, I'm surprised you don't know how to spell that word."  So, you know, what do, what do you do?  You go up and smack your professor (laughter) or--I sat down, and just fumed about it.  When I got ready to go to him for counseling, he told me--he said, "What do you think you want to do?"  I said, "I want to work on a, on a metropolitan daily newspaper.  That's what I've been trained to do here."  He said, "Well, I don't think that's going to work."  He said, "You ought to find a little black daily news--black weekly newspaper or go to a magazine."  I don't know whether 'Ebony' [magazine] was around at that time or not, but do some magazine writing.  So I said, "Well, that's not my interest."  He said, "Well--."  So I thought I would--I remember him because he was so negative, especially, with the racist remark and the fact that he, curried favor with certain kids because he would go out and drink with them.  He also-- probably-- he had a drinking problem. But his negative--negativity dealing with my career, I always, I was always bitter about that, but anyway.
Story_ID: 15415
Speaker 1: The other person who had an impact on my life [at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign] was a man whose name was Bob Sink who was the Editor of the Urbana [Illinois] newspaper [Champaign-Urbana Courier]; trying to think of it.  And because of my work and my class standing and then my need to work, one of my professors referred me to him, said he had  that they had a part-time job that I might be interested, make a little money.  So I went to Mr. Sink and told him I was interested in the job.  He hired me, and my job was to go--I went there three evenings a week for about three or four hours, and my job was to compile basketball scores coming in from all over the state of Illinois and feed them into the AP [Associated Press] trunk line in Chicago [Illinois].  And then AP would, you know, package it up and put it on the wire.  And he showed me how to do other things because we'd be there together later at night, only, and most of the other staff has gone home.  But he would be there putting the paper to bed.  And we would talk from time to time.  He, too, had a, was a--to the best of my knowledge he was a southerner, at least he sounded like a southerner to me.  And when I was about to graduate, one of my last, next to last days, nights at work, he called me into his office and told me I'd done a good job and thanked me.  And he said, "Well, you may think that this newspaper may want to hire you, now that you've finished school."  And he said, "But you should get that thought out of your mind.  This newspaper is not about to hire a Negro."  So I said, "Well, I, yes, I had thought about it."  And it was not high on my mind because I had to go into the [United States] military anyway.  And so that was not my number one worry.  He said, "Well--" he said, "it's unfair and unfortunate, but that's the reality.  And I wouldn't want you getting your hopes up too high to be disappointed."  So I thanked him for his honesty.  That was, that was it.  I don't think I ever saw him again.  I would write to him from time to time and ask for a reference, you know, if I was getting, applying for a job or something or a fellowship.  And he would always give me these great references.  He was an excellent writer himself.  It's very interesting.  I'd been in the [United States] Army for two years, and I, I'd come--I'd done some other things.  And my mother [Georgia Lee Barr Williams] sent me some correspondence.  And it was from the, this (unclear) eight, nine, ten years later, and it was from the Lindsey Shaw newspaper chain--some little, Decatur, Illinois or some place.  It said, "It has come to our attention that you may be interested in employment with this organization."  Well, the newspaper in Urbana [Illinois] was part of the Lindsey Shaw chain.  And I don't know, somehow, he must have put my name in the hopper because I never applied to them for, a job.  Another example of how, how things change, by that time, there was all kinds of, of pressure on newspapers and others to hire, hire blacks, you know.  But those several individuals leave me with very strong impressions about my life in, at Champaign-Urbana.  Of course, I'm, you know, as I said, many of my good friends were there.  And they--I had the strongest impressions of them, but as far as teachers were concerned, these were the most dominant impressions.
Story_ID: 15416
Speaker 1: So, now, you graduated [from University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign] in 1950, was it?
Speaker 2: '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: '54.  And, and you went directly into the [United States] Army?
Speaker 2: No, I left--well, in a sense.  I left--I finished up in the summer school of 1954.  I had to report for duty at Fort Bliss, Texas in, I think March of 1955.  So between the summer of '54 [1954] and March of '55 [1955], I came home to Memphis [Tennessee].  And that's when I met the man who gave me the job running a newspaper.  The 'Memphis Star-Times' was the, name of it.  And I finished my time there, and reported to duty at Fort Bliss, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you told us something about the start, your start at Fort Bliss.  Did you ever get out of the doghouse at Fort Bliss?
Speaker 2: Yeah, eventually--,
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --eventually.
Speaker 1: He [Williams's Tactical Officer], let it go and I let it go [Williams wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Army asking for a change of military profession].  And I didn't try that stunt again, at least--and if I was going to try it, I'd be a lot more subtle about it (laughter) than I was at that time by writing a letter.  So in Fort Bliss, Texas, here's a kid who didn't do--who, who A's and B's in Math, but didn't take any more Math than was required of me.  They put me in--they taught me electronics and trained me on, what was then the beginning of the, the first cadre of guided missiles in U.S. history.  It was something called Nike Ajax.  It was an anti-aircraft missile.  And instead of the--I trained on a lot of the old 120 millimeter, 90 millimeter.  We used to call them, ack-acks (points figure like a gun), but my specialty really was, missiles.  And I came out of there and was assigned to a, battery, the missile battery in Chicago [Illinois].  In Chicago/Gary [Indiana] Defense, they had at that time, in the mid-50s [1050s], we were still in the Korean War, and we had--there were these anti-aircraft units surrounding all major cities in the United States.  And I was in one surrounding Chicago.  Actually, I was at Argonne National Laboratory.  And they had some ground, some of the regular convention weapons there, but they also had some missiles there.  And I never will forget the day I reported.  It was a Sunday, I reported for duty.  The Captain met me at the gate, welcomed me with open arms.  Before I could get to my barracks or put down my bags he took me to orderly room, which is the office, and had me sit down and sign responsibility for millions and millions of dollars worth of equipment, some of which I had never seen.  Now, I say that because this man was a career [United States] military.  And he had about six months before he was going to be out of there.  And he was going to retire.  And he didn't want to accept responsibility for anything, especially anything that could go wrong on equipment and what not.  So he gets this new blood coming in, and he makes me sign up Captain Noack (ph.) was his name, Polish.  He, was, fair to me.  I mean I didn't have any, any problems with him.  I didn't have--with respect to assignments.  In the military, one of the great things about the military is that, your rank and your, your MOS [Military Occupation Specialty], your training determine what you're going do.  And nobody can change that except somebody in higher, you know.  And I liked that, rank ordering of, of assignments.  So I had my role to play as a, what they called a Battery Control Officer.
Story_ID: 15417
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are some other things, but they're just, just anecdotes and stories.  I found the [United States] military to be a very useful part of my learning experience.  I was talking about the, the echeloning and, knowing your place and disciplining in terms of getting the job done.  And in a sense, a sense of order and management, in terms of getting the work done.  I met a lot of young, very bright kids who had great educations, black and white.  And I said, "Well, why are you a Private, you know, in this sub-zero weather?  Why are you outside running a generator and I'm sitting inside," you know, in this comfortable van looking at radar.  I said, "You can go and become an officer.  And you'll be in here."  They said, "I don't want to be an Officer."  Well, "Why not?"  "I don't want the responsibility."  And I, and I guess I later learned to accept that.  That people just had different values.  The, the thing that--I told that in Memphis [Tennessee], I knew both what I wanted to do and what I didn't want to do.  I did not want to do some of the menial chores that some of my relatives and other adults did, you know, whether it was driving a truck or doing something--I knew I didn't want to do that.  And as far as the military is concerned, I did not want to sit outside running a doggone generator in the middle of the winter.  I'd much rather be inside running things and, you know, but anyway, that was just my mindset.  And so I think the military for, you know, young men and probably for young women too, provides a learning experience and a set of discipline that is that, but can be very useful and valuable in going through life.  So it served that purpose for me.  I do not regret.  As a matter--being in the military.  As a matter of fact, I was so comfortable that I--what they call it--I agreed to extend my category for two extra years to stay in the military as a, means of getting flight training.  I was very much interested in flying.  You may recall that back, during that time in the late '50s [1950s], the whole concept of helicopters were coming in, the military and the adaptation of helicopters for commercial use.  And I said, "Boy, I fly, if I learn to fly helicopters in the [United States] Army, when I get out, I can, you know, fly helicopters for a company or for a post office or whatever."  Well, now, of course, I was not wearing glasses at the time.  I took all of the tests necessary to go into what they called Fixed Wing Training.  I--my orders were, my request was fulfilled.  I took the psychiatric exam, visual exam, all these exams, going into the Flight School.  One Friday--on Saturday, we had a--I was the Duty Officer in--at my unit which was stationed fifty--thirty or forty miles outside of Chicago [Illinois].  And the Battalion Commander came down for an inspection.  We had to stand tall for the Battalion Commander.  And he went through the barracks.  And the troops did very well, very good, very good.  And he did something he had never done before.  He said, "I want to inspect the Bachelor Officers' quarters."  Well, that's where, (laughter) that's where I lived.  And the other Officers who were not married lived in the BOQ [Bachelor Officers' Quarters].  He came in the BOQ and just raised hell.  There was one guy who was a graduate of West Point [Military Academy, West Point, New York].  His mother had sent him a big red comforter to keep him warm.  He had it draped across his bed.  The Colonel took that thing, threw it on the floor and said, "This is not military issue."  He went through my drawers and my socks weren't exactly echeloned the way they ought to be, dumped it out.  He restricted all of us to base and told us we had to clean up the BOQ and we could not hire anybody to do it for.  Well, and that was a, that was on a Saturday.  And I had a big, hot date in Chicago that night.  I was so furious (laughter).  I, right then and there, wrote a letter requesting that my, request to be, go to Flight School be rescinded.  And that was the end of my aspirations for flight training.
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: Just on a whim.  So I left there, and I got out of the military and started looking around for a job.
Story_ID: 15418
Speaker 1: Did you stay in Chicago [Illinois, after serving in the United States military]?
Speaker 2: Well, I was in--I was stationed in Joliet, stationed near Joliet, Illinois.  And I looked around for a job in Chicago at a newspaper.  And most of the major newspapers in Chicago had, had one or two black journalist, but they weren't breaking their neck.  They had the token.  And so when I'm, applying and they're saying to me, "No, well, we, you know, we don't have any openings."  So some people with the, I would say, American Friends Service Committee [AFSC] and several other civil rights groups got wind of this and came to me saying, "You ought to bring a lawsuit and blah, blah, blah."  I said, "I don't have--I neither had the time nor the money to bring a lawsuit.  I've got to find a job."  And so my first job was in Joliet.  I moved to Joliet, Illinois, was with the [United States] Army ordinance command.  And I, the whole concept of, tech writing had come into being.  And I was using my electronics knowledge and my missile knowledge to work in an ordinance command where you're--they're producing books and manuals on missiles.  And that was--and I stayed there three months.  And it was just so boring, you know, that I didn't, see myself there.  And that's when I left and went to, Atlanta [Georgia] to work on the 'Atlanta Daily World' newspaper, which at the time was the only black daily newspaper in the United States.  And that began, opened up sort of a new vista on life for me, and I worked there as a reporter for a year and a half.  Met a lot of people-- Atlanta is a fascinating city.  I'd never been in a, place where there were so many upwardly-mobile, upper middle-class blacks in--you know per-square foot, per-square inch.  And that was just a good world.  And so many universities there, you know, five or six different black universities.  And I immediately enrolled in graduate school at Atlanta University.  And I went to school at night--
Story_ID: 15419
Speaker 1: ...and met a man whose, also whose influence caused me to, in a sense, be where I am today.  And that is to--he pushed, and he--to apply for a fellowship that brought me to Washington [D.C.] to work on Capitol Hill for a year.
Speaker 2: And who was that?
Speaker 1: His name is--you ask (unclear).  That's terrible.  Let's keep talking, it'll come to me.  I just, I talked with him recently.
Speaker 2: Is he a teacher?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was head of Political Science at Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia] and later became President of, Dillard [University, New Orleans, Louisiana], which is why I'm having a hard time-- well, not why I'm having hard time, but I'm just--Cook, Samuel DuBois Cook was his name.  And he said--he went to Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio], got a Ph.D. in Philosophy.  He said, "Mr. Williams, you're, studying Political Science and Government here, and you're working on a daily newspaper.  And you're covering Politics in Atlanta, why don't you apply for this fellowship to go to Washington [D.C.] and intern on Capitol Hill for a year."  He said, "They're going to take thirteen people, six of them journalists, who are interested and who are working in politics and seven of them young Political Scientists, you know, young Ph.D.'s."  So I said, "And you think I'm going to be one of six selected.  It's a waste of time."  He said, "Well, give it a shot.  You never know."  And every time I'd go to class, "Have you, filled out your application yet?  "No, no, no," I hadn't done it.  And he stayed on my case and stayed on my case.  And so I eventually filled the thing out.  And they asked me for some references, and some of the other people who I've mentioned, who played some role in my life, like Mr. [Bob] Sink at the Urbana [Illinois] newspaper [Champaign-Urbana Courier], I wrote to him, and put his name down as a reference.  And some other people.  And I got a letter back from the American Political Science Association saying that, they had received my application.  And it was complete.  And I'm still, I told my professor, he'd ask me, "Have you heard from them?"  "No, and I don't expect to.  This is not going to work," you know.  But then they wrote me back and said, "Well, you've passed the first round.  We'd like to meet you.  We'd like to interview you.  And we will select the interviewers, and you select the place."  So I said to myself, "Well, this is,  the 'got ya'.  This is where they're going to get rid of this little black guy," you know.  So they said, well, that they wanted an Editor from the 'Atlanta Constitution' [newspaper].  They had a Political Science professor from the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia].  They had somebody on there, a professor from Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] and a guy on there from a, from a T.V. station.  So I said, "Three white men.  This is it.  This is, you know, this is the (unclear)."  But I said, "I'll fix them."  They said, well, they named the, panel and I name the place.  I, had them come to my classroom at Atlanta University in the heart of the black community (laughter).  Well, then I started boning up for the exam.  I read all the books and go ready, and, reviewed the Magna Carta and all this stuff, ready to be quizzed by these men.  So they showed up, and we met.  And we--you know, they were trying to make things easy, did lighthearted conversation, which I expected, but I kept waiting on the hard stuff to come.  They were asking me things sort of like you were asking, you know, "What did you do in such and such a time"  And, "What do you think about what--?"  And I said, "You know, this is just sham," you know.  They're going to fill out the hour or fill up the hour and a half.  And they're going to go.  They're very determined that they're going to pass me.  And so then eventually they said, "Thank you very much."  And I'm saying to myself, they didn't ask me one hard question," you know, nothing I had studied for.  And I told my professor then, "He said, what did you think about the interview?"  I said, "I thought it was bull," you know.  And he said, "Why?"  And then I told him what I just explained to you.  He said, "Well, you know, everything is not a test.  You can learn more about people sometimes when you just have an easy-going conversation with them, than, than, you know, questioning them."  Well, apparently that's what happened, because I got another communication- well, that was the, that was the final hurdle.  And one Saturday, I guess, I came into the--I'd been on an assignment.  And I came to the office, and I was told that I had telegram.  And I don't--coming out of the South, a telegram means somebody died.  Otherwise, nobody sends me a telegram.  And they said, "Do you want us to send it to you or do you want us to read it to you?"  I said, "Read it to me.  I can't wait."  And they said, "It's from the American Political Science Association.  We're pleased to inform you that you have been accepted, blah, blah, blah."  So cynic that I was, I did win the competition and I was one of six journalists selected in nationwide competition to come to Washington and intern on the Hill [Capitol Hill] for a year, where I interned for then, [U.S.] Congressman James Roosevelt from California and later with [Minnesota] Senator Hubert Humphrey on the Senate side, and stayed on to work for Humphrey in the Foreign Relations Committee for--
Speaker 2: Now, what year is this?
Speaker 1: I came to Washington in 1959.
Speaker 2: Okay, and that's--
Speaker 1: This is when I got involved in, political work for the first time, working on the Hill [Washington, D.C., Capitol Hill] and working for the Democratic Study Group and later [1961] for the Kennedys and wound up going into State Department [U.S. Department of State] during the [U.S. President John F.] Kennedy Administration.
Story_ID: 15420
Speaker 1: That's when civil rights was really heating up here in '59 [1959], I believe.  We had, we already had Brown versus Board of Education, in '54 [1954].
Speaker 2: Yeah, that occurred in '54 [1954].  That was a--
Speaker 1: Montgomery [Alabama] Bus Boycott in '56 [1956] and [U.S. Vice President] Hubert Humphrey becomes a kind of champion of civil rights--
Speaker 2: That's right, precipitated the [1948] walkout in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], led to the Dixiecrat Party.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you didn't tell us about all that.  Yeah, Mr. Civil Rights.  I'm just trying to set this up.  He was one of the big, you know, civil rights advocates amongst the white--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he had that, had that image.  And that was his, that was his very strong sentiment.  And he led--he did more to pursue the concept of, equal opportunity and affirmative action than any other, one individual I mean [U.S. President] Lyndon Johnson really got the legislation through, but (unclear) the ideas, they grew out of people like Humphrey and other white civil rights stalwarts as well as [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and others who were providing the muscle in the street.  So it raised the, elevating this level, elevating this issue to the level where it captured headlines in the newspapers and on the radio, on television where, where people just couldn't sweep it back up under the rug, which had been done for years.  You know, they really had to come to grips with it.
Story_ID: 15421
Speaker 1: Now, this is a time for some re-education, I guess in American, in terms of the American government, in terms of what was really going on in the South.  And it's been written, Taylor Branch writes in 'Parting the Waters' that the [U.S. President John F.] Kennedy Administration in the beginning days didn't get it, you know, they didn't understand why [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was doing what he was doing.  Their objective in the beginning was to silence him, sort of try to, you know, put some (unclear) (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: And there was a great--yeah.  And, and this, in many ways, this brings our conversation very much full circle, because that's when they went out and hired [Deputy Chairman of the Democratic Party] Louis Martin, out of Chicago [Illinois] to come in to sensitize them toward dealing with the black vote.  This was in the campaign because blacks were cool toward the Kennedys too.  They didn't know them.  They were from Boston [Massachusetts].  They were Irish, and they were Catholic.  And when you're down there in the, Bible Belt, the belt of the Baptist preachers, you know, they were suspicious of anybody whose a Catholic, you know.  And so they were--besides, they had just, you may recall when you go back to--blacks had given significant support to [U.S. President] Dwight Eisenhower.  This goes, you know, the, the history of blacks and [U.S. President Abraham] Lincoln freed the slaves and so, black voted for, Lincoln and voted Republican to the extent they were voting at all.  And it wasn't until the depths of the [Great] Depression and the advent of, [U.S. President] Franklin Delano Roosevelt that blacks, like many other Americans, said, "Look, there must be a better way.  This man gives us the hope that he's going to reform things and whatnot."  So blacks started to shift gradually toward, toward the Democratic Party.  But they never got totally there.  And in 1952 and '56 [1956], a significant number of blacks voted for, for Dwight Eisenhower.  As a matter of fact, when [John F.] Kennedy ran [for U.S. President], almost a third of blacks voted for [U.S. Vice President Richard] Nixon.
Speaker 1: Yes, and it's the, one of the last elections in recent memory where the votes were split (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: In which, in which Republicans got a significant vote.
Speaker 1: In 1960--.
Speaker 2: Because with Gold- when [U.S. Senator Barry] Goldwater ran [for U.S. President, 1964], it went just total Democrat.  I mean Goldwater was such a scarecrow that people said, "Oh, no."  And so, and it's been over there ever since, 89, 90, 95 percent.  And the Republicans are still struggling with how to get it back.
Story_ID: 15422
Speaker 1: But anyway, I worked on the Hill [Washington, D.C., Capitol Hill]  for close to two years.  It was a fascinating experience for me meeting a lot of new people and different kinds of people.  And transferred--tried to transfer my credits from Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia]  to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  Howard wouldn't accept them.  So they accepted six hours, I think, and I was in graduate school in Political Science at Howard.  And I, in a sense, I started working all over again doing my Master's degree in Political Science; had some wonderful professors there--.  I was working, so I was going part time.  And when I wasn't working on the Hill, in '61 [1961], I got a--I was appointed to a, junior position, but an important position in the [U.S.] State Department [Washington, D.C.], mainly due to the fact that some of the Kennedys had heard about me.  They knew I'd worked for [U.S. Senator Hubert] Humphrey.  They knew I'd worked for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  They wanted to find some blacks to put in Foreign Affairs as well as in other areas.  But there weren't very many around who had any Foreign Affairs experience.  So, they asked me to come in and talk with them, and said, "We want you to go over to the State Department.  We're going to integrate the State Department [U.S. Department of State]."  And I said, "Fine.  What do you want me to do?"  Said, "I want you to go and work for the Office of Protocol."  Well, I had to almost ask myself, "What the-- what, is the Office of Protocol?"  I didn't know very much about it.  I later found out about it, found out who was running it and went over for an interview in--it didn't happen over night.  There was a lot of racist antagonism to my coming into the State Department in the first place and to coming into the office.  As a matter of fact, the Deputy Head of the office that I was going to work in made a statement, "There's nothing in this office that a Negro can do."  There had never been a black professional working in the Office of Protocol of the United States in history.  This is the office that, that deals with the Diplomatic Corps, that deals with State funerals, that deals with fine dignitaries coming to the United States.  And so--.
Speaker 2: So a lot of this was some sort of a diplomatic etiquette or something like that?
Speaker 1: Well, it's more than just a--
Speaker 2: Protocol.
Speaker 1: --yeah, well, yeah, protocol deals with certain ceremonial things that have to take place.  I, I became an Escort Officer for a number of people, the Prime Minister of Italy, the Prime Minister of India, the President of the Sudan, the President of Afghanistan, which meant that I planned their total itinerary in the United States and served as Escort Officer for them.  And to me, that was fascinating.  I mean I--Prime Minister of Italy, a man whose name was [Amintore] Fanfani.  It was educational for me cause I got around to flying on the [U.S.] President's [John F. Kennedy] plane--I'm flying around to places I had never been before.  And that led to a lot of experiences that I will, you know, talk about when I do some, writing.  But just to give you a scope, since you perhaps did not have my bio, I was in the State Department for seven years.  Three--I was in the Office of Protocol from 1961 until '64 [1964].  The last--my last major assignment in that office was to serve as an usher in John Kennedy's funeral, because that was the office responsible for the Diplomatic Corps and a lot of the adminis--a lot of the ceremonial arrangements relating to State funerals.  And I left there in 1968.
Story_ID: 15423
Speaker 1: I planned to leave [U.S. Department of State], but you may recall, in '68 [1968] was when [U.S. Vice President] Hubert Humphrey ran for [U.S.] President.  And I left the State Department early to go to work in Humphrey's campaign, working for this one  [Deputy Chairman of the Democratic Party] Louis Martin.  You will find that he comes in and out of my life at many different times, and I count him as a friend as well as my main mentor in life.
Speaker 2: This is Louis Martin?
Speaker 1: It's Louis Martin, and he's the one that recruited me and left there, left the State Department and went to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], where I stayed for four years as Assistant Vice President for Public Affairs, and later as Vice President of Public Affairs.  And it was Louie Martin, among others, [social scientist] Dr. Kenneth B. Clark, who, in a sense recruited me from the University of Chicago to take over the Joint Center [for Political and Economic Studies] in 1972.  The Joint Center had been founded in 1970, in part by Louie Martin and in part by [lawyer] Vernon Jordan, in part by [civil rights activist] Percy Sutton and some of the other main, major black political luminaries, [California state Senator]  Mervyn Dymally, Kenneth Clark-- these are old names.
Story_ID: 15424
Speaker 1: I don't want to breeze too much.  I don't want to get too far out of the '60s [1960s], and yet, but it seems like there's some things there that we can probably talk about.  Back in '64 [1964], when the Civil Rights Movement was really heating up, and SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] was in Mississippi.  There was a--they took the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegation to Atlantic City [New Jersey].  And there was a big, sort of confrontation between regular Democrats and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.  Were you involved in any of that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You were at the State Department [U.S. Department of State] then?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  No, I was never a part of activist--civil rights.  I put a lot of money it and tried to be helpful.  I didn't hang out with the leadership crowd.  I was often in things where there weren't very many other blacks, whether it was working on the Hill [Washington D.C., Capitol Hill] or working for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee or, for that matter, being an Officer in a Guided Missile Unit.  So in the '60s [1960s], no, I was here trying to make my own professional mark.  And I was supportive of things happening in the, in [Washington] D.C. because I was a part of D.C., but not a part of a, national movement except to be supportive of Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  When I was a reporter [for newspaper Atlanta Daily World] in Atlanta [Georgia], I used to write a lot about Dr. King and the Civil Rights Movement, but I was not an activist, as such.
Speaker 1: I was thinking--.
Speaker 2: Activists, well, you know, you fight the battles in many ways.  There are some who are on the front line.  There are some who are other lines, but they continue the battle by another, another means, whenever you can, so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was thinking of on the other side of being maybe caught in the middle of it between--because I know there was a lot of, tension, you know, around [U.S. Senator] Hubert Humphrey then in '64 [1964], around, you know, the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.  And many of the SNCC workers felt that he was, as a champion of civil rights, would champion their cause, which did seem legitimate, but, you know, and ended up basically, and they think he basically sold them out.  So that kind of tarnished his civil rights reputation in a sense, amongst the activists anyway.  The same is true (unclear), but [U.S. President] Lyndon Johnson, I don't know if anybody, if (unclear) (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: No, I was not. No, I've been into the--well, things that I've read about it, I've been told, but I was not a party, not a party to that.  And '64 [1964], Humphrey was elected Vice President in '64 [1964]--
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, right.
Speaker 2: --when Lyndon Johnson, on the ticket with Lyndon, Johnson.  And, no, I'd been in the State Department from '61 [1961] to '68 [1968].  So I knew much of his staff.  As a matter of fact, I got a letter from someone the other day that talked--they want to have a, Hubert Humphrey alumni reunion (laughter) at the Humphrey Institute at the University of Minnesota [Minneapolis] some this, this year.
Story_ID: 15425
Speaker 1: So in '68 [1968], you worked on the campaign, [U.S. Vice President Hubert] Humphrey's campaign?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  When he ran for President.  I had resigned from the State Department [U.S. Department of State] because I had--I'd already accepted a position at the University of Chicago [Illinois].  So I left early and I just rolled the dice.  I said, you know, "If Humphrey wins, I'm sure there's a job here for me.  But, you know--and I'm going to go to the University of Chicago and maybe I'll come back.  And then if he loses, I'm still--win, lose or draw, I was goning to go to the University of Chicago."  And, of course, he, you know, he lost.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the country was in the Vietnam war at that point.
Speaker 2: Well, [U.S. President] Lyndon Johnson had really sort of--the war was swirling around his head.  And he was trying to--he was trying to win it.  And then some people said, well, he was doing it half heartedly.  We were taking, significant casualties and didn't see a real out.  And so he just didn't think--the polls showed that he would have a difficult time winning.  And so I never will forget the night in which he gave his "I will not run, stand for re-election" speech.  I was, had taken my kids to a circus at the Uline Arena [Washington, D.C.], some arena here where they used to have ice skating and what not.  And I remember sitting outside in the car and listening to the, speech on, the radio.
Speaker 1: It was "I speak to you tonight with a heavy heart" speech.
Speaker 2: Right
Story_ID: 15426
Speaker 1: So, but, you know, there were--I enjoyed foreign affairs.  I, started out working [at the Office of] Protocol.  I did not stay there.  I was more interested in the political side of, Foreign Affairs and not the ceremonial side.  So I got a job as Special Assistant to the Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, which was in the heart of politics.  And as you know, that, office was responsible for our relations with the, with all of the Middle East, including the Arabs and Israel, with all of South Asia, India, Pakistan, Ceylon [Sri Lanka], Nepal, and with Greece, Turkey, Iran and Cyprus.  All had significant historical, cultural, religious problems, whether it was Hindu and Muslim (laugher) or Muslim and Jewish and the war in Cyprus and the fight that went on between the Greeks and the Turks over who owned Cyprus and all that.  We stayed in battle gear in a sense.  But I saw a lot of the problems--I was, a Staff Assistant to the Assistant Secretary.  And most of the stuff he saw, I saw, meaning the super, secret stuff.  I didn't sit in on CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] briefings, but I could see some of the traffic.  And it was just very, very illuminating.  And I was at point in which I had to have a super clearance to see all this stuff.  So, you, burn out quickly at that level because it's virtually, you, you're going twelve and thirteen hours a day, early in the morning until late at night.  And then the Undersecretary for Administration, his name is William Crockett, who also played a significant role in my life, although briefly, gave me what they call an, offer you cannot refuse, an offer to come up--as they say, come upstairs and work for me.  And he made his Special Assistant and made me Director of the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity.  And I succeeded another black guy.  His name was Richard Fox, who had been in the Urban League in Minneapolis [Minnesota], who also came into the [U.S.] State Department in 1961, but he came in especially to run the, the EEO [EEOC, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] office.  But he was--became a Career Foreign Service Officer and went to, Spain.  And so I replaced him.
Story_ID: 15427
Speaker 1: Well, so you're at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  And you're Vice President for Public Affairs, and tell me about that?
Speaker 2: Well, to me that was a dream job, given some of my history.  I was at a great university.  I had a position that--of some substance and of some uniqueness.  I was the first black Corporate Officer of the University of Chicago.  I had a boss in the President, Edward Levi, who was very supportive.  And I was responsible for radio and television at the University of Chicago.  I was responsible for, for Public, Affairs, Media Relations for alumni affairs.  And I was also Director of the University's Center for Policy Studies.  So I had a lot, of things on my plate.  And I hosted a Public Television, T.V. program for a while.  And I was also a columnist for the 'Chicago Sun-Times' [newspaper], a weekly columnist on the, for the Chicago Sun-Times for, a couple of years.  So I was fully engaged and having a wonderful time, and, enjoying it.  And--but I never thought that that would be life's work for me.  I mean on a university campus, if you're not teaching, then you're, on the periphery and especially in a, university like Chicago.  So I just--my position, I President left, I decided I would leave.  And that's when I was offered the position at--to become President of the Joint Center [for Political and Economic Studies, Washington, D.C.].  And I thought about that for a long time.  And I said, "Well, boy, I've got this great job here and don't have to worry about budget.  Budget is provided.  And there's an organization in Washington [D.C.] that's relatively new.  It's--it has a small budget, and a small staff.  And it's totally dependent upon one foundation."  I knew the, Executive Director of it, a man whose name was Frank Reeves, brilliant lawyer, who had been an assistant to [Supreme Court Justice] Thurgood Marshall, when he was a Professor at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And you may recall that name because our municipal building here is named Frank Reeves Municipal Building.  So Frank was the first Chief Executive of the Joint Center.  And he was a man of some significance.  He was very active in Democratic politics.  He was on the Democratic Central Committee here in, in Washington [D.C.].  He hung out--he knew all of the civil rights leaders, all of the influential blacks in America, anybody whose anybody knew Frank Reeves.  And so when I was asked to--and he--I knew him, but I was not a close friend.  But I knew him, and he had represented and my family on a couple of legal cases.  So when I was asked whether I'd be interested in the job, I, my first reaction was, "No way."  I mean my friend, Frank Reeves, is the head of the organization.  And I'm not going--I won't do anything to undercut him.  And they said, "No, his health is not well, and he knows that we're doing some recruiting.  And if you'd like to go and talk to him about the position, that's fine."  And I said I would before taking it any further.  And I fly here from Chicago to meet with Frank, who was Freedman's Hospital at Howard University.  He'd had a heart attack.  And we talked, and he said, "Look, I, hope, you will do this."  So that cleared the deck for me to--so we look at the position very, very seriously.  Some people at the Ford Foundation wanted me to do it.  The Ford Foundation had provided the seed money to create the joint center in 19--in 1970.  And what a lot of people don't know, a lot of people ask me, "Well, how does a--how does the Joint Center get it's name?  What is a joint center," you know.  And the story is that when the Joint Center was created in 1970, the Ford Foundation wanted to attach it to Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts] or Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] or Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] or some major university.  And people like [social scientist] Kenneth Clark and [Deputy Chairman of the Democratic Party] Louis Martin and others said, "No, you can't do that."  And especially, given the mission of the institution, which is to provide non-partisan assistance to black elected and appointed officials, who were coming out of the Civil Rights Movement and the passage of the Voting Rights Act [1965], coming into office with a greater degree of frequency.  And so they said, "If you, insist upon it being attached to a university, then it must be attached to a black university."  And they said, "Well, Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] is the obvious place."  And so, but at that time, Dr. Kenneth Clark himself headed a Think Tank called MARC, which was an acronym for Metropolitan Applied Research Center in New York.  And he was--his, center was supposed to help with the growth and development of the Joint Center.  And so we came into being, really with two sponsors, Howard University and the Metropolitan Applied Research Center.  And so when they figured it--tried to determine what to call this new animal, one name was, "Well, let' call it the Center for Political Studies."  Well, there're a gazillion Centers for Political Studies around.  So there had to be some distinguishing characteristics.  And they said, "Well, it has sponsors, let's call it Joint Center for--."  Hence, the name Joint.  Nothing more profound than that.  Very practical.  We later changed our name to Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies to more fully describe what it is that we, that we do.  But I made that transition from Chicago, despite from heady protests from my then boss, the President, who did not want me to leave.  And he said to me, "I just cannot understand why you would leave a great university and go some place I never heard of."  And I said, "Well, the number one challenge to me is to make it a place that you have heard of."  And some time--several years--and I came here.  And several years after that, and I don't remember the exact year, but [Richard] Nixon was [U.S.] President, you know.  And they had the Saturday Night Massacre [October 20, 1973] when he fired the Attorney General [Elliot Richardson]  and a lot of other people left and what not.  Well, [University of Chicago President] Edward Levi was picked to become, the successor Attorney General of the United States.  And he moved to Washington [D.C.] to take over the Justice Department.  And I went up to call on him, make a courtesy call, and said, "I'm having a dinner and I'd like for you to--the Joint Center's having a dinner.  I'd like for you to come.  Would you come, be a dais guest."  So he said yes.  And he came and was introduced as the Attorney General of the United States.  We had a fairly sizable crowd, and it was pretty impressive.  And so I went up to him and whispered, "Well, now, you've heard about the Joint Center.  So you know what it is."  And so he said, "Yes, I now know."  When I was being interviewed for this job, I told several interviewers--I reflect on this a lot because I think it may have been very arrogant on my part.  I said, "If you're interested in someone who is a charismatic civil rights leader, that really isn't me.  If you're interested in someone who knows all the black leadership in America, that really is not me.  But if you're interested in someone who is committed to building an institution that will survive, I would consider that to be a challenge."  And, well, they said, "Well, it's--build the institution."  And they hired me.  And I'll just flipped to the end, and the end game in a sense, it has been a marvelous experience for me.  And a lot of people have, have contributed.  I mentioned earlier that Louie Martin not only was one of the founders, he was our first Board Chairman.  And we've had some very good Board Chairmen.  And the place has gone from seven staff when I came in 1972 to close to forty-five today, with offices in Washington [D.C.] and Johannesburg, South Africa.  And our budget at the time I came was $400,000 a year, mainly, from the Ford Foundation.  Today it's $6.5 million, from a diverse, from diverse sources.
Speaker 1: And that's extremely important for this kind of organization, right?
Speaker 2: Well, you've got to sustain it, that's right.  And if you want to bring in top-notch scholars, and people to do work, you have to pay them what they're worth in the, marketplace.  And so, yeah, it's very important.
Story_ID: 15428
Speaker 1: But politically, the diverse nature of the funding, you know, ensures that you can't be, you know, that it's no one source that can choke you off.
Speaker 2: Well that's right.  That helps.  And we [Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, Washington, D.C.] still get, you know, some support from the Ford Foundation, but it's not the, principal supporter that it was for a number of years.  Foundation-wise, we get support from--we've gotten support from Ford [Foundation], Rockefeller [Foundation], Carnegie [Endowment for International Peace], Knight [James S. and John L. Knight Foundation], Joyce [The Joyce Foundation] in Chicago [Illinois], MacArthur [Foundation] in Chicago and a number of other--.  And we get corporations, good supporters.  What we want to do, what we want to do now is to build a base for individual supporting--supporters from people who give money through planned giving through their estates or their wills or who give large sums of money because they're wealthy.  You know, in America 85 percent of all philanthropy is with individuals, not foundations and not corporations.  It's individuals who have--who give the most money.  So that's, what we're working on now to develop that aspect of our, fundraising.  When we came--when I came, the mission of the Joint Center [for Political and Economic Studies] was to provide assistance to black elected officials principally.  And there were several thousand at the time.  Now, it's close to ten thousand.  And we did a lot of traveling, a lot of training because many of the people who, many of the blacks who were elected to office in the beginning were the natural leaders in the community.  They were the top farmers or the top teachers and whatnot, you know, and so then, when the offices opened up, they were the ones that--they had no prior--particular prior government experience or training.  And so we provided that for many of them, you know, training in administration planning, budgeting, training in resource identification, resource acquisition, proposal writing, some of the, ropes in terms of how you conduct yourself and whatnot.  And we used to go around the country and had a number of--as well as have a number of forums here in Washington [D.C.].  Our mission changed and as a result of having done that for close to ten years, and with then--with, more sophisticated and experienced people running for office, and later on you get the [Atlanta, Georgia Mayor] Maynard Jacksons and the  [Atlanta, Georgia Mayor] Andrew Youngs and others who come in with significant training and experience.  And you get others who have also worked in the political field.  So they didn't need the fundamentals as much as some of the people in the early years.  And many of them were organized by level of office.  We were involved in helping to create an organization called the National Black Caucus of Local Elected Officials, National Caucus of State Legislators, the National Conference of Black Mayors, National Association of Black County Officials.  So they're all organized by level and they have staffs at those level, as well as their personal staff.  So providing that kind of technical assistance was no, longer as important as it had been.  But what was important was getting the right kind of information in their hands that dealt with their constituencies.  And there was nobody providing that.  As a result, as--as a matter of fact, digressing a bit, one of the things that made the Joint Center such an interesting concept in the beginning was that it, was proposed--it was designed to do some things that nobody else was doing, namely, to worry about black political participation and influencing the public policy arena.  That was not the work of the Urban League.  That was not the work of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  It was not the work of any other organization.  So it was new.  When it came into being, it, was new, and so, fortunately, it was planted in fertile soil, and it grew so that today it is a peer with these other organizations.  And we work together collaboratively to be mutually supportive.  We create a lot of information that they use in their programs and to formulate their policies and activities and to get to their constituency.  My coming to the Joint Center sort of resulted from several, sort of strands that the Joint Center brought together.  I'd always been interested in writing and in journalism and in publishing.  I'd all--I'd studied Political Science and was always interested in politics.  I had been involved in international affairs.  I knew something about public relations.  I'd had a number of things that my experience in the [United States] military had brought to me.  And I said to myself, "Well, I've been involved in a lot of interesting learning experiences, all in a predominantly white setting.  Maybe I have learned some things that will prepare me to help become more effective in the black community or with respect to blacks."  And I saw my coming to the Joint Center really as the, sort of the, the coming together of a lot of the things that I had done and experiences I had had and the training I had, and therefore, this would be a forum or a place in which I could use this to improve the social and economic status of African Americans.  And that's what we've been trying to do.  We use the tools of research to do that, but our fundamental goal is to improve the, social economic status of African Americans and to strengthen their role, their participation in the political and public policy life of this country.  So that's why we say--one of our--our theme today is to empower people to help themselves through information and technology.  We think that's critically important.  And so we've, come this far.  And I think we've done a number of things.  We--I spoke earlier about honoring my mentor and friend and one of the founders of the Joint Center, [Deputy Chairman of the Democratic Party] Louis Martin, with the creation of the first annual Louis E. Martin Great American Award, which on April 14, 2003, we gave to [U.S.] President Jimmy Carter.  And we will give that award away each year at our annual dinner.  And my hope is that it will, it will go on to become as famous as the Spingarn Medal [awarded annually for outstanding achievement by a black American] is to the NAACP.
Story_ID: 15429
Speaker 1: Can you give me an example of I guess how, you know, a study, you know--I've been reading (unclear) the studies and your work, it seems to me, influences journalists on some level, I mean they're able to quote statistics and quote trends and so forth, you know, and talk about it.  And you all are authoritative on these (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: We are--we're the one organization that probably knows more about black elected officials and the black voter than any other in the country.  That has been our bread and butter since day one.  And each year we have improved our skill in finding out more about them.  We now do national surveys of the black population, extensive surveys, attitudinal surveys.  And so we can tell you generally what they're thinking and which candidates they're leaning toward, what kinds of programs they're interested in, what they're not interested in, who--which leaders they like, which leaders they don't like.  The other area that is purely unique is that we have kept a census of black elected officials since the beginning of the organization.  And we continue to keep a, record of all of the elected officials in the United States.  And we have a database in which we can print that out by, name, by title, by city, by zip code, by dates of office and what not.  So, and--.
Speaker 1: So, for instance, with a candidate, I mean with an black elected official, if I chose a certain person, I can go in that database and find out how many--where they, who they represent, how many years they've been there--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --what their voting record is and their--
Speaker 2: We don't have the voter record, but we can access--we know where to get it.  There are some other--if you want a voting record, say of a member of Congress, you go to the 'Congressional Quarterly' [periodical] and they have that.  And you can pull that off of their site.  So we don't follow their voting records.
Story_ID: 15430
Speaker 1: Can you tell me where the politician stands on certain issues [from the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies database]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Well, I can do that in terms of going to someone else's website.  We don't collect that ourselves.  We know because we're attentive to politics and we read a lot and we can tell you the kinds of things that [U.S.] Congressman Charlie Rangel [New York] is interested in, for example.  That's because at the national level, you have more information that's more readily available than in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  I couldn't tell you some of what, what some of the issues are there.  I know how to find out, by looking at newspapers and talking to certain people.  But we do more in terms of their overall trends, the numbers, where they're located.  And that will tell you something about political influence.  For example, one of the areas that we contributed to that was so significant in the, in the early '70s [1970s], was producing--reproducing census data that dealt with the black population.  In other words, there were people who didn't know that there were enough of them in a certain congressional district that if they came together, they can have some influence.  And you don't know that unless somebody tells you.  You don't know it if you're sitting right there in the middle of it.  You haven't counted everybody.  And so we would say, each year--each two years--we publish something called, 'The Congressional District with the Largest Proportion of Blacks.'  So a lot of people saw that and said, "Man, if we, we got these kinds of numbers and we got our act together, we could either challenge and win that seat or influence whoever's got it."  And so that led to a lot of muscle flexing and people like former [U.S.] Congressman Walter Fauntroy [District of Columbia], used to be he'd go all over the country, taking the Joint Center's [for Political and Economic Studies] data and telling people, "Look, you've got the muscle here.  And you got the potential.  And this is what you did in voting last time and this is the potential.  And this is the votes you didn't use, and you've got to get people registered to vote and get them to the polls.  And, you know, here are some of the issues to support."  So it was the information that led to that kind of, of action that got the whole black political movement going.  And blacks then started to pay more and more attention to, to politics and public policy issues and focusing in on whoever the incumbents were, whether they were black or white or male or female, but people who had some control over their lives and their livelihood.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And it was the information that was so critically important.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you provide the data for a power analysis, you know, basically, that politicians can use for (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right.  We provide the baseline information.  The, gunpowder, if you will.  Now, somebody has to take that gunpowder, put it in a shell and put it in the musket and fire it.  We don't do that.  Our expertise is in providing the information and it goes to Democrats and Republicans.  It goes to liberals and conservatives.  That doesn't concern us.  You can use it as long as you're using it to improve the lot of the people we care about.  You can debate over which is the best way. Democrats and Republicans can debate which is the best way to pursue black economic empowerment.  That's fair.  Or liberals and conservatives can debate over which is the best way to achieve black, minority economic empowerment.  But if you're using the kind of data we've got, you're coming at it from a good way.
Speaker 1: You're informed.
Speaker 2: You're informed, that's right, you're informed.  Now, you put your own edge on it.  And people have all kinds of reasons for putting their own spin on it, you know, (laughter).  Now, we've been used on both sides.  There was a [U.S.] Supreme Court case dealing with voting rights in Mississippi in which the State of Mississippi was being sued for denying blacks the right to vote and to elect office--politicians of their choice.  And so the, the attorneys for the plaintiff came into court and said, "Your Honor, we have data here from the Joint Center that shows what the population--what the voting age population is for the State of Mississippi, how many black elected officials there are and that that percentage in relation to white officials is not as great as the percentage of the population, you know, on their own."  And so that was a pretty powerful case.  But the Attorney from, for the State of Mississippi made his defense argument, and in his argument, he said, "Your Honor, we have data here from the Joint Center for Political Studies that shows how much of a gain there has been made in Mississippi over the past ten or fifteen years." So you're--looking at the same data, you can manipulate it for your own purposes.  And that's (laughter) fascinating.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's fascinating.
Speaker 1: I've read--we have research in the folder about the Joint Center [for Political and Economic Studies], where that was used (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: There's a study that seems--I mean there was one paper that was one paper that's designed to encourage Republicans, I mean black involvement in the Republican Party using data from Joint Center (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, people use it in many different ways.
Story_ID: 15431
Speaker 1: We [Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, Washington, D.C.] are perhaps best known for our research and data in the political arena, but we have it in other areas as well, economic data.  We've done studies on the black worker in the twenty-first century.  We have done data on best practices, looking at hiring when we do work on EEO [Equal Employment Opportunity].  We do work on minority business, done a lot of research and some experts here on, minority businesses.  And one of the areas that I'm most proud of now that's going to be our engine of the future has to deal with technology.  We are, in the process of producing, in collaboration with the Census Bureau, some unique computerized databases that will people at the grassroots level to, access and manipulate data that is an interest to them, whether it's teenage pregnancy or about schools or school lunches and whatnot.  Right now, to get a lot of that information, people would have to come to sophisticated researchers like us or elsewhere to get somebody to, look at that, especially if you want a cross tab it, look at it across the jurisdictions.  You want to compare what's happening in Atlanta [Georgia] with what's happening in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], with what's happening in Detroit [Michigan].  That's three sets of data pools you've got to look at.  Now, based on our system, the system would pool from those three databases and put it all together and give you a printout that gives you one single comparative analysis.  And this is going revolutionize research and revolutionize a lot of the--particularly research at the local level.  And it's going do a lot, you know, it'll do a lot for us in terms of our doing our research, especially, as we, start dealing with larger and larger data sets.  You know, one set is the Census Bureau.  There's a Bureau of Labor Statistics.  There's the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which has huge amounts of data.  So we call that program Databank.  And right now, one can see it on the web, parts of it anyway and access information from the web.  We have converted it into what we call, "user-friendly" fact sheets.  The question is education, rather than giving you a dump of information about education, we have selected the key questions that people generally ask.  And we've answered those questions in little fact sheets with bar graphs and whatnot.  So we're very proud of that.  We a, a major program going on here--this is all in addition to the research, but it's all research-based, that we call NABRE, which is an acronym for Network of Alliances Bridging Race and Ethnicity.  And this brings together a wide array of groups.  There are racial groups, ethnic groups, human relations groups, civil rights groups, all concerned with improving relationships among people.  And we commun- we, communicate with them by our website and by computer.  And we have, chat rooms in which people can talk about race relations.  They can talk about community relations.  They can talk about--and you can hook up people in Boston [Massachusetts] with people in Miami [Florida] and have them communicating with one another and sharing best practices.  We're very high on that as being one of our growth areas.  But we rely upon the bread and butter of politics.  We're getting ready for, 2004.  We'll be analyzing the black vote going into 2004 and, beyond.
Story_ID: 15432
Speaker 1: Okay, and this is really a loaded for you, but we ask everybody, you know, what are their hopes and concerns for the black community?  And this, you know, we're coming right to the database for this one.
Speaker 2: Well, the goal is, from an institutional standpoint, which also coincides with my personal view, and that is to improve the social and economic status of our people, to get them to the point where, where, say the average American is.  We're below the average, not to mention the, you know, above average, from an economic standpoint.  All of the data show that there are these disparities, whether the subject is education or employment or healthcare.  And that's just not natural, you know?  And then what, what we want to do is to level that, level the playing field.  And that's why the whole affirmative action issue that's before the [U.S.] Supreme Court is all that, is, so critical and it's so important.  And we have been producing a lot of information on education and education-related statistics to help people better understand the disparities.  Another area that is a major growth area for the Joint Center [for Political and Economic Studies, Washington, D.C.] is healthcare.  We recently received a grant of $7 million from the [WK] Kellogg Foundation to create a health policy institute that will focus on health--disparities in the health area, affecting African Americans and other minorities.  And what we hope to do is to bring, is to create a voice for the people in a sense who are voiceless in the public policy--health policy arena and in many ways, a vote, or the people who are not at the table when healthy policy is being debated, to help influence health outcomes.  That's very important.  And there're disparities in terms of the, black community in general.  There's some significant disparities when it comes to, men within the black group and women within the black group.  And being a male, you will understand some of the problems that are unique to, to males in terms of prostate cancer and issues like that, have disastrous implications for African American males.  So this is very important, and we're very high on it.  And it's going to be a major growth area for us in the future.  We're looking at some areas now in which we can put together the health policy institute and the databank for new kinds of programs.
Story_ID: 15433
Speaker 1: Sir, now, the Joint Center [for Political and Economic Studies, Washington, D.C.] has another office in [Johannesburg] South Africa now?  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, we've been in South Africa for close to ten years.  We've been there doing--we first started working in South Africa and throughout Southern African really, and worked with, in connection with the National Endowment for Democracy.  And then we got involved in creating an office there to work with preparing for a democratic government in South Africa with the--on the release of [Nelson] Mandela from prison [1990].  And we stayed on to work with the electorate and to work with elected officials there as we did in the United States.  And today, most of our work focuses on economic development in--on health, mainly, HIV/AIDS [Human Immunodeficiency Virus / Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome], which as you know, is of epidemic proportions in South Africa.  We have a staff of about six people there who are focusing on these issues.
Story_ID: 15434
Speaker 1: Now, as politicians come and go, some are better than others at using data.  In Chicago [Illinois], we were fortunate enough to have Harold Washington for a few years [1983-1987] as Mayor, and he was an expert at using data.  Who are some of the politicians who impressed you the most with their acumen, I guess, in terms of reading your data.
Speaker 2: (Laughs)  I don't feel comfortable trying to, trying to grade them in terms of their acumen.  And I certainly don't know all ten thousand of them personally, but let me just tell you some of the ones that I think, on balance, are very effective in what they do and some of the ones who have been.  And this is not to create any kind of invidious comparison, but I think of people like [U.S.] Congressman Charles Rangel [New York], who is the leading Democrat in the House, Ways and Means Committee, a committee of, some power.  One of your Chicago Congressmen ran for a number of years.  I think in terms of at the Congressional level--.
Speaker 1: Rostenkowski ran it.
Speaker 2: Dan Rostenkowski.  I think in terms of the Congressman from--John Conyers from Michigan, who was the leading Democrat in the House Judiciary Committee.  And these are people who are--these are powerful positions.  What that means is, if the Democrats take power of the House, Charles Rangel becomes Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, arguably the most powerful committee there is.  If the Democrats return to head the--take power in the House [of Representatives], John Conyers becomes Head of the Judiciary Committee, unprecedented power.  So I think of them, and obviously, there are many others at the Congressional level who are effective.  At the Mayoral level, I think of the former Mayors like Maynard Jackson, when he became Mayor of Atlanta [Georgia].  He used that office to significantly give economic power to African Americans.  He would not let any big deals go through unless blacks were at the table.  That had to do with, with Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport [Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport] as well as many other projects.  He would just, wouldn't let them go through unless, you know, blacks had a chance to be at the table.  And that really is what people are asking for, a chance to be at the table, a chance to, or an opportunity to get my bid in.  And it's not, not that they want to replace somebody else, but, you know, historically, we've just been outside the room.  At the, the local level--it depends on circumstances.  I was talking the other day to--and I still think of him as Mayor Johnny Ford, in Tuskegee, Alabama.  He's no longer Mayor.  He's a legislator and, by-George, he told me he'd changed parties.  He's now a Republican.  And he had been a life-long Democrat.  And he said he just decided he thought he could best accomplish his goals and then best meet the needs of the community of his people--his community by becoming a, Republican.  A name you mentioned earlier, [Mayor] Coleman Young of Detroit [Michigan], very effective as a, leader.  The young Mayor [Kwame Kilpatrick] whose there now, I don't know him-- I, I've met him.  I don't know him as well.  His mother [Carolyn Cheeks-Kilpatrick] is a member of Congress, but I'm sure he will do well.  So it all depends on who they are.  They're good people all over.  First of all, you've got to say, anybody who gets elected to dogcatcher and above has got to have something going for him, you know, both skill and guts.  And so to stand for office and then to, meet the test scrutiny that's given to you by your electorate as well as by the media and, not to mention your opponents, says that you've a lot of things going for you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we have, since the, very beginning, we have worked with black elected officials around the country.  I'm delighted to say that we still do.  We provide information that they use.  They get synopsis or copies of all of our publications.  They get our monthly magazine, 'Focus', which we get feedback from them saying, "This was very useful background information or economic stuff or international stuff on HIV/AIDS [Human Immunodeficiency Virus / Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome] or on health."  It doesn't give them all the answers, but it does give them a policy framework for considering many of the issues that come before them.  And it also tells them where they can get additional information.  One of the things that we had been working on recently, we had been talking to a number of elected officials who've become sensitive to the need to provide leadership opportunities for young African Americans.  We've been talking to people at the Tavis Smiley Foundation.  They were very much concerned about young African Americans.  And we've been talking to some other people about this.  And so we've created and working on a concept now that looks at, black leadership.  Because if you look around at many black organizations, including this one, you have leaders who have been there a long period of time.  And the question becomes, "Who succeeds them?"  We don't always do a good job of bringing our young people in to get the kind of experience and training that they need in order to succeed.  Quite often, historically, I think many black leaders have kept them out because they don't want them to become the competition.  But that's not useful in the long run.  And so we want to do something that elevates youth leadership and that talks about new kinds of opportunities.  The young--many of the, opportunities and the skills that lie ahead are going to require skills and minds that are far more nimble than mine, and those of many other leaders as well, because we're into the area of high technology and computers and being able to see how we can use those sciences in order to accomplish, again, that fundamental goal, improving the socio-economic status of African Americans and enhancing their influence in the political and public policy arenas.
Story_ID: 15435
Speaker 1: Now, there's one initiative [Commission on Black Men and Boys, Washington, D.C.]  involving young men and black men and boys, right?  And grew out of the Million Man March [1995, Washington D.C.], I guess?
Speaker 2: There was an initiative.  And we, have completed our phase of it, which was a research phase, a get-it-off-the-ground phase and a research phase.  It is now continuing under the leadership of [U.S.] Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton [District of Columbia] because it's a district program.  We hope it will be seen as a prototype that could be employed around the country.  One of the things that the Congresswoman noted, and we certainly agree, and she called me in to talk about it.  She said, "You know, regardless of what one thought about the Million Man March, it did indeed mobilize a lot of people whose intention was captured for a short, a relatively short period of time, and whose consciousness was raised."  But they went back home, and nothing changed.  Nothing happened.  The status quo (unclear).  There was no catchment, there was nothing to take advantage of all that had happened.  And that's true too.  And so she said, "Well, why don't we think about creating something here in the district that can tap into that kind of interest and enthusiasm."  Well, the first thing you need to do is to find out, well, what exists in the district?  What kinds of programs are there for young, young black men and boys?  The next thing you need to do is what are interests and needs of this community?  And so we've done some surveying in the district.  And then you want to find out, well, what are some things that other people have done around the country, some good practices?  And then the next thing, who are some of the leaders you want to get involved in this program.  And so we, together with the Congresswoman, have done it.  She recruited [professional football player] George Stark.  I don't know whether that name is familiar to you, but during the hay day of the [Washington] Redskins, George Stark was a guard or a tackle.  I mean he is a big man.
Speaker 1: One of the hogs (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's right.  One of the early hogs, that's right.  And George Stark provides community leadership for that, program.  But we provided the information, and for which the Congresswoman was appreciative.  And now, she's--the Initiative is hers.  It's at the community action level now.
Story_ID: 15436
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you were a Vice Chairman of something called the Black Leadership Forum.  Now, what is that?
Speaker 2: The Black Leadership Forum is an organization of some of the major, let's call them, civil rights and service organizations in the country that was created in 1977 at the instigation of Vernon Jordan when he was head of the National Urban League.  And the question was there, you know, there's an Urban League, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], there's [President, National Council of Negro Women] Dorothy Height, there's [civil rights activist] A. Philip Randolph [Asa Philip Randolph], all these group--we're rich in organizations, both national and local.  But we don't have a way of communicating all the time.  And, and we generally don't get together to communicate unless there is a real crises.  In a crisis, we'll communicate, but when things look to be business as usual, we don't.  And so the forum then was conceived as a--bringing, as a place that, an entity that brought together these national black leaders to talk about issues of concern to them and to come up with a single voice in which they could articulate those points of view, and where they reached consensus to go back to their individual or their respective organizations and play out that agenda, whether the subject was voter registration or the subject was healthcare or the subject was whatever.  And so the forum was created to do that.  And Vernon is head--you can just think of some of the people who've been the head of it.  Vernon was head of it for a while, [lawyer, minister] Ben Hooks was head of it for a while.  The longest-term leader has been the Reverend Joseph Lowery, who now is Chairman Emeritus.  And he, you know, he's retired.  But he still provides some, leadership and support.  We have an Executive Director in a woman whose name is [policy scholar] Dr. Yvonne Scruggs-Leftwich who provides leadership for him.  So the Forum, that's, the history of the Forum.  It came in 1977 and the leadership of Vernon Jordan, it still exists.  It, like so many organizations, finding it tough sledding in today's economy.  And I think it's time to--and I've said this to my colleagues on the Forum, for us to step back and take another look at the Forum to see whether the goals, the mission and goals that it set for itself back in 1977, are as relevant today as they were in 1977.  It's always relevant to bring black leaders together, but how do you do--what, what are the circumstances under which you do that?  How do you organize them because they're all out there scuffling and leading their own organizations.  And they don't have all the time in the world.  And they're trying to get the resources to run their group.  So what is the best way to relate to them?  So it's a concept that in my view is still a useful one.  I think we may need to look at some different methodologies in terms of how we support people who are in the top positions.  And the names are-- you know, I mentioned some of the names, the Urban League, the Legal Defense Fund, A. Philip Randolph, Dorothy Height's National Council of Negro Women, the Joint Center [for Political and Economic Studies] is a member, [National Organization of] Blacks in Government is a member, and then, you know, there are about thirty-five or forty heads of organizations who are part of the board of that group.

Speaker 1: Now, some have said there's a crisis in black leadership going on now.  And I can't remember a time when somebody wasn't saying on some level, but what's your assessment of black leadership.  I know you mentioned a few minutes ago, moments ago that you know, [Mayor, Detroit, Michigan] Coleman Young, who is now dead.  And we had another man in Detroit.  Now, we have a young man [Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick] whose thirty-one, thirty-two years old--
Speaker 2: Representing the wave of the future.
Speaker 1: So what's your assessment of today's black leaders?
Speaker 2: I never quite knew--known what that meant, I--the term "crisis in black leadership."  Does it mean we don't have any black leaders today?  That doesn't make much sense.  Does it mean that the ones who are there are not effective?  That's a judgmental question.  How, do we determine--measure effectiveness?  So it's kind of a feeling that many people have that they call crisis in black leadership.  And it's a feeling that is born out of a sense of frustration or despair that we aren't getting where we ought to be, and therefore, it's the fault of leadership.  Well, we know it's many different reasons for that, not always the leadership.  But I do think that there is--when I hear it, I think in terms of the leadership developing some collective goals, in addition to their own individual goals.  Now, they're, individual leaders and then there are collective leaders.  Individually, people have to determine what works for them.  Collectively, when you're working on behalf of the larger community, not just, Dayton, Ohio, but nationwide, is when you need to bring together leaders to break bread together, to comfort one another, which is very important when you're on the point.  But more importantly, to hear the same kinds of information, to have some facts brought to them about relating to some issues that concern them, and having--and discussing those issues behind closed door so to speak, or at least out of the public limelight until you can reach some consensus or determine that you can't reach consensus and therefore, let everybody go on and do what he or she wants to do.  But where you can reach consensus, you should, it's possible to put together a bold leadership drive in which you have everybody reading from the--singing from the same hymnal so to speak, which is far more effective than one or two voices to, continue the analogy crying in the wilderness.  So that is a void that the [Black Leadership] Forum sought to exist, seeks to exist.  That has not always been there.  When you go back, the period that you seem to be an authority on, the period of the '60s [1960s], where the leadership was a relatively manageable group of people, who do we think about?  We think of, we think about those who are in, in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].  You think about Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  You think about Urban League.  You think about the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  You think about [President, National Council of Negro Women] Dorothy Height.  Well, those people talked to one another, and they supported one another.  But then, along comes a Joint Center [for Political and Economic Studies], and we're working with a new--as they would say, "A breed of cat," black elected officials.  Every one of them, all ten thousand of them say they're a leader.  And they don't back off from the Urban League and the NAACP (laughter) or anybody.  So how do you integrate them into "the leadership?"  That's what makes this whole question of leadership very important.  And you notice that it's only--it's probably only your minority communities that people talk about the leadership, you know.  I don't think I've ever heard anybody talk about the white leadership.  Who is the white leadership?  They're talking about individuals who've got power or groups with power, but we, tend to place emphasis on that.  And I understand that's for historical reasons, and the way, and slavery and whatnot.  And so it's nothing, wrong with it.  But I think when they say, "the crisis," that's what people are talking about.  Some people are talking about the fact that there's some people out there with agendas that are different from theirs.  If you look at some of the black conservatives, you know, when they say that black leadership is in crisis, that means they don't agree with them.  They think they're too much dependent on government.  They think they're too Democratic, and whatnot, so black leadership is in crisis.  So it all depends on who is, whose coming out of that.  But my view is that we need--that people are doing the best they can today as indeed they did fifty or a hundred years ago under the circumstances they find themselves in.  Today's circumstances are extraordinarily complicated for a number of reasons.  A lot of success has been achieved.  When you step back to look at the achievements of civil rights and the equal opportunity under the affirmative action, they have been significant.  Are we fully there?  No, and that's frustrating when you get close enough to see the goal, and you still can't get there, that's very frustrating.  And that's where we are.  I think we've come close enough to see the goal, but we are having a hard time getting those last twenty-five yards.  And so that's why I think we're seeing this major fight around affirmative action.  And that's why we're likely to see a major fight around some health care issues, a major fight around the tax cut issues, which it, becomes a political and ideological issue.  And without aiming to be partisan, the tax issue on the Republican side has more to do with concerns--it's more than economic.  It also is an attempt to take money away from social programs, and give it back to people who are disproportionately wealthy and disproportionately supportive of Republican ideas.  And to deny that money, you can't help education, and you can't support welfare if you don't have any money.  And if you take the surplus, and you give it all away on the grounds of, "Well, I'm going to do this to stimulate the economy.  So more people will get money."  Well, that's a crapshoot as to whether that's going to happen or not.  So the issues, are complicated, but we need to bring people together to, not only identify the issues, analyze the issues, but sometimes disaggregate them so we can see where we have friends and where we have allies and where our foes are because not all of our allies are Democrats and not all of our foes are Republicans.  And we need to be astute enough to figure out where or allies--or who our allies are, in any given arena at any given time on any given issue, and not just be so generic that we're going to always be with this group or always be with that group or always take this position.

Speaker 1: One of the areas where the Joint Center [for Political and Economic Studies, Washington, D.C.] gets a lot of attention, perhaps good and bad, has to do with some of our national surveys.  On our surveys, in looking at education, we often ask the question of people, what they think about vouchers?  Well, we have noticed a trend, and we've been talking about this and publishing it for at least five or six years, a growing trend among blacks to say they're supportive of vouchers.
Speaker 2: School vouchers?
Speaker 1: School vouchers.  Now, to me, personally, that's a little comp- annoying in the sense that I'm not sure--I personally am not convinced that vouchers are the best thing, particularly, as they have been proposed by some people.  But I do think that the public schools need help.  There's no question.  Now, I don't know whether vouchers is the right answer, or take the money that you would put--take what you would put in vouchers and put it in the public schools to improve them.  But we've telling black leadership this for a long time.  Along come the conser- and they're "Oh well [raises hand up in the air], vouchers are no good, and blah, blah, blah, blah."  Said, "Well, that may be, but I'm telling you what the people are saying."  Now, the, conservatives come along, and what do they do?  "The Joint Center says that blacks are supportive of vouchers."  Now, that's partially--the Joint Center didn't say that.  We--our research shows that this is what they think.  And so then our friends in labor and our friends in the civil rights community go all up in arms, you know, "How could you say that?"  I said, "I didn't say it.  I'm just--I'm the messenger, telling you what they've been thinking along time.  If you want them to change their thinking, you'd better get out there and talk with them, talk to them.  Tell them why vouchers are not, if that's what you believe."  They're listening to people who are telling them, "If white folks can send their kids to a private school, wouldn't you like to send your kid to private school?" The answer is yes.  "If your public is not good, and would you like to have a better alternative?"  The answer is yes.  So don't put all of your eggs in the basket of damning vouchers.  Put some of your eggs in the basket of improving the public schools.  So--.
Speaker 2: There's also a faction of the black community that wants to control their own schools.  And they see the voucher idea as a way to do that (unclear) (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you've had some experience with that in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean more so in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] and Chicago's had some, but Milwaukee and there's some other cities.  I think Detroit [Michigan] has got a--they've rescinded some of their voucher stuff--.
Speaker 1: And Ohio was experimental on vouchers too.  Yeah, they've been, there've been some test cases.  I don't know of anywhere the outcome has been purely positive, and strictly positive.  And, yes, people do want to have some, influence.  And there are some other experiments that are out there also, magnets schools are out there, and some other institutions--.
Speaker 2: Charter schools.
Speaker 1: Charter Schools and whatnot.  And I think it's, important.  We look at them and we figure out what the results are and open our minds to them.  But when you get vouchers used as a political football by one party, and you get the other one, you know, and you get--well, it's, an enormously complex issue, and we shouldn't let--debate about that issue, cloud the goal.  The goal is how do to improve education for kids.  Now, if you tell me vouchers are wrong, tell me what's right.  This is what I would say to [U.S.] President [George W.] Bush, if you tell me affirmative action is wrong, the way Michigan is doing it, tell me a way to improve educational opportunities that's better than what they're doing.  And they can't.  I mean he, proposes a system dealing with high schools that is heavily dependent upon segregated high schools.  So coming up with solutions is not as easy as it sounds.  So some people just really trying to, trying to put up smoke screens.
Speaker 2: But it all starts with good information leading assessment of "where are we?"
Speaker 1: Well, that's true, that's true.  That's true, and we [Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies] try to, be the engine for that, and, you know, we are the only full-time black research, public policy institution in the country.  We're a think tank.  We can't deal with all of the issues and all of the problems, but we deal with a lot of them.  And when we can't provide information relating to some of them, based on our knowledge of our research and databases, we can tell people where to go to get the information.
Story_ID: 15439
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a productive relationship with the black press in terms of utilizing the data that you collect?
Speaker 2: We have a productive relationship in the sense that they get it.  I can't force them to use it.  They use it when it serves their purpose, and I don't mean that negatively.  They have, you know, and I've been a journalist.  And you, have other things you want to get in the paper other than a study from the Joint Center [of Political and Economic Studies, Washington, D.C.].  We get very good coverage in the, in the black press.  And we have a good relationship with NNPA [National Newspaper Publishers Association].  And I don't have any complaints.  I'd like to--we'd like to do more.  We've talked about getting together to have a, regular Joint Center column that gets in all the black press, but, you know, that can get loaded down with all kinds of political issues, some petty, some not so petty.  And so we just said, "We're providing it.  It's up to you to use it."

Speaker 1: Okay, now, and you've been a MacArthur Fellow [annual grant], and you've received numerous awards, you know, and what would you see at this juncture as your legacy?
Speaker 2: (Chuckles)  Well, my first thought is that I'm probably too young to be thinking about legacy (laughs), but anyway.  I think, in terms of, if one wants to do legacy, I think I would be arrogant enough to say that this institution [Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, Washington, D.C.] is my legacy.  I have given thirty-one years of my life to it.  It has been my honor to, serve this place.  And I'd like to think, as I said in the very beginning to the people who wanted to hire me, I'd like to think that I have not only been successful in running an organization, but that I have created an institution.  Institutions survive people.  Organizations generally do not.  Just an organization, the head of it leaves, most of the time the organization folds, okay.  We look at--well, some of the organizations coming out of the Civil Rights Movement when the head of it is gone, they tend to flounder.  And I think that I'd like to believe that I have succeeded in creating this as an institution, one that will survive me.  I'd like to believe that what we do is of enormous value, not only to black people, but to the society as a whole because it's the, society that has to solve these problems and just the black community.  We're all in it together.  So to the extent I have a legacy; it probably is that I have been here, low these many years.  We have helped a lot of people.  We've helped a lot of black elected officials.  We've helped a lot of civil rights leaders.  We've helped to open the eyes and minds of a lot of people.  You mentioned earlier the media.  The media is one of our major constituencies.  And we get a lot of information to them.  They don't always use it.  Sometimes they do.  When they do, it gives us a free ride.  It gives our information a free ride.  I don't have to pay for a book or whatnot.  So that would be it, I believe.  Yes, I was a MacArthur Fellow.  I was quite honored to be so, be selected.  And I would, to anybody who can get in a MacArthur Fellowship, I would say, it's really, really worth it.  They're very generous with their financial support and with giving you the opportunity to use it in any way that you see fit.  That is a, that's a rare opportunity anywhere.  It certainly is a rare opportunity in American life.

Speaker 1: Okay, just one last question, sir.  Wow would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as someone who made a significant and important contribution to society, including my own family, including my friends, including the people that I have had the honor to work with.  I'd like to be remembered as someone who, well, was committed to helping somebody along the way and as someone who has brought enough in mind and experience to understand and respect other people's points of view, persuasions, whether I agree with them or not.  I respect their right to have their own perspectives.  And I think that is a sign of both wisdom and maturity, which I'd like to think I have both.
