Speaker 1: --Jackson, and that was taken in August of 2004, just as I was taking over the board, chairman of the Board [Board of Trustees] of Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My aunt and my niece, Mignon Lewis [Mignon Lackey Lewis], [HistoryMaker] Yvonne Jackson, and Camille Townsend.  Mignon is a graduate of Spelman, and I am a graduate of Spelman, and we were at a dinner in 1992 in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: So, that is a picture of my immediate family, my mother, my father, my sisters.  So, Gwendolyn Jackson [Gwendolyn Lackey Battle]; Giles B. Jackson [Giles Jackson], he was an attorney in Los Angeles [California]; my mother who was a teacher; my older sister Mignon [Mignon Jackson]; Yvette [Yvette Jackson Townsend], my twin is on the left, and Yvonne is the smaller of the two little girls, that's me.  And that's the Jackson family in 19--I'd say I was five years old, so that was probably 1954, 1956.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I said infamously known as the twins, Yvonne and Yvette.  We were probably four or five months, maybe a little older, I don't know.  But that was probably 1950, Yvette and Yvonne Jackson, 1950.
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: Yvonne Jackson, taken in August, 2004, I think it was 2004, in front of Morehouse-James Hall of Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia, again, when I took over as chairman of Spelman College's board.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Yes. Oh gosh, what year was that?  That's Brenda Scofield and Yvonne Jackson.  I was receiving the Corporate Women's Network Award [ph.], leadership award.  And that was probably in 1984, approximately.
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: Charlie Lackey [ph.], great-great-great-grandfather, born in Indian Territory [Oklahoma].  And this picture was probably taken in 1886.
Speaker 2: Wonderful, okay.
Speaker 1: Fred [Frederick Jackson, Jr.] and Yvonne Jackson, taken 2005.
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: That is Nicodemus [Nicodemus Calbert (ph.)], and he was married to my grandm- great-great grandmother, let's see great-grandmother, Ozora.  And that picture was probably taken when he was young.  And the other picture you'll see later is of Ozora, and they were both young.  This was probably 1875.
Speaker 2: All right, ready.
Speaker 1: This is Ozora Guess.  She was my great-grandmother, a teacher.  Ozora Guess Calbert [ph.] was her name, probably taken about 1870.  It's really a sketch, 1870.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is a picture of my grandmother on my mother's side and grandfather, Doll [Doll Beaty Lackey] and Sevallia Lackey with their six children.  I love this picture.  My mother is in the middle of this picture, she's the one in the middle, kind of the tallest one in the middle.  And from left to right is Dr. Lawrence Lackey who was a physician in Detroit, Michigan; Wynola Carey [Wynola Lackey Carey], she was the principal of Palm Springs High School in Palm Springs, California; and Zenobia Wilburn [Zenobia Lackey Wilburn], they're all Lackeys, Wilburn.  She was a college professor in Phoenix, Arizona; my mother, Gwendolyn Jackson, a teacher in Los Angeles; my aunt Mignon Lewis, who was a teacher in Los Angeles; and my uncle, Mervyn Lackey, who is a retired superintendent of schools in Phoenix.  That's the family.
Speaker 2: And the front row?
Speaker 1: Oh, front row.  Doll Lackey, my grandmother, and Sevallia Lackey.  And that picture was taken in 19--it was their fiftieth wedding anniversary, I was ten years old.  So, that was taken in 1959.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Obviously, Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] and Yvonne Jackson.  I don't know who the other woman is.  This was taken on an Indian [Native American] reservation in, oh gosh, what town was that?  Somewhere way out in the middle of nowhere.  I actually flew on the Air Force One going into there, but--because our planes had to land in one city.  And Air Force One picked us up and took us to this place, and we were making a speech at this Indian reservation.  And I want to say that is 19--in the year 2000.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Probably taken in 1980.  And I picked this picture--it's a work picture.  Because it's a group of people, it was the first graduating class at the Institute for Diversity [American Institute for Managing Diversity], started at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia], by Roosevelt Thomas [Roosevelt Thomas, Jr.].  He's not in that picture, unfortunately.  But it was sort of a real culminating event.  Avon Products [Avon Products Inc.] sent some managers down to Atlanta for this first course, and it was an inaugural event, it was great.  So, I can't tell you who all those people are.
Speaker 2: Okay, can you name anybody?
Speaker 1: Yes, I can name Tony Carter [Anthony Carter], who's left.  I can name--the far left, I'm sorry--left side, yes, Tony Carter.  And I should remember the next guy's name because he was very senior, senior to me there.  I can't remember anybody else.  This guy is Roosevelt Tolliver, lives in Atlanta, an engineer.  Carol Wehberg [ph.], that's it.
Story_ID: 326447
Speaker 1: I just picked this picture because it was fun. I was being made up, and I was getting some award.  Again, I was with Avon [Avon Products, Inc.], and I can't even name the award.  That's the story, quick story.  And it was probably taken in 1982.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What was your position with Avon at the time?
Speaker 1: Maybe that wasn't Avon; maybe that was Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.].
Speaker 2: What's that? Hibiscus? Remember which-
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, it wasn't Avon, it was Sears.  So, it was probably 1975.  I was--so, my position at Sears was merchandising manager for the stores.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: These are some great photos.
Speaker 2: It's so wonderful to have them.  I don't think my family has anything.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, Giles B. Jackson [Giles Jackson] and Gwendolyn L. Jackson [Gwendolyn Lackey Battle], 1954.  Around the Brown--Brown v. Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] time, my father had just passed the bar, and he was just starting to practice law in Los Angeles, California.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What year is this?  Does it say on the cover? Nineteen ninety [1990], right, November, 1990?  Yes, November, 1990, November 1990 (laughter), I was vice president of human resources at Avon Products at the time.  And we had a big diversity effort going on, and Black Enterprise decided to come talk to us, and there I end up on the cover of Black Enterprise magazine in my pink jacket.  When that hit the newsstand, all these women who had been wearing black suits to work every day, and grey suits, called me and said, "What a statement, Yvonne [HistoryMaker Yvonne Jackson]."  I didn't wear a lot of black or grey, so I wore colors, as you can see from what I have on today.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can I talk now? That picture was taken when I first became vice president at Avon.  And I first became vice president, I was vice president of international human resources.  And that was in 1986.
Speaker 2: Okay, I just want to get a shot of the whole page.  Okay, we'll start with the individuals on the bottom left.
Speaker 1: Okay, Rachael McMullen, my great-great-great-grandmother, who was owned and the wife of Jasper McMullen [sic. Hugh McMullen].  Jasper McMullen was born in Carroll County, Georgia in 1837.  At five years old, he was taken to Lafayette, Mississippi [Lafayette County, Mississippi] and then to Tennessee.  He left Tennessee and went to Texas.  His, Hugh McMullen, his master and father, was an Irishman who settled McMullen County [sic. Hugh McMullen's father, John McMullen, settled McMullen County, Texas].  So, he's the son of Hugh McMullen and Rachael--let me just make sure I said this right.  Rachael was--no, Rachael was his wife.  Then there's four sons of Jasper [sic. Hugh McMullen], Betty [Betty McMullen Guess] and Jasper.  And then there is Betty, who was also the daughter of Jasper.  She's the one on the far right.  And she is my great-great-grandmother, the daughter of Rachael and Jasper.
Speaker 2: Very good, next.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So let's, yeah, let's correct this.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'll just mention that this a correction.
Speaker 1: Okay, correction.  (Laughter) I don't know my own family history, or I've forgotten it.  But this is a picture of Rachael, who was the daughter of Hugh McMullen--no, the wife--the slave owner.  Hugh McMullen was the master and father, and Rachael was his slave and his wife of one sort or another.  And she had these five children, actually, I think she had six.  We're learning about another one as we speak.  Betty McMullen, who is on the far right, is from my line.  And then there's a picture of her brother Jasper and other brothers, sons of Rachael and Hugh McMullen.  That's the story.
Speaker 2: All right, ready, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, that was a shot taken of me as I was being named a Black Achiever [Black Achievers in Industry].  And that was in 1983.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And who named you that?
Speaker 1: Harlem [New York, New York], the Harlem YMCA.
Speaker 2: Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: Yes, this is a picture taken with Rosey Grier [Roosevelt Grier] and Al Smith [ph.].  And I was just featured in Rosey Grier's book called 'The Multicultural Heroes,' [sic. 'Rosey Grier's All-American Heroes: Today's Multicultural Success Stories,' Roosevelt Grier] and that picture was taken at that time, and that was in 1988, maybe 1989.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, ready.
Speaker 1: This picture was taken of me in 1986, one of my first or second visits to Japan, Tokyo.  This is the, the man on the right is Eto-San [ph.], who I worked with for three years.  And I spent a great deal of time in Japan working with this man and other Japanese in the Avon business in Japan.  And the reason it's significant is I was one of the very few first African American women to actually work in Japan.

Speaker 1: My name is Tracey Lewis, I'm the interviewer.  And our videographer today is Matthew Hickey.  And we're here interviewing?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Yvonne Jackson.
Speaker 1: That's right.  And I didn't tell you exactly how we're going to go through this, but it's pretty simple.  Right now we're slating, so I'll just ask you our location, dates, and et cetera.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, Mrs. Jackson, where are we today?
Speaker 2: We're in Miami, Florida, and this is February 15th, 2006.
Speaker 1: I can't believe it's--
Speaker 2: Yesterday was Valentine's Day.
Speaker 1: Happy Valentine's Day.  And can you also give us the full spelling of your name?
Speaker 2: Yes, Yvonne, Y-V-O-N-N-E, and I use the middle initial R as in Ruth; and Jackson, J-A-C-K-S-O-N.  Jackson happens to be my maiden name and my married name.
Speaker 1: No way.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That's pretty lucky.  You didn't have to change your stationery or credit cards or anything.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And can you--
Speaker 2: I'm a Jackson-Jackson.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I like it.  And can you give us your date of birth?
Speaker 2: Yes, June 30, 1949.
Speaker 1: I still don't believe you, but I guess I have to. And can you tell us your occupation?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm a consultant, and I'm semi-retired.
Speaker 1: You're not old enough to be semi-retired.
Speaker 2: I'm fifty-seven years old this year, definitely.  But I'm--last year I said I was going to retire.  And I'm doing a couple of projects.  I'm on a couple of boards, and I said I was going to devote at least five years of my life to building all that I can do for Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] so as chair of this board [Board of Trustees].  And it certainly takes a bit of time.
Speaker 1: This is true, that's right.  And your side job is being the chairwoman of Spelman's Board of Trustees.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Are you the first alumna chair?
Speaker 2: No, I'm the third alumna chair.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Marion Wright Edelman was the first.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And she was chair for ten years.  And then June Gary Hopps was the second, and I prec- I followed her.
Story_ID: 326449
Speaker 1: So, now, step two is just kind of getting loosey-goosey here, ask you a couple, five People magazine-ish type questions.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is red.
Speaker 1: And your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Probably guacamole.  (Laughter) I don't know what made me think of that, but that seems good enough.
Speaker 1: Well, it's always good on everything.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Springtime.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?  Did I just ask your favorite color?  Oh, red, yes.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh, a saying, is there a favorite saying that you have?
Speaker 2: To thine own self be true.
Speaker 1: I like that one.  And you have a favorite vacation spot?
Speaker 2: Home, Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: What part?  Oak Bluffs [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Oak Bluffs, yes.
Story_ID: 326450
Speaker 1: Were you born in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] or?
Speaker 2: Born and raised in Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: What part of L.A.?
Speaker 2: South Central, now called Watts [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: I was born at White Memorial Hospital [White Memorial Medical Center, Los Angeles, California], my twin sister and I.  I am twenty-one minutes older than she is, so I'm a middle child as a result of that.  I have an older sister, Mignon [Mignon Jackson], and a twin sister Yvette [Yvette Jackson Townsend].  And I stayed in Los Angeles until just after my sixteenth birthday, and then I left to go to Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: So let's--well, let's go back a little and deal with age one through sixteen.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me your mom's full name and her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Yes, Gwendolyn Lackey Battle.
Speaker 1: Is that L-A-C-K-E-Y?
Speaker 2: L-A-C-K-E-Y, yes.
Speaker 1: And do you know where she was born?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was born in Oklahoma.  I don't know if I remember the--although I may have put it on that--because I called my aunt [Mignon Lackey Lewis] and asked her.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's right here.  In 1926.
Speaker 2: Did I say what city?
Speaker 1: You said Oklahoma.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, I didn't know the city.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you know anything about her childhood and her life in Oklahoma?
Speaker 2: Yes.  In fact, we went through some of these pictures.  I have pictures going back five generations of my mother's family.
Speaker 1: No way.
Speaker 2: But she, she grew up the middle child of six.  I shared a picture with her mother [Doll Beaty Lackey] and father [Sevallia Lackey] and their six children.  And my mother was, as I said, the middle, middle, middle, sometime middle of the six, I guess she was the top of the six.  She had three other sisters and two brothers, four of them have now passed.  My mother recently passed.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry to hear that.
Speaker 2: Thank you.  And, but she has a brother and a sister still alive, one of whom went to Spelman, which is how I got there.
Story_ID: 326451
Speaker 1: My grandmother and, my grandmother and grandfather were very active in the community.  My grandmother was a teacher.
Speaker 2: Do you know her name?
Speaker 1: Yes, Doll Beaty Lackey.
Speaker 2: Do you know where she was born?
Speaker 1: She was born in Waco, Texas.  And my grandfather was Sevallia [Sevallia Lackey]--I don't know his middle name-- Lackey.  I think it was Lawrence Lackey.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he was born in Indian Territory [Oklahoma].
Speaker 2: Where was--
Speaker 1: It wasn't a state at the time.
Speaker 2: And what do you know about their lives in Oklahoma?
Speaker 1: Well, my grandmother was a teacher.  And my grandmother at fourteen and fifteen years old left Oklahoma.  She grew up in Oklahoma, and left Oklahoma to work in Colorado and to work in California.  She was very adventuresome, my grandmother.  In fact, my grandfather never left Ardmore, Oklahoma, which was the town they settled in after they went--they graduated from Langston University [Langston, Oklahoma], both of them.  It was called Langston Normal [sic.] at the time.  Both of them went to become teachers.  My grandmother became a teacher, and my grandfather became a postal worker, probably one of the few and only black postal workers.  And when I say postal worker, actually he was a janitor in the post office, with a college degree.  And he, he had other side jobs too, but that was his primary responsibility.  He was very big in the community.  They went to the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, very active in their church.  And they just were great parents, and made sure all six of their children went to college, and worked hard to do that.  My grandmother was adventuresome.  I say she was a woman far ahead of her time in years.  Because she was so committed to educating her students, that every summer she would go and take a course here or take a course there.  She happened to take a course at Atlanta, at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and met Benjamin Mays, which is how my aunt [Mignon Lackey Lewis] ended up at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] and how I guess I ended up at Spelman.  Because all of her other children except for my mother [Gwendolyn Lackey Battle] and this aunt went to Langston, there in Oklahoma.  She went to New York [New York], and she took millinery at the Fashion Institute of Tech--Fashion Institute of Technology [New York, New York].  So, she was always one of these people that was educating.  My twin sister [Yvette Jackson Townsend] and I lived with her when we were ten years old.  And all I can remember about that experience was we would go to school, and she taught at the school we were going to.  And we'd come home and we got to play outside.  And then we would come back and we'd have our real lessons, which were with my grandmother.  (Laughter) There was at least an hour of geography lessons every night, and we learned about every country in the world and its capital.  At fifteen years old, I could you tell this; I could find it on the globe.  She had this huge globe in her bedroom.  Every, it was amazing what I learned at ten years old about the world, which has I think shaped my worldview.
Story_ID: 326452
Speaker 1: We were just talking off-camera about your [maternal] grandmother [Doll Beaty Lackey].  I'd like to capture that on tape as well, that you were saying--what were you, what did you wish about your grandmother growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I just, I said she was just such a brilliant person, and she was so committed to educating herself, and she had so much to offer the world.  And I said that when I was ten years old, and my twin sister [Yvette Jackson Townsend] and I lived with her for a year in Oklahoma.  My parents [Gwendolyn Lackey Battle and Giles Jackson] were in California, and we were there with her.  We wanted to stay, and for some reason we just, we went for every summer until we were probably thirteen.  But we went every summer.  And that summer that we went, we just, we begged my mother, "Let us stay with Grandmother, let us stay with Grandmother."  And we stayed that year.  And we'd go to school and we'd come home and we'd take off our clothes and put on our play clothes.  And that was when, you know, you dressed to go to school, and your play clothes weren't your clothes that you wore to school.  We'd put on our play clothes, go outside to play for a little while, and then we'd come in and have dinner.  And then after dinner we would have what I call the real lesson.  (Laughter) And we made straight As in school, but the real lesson was with my grandmother.  And that was her, you know, geography lesson or whatever lesson it was.  I don't know, it was always something extra.  And she, I just remember that year learning every country in the world and its capital, and I could show you where it was.  Now, my grandson who's five can tell you every state in the U.S., but he can't tell you where it is.  He's just, it's rote for him, and it should be at five.  I don't understand why they're doing that at five, but they are.  But anyway, every country, its capital--and you know, for example I learned that there were twenty-three Christmas Islands in the world.  And I could point out every, I could take you, on a globe--she had a very minute detailed globe--I could tell you where every one of those islands was in the world.  So, I mean, can you just imagine that (laughter)?
Speaker 1: That's pretty amazing.  I mean, so if I were to say, "What is the capital of--
Speaker 2: Of--
Speaker 1: --Fiji?"
Speaker 2: Yes, I could tell you that.  I can't tell you that today.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) But then.
Speaker 2: But I could tell you that then, and I could find it for you.
Speaker 1: That's pretty interesting (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not just, you know, not just tell you, I could find it on the globe.  I could tell you where it was, what region where it was.  And you know, it shaped my worldview.  It made me understand that, you know, the U.S. was here, we were here, and there was a great big world out there.  And most children don't understand that at that age.  You know, you don't understand there's a great big world out there, and lots of people in it other than yourself and the small community in which you grew up (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That there's more than in your backyard.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 326453
Speaker 1: So yes, my [maternal] grandmother [Doll Beaty Lackey] was quite special to me, and quite, obviously quite influential, very disciplined.  She and my grandfather [Sevallia Lackey] raising these six children, ensured that all six of them went to college and graduate school, and all the other things that they did.  And they, you know, they went to college.  They went to Langston [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma] to become teachers.  My grandmother became a teacher, and my grandfather went to work for the post office.  He was the janitor in the post office, and he retired from there after thirty years.  My grandfather never left the City of Ardmore [Oklahoma].  He was on all the local Chamber--black chambers of commerce, et cetera and very active in the community and his church, and he went to an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church.  And my grandmother went everyplace, she traveled everyplace with children, even after her children were grown.  She was all over the place.  My aunt gets married.  One of the photos I showed was my mother [Gwendolyn Lackey Battle] at my aunt's wedding.  She gets married in Los Angeles [California], my grandfather does not want to leave Ardmore to give her away, it's his favorite daughter.
Speaker 2: He didn't even leave?
Speaker 1: No, he did not come to give her away.
Speaker 2: Naughty.
Speaker 1: Naughty, yes.  He just was a guy that was into his community, and that was it.  My grandmother, on the other hand, was everyplace, and she traveled the world.
Story_ID: 326454
Speaker 1: That is just so intriguing to me, for a couple of reasons.  One, just because she [Jackson's maternal grandmother, Doll Beaty Lackey] sounds like such an incredible person.  But I'm also thinking about what, you know, racial barriers did she encounter in her travels, especially leaving, you know, the relative quietude of Los Angeles [California] or of Oklahoma and going to the Deep South.  And I'm not sure where Ardmore [Oklahoma] is in relationship to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's the middle of Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it's about--
Speaker 1: Did you hear any stories from her about--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you know, she didn't talk much about that.  It was interesting.  In fact, I'll tell you a story, and I remember it, because I don't know what age I was.  But my--she always had a car, my grandfather [Sevallia Lackey] had a car.  So we didn't have to take public transportation.  But one time we did, and this is in Ardmore.  And we get on the bus, and she's with my twin sister [Yvette Jackson Townsend] and I, and maybe my older sister [Mignon Jackson], I can't remember exactly.  My grandmother is very fair, she looks white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she gets on the bus with us, and this man doesn't realize we're all together or something.  And he is going to let her sit there, this white man.  And so, she's going to sit there in the front of the bus.  And there was some comment made that she could sit in the front, or what, what--there was some racial thing that happened.  It's vague in my mind, I was a little girl at the time.  And so she obviously sat in the back, she knew she was black.  But it's interesting.  That, that's, that's the only time.  And the other time was--we didn't understand all this, we were much too young.  We went to the pool.  Of course, all the kids in the pool, the community pool that my grandfather had worked with the community to build and have, we would go swimming every day there, and all this kind of stuff.  All the kids were black, and we didn't think much about it.  You just don't think about it, we were happy.  Although her neighbors were white--you know, Ardmore was not a, it was segregated I'm sure, but it was very interracial.  I mean two or three of her neighbors were white, so some were black and some were white.  You know, everybody had a lot of land there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It wasn't house right next--
Speaker 2: You weren't on top of each other.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was, she didn't talk much about race.  My grandfather didn't either.  They dealt with it, and they knew they had to work harder and ensure that their kids were working hard to be the best that they could be in the world that they were in.  But they didn't talk much about race.  And it's interesting.  I didn't get all this until, you know, I was in high school.  Because see, I'm in Watts [Los Angeles, California], I grew up in Watts.  And you know, our community was all black.  And now we had, we went to a church that was in our community, Bellview Community Church [Los Angeles, California].  And there were, we had a lot of exchange programs.  We worked on Indian [Native American] reservations in the summer and spring break, and various and sundry things.  We had a lot of exchange programs with different churches.  So, you know, all the stuff was going to get people connected.  But I didn't understand all of that, you know.  I watched on television some of the issues from the South, Selma [Alabama], and you know, lots of things that were going on, and the March on Washington, all that stuff.  So, but I didn't get all that until really I got to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Story_ID: 326455
Speaker 1: Let me ask you a little bit about your dad.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And can you tell me his full name?
Speaker 2: Yes, Giles Beecher Jackson [Giles Jackson].
Speaker 1: And do you know what year he was born, and where we was born?
Speaker 2: Giles Beecher Jackson.  Yes, he was born--I put it on that piece of paper and I don't remember exactly.
Speaker 1: Oh, let's see.
Speaker 2: But my mother [Gwendolyn Lackey Battle] was--
Speaker 1: Richmond, VA [Virginia].
Speaker 2: Yeah, Richmond, Virginia.  I knew it was Richmond, but I don't remember the date.  He's two or three years older than my mother.  And his family--so, he was from Richmond, Virginia.  He went to the, he was in the first black  Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] troop at fifteen years old.
Speaker 1: So, who did he lie to--
Speaker 2: He graduated from high school--a lot of people, but I think they let them in at that age.  And he was stationed in Guam and some other places.  Actually, as we were going through his papers after his death, we discovered he was in the Marines twice.  So, it seems like he was in the Marines then.  Then he came back and went to Virginia State [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], which is where he and my mother met, at Virginia State University in Virginia outside of Richmond.  And he, his parents were Roscoe Jackson--and I put on there Sadie, but it's really Bessie [Bessie Hilton Jackson], her first name was Bessie.  And Bessie was a teacher also.  My grandfather, Roscoe, was a politician in Richmond, I think that was his full-time job.  I can't tell you anything else I remember about him, other than that.  But his father was Giles Beecher Jackson, so my father was named after his grandfather.  And that Giles Beecher Jackson was the first black attorney in the State of Virginia.  And--
Speaker 1: Where did he go to school?
Speaker 2: I don't know where he went to school.  I'm not sure he went to school, but he passed the bar.  And what I couldn't find--and I don't know, I'm sick about it--I have a book that he wrote.  Because he and Frederick Douglass were big, big time buddies.  And they ran around Virginia and did all this emancipation stuff, and you know, were into all this stuff.  And he wrote a book called, it's called 'The Negro Industrialization' [sic. 'The Industrial History of the Negro Race in Virginia,' Giles Beecher Jackson] or something like that.  And I can't find my copy, and there are not many of them around.  My sisters [Mignon Jackson and Yvette Jackson Townsend] and I each had a copy of this book.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: But he was, he was a guy--he's well known in Virginia, this Giles Beecher Jackson.  I didn't know him.  Unlike--so, the significance about my mother and my father is this: my mother's family was a very enveloping family, you know.  They, my husband [Frederick Jackson, Jr.] will say this to this day.  I mean, we're all close, real close.  My father's family wasn't.  So, I didn't know any of this about my father's side of the family until my grandmother, my grandmother Doll [Doll Beaty Lackey], took my sisters and I to Virginia.
Speaker 1: To see--
Speaker 2: To see the other grandmother, and to learn a little bit about his history, this famous history of ours.
Story_ID: 326456
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) My father [Giles Jackson] literally, when he left Virginia--when he left Virginia--my sister [Mignon Jackson] was born in 1948 in Oklahoma.  He left Virginia in 1948.  When they graduated from college [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], he graduated.  On the way to California, my mother [Gwendolyn Lackey Battle] stopped and had this baby in Oklahoma at her mother's [Doll Beaty Lackey] home in Atoka [Oklahoma].  My father was going to Los Angeles [California] to go to law school, and he did go to law school.
Speaker 2: Where did he go to school?
Speaker 1: He went to Southwestern University [Southwestern University School of Law; Southwestern Law School, Los Angeles, California] and he graduated in about 1950, took him--he went to law school at night, and he was a social worker during the day.  And he graduated in 1954 or thereabout.  But my--so my father left the South and literally never went back until I graduated from Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia] in 1970.  He didn't want any of us to go south.  My mother encouraged that, but not my father.  He had wanted no part of the South.  He was so, my father was a brilliant man, and he was so demoralized as a youngster growing up there.  All he could think about doing was getting out of there, and he got out and went to Los Angeles.
Speaker 2: As absolutely as far as he could get on the other side (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's right.  And he went there because my mother's sisters were there; one of her sisters was there, and her husband.  And he thought there were good jobs out there, and all the other stuff.
Speaker 2: Now, that is, that's actually very powerful, that contrast between those two sides of your family, both very dedicated to education and bettering themselves.  But on your mother's side they really didn't talk about--well, not really spoke about it.  But your father really reacted--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --to it.  I mean, was this something that he spoke about at home, or just something that he just kind of knew viscerally?
Speaker 1: Knew viscerally, he didn't talk about it.  He's a high achiever, my father was a judge.  And when he--and he was on the bench for twenty-five years.
Speaker 2: At what level was he?
Speaker 1: A superior court judge in criminal court.  And so, he was very successful, but he didn't talk about, he just didn't talk about it.  It was not, it was an off-limits conversation.
Speaker 2: I mean, you said until your [maternal] grandmother Doll [Doll Beaty Lackey] took you, you never visited those grandparents?
Speaker 1: I understood.  I mean, my mother would say it, but my grandmother actually physically took us and said, "This is the other side of your family."
Speaker 2: She was a cool lady.
Speaker 1: And my father--because my father wouldn't; he didn't.
Speaker 2: Very interesting.
Speaker 1: Yes, very interesting.  He would not--he's coming to Atlanta [Georgia] in 1970, I'm graduating from Spelman.  He doesn't want to come then, but he is going to show up; he decided he's going to show up.
Speaker 2: Not like your grandfather [Sevallia Lackey], who wouldn't go to your aunt's wedding (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right. And he, he just, he said he had to stay at Paschal's [Paschal's Motor Hotel and Restaurant, Atlanta, Georgia].  I mean, he wasn't going anyplace other than to stay in the black area of town.  I said, "Well, you know, people are staying downtown at the Hilton [Hilton Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia]."  "No, I'm staying in Paschal's."  (Laughter) He was so--
Speaker 2: That is--
Speaker 1: --traumatized.  He was traumatized, literally.  That's all I can say about it.
Speaker 2: Do you have any aunts and uncles on your father's side, or is he like an only child?
Speaker 1: I have, yes, two aunts, both of whom--one was living in Hampton [Virginia] at the time, and her husband taught at Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia].  And the other lived in Richmond [Virginia].  He didn't visit them.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: If there was any visiting going on, they were coming to California; that was it.  His parents' [Bessie Hilton Jackson and Roscoe Jackson] death, no.
Speaker 2: He didn't even--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Wow, that's very powerful.
Speaker 1: It's serious, yes.
Speaker 2: That's very powerful.
Speaker 1: It's neurotic, you know.  He had a ser- and he didn't talk about race.
Speaker 2: Interesting.
Speaker 1: He never talked about it, and he had to deal with it every day.
Speaker 2: In the criminal court system--
Speaker 1: In the criminal court system.
Speaker 2: --in Los Angeles, California.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: In the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: And be a judge, you know.  Hey, you know, I think about it now, and I think wow, what was going on with this man (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, that's going to be a question for the ages.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That's--I'm going to touch back on that when we get to your adulthood (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. All right.
Story_ID: 326457
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about your childhood in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  Where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: I went to 111th Street, I think that's right, either 111th or 109th Street; it was 109th Street [109th Street Elementary School, Los Angeles, California], sorry.  We lived on 111th, and I went to 109th Street School.  Schools were numbers there in Los Angles.
Speaker 1: Just like in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to Jordan High School [David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: What was life like for you at Jordan (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Jordan--Jordan was an all-black high school, the worst high school in Los Angeles County.
Speaker 1: Was that your assessment, or was that an external assessment?
Speaker 2: No, external assessment.  And, you know--
Speaker 1: What made it the worst?
Speaker 2: Just in terms of, you know, kids going to college, and all that other kind of stuff.  Now, so, we lived, we lived in this little community really on the outskirts of what was then Watts [Los Angeles, California].  And they called it Blodgett Track [Los Angeles, California], where we were.  We had a choice, to go to Jordan or go to another high school.  Actually, we had a choice of going to Jordan, and they were integrating another high school called Washington High School [George Washington Preparatory High School, Los Angles, California].  My mother [Gwendolyn Lackey Battle] decided that we should go to Jordan.  One, because that was on her way to work (laughter).  She taught at one of the other elementary schools there in Watts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that was one thing.  But the second thing was she knew the teachers and the principal there, and she decided that these people were interested in our education.  And my sister, my older sister [Mignon Jackson], had gone one summer to summer school at this Washington High School.  And they tried to put her in the worst classes and, you know, it was not--
Speaker 1: The dummy track?
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.  And my mother said, "Look, I can't deal with that.  I don't have time to deal with it.  I'm going to put you where I think it's--." And my father [Giles Jackson] was the local lawyer there in Watts.  So, I mean we were in the community which we were in, and so it was easy for us to go to Jordan High School.  And I said it was the worst, and it was the worst.  It wasn't the worst for me personally.  I mean, I had a lot of advantages there as a high school student.  And, you know I was in everything.  We were very active, my sisters and I.  You know, we had lots of stuff going on.  We started this committee called the Student Committee for Improvement in Watts, which was about community improvement.  In fact, my twin sister's [Yvette Jackson Townsend] husband ended up writing a book about this.  Lots of things were going on in Watts at the time, and we were in the middle of all of that.
Speaker 1: So yeah, let's place you in some actual years.  So, you started elementary school in what year?
Speaker 2: I started in '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: So, right before Brown v. Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954]?
Speaker 2: Yes. And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And--well, now, was the 109th Street School all-black as well?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, all black.
Speaker 1: So--
Story_ID: 326458
Speaker 1: So, when Brown [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] was decided, what, if any effect did that have?  I mean do you remember anything about it at that time?
Speaker 2: No, no, I don't remember anything about it.  I remember a conversation.  We had dinner--we ate dinner together every night, our family did.  My father [Giles Jackson] was working, he would come home, his office was not that far away.  He would come home and we would have dinner and then he'd go back to work.
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.
Speaker 2: But my mother [Gwendolyn Lackey Battle] always had dinner, and it was--the phone got taken off the hook, no calls came in.  We had dinner together.  So, we would have conversations at dinner.  And so I remember that, because shortly after Brown v. Board of Education, there was a problem in Watts [Los Angeles, California], and I don't know exactly what it was.  And I didn't, I vaguely remember this hullabaloo about some issues with some black guys getting stopped by police and, you know, all that kind of stuff.  And my father had to manage through that, he was the lawyer on the case.  And the person who told me about it later in my life, after my father had passed away was Johnnie Cochran.
Speaker 1: An extra super small world.
Speaker 2: I met him right here in Miami [Florida], I'm an executive at Burger King.  He comes to do some business there, and I meet Johnnie Cochran.  And I said, "I'm from Los Angeles [California]."  I told him my name, and I said, "You know, my father was a lawyer there, a judge."  And he says, "Judge Jackson?  You're Judge Jackson's daughter?"  I said, "Yes."  He said, "Well, let me tell you about your father."  And he tells me about this case, and it was like the Rodney King kind of case.
Speaker 1: Wow, at that time?
Speaker 2: This is at that time.
Speaker 1: Like in the '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: And it was a big case, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a big, big, big case.  Now, I vaguely remember all this stuff going on, you know, and the conversation.  My father's partner was a guy by the name of Hurdle Clay Jacke, who's still alive.  And they had, they together were kind of working this case, and it was a big thing.  And what Johnnie Cochran said to me--which again, you know what it's like growing up with your parents.  You don't hear and pay attention to anything they're talking about.  You don't even listen to what they tell you.  I mean it's like, "Who are you?  What did they do, what do they do, really (laughter)?"
Speaker 1: That's true (laughter).
Speaker 2: All I knew is that his office was there, and when he wasn't coming home for dinner, my mother would send a plate of dinner.  We'd get on our bicycles and ride the dinner over to his office.  And then we'd play over there for a little while, and then we'd come home.
Speaker 1: Come back?
Speaker 2: Come home.  So, that's all I knew.  But anyway, he had this really famous case.  But this is all around, you know, kind of the same time frame. I was young (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 326459
Speaker 1: So, high school [David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California] is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the civil rights era is really--
Speaker 1: I graduated in '66 [1966].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So high school is '63 [1963] to '66 [1966], and as I said, very active in Watts [Los Angeles, California].  And the Watts riots happen--
Speaker 2: In--
Speaker 1: In 1965.
Speaker 2: I was just about to ask you.  So, what was that like?  Because you're now my first Watts riot interview.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: It's something I just know historically, so--
Speaker 1: Historically.
Speaker 2: What do you remember from that?
Speaker 1: Things were terrible.
Speaker 2: How old were you?
Speaker 1: I was fourteen, fifteen.
Speaker 2: So you could really appreciate--
Speaker 1: All I know is I was home.  We didn't, we weren't allowed to go outside.
Speaker 2: Now, how long do you recall--
Speaker 1: Three days.
Speaker 2: Okay, three days.  Anyone you know injured, or property loss, or--
Speaker 1: I knew a lot of people.  It later was started--ironically, it didn't start in Watts.  It started on our corner, and then it moved down Imperial Highway.  And, you know, we watched the fire flames, you know, and all that stuff, but we were home.  We were just, couldn't go out.  I mean that was it--home, not going anyplace.
Speaker 2: No school, no--
Speaker 1: No, nothing.
Speaker 2: No riding any dinner over to your dad's office?
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, none of that.  And my parents [Gwendolyn Lackey Battle and Giles Jackson] at this point are divorced.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: So, but no, we weren't, we weren't going outside, we weren't doing anything.  We were just there.  We had moved, at that time we had moved to 118th Street.  So, we were just there, and that was it.  Now I'll tell you what did happen though, in the course of events.  My sister [Mignon Jackson] graduated from high school that year.  It was the most miraculous thing that happened.  So, we're entering our senior year of high school, the summer after the Watts riot, Yvette [Yvette Jackson Townsend] and I.  And we come back, and we have a brand new science building.  They built this building in record time.  We had a brand new science building at our school.
Speaker 2: At the worst high school in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: Yes, and we had brand new books.  We didn't know what it was like to ever have new books.  We never had new books before, ever.  We always had books that had been marked up, and other people had written in them, all that kind of stuff.  We, all of a sudden have--this place was transformed.  And I was like, "Are we in the same school?"  (Laughter) And having said that, we had some of the best teachers--Mrs. Hay [ph.], Mr. Lockhart [ph.]--I mean I remember these teachers because throughout high school, you know, English,  my sister Yvette and I were math majors, and there were very few of us math majors, so we were down one little track there.
Speaker 2: Very focused.
Speaker 1: Took, took the same classes, you know, and all that kind of stuff.
Story_ID: 326460
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --it's 1966, the summer after the Watts riot [in Los Angeles, California] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) After, 1965, the summer after the Watts riot.  And we, we go to Jordan High School [David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California] in the fall.  And we, all of a sudden, miraculously, have this new science building.  We have new books, and you know, we--now when you don't have something, you don't know you're supposed to have it, right?  (Laughter) So, we didn't know.  We were like new books, what is this?  I mean--
Speaker 1: All of it.
Speaker 2: All of it.  I mean, lots of things happened, lots of opportunities were created for kids to go to different colleges and do different things.  And, you know, it was a lot of stuff happening.  It was so much happening the administrators of the school couldn't even manage it, you know.  In fact, Yvette [Yvette Jackson Townsend], my twin sister, went to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].  She was in this, they call it the transition program.  They invited her, you know--
Speaker 1: To Yale?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She didn't stay, but she went.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you know, she, that's what she did after we finished high school.  Anyway, it was, it was quite an interesting--it was just--all I can--it was just miraculous, what happened.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: There was just such attention put on that community.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now, had anything happen to your school in particular?  I mean had it burned or anything?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But they just so happened to--
Speaker 2: Nothing happened to the school.
Speaker 1: --make some changes?
Speaker 2: It brought focus to the struggling community of black folks in Watts [Los Angeles, California].
Story_ID: 326461
Speaker 1: Now, now you said earlier that because your [maternal] grandmother [Doll Beaty Lackey] went to AU [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] for a summer and met Benjamin Mays, and your aunt ended up attending Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia.]  So, to kind of bring in this Watts [Los Angeles, California] piece to it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Spelman thing--yeah.
Speaker 1: How did, did that affect your choice to go to Spelman?  Or did it at all?
Speaker 2: It didn't.  You know, I'll tell you this.  And I've told this story, and I think it's in that article that you have there.
Speaker 1: Oh the Spelman?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  This is a funny thing, and you never know how, how we influence children.  I meet this aunt, Mignon Lewis [Mignon Lackey Lewis], I'm about four years old.  She comes to Los Angeles [California], moves to Los Angeles from Atlanta [Georgia].  She graduated from Spelman in '51 [1951].  She taught at Turner High School [Henry McNeal Turner High School] there in Atlanta for a few years.  And then she decided to move to Los Angeles where her sisters were, two of her sisters were, and my mother [Gwendolyn Lackey Battle] and my other aunt [Wynola Lackey Carey].  And both--my mother was teaching, and my aunt was a principal of a junior high school, assistant principal of a junior high school.  So, they were both doing well there in Los Angeles.  And so, my aunt decides to move there.  Well, I--we greet my aunt, she comes by train from Atlanta to Los Angeles, the--at the train station.  And all I knew, and all I remember thinking--now I'm four, impressionable, four--that I want to be just like her.
Speaker 1: What did she look like stepping off of the train?
Speaker 2: She was gorgeous.  She was fun; she was just an incredible person, just there.  (Laughter) And all I--in my head all I remember was that she was coming from Spelman--and she wasn't really--but she was coming from Spelman.  And I thought, I want to be like her.  She became our music teacher.  She taught, she taught my twin sister [Yvette Jackson Townsend] and I how to play the piano.  And she was in our lives.  And I just wanted to be just like her.  And of course, I forgot about that, you know, as I'm growing up and doing all these other things (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But not really.
Speaker 2: But not really.  So, when I started thinking about colleges, the only place I was thinking about was Spelman.  You know, I thought about San Francisco State College [San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California], you know, and then I kept going back and forth.  But Spelman was really at the heart of it.  And I applied and I got in, and that was it.  Done.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, I want to ask you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sight unseen.
Speaker 1: You just knew.
Story_ID: 326462
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you a question about your twin sister [Yvette Jackson Townsend].  Now, are you guys fraternal or identical?
Speaker 2: We are identical.
Speaker 1: So, now what is this like, that you guys decide to go your separate ways at age eighteen?  How did that feel?
Speaker 2: Well, we weren't eighteen, we were--
Speaker 1: Or sixteen?
Speaker 2: Yes, we had just turned seventeen.  And no, just turned sixteen, sorry.
Speaker 1: Like you said, you were sixteen when you went to college (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, just turned sixteen.  And we, I think we always knew that we were going to go to different--we never talked about it per se.  I mean, it wasn't a conscious conversation.  You know, at that those ages, you're trying to be your own person.  So we had stopped dressing alike and, you know, we did--everybody still got us mixed up.  But we didn't have names.  I was Twin, and she was Twin, that was the name.  In fact to this day, I can--one of my mother's [Gwendolyn Lackey Battle] brothers, you know, he still will call me Twin.  He doesn't know my name.  (Laughter) Her children, my children--Twin's children, Twin's children, that's the deal.  I answer to Twin, I answer to Yvette, I answer to Yvonne.  I answer to three things--Twin, Yvette, Yvonne.
Speaker 1: Twin?
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: Who came up with that one?
Speaker 2: Well, that was the name, Twin, the twin, the twin.  So it's Twin (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, maybe the idea of having your own real identity (laughter).
Speaker 2: Identity.  You know, we kind of knew.  I mean, we were smart little people.
Speaker 1: Twin (laughter).
Speaker 2: We were smart little people, and we knew that we probably needed to do our own thing.  Yvette was in love, she was in love.  Now she went to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], but she came back.  Her husband went to UC Santa Cruz [University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California].  The--husband--he was her boyfriend then, but they started dating at fourteen years old, and they're still together now today.
Speaker 1: Lucky.
Speaker 2: Married in 1970, and on and on and on.  But--
Speaker 1: Now, where did she end up?
Speaker 2: She went to Pitzer College in Pitzer--Claremont, California.
Speaker 1: So, Connecticut was too far?
Speaker 2: Yeah, much too far.  Too cold, too.  She just said it's just too cold and too far away from Richard [Richard Townsend].  So, she hightailed it back to California the next year.  She got into Pitzer, and that was it.
Speaker 1: And that's where they--?
Speaker 2: So we, you know, we were self-identifying at that point, and becoming our own person.  And we are, to this day, like this (gesture).
Story_ID: 326463
Speaker 1: Where does she [Jackson's twin sister, Yvette Jackson Townsend] live?
Speaker 2: She lives in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She's never been to Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia], ever.
Speaker 1: She didn't see you graduate?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: She didn't? Naughty twin.
Speaker 2: She was in school.  And ironically--and it's interesting.  As close as we are--this is the most interesting thing.  We don't talk about the things we do in our--we talk about our families and ourselves, and relationships, but not anything else.  So, an example of this is Beverly Tatum [HistoryMaker Beverly Daniel Tatum] goes out to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] to speak.
Speaker 1: The president of Spelman?
Speaker 2: The president of Spelman.  And she is speaking, and Beverly and I talk, you know, two or three times a week.  And she told me she was going out to speak at UCLA.  And I said, "Oh, you know, my sister may be there.  That's my twin sister.  Just know that that's Yvette, not Yvonne if she walks up to you."  So, Yvette had told me--she's in that field, psychology.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, she was chief of mental health for the county of Los Angeles [Los Angeles County, California].  So, she was going to go hear Beverly speak.  So we, so she walks up to Beverly and she talks to her and thus and so.  And she calls me and says, "I didn't know you were chairman of the Board [Board of Trustees] of Spelman."  (Laughter) I said, "I never told you that?"  And she said, "No, you never told me that."  She said, "Well, how long does that last, about a year?"  I said, "No, much longer than that."  (Laughter) We don't talk about things that we do, or what we are.
Speaker 1: Why do you think that is that?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  We, we just talk about--my best friends, I don't know what they do, and they probably don't--didn't know what I do, unless they see it in some article or something like that.  It's not a conversation that I have with people that I know well, you know.  It's not a conversation you have with your sister about what you do?
Speaker 1: You know, it's very funny.  I have three sisters, and that is true.  I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You don't have those conversations.
Speaker 1: Because I say, "Didn't I tell you?  I could have sworn I told you I was, you know, with The HistoryMakers?"  She's like, "No, you didn't tell me."  I'm like, "Well--."
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's not conversations you have, right?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: You have conversations about your parents and your children, and your friends--
Speaker 1: And pets.
Speaker 2: --and your relationships and things like that, but you don't have those kinds of conversations.
Speaker 1: I guess, and this is just me, thinking like, oh, now twins are different.
Speaker 2: No.  But you don't talk about those things because those things are kind of superficial, right?
Speaker 1: True.
Speaker 2: They have meaning to the world at large--
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: But they don't have meaning to your relationship with that individual.  It's the same way with my girlfriends.  I mean somebody told me one day, they said, "Oh, your friend Precious [ph.] is this or that."  And I said, "Oh, really?  I didn't know she was." (Laughter) "You all are best friends, and you don't know that?"  I said, "We don't talk about each other's work.  I mean, I wouldn't know what she did."
Speaker 1: And it would be probably a little boring.
Speaker 2: Exactly, you know.  That's not, you know, occasionally you go off and have a conversation here or there about something that's interesting.  But, so, I don't mean to deviate here too much--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: But we are very close (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Still.
Speaker 2: We are so close that--
Speaker 1: Even though she's in California and you live here?
Speaker 2: There is, there is that mystical thing that happens with twins, I believe it.  And we're very practical people.  When she was having her first child, I'm in New York [New York], living in New York at the time, and I think I'm having appendicitis.  And I think I'm having appendicitis, and I said I can't be having appendicitis because I had my appendix out already (laughter).  So, I'm in just terrible, terrible, terrible pain.
Speaker 1: Whoa.
Speaker 2: I discover that Yvette is in labor with her baby.
Speaker 1: Interesting, I believe it.  That's what I wanted to ask.  Like, isn't there some secret twin thing?
Speaker 2: Thing. There is a secret twin thing.  There's a mystical, non-explainable, don't talk about it too much because a lot of people don't believe that stuff.  But I believe it, too.
Speaker 1: Most people do.
Speaker 2: Of course, I believe in a higher power, too, and I think that's supreme (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean, you guys have the same egg.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: You just split in half.

Speaker 1: When you were in, in elementary school [109th Street Elementary School, Los Angeles, California] and high school [David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California], any mentors or teachers that particularly stand out in your mind?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mentioned a couple in high school in particular that probably--Mr. Lockhart [ph.] and Miss Haney, Gladys Haney, she's in Los Angeles [California].  I don't know if she's still alive.  They, they were really aggressive teachers, that you knew were interested in your welfare.  And they were challenging you and helping you.  And I was editor of the school paper.  So the guy who was the mentor of the paper was also a mentor for me.  I can't remember his name, Edward Levin [ph.] or something like that.  But you know, I always thought that they just, there was an extra effort that they put in connecting with us and helping us, and making sure we were kind of doing the right thing.  And so, yes, I had lots of that.  And of course I had all of my mother's [Gwendolyn Lackey Battle] family who were around and about, and who were great mentors and role models.  And my grandmother [Doll Beaty Lackey], of course, the ultimate.
Speaker 1: You can't forget Grandma.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 326465
Speaker 1: So, now you choose to have the black college experience, while your twin sister [Yvette Jackson Townsend] is choosing to have an Ivy League experience [at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].  So, you--
Speaker 2: Ultimately, West Coast--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: White woman, Pitzer [Pitzer College, Claremont, California] was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, right.
Speaker 2: Among Harvey Mudd [Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, California].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And Harvey Mudd was the men's college, and Pitzer was the women's college.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And ultimately they came together or something like that, but--
Speaker 1: Like the Claremont McKenna schools [sic. Claremont Colleges, Claremont, California]--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  But I did choose to have the black college experience.
Speaker 1: Now I know we touched upon the family influence, and that.  But, was there something else in particular that--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I think, first of all I think it was divine intervention.  So, let me say that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: And I mean that sincerely.  You know, I read about Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], and I thought okay, this is a good place for me to go and get a good education.  At the time, it wouldn't have been a great education, but it was a good education.  And I knew it was an elite black woman's college.  I knew I wanted to be among elite black women.  And I say elite, I'm talking about intellectually, women who were going to do something.  So, I don't mean, you know--
Speaker 1: Money elite.
Speaker 2: I have to, yes, I have to think about it now.  Because, you know, Spelman still has this reputation of those snobbish Spelman women, or whatever they say--bougie, somebody said.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, but I knew about the education, and I wanted that.  And I wanted--all I can say is when I got there, the first day--and I don't know if they had this when you were at Spelman, but you have to go to the convocation.
Speaker 1: Convocation, oh yeah, that was--
Speaker 2: Yes, or something like that.  And all I can remember was that those professors and administrators were walking in in caps and gowns.  They wore robes in our convocation, our first one.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think they did.
Speaker 2: And do you know I stood there and just cried?
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: I was so moved by being in that place with these black people who were--you know, my family was about education.  That was the thing--education, education, education.  So, here I was in the middle of this.  I was in it, all these black people, educated and being educated, and wanting to be educated, you know.  And I, I was just, I was awed by it.  And different than Watts [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Right.  Because that was, I mean, it wasn't as if you went from all-white situation to an all-black one.  But--
Speaker 2: Different than Watts.  Because at our high school [David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California] in Watts, and in our church in Watts, yes, there were those of us who were going to college and getting further educated.  And in our community--it was a middle class community, this little group, this little community that we lived in.  But when you think of the whole of Watts, that wasn't the case.  There was a lot of drugs and pimping and all the other things that happened, you know, in desperate communities going on, and I saw it every day, every single day.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: So, so, so, but Spelman was different than Watts, because everybody was moving in one direction, and that was about getting more education.  And that wasn't true in Watts.
Speaker 1: Now, Dr. Albert Manley was president when you started, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, he was.
Story_ID: 326466
Speaker 1: For people who didn't go to any schools in the AUC [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia], we differentiate, like what dorm you lived in in your freshman year because it determines everything, like maybe who your future husband is going to be.  (Laughter) Because, well my class--was it like that when you were at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia]?  Like, I lived in Abby Hall [Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Hall] my freshman year.
Speaker 2: I lived in Morehouse North (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, what they now call Morehouse-James [Morehouse-James Hall].
Speaker 2: James, yes.
Speaker 1: Which is right next door to Abby Hall.
Speaker 2: You're right.
Speaker 1: That was a freshmen dorm then?
Speaker 2: That was a freshmen dorm.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Because it had not been renovated.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, I'm sorry (laughter).  It's beautiful now.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: It was not beautiful then.  It was okay.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's a dorm.
Speaker 2: So I lived in that dorm my freshman year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you said you were a math major at school?
Speaker 2: In high school [David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: In high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was a history major at Spelman.
Speaker 1: What drew you to history?
Speaker 2: Well, I took a class from Dr. Vincent Harding [HistoryMaker Vincent Harding].  And I took my first history class from him, and that was it.  I don't know if you know him, knew him--
Speaker 1: I've heard the name.
Speaker 2: --or ever heard him speak.  Interestingly enough, he speaks with a heavy lisp, but he's one of the most incredible professors that you ever want to take a tough, but impressive--I took American history with him, and I just thought, wow, this is what I want to learn about.  Now, I took--so I was a history major.  I was also, ironically, a business administration minor.  And I had the same amount of hours in business administration as I had in history.
Speaker 1: Which really was more of a double major.
Speaker 2: Yes, I couldn't get a double major, and I took all of my classes at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], one of two women taking all these classes at Morehouse.
Speaker 1: Well, that must have been challenging.
Speaker 2: Actually, it didn't feel very challenging.  I was--and I don't even know what made me--I know what made me.  I took an economics class from--I had to take it over at Morehouse for some reason, and I took it from Roosevelt Thomas [Roosevelt Thomas, Jr.], I don't know if you know that name.
Speaker 1: I don't, I don't know his name.
Speaker 2: Well, Dr. Roosevelt Thomas, and he's written several books.  And he is in Atlanta [Georgia].  He was teaching at Morehouse at the time.  And he, he's written, he's the foremost writer around diversity in the country.  He's a writer and speaker for twenty-five years now.  So, I took a class he was teaching at Morehouse.  I took an economics class, and I was, I loved it.  Much like I felt about history, I felt that way about econ, and after that I started taking accounting and other things to ultimately get this, ultimately get this business degree.  I didn't know what I was doing, and (simultaneous) --
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was going to ask you, did you know?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, but I knew--okay, when I talked to some of those guys, that's what they were doing.  And I said, okay, I'm going to do what they're doing.
Speaker 1: So, teaching wasn't pulling you, and law wasn't pulling you, like your parents' [Gwendolyn Lackey Battle and Giles Jackson] interests?
Speaker 2: No, they weren't pulling me.
Speaker 1: And what was your [twin] sister [Yvette Jackson Townsend] majoring in?
Speaker 2: She majored in psychology or sociology.  Pitzer [Pitzer College, Claremont, California] is a behavioral science school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that's its focus, and that's what she was--she was in the middle of the Black Power movement there.
Speaker 1: That's right, she was in the right place--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at the right time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You have [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis over at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] and Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture].
Story_ID: 326467
Speaker 1: Well, now, so you're at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] '66 [1966] to '70 [1970] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Through '70 [1970].  Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] died in '68 [1968], monumental.  I have some pictures in fact; I didn't pull those pictures out.  I stood at his casket.  I was--I--You know, it was--he laid in state at Sisters Chapel [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Did you know that?
Speaker 1: No, actually, I did not.  I was just assuming you were about to say Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: No, he laid in state at Sisters Chapel.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And he--Sisters Chapel was open all night.  People were coming onto that campus.  There were thousands of people coming over to Spelman lined up (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were they lined up from the front gate?
Speaker 2: They were lined up from the front gate all the way, all night.  I was one of those people that stood at his casket, one of the bearers I guess, from midnight to four in the morning.
Speaker 1: Wow.  What was that like?
Speaker 2: You know, we were guarding, like.  It was something.  It was, it was--and then I went back to the dorm and got on a plane the next morning and went to, you know, Memphis [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Oh, for what?  For the garbage strike [Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike], you know, the march?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.  They had planes going, and we went.
Speaker 1: To carry on?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean it was really an incredible time, it was an incredible time.  I have a picture of him in the casket.  It's terrible.  I have that picture.
Speaker 1: Wow, wow.  Did you take that picture?
Speaker 2: I took that picture.
Speaker 1: What made you take that?  You know, that always fascinates me.
Speaker 2: I just needed to capture that.  I was young, I didn't know.  You know, I normally--
Speaker 1: Oh, not that it was wrong, I'm just--
Speaker 2: I normally wouldn't take a picture of a person in a casket, to be honest with you, but I took his picture in the casket.
Speaker 1: It was Martin Luther King.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 326468
Speaker 1: I guess we'll put in your timeframe again, '66 [1966]--
Speaker 2: To '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: So, you come in--now, does Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] still have at that time the very strict rules about not being able to wear pants off-campus, and you had to ask your parents for permission?  Tell me some about Spelman life, so we can put you in a perspective.
Speaker 2: So, let me tell you about Spelman life and tell you about me at Spelman.  Because I get there, I've just had my sixteenth birthday.  I'm young, young, young.  And I tell the story at the board meeting [Board of Trustees, Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] all the time, and I'm sure the board members have gotten this down, "We know, Yvonne [HistoryMaker Yvonne Jackson]."  I went to a party every day of my freshman year.  I partied throughout my first year, just partied every single day (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How?  I had to be back on campus by midnight.  So--
Speaker 2: Well, you can start a party at three in the afternoon, and we did.  As soon as classes were over with, we were gone off the campus, hanging out, literally.  We had to be back at nine during the week.
Speaker 1: Nine?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I think it was ten thirty or eleven on the weekends.  That was fine, actually.
Speaker 1: Well, I guess if you start partying at three (laughter).
Speaker 2: Hey, you start before it got dark. (Laughter) And in the wintertime, hey.
Speaker 1: Gee.
Speaker 2: So you, it was--
Speaker 1: That's awesome.
Speaker 2: I partied my freshman year, the whole year.
Speaker 1: Did you go to class?
Speaker 2: I went to class.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I worked.  I was, I worked, I worked in the dining hall my freshman year.  I made those biscuits.  I was up at five in the morning.
Speaker 1: Do you know how to make those biscuits?
Speaker 2: I knew how to make those biscuits in that big churn thing.
Speaker 1: So, you knew Alma Upshaw?
Speaker 2: I knew a lot of people.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: I put that hairnet on and I was up--I'm an early riser to this day.  So, yes, I--
Speaker 1: I love those biscuits.
Speaker 2: So, I was an early riser.  But I partied, and I almost flunked out.
Speaker 1: Because you were partying too much?
Speaker 2: Right, I wasn't studying.  I absolutely, I thought I could just make it on osmosis, I guess (laughter).
Speaker 1: On your party fumes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what did your parents [Gwendolyn Lackey Battle and Giles Jackson] say when those grades arrived in Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 2: I was so embarrassed; I was so embarrassed.
Speaker 1: Are we, I'm sorry. Were you--wait was that one minute? Oh okay. I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: So, let me tell you this quick story.  I think I'm flunking out.  I remember calling my mother and saying--I'm crying, crying, crying--, "I'm coming home, I failed."  I failed one class, and it was the first failure in my life.
Speaker 1: Oh, my goodness, what class was that?
Speaker 2: Biology.  And I am devastated, completely devastated.  Well, to make this short, my mother said to me--she sounded so much like my grandmother [Doll Beaty Lackey]--I'm sure she was holding her breath on the other end of the phone because she didn't know what to expect.  She said, "That won't be your first failure.  And what you're going to do is repeat that.  You're not coming home, you're going to repeat that, and you're just going to make an A on it.  So, do you know what you did to get an F?"  And of course, I did--I never opened the book.  (Laughter) I did open the book, but not for very long.
Speaker 1: You opened it and shut it immediately.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  So, that was my mother.
Speaker 1: That is so cool, how understanding.  So, she didn't yell?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, she didn't at all.
Speaker 1: There were no gnashing of teeth?
Speaker 2: Actually, it was a good lesson for me.  I made the honor roll after that.  I mean it was, and it was my first failure.  I had never failed anything ever.
Speaker 1: So, it was like a huge (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Like a wakeup call.  And you know what?  I say this to this day, and it's true about my life, I've learned more from my failures than certainly I've learned from my successes.
Story_ID: 325851
Speaker 1: So your lesson from almost flunking out your freshman year [at Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] was that you learned more--or well, I'll let you say it.
Speaker 2: I learned more from--I, I always say this.  And it's, it's a--I've learned more from my failures than my successes.  And I've had plenty of them, you know.  They've made me stronger and a better person as a result of them.  So, when I talk to young people I say this, "You know, it's okay to fail."  You just--as one young woman said--I don't know if you guys have ever interviewed [HistoryMaker] Bonnie St. John; she's somebody you should interview.  She's an Olympic medalist and Rhodes scholar, and all this other kind of stuff.  And she has a book, it's not about how, about falling down, It's how fast you get up.  (Laughter) Because you're gonna fall, it's how fast you get up.  And that was, she tells her story because she says that was the difference between winning the silver medal and the gold medal, because everybody fell coming down the slalom, the skiers.  Everybody--it was a particularly icy day, everybody fell.  It was how fast they got up.  And so, my story is learning from those failures, those, those mishaps.  You know, for me it was, okay, I partied.  I was young, I partied.  But I learned that I had to study, and I learned that I could survive a failure, more importantly.  And that's a character thing.  Because a lot of people who think they haven't had any failures in their life, and they--all of a sudden they get to age thirty and have something happen to them at work.  You know, they get involved--they're in a business or a department that people don't like them, and duh duh duh da, and they think it's the worst thing in the world.  Well, it may be, but at that moment and time, but you can survive it.  You can survive it, and you can move on.  You can get out of that situation, you can figure out that kind of stuff.  So, that's why I say I've learned more from my failures than my successes.
Speaker 1: You know, it's really funny, I really needed to hear that today.  Thanks.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I really did.
Speaker 2: I'm glad.
Story_ID: 325852
Speaker 1: Now, I want to go back to your fun college life.  Now, I was always told that in that era of the '60s [1960s] that--we were talking about that before, that you have to wear white gloves and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, you asked me that question.
Speaker 1: --and parental pressure.  We ran out of time on that last tape.  So, we'll hop back on that.  So--
Speaker 2: So, yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about it.
Speaker 2: Curfew was nine during the week, ten-thirty on the weekends.  You wore dresses.  You could only wear pants on Saturday morning.  No gloves, none of that stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, but, but it was very, you know--well, we were dressing like that in high school.  You didn't wear pants to high school.  And this is '60s [1960s], you didn't.  You'd wear skirts and, you know, whatever, blouses.  And we wore the same to class at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Now, in the wintertime you could throw a coat on and never open it, which happened a lot.  So, you didn't know what was underneath that coat.  (Laughter) But yes, it was very formal like that, like any school was in the '60s [1960s].  And Spelman was traditionally southern, and very much into those southern roots.  And you know, it was in their tradition.
Speaker 1: What about, I'm thinking about that time when we had a revolution in the hair styles.  What about the afro?
Speaker 2: (Gestures) (Laughter) I don't have, I couldn't find my--maybe I have it in there; I'll have to look for it.  My, when I graduated from Spelman in 1970, I had an [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis hairdo like this, huge, an Afro.  And--
Speaker 1: What did your mom [Gwendolyn Lackey Battle] say?
Speaker 2: Didn't say much; she didn't like it.  Grandmother [Doll Beaty Lackey] hated it.  Father [Giles Jackson] hated it, everybody hated it.  But that was in.
Speaker 1: It was the style.
Speaker 2: And I can just remember.  So, I'm taking business classes, I'm a history major.  I'm going to go into business, and I'm interviewing with this thing.  And it was absolutely incredible.  And I remember making some decisions about my appearance, my Afro, and how that would work for where I was going to work.  And so, when I was coming out of Spelman, I was interviewing with banks and retailers.  And I--
Speaker 1: There in Atlanta [Georgia] or?
Speaker 2: I interviewed in Atlanta, and then I went to New York [New York] and interviewed with these people--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --most of them.  And initial interview was at Spelman, and then I went to New York for most of them.  And I remember having to make a decision between the Federal Reserve Bank of New York [New York, New York] and Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.], which is where I went to work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this is what happened.  I was very interested in what was going on at that bank, and it was a job working on some foreign exchange desk, or something like that.  I go up for the interview, and I walk through where I'm interviewing.  And I walk through the area, which they're giving me a tour.  And I walk through the area that I would be potentially working in.  And it's a desk, lots of desks, like forty desks or so, with all these white guys, white shirts and blue ties, and their jackets are hanging on the back of their chairs.  And they're sitting at these desks, and you know, with telephones or whatever.  And I just, I just remember thinking, and it's going through my mind, "How would I fit into that?  I am so different from those men," and they were all men.  And that was true everyplace.  But somehow, it just seemed too much of a gap.  And when they made me the offer, I said, "You know, this is very exciting work to me, but I can't imagine myself working there."
Story_ID: 325853
Speaker 1: Here I am with this, you know, huge Afro, huge, beautiful, but huge.  And I ended up going back to Los Angeles [California], taking the job with Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] in their management training program.  Now of course, I was the first African American woman on that training program in that region, et cetera.  I mean that was, that's the story of my life, you know, so far.
Speaker 2: The first?
Speaker 1: The first.
Speaker 2: Well, that's what makes you a HistoryMaker.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: That's what makes you a HistoryMaker.
Speaker 1: Yes.  In fact, this is another story, and it's so ironic.  I just went on this advisory board for Price Waterhouse [PricewaterhouseCoopers].  And, do you know them?  They're an accounting firm (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.  They used to be Coopers and Lybrand and--
Speaker 1: Yes, they merged.  So, I, I, I just joined their advisory board.  It's like an advisory council, and it's a council made up of CEOs and myself.  And they have their first meeting of this kind, and it's really to advise their CEO in a grave situation, from a lot of standpoints.  And I forget sometimes, you know, I just forget.  So I get to the meeting, and I'm--this is in January, and, in New York [New York].  And of course, I'm the first to get there, the first one there.  And there were a couple of women there who were at the desk giving us our name tags and other things--dinner before the night of the meeting.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so I get--and so people started coming in, the rest of the people who are on this council.  And the senior members of the management team are there, the CEO and his team.  And the evening is going on, and more people are coming in.  Of course, they all walk up to me and say, "You must be Yvonne [HistoryMaker Yvonne Jackson]."  And finally, I say, "How did you know?"  And of course, I look around and I am the only person of color, the only woman, again in that group (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The only woman as well?
Speaker 1: The only woman, again, in that group.
Speaker 2: This is January of 2006?
Speaker 1: January of 2006.  And I, you know, and I just, you know I joked about it, but you know, I was serious.  And the guy, the CEO, looked over at me and he looked to see if I was serious or if I was joking.  But I was seriously joking.  (Laughter) And so, here we are again, it's 2006.  And I, you know, I've been on management teams, you know, working for CEOs, three, the last three employers that I had, Pfizer [Pfizer Inc.], Compaq [Compaq Computer Corporation], and Burger King.  Pfizer is an exception, I will say that.  But when I went to Burger King, I was the first woman on the senior management team.  Of course, the first person of color. When I went to Compaq, the first woman, and of course the first person of color.  When I got to Pfizer there was one woman, and she actually is running the largest business.  And but of course, I was the first person of color, and the first person of color on many levels.  And when I went to Burger King I worked with several CEOs, it was some transition there.  I went, in fact, I, I made it a point of diversifying that senior management team, because I had, I had responsibility for recruiting for the CEO.  And he and I agreed we were going to make this the most diversified team, and we did.  He ended up hiring another woman who was a Turkish woman to come in and head up R and D [research and development], and then a woman to head up strategy.  And his team was, he was Greek.  His team was very, very eclectic, and very different as a result of that.  And it was great.
Story_ID: 325854
Speaker 1: How do you think your, your college experience shapes you, or helps you to deal with having to be the first, like so when you took the job at Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] and you were able to compare that between the Federal Reserve [Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York, New York] and your subsequent jobs?  How--
Speaker 2: Well, I think the education at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] helped me to, helped me with two things.  One, understand again, the world that I would enter, leaving Spelman.  You know, it gave us some realistic pictures.  Now, you know, we didn't have courses that they have now--Women in the Diaspora, and all those other kinds of things.  But you got it through other things.  [HistoryMaker] Vincent Harding--you know, American history, the, the knowledge, the, you know, the things that faculty talked about and helped instill in us.  And then the second part was the confidence.  You know, you, you leave Spelman having journeyed through your own self-development, which is all college is.  It's really self-development.  You're out on your own figuring it out, with the help of these teachers and instructors and professors.  And so, that strength of character and strength of reinforcing the values that I brought to Spelman from my family life helped me to be confident about who I was, and what I was going to be able to do in my life.  And I had visions for myself; I had them leaving Spelman.

Speaker 1: What were some of your, your dreams and your aspirations for yourself as a high-schooler and as a young adult?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't--you know, I can't say that I knew exactly what I was going to be; I didn't.  Because no, my family were teachers and lawyers.  They weren't businesspeople, they didn't know anything about business.  They didn't even know what it was.  You know, it was like, "What is this?  What are you going to do?  What does, what does this mean?"  And I couldn't explain it to them, either because I didn't know enough about it.  I had no role models from that standpoint; there weren't any.  There were very few, let me put it that way.
Speaker 1: Well, at, at a corporate level (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's what I'm--
Speaker 1: --in the early '70s [1970s]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Really, who was there that you could have written a letter to?
Speaker 2: They were so few and far between.  You didn't see anybody you didn't know, I didn't know.  So, I didn't have any role models.  I didn't know; I was feeling this out.  I knew I liked it, and that's the other key thing, is do what you like, what you have a passion for.  And I knew I liked business, I was intrigued by it; it was fascinating to me.  It was like, you know, I feel like I had been sort of entrepreneurial from the time I was a kid; I was selling potholders.  I made potholders and sold them and, you know, and I made money, and I liked having my money.  And I started working, you know, when I was twelve years old at the cleaners on Saturdays, and from seven to seven.  And I made my own dollar and twenty-eight cents a week or something like that, I can't remember what it was.  No, it was eleven dollars and twenty-eight cents a week, and that was a lot of money, because my allowance was only five dollars.  So, so, I had money (laughter), and I liked having money.  And I worked throughout the time I was at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I first worked in the dining hall.  Then I, then I ran the AU [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] federal credit union.  I worked two days a week there for ten hours a week, or something like that.  And I left Spelman with money, with a thousand dollars saved.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what, in 1970, what were the thousand dollars--
Speaker 2: Well, the tuition was two thousand.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you saved up--
Speaker 2: My mother [Gwendolyn Lackey Battle] paid the tuition.  That was her job, to pay the tuition.  We, Yvette [Yvette Jackson Townsend], Mignon [Mignon Jackson], and I had to make our first payment.  We could pay on installment, and my mother had the responsibility for paying the tuition.  And we made our first payment.  We had to work every summer to make our first payment because my mother's salary didn't--she was a teacher.  They didn't pay them twelve months out of the year.  They started, the first check was in October.
Speaker 1: So, you had to do that.
Speaker 2: We had to make the first payment, which was due in August.  So we had to work, that was the deal in our family.  My mother and father [Giles Jackson], they worked that out, who was going to pay what.  We paid our first installment, and then my mother's salary took care of the rest of it.
Story_ID: 325856
Speaker 1: Your parents [Gwendolyn Lackey Battle and Giles Jackson] divorced (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And which--
Speaker 2: In junior high.
Speaker 1: Oh, junior high.  So did you live with your mom, or your dad?
Speaker 2: My mother. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did your parents live still both in Watts [Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They stayed in close proximity to each other.
Speaker 1: And how did that impact you?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was tough, yeah.  We didn't understand it, and yet we did understand it.  My father was busy all the time working, working, working, working.  You know, my mother had this thing about dinner, and you know, it was, she was serious.  Her mother [Doll Beaty Lackey] was like that.  (Laughter) So, but it was tough.  You know, we had a difficult time, but we, you know, we were together, my sisters [Mignon Jackson and Yvette Jackson Townsend] and I.  And you know, we could manage through that.  But it was a tough time.
Speaker 1: So he was, I mean he was still contributing financially?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But that was something that they worked out?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The girls had to do this?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we did it, because all three of us were in college at the same time.
Speaker 1: Ouch.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  So, we had to make that first payment.  My mother made the other payments, and that was the deal.
Story_ID: 325857
Speaker 1: Now, you know, it, it's very clear you have such a strong entrepreneurial spirit.  You're at Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] in the management training program, first black woman.  Did you start right away after college [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] in 1970?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, July of 1970.
Speaker 1: So, what, now you were in Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: No, I was in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: In L.A. [Los Angeles, California] that's right, you went back to L.A.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what was it like being back home now, as part of this management training program?  And Sears is still, you know, the big kid on the block in terms of retail at that time.
Speaker 2: At that time.  It was a great experience, a great learning experience.  You know, as I said, I didn't know anything about business, and here I was thrown into learning all these new things.  And their training program required that you start where the merchandise comes into the store, and then you work the floor.  And all I can remember is my, my mother [Gwendolyn Lackey Battle] coming in one day to the Sears store, and she said, "I didn't send you to college to do this."  (Laughter) Because to her it seemed menial work.  And I said, "It's okay."  You know, I was learning, I was learning.  And I was willing to learn.  I was soaking it up.
Speaker 1: Now, how long were you with Sears?
Speaker 2: I was with Sears almost ten years.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: So, let me tell you another story about race.
Speaker 1: Please do.
Speaker 2: I'm at Torrance [California], the Torrance store, and it is, all-white area, you know, the whole thing, in California.  And so, I'm on the management training program, and I, we got an hour for lunch, not that you always took it.  But I, this particular day I went over to the store manager's office.  And I said, "I'm going to take my full, I'm going to be out of the store."  You kind of let people know, "I'm going to take my full hour for lunch.  I'm going over to have lunch with my father [Giles Jackson]."  My father was the juvenile ju- juvenile court judge there in Torrance.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But nobody knew he was black. Yes.
Speaker 1: Was he passing?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or was it just that no one bothered to ask?
Speaker 2: Correct, they made assumptions.  And he looks black, and his hair is slicked back.  So you know, you--but he could have been Italian, I guess.  I don't know, I just, I thought it was phenomenal, to me.  So, he wasn't trying to pass.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was just, assumptions were assumed.  And he was not that fair, so I mean, anyway.  (Laughter) So, when you see his picture you'll see.  And so the store, the secretary to the store manager said, "Oh, you're going to have lunch with your father.  Does he work around here?"  And I said, "Yes, he works over at the courthouse."  And she said, "Oh, who's your father?  Because my husband works at the courthouse."  And I said, "Giles Jackson."  And she said, "Judge Giles Jackson?"  And I said, "Yes, Judge Giles Jackson."  She said, "Well, my husband is the bailiff for your father."  I said, "Oh, great."  I, but I could see the look on her face, and she had never connected this, now my last name is Jackson--you know, no connection at all.  But she had no way of knowing, you know.  And I was just saying I was going to be gone for the hour because it would take me ten minutes to drive there and ten minutes to drive back, and I needed my full lunch hour.  And so, so, I, the story is, so she is stunned.  She goes--
Speaker 1: Because she knows.
Speaker 2: She goes home and tells her husband.  Maybe her husband--I there was something that was in that story there.  And so, my father tells me this the next day.  And he says, "You, the store manager's secretary is my bailiff's wife."  And I said, "Yeah, I found that out."  We didn't have a conversation at that time about it.  But it was a couple days later, I guess when he said that.  And he said, "You know, I think that guy thought I was white," (laughter).
Speaker 1: Even the bailiff?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  And I said, "Well, why would they think that?"  And he says, "Beats me."  (Laughter) So, so, this woman--after that it was a completely different relationship, yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: I mean was she like, "Well, hello Miss Jackson [HistoryMaker Yvonne Jackson], It's a pleasure to see you."  Or was she--
Speaker 2: It was interesting, it was interesting.
Speaker 1: That's really--you know, because you had that issue kind of with your grandmother [Doll Beaty Lackey], too, that perception or mistaken racial identity.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But you're always there to set it straight (laughter), no matter what.
Story_ID: 325858
Speaker 1: So now, I mean I know the world was a different place back then, when people actually stayed with an employer for a while.  But what made you stick with Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] for--
Speaker 2: I was doing great there.
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was learning a lot, I was moving up.  I actually moved from Los Angeles [California] to New York [New York].  I married, not Fred Jackson [Frederick Jackson, Jr.], first husband, and he was a Morehouse man [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: So, did you guys know each other in undergrad?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And George Watson [ph.] was his name.  And, but I moved to New York with Sears, they you know, did the whole thing.  And we got married and lived in New York, and I grew there; I mean I learned at Sears.  I call it my business analytics.  I was trained well in merchandising around analyzing data, and analyzing information.  And that's what I learned at Sears, and I, and I also had some failures there.
Speaker 1: And what was one that stands out for you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) One was working for a guy that was so tough, and so ridiculously tough on me.  And I would go home at night and just be--I didn't know how I was going to stay.  It was so awful.  And one day I went to his office and I--I mean, I thought I was doing terrible--I thought I was doing terrible.  And I said, "Why are you so hard on me?"  He was a white guy, Tom [ph.].  He said, "I see so much potential in you."  And he said, "I know I've been tough."  He said, "But I know you can think through these--."  It was really about analyzing stuff.  And I said, "Well, you could help me by saying that more often to me."  I said, "I don't mind the work, you know that."  And he said, "Yes."  So, I learned that.  So I'm thinking I'm failing, I'm thinking I'm crashing and burning.  And I'm thinking this--and he was being tough on me now.  Now maybe he said that because, you know, he needed to, I don't know.  But whatever, it certainly made me feel better about how terrible he was (laughter).
Speaker 1: Indeed.  You could take it.  Well, so what kind of manager are you because of that experience?  Like how did that--
Speaker 2: I try to be a much gentler manager.  I mean I'm tough on people; people will tell me--say that to me.  But I'm fair, and I tell people what I'm thinking about them and their capabilities and what the goals are, where we're headed.  And I'm honest with people; I give them a lot of feedback, positive and negative, all of it.  So, but I--what I learned from that--and again, I thought that was a failure. Was that I, that I could misunderstand, and it was important to have a conversation, even if I had to make the conversation.
Story_ID: 326469
Speaker 1: Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] for ten years, and you got married [to George Watson (ph.)] and moved to New York [New York].  Then?
Speaker 2: Then, okay, Sears says--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: --Sears says they're moving their corporate headquarters to--the New York adjunct headquarters, back to Chicago [Illinois].  This is 1979.  And I am, so I've been in merchandise and merchandising.  I had taken this rotational assignment in human resources [HR].  And, but Sears says to me, "Okay, you've been here a year in this job.  We want you, we see you as merchant.  So, when you go to Chicago," 'cause I was supposed to go to Chicago.  "We'd like you to go as a merchant, not in HR."  So, I said okay.  So I go out, and I look in Evanston [Illinois] and think about housing and all that.  I.e. I am separated from my husband by this point.
Speaker 1: Was it worth that, was really doing it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Probably.  And so I'm thinking about--then I decide I don't want to go to Chicago.  One, came to New York, and it took me all those years to adjust to the cold in New York, and it was colder in Chicago.  I wasn't going to move (laughter).  And I'd been there many, many times traveling with the company, and I just said I don't think I'm going to do this.  So, I've got to strike out and figure out what I'm going to do.  Well, Sears was really upset, and they said, "Well, look, we're going to keep fifteen jobs in New York.  We'll give you one of them."  One was a fashion counselor, who makes fashion decisions about color and different things for the women's apparel group.  You travel to Paris [France], and you do lots of interesting things like that.  And I just kept thinking, the job is going to dead end.  It would be easy for me to take the job, and it would dead end there.  Because there're fifteen people there, and they're going to stay in New York.  And I'd be the only--anyway. And I had progressed at Sears in a number of key jobs.  I mean I'd really done well.  And so I said, "No, I'm out of here."  So, of course I have to start looking for a job, and I'd never done that before except coming out of Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia.]  This is 1979 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) As a twenty-two year old?
Speaker 2: Yes, now I'm--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, no, you weren't twenty-two; you were twenty.
Speaker 2: Twenty.
Speaker 1: Good Lord.
Story_ID: 326470
Speaker 1: So I, I start looking around, and I, I liked this human resource thing.  But I didn't have enough experience with it.  So I say to a friend, "You know, I think I'm going to try to interview in human resources."  I was interviewing in merchandising, so that was easy also.  And Avon [Avon Products Inc.] offers me a job in merchandising.  And I say, "I like this, but I really want human resources.  Do you got any jobs in human resources?"  And they say "No."  So, I end up taking a job, not at Avon--I ultimately went to work for Avon for fourteen years--but at American Express [American Express Company]--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --as manager of employee relations.  This was my first big manager's job.
Speaker 2: And that was '79 [1979]?
Speaker 1: That was '79 [1979].  I stayed there for exactly three months, a learning experience.  I didn't like it.
Speaker 2: What didn't you like?
Speaker 1: I didn't like the culture.  I went to work--it was, it was banking, you know.  I was, these people were walking around in these blue, black, and brown suits, and you know, it was Wall Street.
Speaker 2: Like the Federal Reserve [Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York, New York] again.
Speaker 1: Yes, here I was.  And it was, I felt like I was in a strait jacket there.  I mean it was very, very, banking oriented.  I, when I interviewed there, I was thinking it was a more marketing kind of company.  Now they are, but you know, it was like a bank.  And I'm like, "I don't like this."  And the other thing--so I'm manager of employee relations, and this is 1979.  And there had just been a law passed that women who--and this has to do with my values. Woman, they had passed a law that if women were taking maternity leaves, they had to get maternity leave.  They had to be able to take maternity and have their job when they came back.  So, it was a law that had just been passed.  And I remember sitting in a meeting with these higher-ups there in human resources, and they were talking about how they were going to deal with this.  And they were talking about these women who were going out on maternity leave as if they were cattle.  And I'm sitting there, not believing that I'm sitting in this room, talking, they're talking like this.  And I'm thinking, this doesn't feel good to me.  You know, so I leave that meeting, and I remember saying to my boss, "You know, this is an uncomfortable situation for me."  The next day or the next week, Avon calls me again and says, "We got a job in human resources."  And I go up there and meet with them, and I loved Avon, I loved the--It was a, you know, it was a cosmetic company; it was happening, you know.
Speaker 2: Was it majority women in decision-making positions?
Speaker 1: Well, no, not when I got to Avon, it wasn't.  But that changed over time.  But as part of what I brought--I mean I worked on that while I was in the various jobs.  But so, I took the job at Avon, and I went back to American Express.  You know, I mean, I said, "Look, I've got an offer someplace else."  And they were devastated, "Oh, you can't go."  "Yes, I'm going.  This isn't the right environment for me," (laughter).
Story_ID: 326471
Speaker 1: I want to ask, I've always--I mean I know because I'm an intelligent person.  But what is human resources?  You know, it used to be called personnel.  But it's more than that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you give a little bit of background?
Speaker 2: So, it's the process, the people who define all the processes for how you're going to hire someone, how you're going to fire someone, and everything in between--all the education and training programs, all the compensation, you know, how compensation policy--how you're going to manage it, how you're going to administrate it.  It's all benefits, so today you know, you're going to have a pension plan, you're going to have a 401(k), you're going to--it's financially focused today.  And you know, what kind of medical plan are you going to have?  You know, all the other accoutrements that come with working for someone.  So, somebody has to be responsible for establishing the policies, the programs, and the processes for how those--Now, the managers of the company--you know, when I was working for Pfizer [Pfizer Inc.] George Watson [ph.], you know, we had six thousand managers.  They have to do it every day with the people who work for them.  But human resources sets all those policies, working in concert with the management team to decide on those big things, huge things.  So--
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, typically, like when I was at Pfizer, we were managing about nine billion dollars of their costs.
Speaker 1: That's like a small country (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Our payroll, our payroll was six billion [dollars], and so yes exactly, and so, you know, you're making pension decisions, you're making decisions--you know, we bought a company for thirty billion dollars.  How do you integrate all of these thousands of people that are coming?  What are the processes?  How do you make decisions on who's going to come or not come?  Who's going to--how are people going to get promoted, you know, whether or not you're going to put your jobs on the Internet or not, you know?  And how are you doing it?  And everything that you can imagine, you know, leadership programs and all those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: Which really didn't exist before.  It really was just like, we're hiring this person; we're firing this person.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you got to have, you've got to have processes for how that happens, or else there's chaos in companies with 122,000 people, which is what Pfizer had when I left there.
Speaker 1: Again, like a small, okay like a, like a city.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: A 122,000 people?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 326472
Speaker 1: So, part of human resources for you in the '80s [1980s] was diversifying--
Speaker 2: Diversity (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the workforce?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, how did that come into play for you? How did you do that?
Speaker 2: So I joined, I joined Avon [Avon Products Inc.].  And one of the things that we worked on, and I probably was at the forefront of, was helping Avon re-establish themselves from a diversity standpoint.  Because they had, had a reputation for that, but they had lost their way.  And one of the things I certainly have learned over the years is that you've got to be vigilant about that, if that's in your best interest.  And so, we did a lot of work.  A picture that I shared with, to have photographed was a picture that we started--for example, for, we had programs for how we would think about women who were in the pipeline, and developing special programs.  We actually developed a special program [American Institute for Managing Diversity] down at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] for our black employees to go to, and really it was around business.  And Roosevelt Thomas [Roosevelt Thomas, Jr.] taught that.  He had by that point gone back and got his Ph.D. at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and he'd come back and he was the dean of the business school at AU [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and whatever.  And we started up this thing, and it was a big thing. Yes.  Small the world is. And so, that was really about having the CEO think about what he wanted.  I was at Avon for fourteen years, and you know, we just kept focusing on diversity among many things, but, and particularly when I was in the U.S. business.  I was four years in international business, so I didn't spend much time at all in the U.S.  I was mentioning again another picture that we had taken; it was a picture of me in Japan.  Because I worked in Japan for three years, going back and forth.
Story_ID: 326473
Speaker 1: Well, I want to--now that is certainly a unique lifestyle.  So it's one thing to try and diversify the U.S. workforce.  But what are the challenges of diversity in the international workforce, which I guess on its face seems like--of course it's diverse because it's international.  But--
Speaker 2: Well, not really.  You can go to Japan and, you know, it's Avon [Avon Products Inc.], and you think--but you know, it's all men in that company.  The sales organization was female, but the management was male.  And--
Speaker 1: Top to bottom?
Speaker 2: Top to bottom.  And that was one of the focuses we had in Japan, was getting women into the management ranks.  And in that country at that time, for example, it was common that if a woman was in this job, and a man was in this job, the man made much more than the woman.  I mean that was norm; that was the way it was.  And you look at compensation data.  You know, I'd go there and I'd look at compensation data.  And you'd see these names, women's names, and their salaries were here.  And you'd see men's names here.  I mean it was legitimate and accepted and practiced, and it was not considered discriminating at all in Japan.  That was the way it had to be, and the way it was.  And so, for example, so here's an HR [human resources] executive decision.  I say, "That doesn't fit Avon's principles.  We want to pay men and women the same."  And the Japanese would argue with me, "We can't do that.  We cannot do that.  That is unacceptable in this country; it does not fit our culture."  And I would say, "I'm sorry it doesn't fit your culture; it doesn't fit Avon.  This is the company that sells products by women to women.  We are not going, we're going to go against your cultural norm, and we are going to set a compensation policy where men and women are paid the same.  So, figure out how you're going to get these women up to those levels, because you're going to pay them the same.  And on my next trip we're going to sit down and talk about how you're going to do that."  So, those are some of the things that happen in these international markets.  And so, they're small things, but they're big things there.  And it took us a year to figure that out, to work it through the Japanese culture; we had to work it through.  All of the senior management in the Japanese companies, I will tell you, to this day it's worked out there.  And I will tell you, Avon in that country has attracted more women to work for that company than any other kind of company there, because we changed those compensation practices.  And we said, "We're going to pay you what we pay guys."  And that started to tilt the scale there.  And it takes ten years for those kinds of things to happen in Japan.  I mean, they're not simple things, they're really big things.  But you kind of make those decisions and point out those things and work that stuff--So, that was kind of some of my early work there in 1983, '4 [1984], among other things.  I mean that's just an example.  But that's an example of what HR people do, and the kind of decisions they make. And the kind of dec- they work with the management team to do it, but it's their responsibility to look at these policies and look at these--all this stuff and say, "Okay, you know, how does this look?"
Story_ID: 326474
Speaker 1: What is it about HR [human resources] that interests you?  I mean you know, yeah, you had that rotation when you were at Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.], and you thought it was interesting.  But what is it that like makes you want to get up in the morning (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know what it was was, I had been dealing with product before, and it was good.  You know, it was great.  But I liked the people part of it.  I felt like I could influence more.  So, that kind of decision.  When I was at Avon [Avon Products Inc.] and we were having to reorganize all of our manufacturing facilities, and we did what was called workflow re-engineering.  And it was the most sensational thing I'd ever--we were taking--you know, usually you have a hierarchy in an organization.  And we were taking guys who were working on the floor in a manufacturing facility who were putting, just using forklifts and bringing merchandise and bottles out so you could fill them.  We were involving them in some of the decisions about what should happen on that manufacturing floor.  And I saw some of the most creative thinking, some of the best solutions, some of the speedier ways to get it done.  And I'm thinking, wow, this is sensational.  And I saw people developing.  You know, I saw guys who, they, you know, I used to say this to some of the management team there when we were making these kind of decisions about involving these junior level people.  They weren't junior level in terms of age, but in terms of there, where they ranked in the company and in decisions about what was going on.  And in manufacturing, I said, you know, "These guys go home"--guys--I'm using it generically--"go home and they're running their local fire departments.  They're, they're running, they're keeping the books for their church.  They're, they're running their churches."  I said, "They can do this at work, too.  It's just that you have guys who have decided they shouldn't do it; it's not that they can't do it.  They have the capacity to do it, so let's give them a shot at this."  And they learned to use technology and, you know, it was fascinating to me, it was a great thing.  So, it's that kind of stuff.  So, I see in human resources you're dealing with all aspects of human capability and the human capability of growing and learning and developing.  And that to me is just phenomenal.  So, that's what's got me into human resources.  So it's not a widget, a product, it's people. And I, and how I can influence--my work was about how I could influence the change in the development of individuals.
Story_ID: 326475
Speaker 1: So, fourteen sounds like very personally rewarding in, rewarding in terms of your career.  So you're there  from 1979 until--
Speaker 2: Through 1993, go to Burger King, come to Burger King.
Speaker 1: Now what happened to draw you over to the King?
Speaker 2: Well, it really was what happened that caused me to leave Avon [Avon Products Inc.].
Speaker 1: What happened at Avon?
Speaker 2: I was working for a guy that--came in to run the U.S. business, and I--he and I just had some big fundamental issues.  Part of it had to do with he was a new person to the company.  And I always said Avon was two things.  It was about lipsticks and teddy bears, lipstick being the product.  And teddy bears had to do with women and their self-esteem, a very simple equation, real simple.  And Avon was about the, the earning opportunity for women at Avon, to be their representative.  And if you traveled to Brazil, and I did, and traveled up the Amazon [Amazon River] with women who were--before they were an Avon representative, they were human laborers.  They carried backpacks on the back of mountains and, you know, that's how they earned their living.  Now, they sold lipsticks.  And earning opportunities--we went to Romania when the Wall [Berlin Wall, Berlin, Germany] came down, and we talked to women who were beginning to get into Avon.  And they, they didn't know they could do this.  And they would do it, and they made money for their families.  And equally in the U.S., these women who were housewives and they're treated like shit at home, they'd knock on their neighbor's door and sell some products, and they are all of a sudden they're little businesswomen with little businesses, little businesses.  But nevertheless, and learning how to influence somebody to buy a product.  And then in all of that, they get recognized for selling this level of sales and that.  And they'd come to these meetings at lunchtime, and you know, and on an annual basis there were the top winners.  And they were so proud.  And it's the only time in their life that probably they got any kind of recognition, because their husband is the truck driver, and you know, they don't have any--so, I always said it's about women and their self-esteem.  It's a simple equation, one, learning how to sell and run a little business, and then two, secondly, you know, selling products that they liked.  I still buy my, all my makeup is still Avon, and I wear it every day when I wear makeup, and that kind of stuff.  So that, so this guy--and I had some real fundamental kind of conversations about that--he didn't get the self-esteem part.  And I said I didn't want to work for him anymore.  So, I didn't.  It was a tough decision.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Fourteen years.
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: I had become vice president of international human resources, and I became vice president of human resources at the U.S. level.  And then he came in and I said goodbye, it was abrupt.  I said, "This isn't working for me."  I told him, "I said I don't like working for you.  We have some fundamental basic differences about how we see this and the world, and it's time for me to move on."  And I did.
Story_ID: 326476
Speaker 1: So I go from Avon [Avon Products Inc.] to Burger King.  I come down here to Miami [Florida].  This is where Burger King is headquartered.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Here, I don't know if when you guys landed you saw the big Burger King headquarters over by the airport.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: It's over there.  And I had the--so when I was Avon I had U.S. human resources, worldwide human resources.  But I didn't have a big top corporate job.  I came into Burger King in the big top corporate job.  And it was worldwide, and--
Speaker 2: What did they, what did they see in you that others hadn't?
Speaker 1: I think they saw my strength of character.  And clearly, I brought a lot of experience in change.  And they were about to go through a re-engineering project process for the entire business, worldwide.  And I would be leading that.
Speaker 2: And that's, for you, is that from the person behind the counter all the way up to the top?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  The re-engineering, yes, everything from--I was working for the CEO, and he was re-engineering the entire company.  And you know, human resources was a big, big, part of that.  Because literally and when we finished that effort--it was a year-long effort--everybody was in a new job doing different things.  So, how you define every job, every job in a big huge company and how they interacted with others?  And all the compensation issues, all the training issues, all the feedback issues, all of those were HR [human resources] questions.
Speaker 2: What were some of the things that you liked about being at Burger King?
Speaker 1: I liked that it was worldwide, I liked that it was a consumer business.  I liked the crew members.  Our crew members were--you know, just going into the store and talking to them and, you know, and helping our franchisees understand that they could motivate these people to be what they could be, you know, as crew members.  And, saw a direct correlation between good managers and good store sales, a direct correlation.
Speaker 2: That's a, you brought up an important point that I hadn't thought about.  As opposed to Avon, where it's almost like independent contractors, and then the management force at Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] everyone is a manager, or an employee.  But at Burger King, you have franchisees.  So, they you know, they own their business, but they also have to take--
Speaker 1: So, the way that worked was they owned their business, but they had to, they had to get through operations, they had to be certified.  Their people had to be certified to be in those businesses.  And all of that happened through what we call Burger King University.  All the training, I had responsibility for that.  So, 330,000 people come through some kind of training at Burger King University.
Speaker 2: How many Burger King stores are there around the world?
Speaker 1: Probably fifteen thousand now.
Speaker 2: Gee.  Does this ever keep you up at night, like worrying about so many people's jobs?  You know, just--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: I know not that you're going to fire anybody one day, but just that there's so much responsibility for so many people.  Like you said, the financial aspect, leadership training with franchisees.  I mean they made a significant investment of money to own this business.  And maybe they're not necessarily managers, but--
Speaker 1: So, what would keep me up at night was making sure that I had the right team to do the things that we needed to do.  And that's another lesson I learned.
Speaker 2: Well, we have a couple of moments.  What was it?
Speaker 1: The lesson was getting the right people working for me--
Speaker 2: Now how did you do that?
Speaker 1: --so that I wasn't up at night.  And I made some mistakes.  Sometimes I'd say, "Well, I don't need to hire, you know, I don't need to have this, I don't need to spend this kind of money to have this kind of person."  Wrong decision, wrong decision.  Move fast to get the best team around you that you can, better than I am.
Speaker 2: So, you subscribe to the, the school of thought that you don't hire people with less skills than you, so that you always look good.  But hire people even better?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know I just said that, and I should have let you say that.  But--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that I should hire people who can go beyond where I can go.
Speaker 2: Black, white, Asian, men, women?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I try to have a diverse team.
Story_ID: 326477
Speaker 1: What separates a good manager from a great manager?
Speaker 2: I think what separates a good manager from a great manager is, one, that manager doesn't need to, the great manager doesn't need to be the smartest person in the room.  In fact, usually isn't the smartest person in the room.  And knows how to get, how to get the very best out of every individual.  And every individual is different and needs different things.  So, I can remember, you know, walking in and having a new team, and realizing that it's going to take me two or three months to sort out really what turned this person on, or what that person needed.  And that took skill, to just try to know that, to try to understand that about people that I worked with, and trying to give it to them.  I mean I remember I had one team, and this one woman--I said she really is interested in power and being in the spotlight.  Well, I wasn't that interested in it.  So, it didn't matter to me, it mattered to her.  So I made sure she got all those things that would put her out there.  And one guy, interested in money, and I did my level best to--I acknowledged that that's what he was interested in, and made sure he got it.  He was worth it (laughter).
Speaker 1: If that's what it took to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to keep him on your team.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And this woman, she didn't care about money, she cared about power.  Fine, if you want to be out there doing these things, great.  And my husband [Frederick Jackson, Jr.] said to me once in this situation, he says, "You know, so and so seems to get--."  I said, "You know, she really likes that, and I don't really care about it."  I really didn't.  (Laughter) He said, "Well, don't you think you should do that sometimes?"  I said, "Yeah, but it's not that important to me," (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, like in speaking with your friends, they don't know really know what it is that you do because--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's not that important to me.
Speaker 1: The accolades.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, and they come, you know, they come anyway, they come your way anyway and you don't have to work that hard at it.
Story_ID: 326478
Speaker 1: If you work hard at what you do, and do it the way you can do it, then those other things happen for you.  And I mean I found this throughout my career.  I can tell you time and time again, and this was true at Avon [Avon Products Inc.] because I was moving up rapidly there.  I was surprised about five of those promotions that I got.  I didn't see them coming at all, never thought about it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You didn't want it?
Speaker 1: Never thought about--no, I didn't know.  I was working my job and doing what I did to the best of my ability.  And I did want it, but I didn't look for it.  I just was focused on what I had to do.  And I can remember the first promotion I was going to get.  The second promotion, it was a big promotion.  And I, they called me up to give me this promotion, and I just, I was stunned.  "You're going to promote me?"  (Laughter) And I was stunned, absolutely stunned.  I had no idea at all, none.  And the next time I was about to get another promotion, and I remember saying to this guy--he was going to make me a vice president, this was international.  And I get a call, and he wants to meet with me.  And I knew he was forming this organization, and I'm thinking, "Oh, interesting."  And I didn't know this guy.  He had known me because he had remembered me from something that happened, and I'll tell you about that.  And he said, "I want you to consider taking this vice president job."  Well, heck I was here, and that was there.  So, what do you mean, consider?  So, I looked at him and I said, "Have you thought about this carefully?"  Because I said, "I'd love to do the job, but I don't have any international experience."  I told them all the things I didn't do.  (Laughter) I said, "But let me ask you, why do you want me for the job?"  And he said, "You don't remember this.  I was in a meeting with you six years ago, and we were in the middle of deciding about how we were going to decentralize our Latin America business."  And he said, "You were the only HR [human resources] person in that room that was concerned about the people, and what they would think and how they would feel.  And you kept asking questions about, 'Well, if we do this, how do you think this group will feel about that?'  And you kept asking those kinds of questions."  And he said, "To me, that was more important than everything else we were deciding.  Because I, too, was concerned about how people were going to feel when they were told they didn't have any jobs here--that the jobs were going to Latin America, and this would be the process.   And you kept saying, 'Well, if we do this, how will people feel about it?'"  And he said, "You don't remember that.  But that to me was the most critical thing.  Everybody else was talking about everything else, but they weren't talking about that."
Speaker 2: Not about the people.
Speaker 1: The people and how they would feel. "And so, that's why I want you in this job.  I don't care that you've never been to London [England].  I don't care that you don't have that experience because that isn't relevant to what I want for a person in this role."  He was the president, the new president of this group.  And I said, "Oh, well, that makes me feel good."  And I said, "Yeah, I'll take the job, I'd love to take the job."  I said, "I don't have a passport," (laughter).
Speaker 2: One little thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 326479
Speaker 1: What year did you leave Burger King, and what caused that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What caused me? Okay.  So I left Burger King in '90 [1990], no let's see.  I got there in '93 [1993], left in '99 [1999].  I left because I had, at Burger King, I had worked for four CEOs at Burger King.  There was a lot of transition at the very top.  They were all very different and interesting guys, and I just said I wasn't going to work for the fifth CEO of Burger King.  And I knew the guy that I was then working for was going to leave at some point in the next year.  And so, I, you know, was getting calls from people all the time.  And the Compaq [Compaq Computer Corporation] opportunity seemed like a great one, and I took it.  I interviewed, and Kent Hunter [ph.], you know, would call me.  And I responded to several, and that one in particular and interviewed and went to Houston, Texas.
Speaker 1: Oh so, yeah, you had to pick up and move, leave here.
Speaker 2: We had literally just moved here.  My--We were, when I went to New York [New York] and interviewed with Compaq, the interview was one day.  They made me an offer, and that was unheard of.  I met this young new CEO, Michael Capellas at six-thirty in the morning for breakfast.  And at three-thirty in the afternoon he made me a job offer, and we had just planned to have breakfast.  After we had breakfast, he said, "Look, I have a board meeting here today in this hotel.  Could you stick around today?  What are your plans?"  And I said, "Well, I'm heading to Minneapolis [Minnesota] this afternoon, but I have the morning free."  He said, "Could you stick around, and I want to see if I can get some of my management team available to meet with you, and some of the board members."  So, I'm in that hotel all day long and meeting with these various people.  And my plane was canceled going to Minneapolis because it was the day of Hurricane Floyd, and no planes were flying anyplace.  And I was there, and it happened.  And I remembered leaving that room that day, that hotel that day, and going back to--we had an apartment in New York--and calling my husband [Frederick Jackson, Jr.] who worked for IBM [International Business Machines Corporation].  He was a thirty year IBM'er.  And I said, "I didn't tell you.  I forgot to tell you this morning--I had a lot of things going on in New York--that I was meeting with Michael Capellas."  And he says, "Well, who's Michael Capellas?"  "Oh, Michael Capellas, that's the new CEO at Compaq."  And, and, and he says--I said, "I had breakfast with him this morning, and I actually ended up having lunch with him, and he made me a job offer."  And he said, "What?" (Laughter) He said, "Aren't they in Houston?"  And I said, "Yes."  He said, "Yvonne [HistoryMaker Yvonne Jackson], do you know we're moving next week?"  (Laughter) We were, we had just downsized out of big house here, not too far from here, and moved here.  And so--
Speaker 1: Bada-bing bada-boom.
Speaker 2: Yes, but we kept this and we bought in Houston, and had a good time.
Story_ID: 326480
Speaker 1: --Let me touch on your personal life just for a moment.  So, when you left Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.], you were separated [from George Watson (ph.)] and--
Speaker 2: Ultimately divorced.
Speaker 1: Divorced?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you meet--
Speaker 2: Fred [Frederick Jackson, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Fred.
Speaker 2: Well, we met skiing in Canada. If you can (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What part?
Speaker 2: Eastern, Mont-Tremblant [Canada].  And we literally lived ten minutes from each other.  But we were both skiing there and, boom, that's how we met.  It happened for me on the slopes.  So--
Speaker 1: How tough is it for a black woman of your stature in the business world to meet another person?
Speaker 2: I'd given up on it.
Speaker 1: Because how long had you been divorced?
Speaker 2: Thirteen, almost, I was divorced almost thirteen years before Fred and I married.  So, I had just, I dated guys and it just always seemed like an issue.  And you know, there I am kind of moving up, and you know, doing my thing, and you know, and just meeting guys.  It was tough.  And I was, you know, I just could kind of, I was just having fun.  I just, I had given up on meeting anybody that I could be with for a long period of time, and then I met Fred.  And he was easy-going, and more importantly, he could accept my independence, because that was the big deal.
Speaker 1: The first--
Speaker 2: Yes.  I mean I was, look at my grandmother [Doll Beaty Lackey].  My mother [Gwendolyn Lackey Battle], I haven't talked about my mother.  But they were independent women, and here I was, that was me.  And I wasn't, that wasn't going to change.  I wasn't going to be anything different than that.  And you know, when Fred and I were dating, I was in that international job.  I was traveling literally 70 percent of the time.  I was out of the country, I was not here.  So, any man that could deal with that and be okay with it--I mean he had enough, you know, things of his own. That he was his own person, and he didn't require that we be dependent; we were interdependent, completely dependent on each other.  Now, the phase we're in now is we're learning how to be--we're in this--we're together now, we're both retired, doing this kind of retirement thing.  And so, we're figuring out how we spend so much time together because we haven't spent this much time together.
Speaker 1: It's totally different now.
Speaker 2: It's different, and we're older and all those older things.  But, anyway, yeah, so I had given up on that.
Speaker 1: How long have you and Fred been married?
Speaker 2: Seventeen years.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, congratulations.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: So, it's isn't easy.  So you guys, did you both move to Texas?
Speaker 2: No, I moved to Texas.
Speaker 1: And he stayed here [Coral Gables, Florida]?
Speaker 2: He stayed here, and he went back and forth.
Speaker 1: That's true love.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, when you're more mature, you can kind of work that out.  We knew we weren't going any more than one time zone.  So that--if we were going West Coast to East Coast, that's tough.  But one time zone, you know, you can still talk to each other every morning and every night without it being such--you know, somebody's up at six or five or you know, seven or, you know, nine, ten kind of thing, where it's not so--but he traveled enough such that he could spend a lot of time in Houston [Texas] and I could spend time here, and that's what we did.
Story_ID: 326481
Speaker 1: You're at Compaq [Compaq Computer Corporation] for--
Speaker 2: Three years because we got bought by Hewlett-Packard [Hewlett-Packard Company].  You heard about that big thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I used to own a Compaq laptop.  So I remember when I tried to get it fixed, then it was HP, and it just didn't work.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see (laughter).
Speaker 1: It was like, what's happening here?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: That was the biggest most outrageous acquisition.  You probably didn't follow it, but--
Speaker 1: No, no, that's why I do remember because--
Speaker 2: --Carly Fiorina.
Speaker 1: --I did actually have a personal investment of a laptop that just crashed and I needed it fixed, and it was right in the midst of all the mayhem.
Speaker 2: The transition.
Speaker 1: Because the HP CEO, I can't remember her name.
Speaker 2: Carly Fiorina.
Speaker 1: She really took a lot of heat.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: But what was it that was, I mean, tell our future viewers what was the controversy of that?
Speaker 2: Of that acquisition?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Her board, well, her shareholders did not believe she should buy Compaq because of the issue of PCs [personal computers].  Compaq was, you know, known for its business, PC business.  There's no margin in it.  And she had the same issues at HP, and they just thought you were just buying a company that's dying.  Because Dell [Dell Inc.], you know, was on the scene and doing well.  And so, that was the issue, the fundamental issue.  What, what they didn't see was the fact that while Compaq had been a PC business, we had bought digital some years before, which was really more large computers, Alpha chip and Himalayas from Tandem [Tandem Computers].  And so, it was a lot more than PCs.  That was probably one-third of the business, but the other two-thirds was that and professional services.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, but that was the big issue, and it was just--she had a shareholder who had been a board member who was fighting the deal, and he lobbied hard to do that.  And he had the HP family on his side.
Speaker 1: That's right, the family did support it.
Speaker 2: So, it was terrible for her and them, and certainly for Compaq because it had--the business, it had Compaq in limbo.  The shareholders had to approve it; we didn't know if they would.  And it was just a long, long, long tedious battle that was played out every day in the media, and one of the first of its kind played out that way, and for our employees.  So--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, here I am, head of HR [human resources].  So we announced in September that we were going to be bought by HP.  And as a management team, we spent a huge amount of time selling that idea, getting people excited about that possibility.  But when all this stuff started happening, we weren't sure that it actually would happen.  So we had to manage that, you know, all the morale issues associated with that.  And you've got to have people who are still productive wanting to fix people's computers.
Speaker 1: Because they didn't.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, you know, people go into foxholes under those circumstances.  What's happening, you know?  What are we supposed to think?
Speaker 1: Well, one's job is under fire as well.  Because in acquisition, I mean you have duplications.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: And even for you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --there's an HR director at HP.
Speaker 2: Correct, right, which is why I left.  So, you know, you had all those things.  And then, you know, we're trying to decide how we would make those kind of decisions--who gets the job, who doesn't get the job?  And that starts at the top and goes all the way down.  We had eight-five thousand people to make those decisions about worldwide.  So, you know, there are complicated things, and it was a tough one.
Story_ID: 326482
Speaker 1: It was, it was tough for me, it was tough; I had to make some personal decisions.  And that had to do with whether or not I would go with them [Compaq Computer Corporation] because they did want me to go with the HP Company [Hewlett-Packard Company].  But there were two things that happened.  One, I, it would have taken me to the West Coast, and it would have--secondly, and probably more significantly, it would have, I would have had to ask Fred [Jackson's husband, Frederick Jackson, Jr.] to retire from IBM [International Business Machines Corporation].  Because--
Speaker 2: Oh, HP and IBM (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We couldn't--HP and IBM were competing head to head.  And not so Compaq IBM, but HP IBM.  The new company would have had that issue, and I couldn't have been head of human resources for HP and have my husband working for IBM.  It just wouldn't have worked for me and for him.
Speaker 2: Mary Matalin and James Carville--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: They did it.
Speaker 1: No, I don't know how they do that and did it.  But it doesn't, it was already beginning to be a little difficult.  Because, let's say Fred would come and we would go to business dinners with me.  And he was always very supportive, and would always come to the business dinners when spouses were invited.  You know, my boss at the time would get, have a couple more glasses of wine and start talking about the competition.  And of course, he always thought the competition was IBM.  And there Fred sits listening to that B.S., and it was uncomfortable for him.  He would kind of shrug it off, but I know it was.  Anyway, so Fred had moved to Miami [Florida] with me.  And it took me a year to get him to come to Miami.  And when he came here, he said, "I'm never leaving," because he loved it down here.  And his office was technically in New York.  So he said, "I'm not leaving Miami," and he didn't.  So anyway, it was going to be complicated, personally, and I wasn't ready for that complication.  I wasn't that invested in it to want that kind of complication.
Story_ID: 326483
Speaker 1: So Pfizer [Pfizer Inc.] says (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, Pfizer said--and Pfizer was about to do an acquisition, and I had had enough experience planning for the HP [Hewlett-Packard Company]-Compaq [Compaq Computer Corporation] one.  They were buying Pharmacia [Pharmacia Corporation] and they were looking for a head of HR [human resources], and here I was.  And I wanted to get back to the East Coast, and I wanted to get back to New York [New York] in particular.  We had lived in, I had lived in New York by that point before coming to Miami [Florida] for twenty-three years.  So, New York was like home for me.  So, so, I went to Pfizer.
Speaker 1: How long were you there before you semi-retired?
Speaker 2: Three years.
Speaker 1: And then what led you to semi-retirement?  And don't say because you're getting old because I don't buy that.
Speaker 2: Well, a couple of things.  One, we went through the Pharmacia acquisition, it wore me out.  And two, we were going to make some management changes, and I decided at that point I didn't want to do those changes.  And I just said--I had--when I went to Pfizer I said to--I remember Fred [Frederick Jackson, Jr.] and I talking about this.  And I said, "Look, if I'm having fun, I'm going to stay five years.  If I'm not having fun, I'm staying three years."  Well, three years, here we were.  And I just said three years, and I don't think I like this, and like it enough to stick around for another couple of years.  And I would have had to commit myself.  With the changes that were going on, I would have had to commit myself for much longer than that, and I wasn't ready to do that.

Speaker 1: Now how did you get tapped to lead the Board of Trustees at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I went on the board years ago, eight or nine years ago.  And, started getting very involved in, you know, the board activities.  It takes couple of years to kind of find your way around these boards.  And so it did, that was the case at Spelman's board.  And so I, I led the team that brought in Beverly Tatum [HistoryMaker Beverly Daniel Tatum].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was the chair of the search committee.
Speaker 1: Because, let's see, Dr. Cole [Johnnetta B. Cole] left in '90-whatever [1997], and then [HistoryMaker] Audrey Manley.
Speaker 2: Right, and then Beverly Tatum.
Speaker 1: Now, she was at Mount--
Speaker 2: She was acting president at Mount Holyoke [Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, Massachusetts], yeah.  I think Johnnetta left, Johnnetta Cole left Spelman in '92 [1992], if I'm right [sic.].  Audrey Manley came in for five years.  She was a five-year president.  And then Beverly's been there almost four years now, Beverly Tatum.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I have her book, 'Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria' ['Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria: And Other Conversations About Race,' Beverly Daniel Tatum].
Speaker 2: Yes, a great book, isn't it.
Speaker 1: I do like it.
Speaker 2: So, I led the search team.  And typically what happens at Spelman is the person who leads, who is the chair of the search committee, ends up chair of the board.  So, I mean I knew that, that was a possibility.  And I, it was during the time that I was at Compaq [Compaq Computer Corporation] and working through all that HP [Hewlett-Packard Company] Compaq stuff that went on for nine months.  And so I, they asked me about chairing the board at the time that I, that Beverly came in.  And I said--and the current chair, June Gary Hopps, who's somebody you guys should interview.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.
Speaker 2: I was going to send you names.  But she, she's a Spelman grad too, '60 [1960] I think it is.  She was wanting to stay on as chair, which was fine with me because I had enough going on from a work standpoint.  And we agreed on her time, tenure, and that's how I ultimately became chair of the board.  So, it's--I'll tell you, my first year as chair of the board I was working, and it was tough.  It was tough because I couldn't get into it.  And I like to get into things--not that I run Spelman, that's not what I'm talking about.  But there are certain things you learn.  I'm learning about higher education and what kinds of strategic decisions you make from a board perspective.  And I'm just beginning to learn all that stuff, and I have time to learn it.  So, Beverly and I, you know, are spending a lot of time together talking about things that are important to Spelman's future, you know, ten years out.  We've got to think ten to fifteen years out.  We have to plan for the future of Spelman from that standpoint, you know, like land acquisition and expanding the campus.  And you know, those things take time.  And you know, what will our students need ten years from now?  You know, the world is flat.  How do we, how do we prepare our students for this now flat world?  And you've seen that book ['The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century,' Thomas L. Friedman], I'm sure.  You know, so how do we build a curriculum around that, and also this question of not only the academics of how we prepare students, but also the leadership and civic engagement issues.  You know, there's a lot of things going on in this country and in this world that our students need to be engaged around and as they leave Spelman.

Speaker 1: What has been the most rewarding part about being the chair person of Spelman's [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] Board of Trustees?
Speaker 2: I think the most rewarding--it's again about the sphere of influence, and it's working--knowing that I'm working on behalf of 2100 black women, and from, ensuring that I bring the very best in terms of thought leadership to the board for their future.  And that you know, and I'm loving it because I didn't love it the first year.  I couldn't think about it.  I was in the middle of acquisitions and, you know, working and traveling, and you know, and you know, and tired, and then trying to see my family.  And I have two little grandkids and we're trying to keep up with them.  And they live, as I told you, in Chicago [Illinois].  So, but it's just about the potential, you know.  And Spelman offers so much to so many people including myself, including you.  And there's so much connection with the Spelman woman.  And--
Speaker 1: It's pretty cool.
Speaker 2: It is cool, it is cool.  And ensuring that we're producing a product, the product are you and I, and the product is young, African-American women who not only will be successful in their own right, but also engaged around the community in which they live.  Because I think that's what Spelman helps you understand that, you know, that we don't live in this world by ourselves.  And so, just ensuring that we're, thinking strategically about how we, how we maximize that.  And Spelman has a lot of work to do on that.  But equally so, Spelman is doing great work.
Speaker 1: I always remember the mantra of my four years, lift as you climb, and not forget those people who live across the street.  Just because they're in the projects doesn't mean that they're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --that they're any less--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --than us.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And we can help provide opportunity.
Story_ID: 326707
Speaker 1: Now that we've kind of walked through your life up to this point, which is still--you're pretty young.
Speaker 2: Yes, I have another twenty to thirty years to go.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) At least.
Speaker 2: And it will be different.
Speaker 1: Well, so, yeah, looking back on all this, what do you think--I know when I ask a legacy question it doesn't necessarily mean that, you know, you have to be deceased to leave a legacy.  But when, you know, when I open the Spelman Messenger or someone else reads something about you, what do you want them to take away from your life and your experiences?
Speaker 2: I guess--I'm not sure, you know.  I'm still working that out.  But I guess what I hope that people think about [HistoryMaker] Yvonne Jackson is this: that she does reach back, that she is focused on including and ensuring we're at the table.  We were at a thing the other night, and I was very proud of this one guy, he's a reporter here in Miami [Florida].  And it was a Black History Month thing, and it happened to be at Burger King.  And they had three black college presidents there, and they were talking about historically black colleges [HBCUs].  And I got up to say something, to ask a question.  And afterwards, he said to me, "You were an executive here at, at Burger King many years ago."  And I said, "Yes."  He said, "You, I've heard so many things about you.  Because you truly did bring diversity to that senior management team at Burger King."  He said, "I've heard so many stories about you, and you know, you brought all these folks here, and you brought all this--." And I was proud to be known that way.  And that has been my mantra for the various places that I've worked.  So, that kind of legacy, it wasn't about talk, it was about action, relative to ensuring that, that you know, I can influence decisions that effectively get people of color and people who are different to the table.  And that's part of being in human resources.  And so, that kind of legacy is one thing, to be known that way, to know that that's what I've stood for.  And the other is what I stand for.  My, I'm sure you've heard this in these conversations.  I mean I have very strong values, and I'm very clear about them and they decide things for me.  You know the, I don't want to work at this company because of this; I'm not going to do this, you know.  The decision about my leaving Avon [Avon Products Inc.], you know, this, the self-esteem issue for women.  Well, it applies to me, it applies to you, it applies to us.  It's fundamental for me.  And you know, I just remember I worked for this guy once and he said, he was talking about black people someplace.  And he said to me, you know, he was talking about these people, black folks.  And he said, "But you're different than that."  And I was so upset.  And I said to him, "You know, I think I've made you too comfortable, because I'm just like those people.  Because if you saw me on the street, that's exactly who I am."  And he just looked at me, and he said, "I think I said something wrong."  And I said, "No, you said what you were thinking.  And I just need you to know that if you saw me on the street, you know me now.  But if you didn't know me and you saw me on the street, you wouldn't treat me the way you treat me sitting here in this office."  So, I don't forget who I am.  And I also want to educate other people about who I am and what prejudices we all bring to the table, but certainly in that case.  So influencing that, I guess, legacy.

Speaker 1: You know this is a question, I always say it's kind of funny because it's almost the same but somehow different, which is how would you like to be remembered? Which I suppose means thinking of yourself in the past tense.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess I want to be remembered as this honest, forthright, African American woman who you can trust. That's it.
Speaker 1: That's a pretty good recipe, I like it. Well, is there anything (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, that's my story.
Story_ID: 326709
Speaker 1: Well is there anything that I didn't ask you that you wanted to talk about?
Speaker 2: No, I guess that's it, I can't think of anything.  We, we've talked about so many things.
Speaker 1: Well, my, my goal is to be comprehensive--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and for you to share some great advice.  Well, there, my one last question, what advice would you give to someone who graduated from Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], May of this year getting ready to navigate the world?
Speaker 2: Three things.  Think about--so this goes back to, to your own self be true.  Think about who you are, and what makes you happy.  What are you passionate about?  And make that part of your life work.  So, if you love sports and you're just a sports addict, go work for the NBA [National Basketball Association].  Work someplace, we know we're all going to work.  Work for someplace where you can leverage that passion because it will take you a long ways.  That's one thing.  And people say that all the time, but I'm serious.  You know, I love fashion, that's why I went to work for Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] in merchandising.  I really loved it, and I still do.  The second thing is just know, again, to thine own self be true.  Understand who you are, what you're all about, and define that.  You've got to stand up for that.  So, stand up for something, and it has to be around your own personal principles, and be known for that.  And the third thing is be disciplined and focused, but recognize that you're going to have those failures, and you will learn significantly. They'll happen, they're going to happen, and it is what it is.  It's going to be that way.  It's how fast you pick yourself up.  If you're in a rut, figure out how to get out of it, and get out of it.  You don't have to do what you're doing, you don't have to be what you are.  You don't have to be in that relationship.  If it's a rut, get out of it, and you know, call it what it is--failure, it didn't work.  Move on.  And so as Bonnie [HistoryMaker Bonnie St. John] said, "It's just how fast you go--how fast you get up."  That was the difference between her being a silver medalist and a gold medalist.  You're going to fall down, it's how fast you get up.  So, and you get up and keep going.  And you may fall again, but it's how fast you get up.
Speaker 1: That was beautiful.
Speaker 2: Yeah, thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  This has been wonderful.
