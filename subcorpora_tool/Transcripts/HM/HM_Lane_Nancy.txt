Speaker 1: So I'm [HistoryMaker] Harriette Cole, I'm the interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Observing is Gloria Rodriguez.  We--today is October 28th, 2016.  We are in Greenwich Village in New York City [New York, New York] at the home of Nancy L. Lane [HistoryMaker Nancy Lane].  I would like for you to say for us--also, say and spell your name and tell us what you do.
Speaker 2: I'm Nancy L. Lane; and I am, you know, I'm one of those who has also flunked retirement, so after a corporate career, I'm now involved with museums and other not-for-profit organizations.
Speaker 1: Excellent.
Story_ID: 660199
Speaker 1: So I'd like to start with what we call People magazine type questions.
Speaker 2: Good.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yellow.
Speaker 1: And food?
Speaker 2: Almost everything.
Speaker 1: Season of the year?
Speaker 2: Summer.
Speaker 1: Vacation destination?
Speaker 2: New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite saying or phrase?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess it might be--once when I really wanted something badly, and I couldn't, couldn't achieve it, and I was crying and telling my mother [Gladys Lane], and she said, "Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Lane], think about your faith.  It tells you to make the--it, it tells you, you know, to--let it strengthen you."  And I said, "Mother, it tells me to make things happen that I want to happen, and it's up to me to make it occur."  And so that's it: it's up to me.
Story_ID: 660200
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your mother.  Well tell--please tell me her name and when and where she was born?
Speaker 2: So my mother was Gladys Lane, born in Boston [Massachusetts], and her mother was born in Boston, and our family moved to Boston right after slavery; and so she passed away a while ago.  And she encouraged me to do many of the things that I hadn't realized that she would have done if her circumstances had been different, but, fortunately, she encouraged me, and so some of the things that I've achieved were as a result of that.
Speaker 1: And so she was born in Boston.
Speaker 2: She was.
Speaker 1: And you say that her family moved there right after slavery.  How far (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Her--
Speaker 1: --back can you--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --trace her family?
Speaker 2: Well, so far, I've done 1860, right.
Speaker 1: And so 1860 is during slavery, so you know, you can identify family members who were enslaved?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I have a listing of who was free and who was--is enslaved--
Speaker 1: In--?
Speaker 2: --because--even within the same family.  Some--and even within the same generation, some were free and some were enslaved.
Speaker 1: Do you know any stories about them?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't know how it happened that those distinctions were made.
Speaker 1: Do you, do you know what names?  Do you remember any?
Speaker 2: I know their first names.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so--do you want their first names?
Speaker 1: Yes, please.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  Well, I know Ned [ph.].  I know Susan who became--she was Susan Mukes Dubois [ph.]; and Cora Mukes [ph.] is also an ancestor; and those are the ones that come off the top, right.
Speaker 1: But you know that even in that same generation, there were some who were free--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and some enslaved.  Where did they live?
Speaker 2: They lived in Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you know the circumstances of their freedom?
Speaker 2: I don't.  All I do know is that the matriarch in the family, when they became free--when everyone was free, the matriarch in the family said, we're moving to--we're moving north, and I know that on the way she died, and somehow they managed to still make it to Boston.
Speaker 1: Wonder why Boston was the choice--do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't.  I don't.  But I would assume a sense about the abolitionist movement there.  That would be my guess.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 660201
Speaker 1: And what about your father?
Speaker 2: My father was from Alexandria, Virginia.  And my father came from a large family--they had one daughter, and then they had eleven boys in a row.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And, and then they had a couple of daughters, but, as a result, those eleven boys felt that to have a daughter was such a, such a joy, such a privilege; and therefore, all of their daughters were treated with the same way that they had been raised to respect their sisters and to support their sisters.
Speaker 1: Well, what was your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So I'm lucky.
Speaker 1: --father's name?
Speaker 2: Samuel Lane.
Speaker 1: Samuel Lane.  And where is he in the birth order?
Speaker 2: He was the youngest of the boys.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, therefore, his brothers--he moved when he was a young adult.  He moved from Virginia with the family, with his mother.  She stayed there in Virginia.  And he moved and lived for a while with each of his brothers who had also moved to Boston [Massachusetts].  There were three brothers in Boston.
Speaker 1: And did they share why they chose Boston?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know.  But for each of them, there were opportunities in Boston that were really quite remarkable at that time.
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: Well, for example, my uncle John, he went to law school along with my father; and my uncle is--was very entrepreneurial.  Can I tell a story?
Speaker 1: Please.
Speaker 2: So one day he was visiting a friend who lived in Plymouth [Massachusetts] where the rock [Plymouth Rock] is, and after the Civil War, the same way that white people received thirty acres and a mule, blacks who had served, some of them who were in the Massachusetts area, received land in Massachusetts, in Plymouth; however, the location of the land was not really very attractive.  My uncle was visiting his friend that day, and a neighbor came in and said, "I've just come to say goodbye because I'm selling--I'm giving up my home," which was one of those that had been received.  And my uncle say, "Why?"  And he said, "I can't keep up the payments on the mortgage."  And my uncle said to him, "When is it--when will the bank take it over?"  And the man said, "Tomorrow."  My uncle said, "Sell it to me."  The man said, "Well, why would you buy it when you can only own it for twenty-four hours?"  My uncle said, "Let me worry about that.  Tell me the price, and I'll buy it."  My uncle John then went to the bank and said to the banker, "I'm now the owner.  You know you won't be able to sell this property," because it was a small black community in Plymouth, he said, "and so, therefore, let me take over the mortgage.  That'll be good for your bank, and it will be fine for me."  And so my uncle, for that small amount of money, took over that mortgage and other adjoining property in Plymouth.  And I'm saying that as an example of what an entrepreneur he was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  And what--which uncle was this?  What's his name?
Speaker 2: This was my uncle John T. Lane [ph.], very--
Speaker 1: And --
Speaker 2: --particular about his middle initial.
Speaker 1: John T. Lane.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And where was he in the birth order?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Thank you (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was he older than your father?
Speaker 2: Everybody was older than my father.
Speaker 1: Oh, right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Of course--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --because your father was the youngest boy.
Speaker 2: He was the baby, right, right.
Speaker 1: And when was your father born?  Do you know what year?
Speaker 2: I don't know the year, right.
Speaker 1: When--but before they moved, what--and actually, just looking at your father's family history, how far back can you trace his family?
Speaker 2: I'm embarrassed to say that I have not traced his family yet.  Just working on my mother's family has been such a challenge.  But I do know when I visited Alexandria, I went to the street where he grew up, and there was a church there, and they have records in that church.  So once I complete the project with my mother [Gladys Lane] and that family, then I'll be going on to my father's family.
Story_ID: 660202
Speaker 1: How did your parents [Gladys Lane and Samuel Lane] meet?
Speaker 2: Harriette [HistoryMaker Harriette Cole], you're a trip.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I, I'm vaguely remembering now.  There were a series of social activities organized by a woman, Marguerite Cartwright who was a phenomenon herself.  Marguerite, who lived in this building that I'm in and was the godmother of Patricia Williams, who is a writer for The Atlantic, Marguerite Cartwright held a series of social events at 464 Mass Avenue [Massachusetts Avenue].  Boston [Massachusetts] people know that location.  And I suspect they might have met there.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so they married.  Where did they live?
Speaker 2: They lived as--I don't know their initial home, but I know they lived in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], which is where I grew up.
Story_ID: 660203
Speaker 1: When you think back on the early days, what is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well, my earliest childhood memory is not a happy memory.  My mother's sister, Rita [ph.], lived with us off and on most of my childhood; and one evening, my father [Samuel Lane] was taking my mother [Gladys Lane] out to some affair, and my aunt was staying at someone else's home at that point, and they had a dog, and when the dog was eating one afternoon--and I was three--I went over to the dog with some toys and spoke to the dog and then went back about what I was doing.  And when the dog finished eating, he came over and knocked me down and bit me, and the scar starts right in the corner of my eye.  So lucky from day one because it was just right in the corner and then goes down my face.  And so I remember that.  I remember them taking me to the hospital; and then when they brought me home, I remember they opened the door, and my mother was in the bedroom, and there I was with a bandage all over half of my face.  My mother is screaming.  But I also remember getting in the bed with my mother, and she was comforting me; and my father brought me something I adored: a glass of milk.  I adored milk, and he brought it to me in a wonderful red cut glass, glass, and, and so I remember vividly that he gave me something that I so adored.
Speaker 1: Wow, age three.
Speaker 2: I remember that, yeah.
Story_ID: 660204
Speaker 1: You grew up in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], you said.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you grow up in a house?
Speaker 2: An apartment.
Speaker 1: An apartment.  What are the sights, sounds, and smells that you remember as a child, at home or in your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well, so I remember--of course, we had a wonderful church in my neighborhood, St. Mark's church, Congregational church [St. Mark Congregational Church, Boston, Massachusetts].  I remember some neighbors whose name--their name was Baskerville [ph.], and I remember vividly--once the Baskervilles give me a birthday party.  I think it was my first birthday party ever.  And I remember how these neighbors made me feel so special.  I sat at the head of the table.  They brought out the cake.  We sang 'Happy Birthday.'  I always remember their generosity to me.  And so many, many years later, I was in Boston [Massachusetts] for an event, and a group that--you see, where we lived in Roxbury was called the hill.  So many black neighborhoods, as you know, have--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --the hill; and so a group of Roxbury people, annually, organized an event called Over the Hill [ph.].  And we were from all over the hill, and one year I attended from New York [New York], and I saw members of the Baskerville family, and I asked for Sylvia [Sylvia Baskerville (ph.)].  This really makes me feel emotional right now even.  I said, "Is Sylvia still here?  Is, is she here tonight?"  And they said, no.  I said, "Tell Sylvia, I so remember that party."  And I did.  I remember Sylvia's mother being so nice to me for that party.  It was very special event in my life.  And it shows how neighbors can make such a sense of community.  They were nice people.  Not related; nice people (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 660205
Speaker 1: How many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: You're the only child.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and what was your father's work?
Speaker 2: Well, my father [Samuel Lane] had a number of jobs, none of them major jobs like his brothers, but--so he worked for American Airlines at one point, and he worked for a company that made steel, used steel in products; just a whole range of jobs.
Speaker 1: And what about your mother [Gladys Lane]?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother worked--her final career was working for the State of Massachusetts.  And I can remember one day she was thinking about taking the civil service exam, and my mother was so smart that I was surprised she hadn't done this before; and she told me later, she never would have done it if I hadn't encouraged her.  You know, it just shows the reciprocal kind of relationship.  And so, so she took that one.  She moved into a job, a civil service clerical position, and she kept moving and moving and moving.  She kept taking exams.  She got caught up on it.  She loved it.  And she was successful at it.  So, so that was what she did.  She loved working with computers.  She, she had a lot going for her.
Speaker 1: And did either of your parents go to college?
Speaker 2: My father went to law school.  And in those days, you could go to law school without going through an undergraduate degree.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Well, in fact, at one point, because you read about it with our presidents, they didn't go to law school, but you could still sit for the bar without going to law school even.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And did he ever practice?
Speaker 2: He did not, no.
Story_ID: 660206
Speaker 1: So as an only child growing up with loving parents [Gladys Lane and Samuel Lane], what, what were you like as a, as a child?
Speaker 2: Very conservative.  Very--I loved doing things, and I knew that if people liked taking me places that would take me even more places, so I really--I was someone people would say, "Okay, we'll take Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Lane] with us."  So, for example, my aunt, when she, she went to church, and she went to a Pentecostal church, and they had some of the great gospel singers.  I never knew why she didn't take her three children, but she took me.  And then another neighbor, I remember she would take me to picnics that her organizations would give and so forth.  So I, I was, I was quiet and reserved.  And that's why, subsequently, some of the things I've done, I take great pride in because it shows growth.
Speaker 1: Growth in the sense of not being as quiet?
Speaker 2: And not being afraid to do things independently, not needing somebody to take me by the hand to a picnic and so forth.  I now take myself by the hand.
Speaker 1: Would you describe that you were shy at that time?
Speaker 2: I was quite shy.  And, and also, for example, when I was thinking about going to college, the guidance counselor said to me in, in my high school [Roxbury Memorial High School, Boston, Massachusetts], "Oh, no, Nancy, don't even think about that."  You know, et cetera.  So, you know, I, I was shy and, and didn't have the kind of self confidence that also I developed.
Story_ID: 660207
Speaker 1: Where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: In Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] at the--let me just think--Henry Lee Higginson school, and the--Henry Lee Higginson-Lewis, Lewis school [Henry L. Higginson Elementary School]; and then Roxbury Memorial [Roxbury Memorial High School, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: And so Roxbury is the--is, is a black neighborhood in, in--
Speaker 2: Well, when I grew up--
Speaker 1: Or was it then?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I grew up, it was, I would say, 30 percent Jewish.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the rest black, but black with a mixture because you know how black neighborhoods are.  So they are--the man who had the local Chinese laundry was a partner with a woman who was a black woman from Canada, et cetera, et cetera, so it was quite a mixed community.
Speaker 1: And were there West Indians in your neighborhood at that time?
Speaker 2: Not at that time, but subsequently.  And those who came, they moved into what we called downtown more than the hill.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Subsequently, of course, it's changed dramatically.
Speaker 1: So as, as you recall your neighborhood growing up, you mentioned the, the one family of neighbors, but tell me about other people, like what--and what did they do?  What--?
Speaker 2: So let's just say, well, one of my close friends, I--you know, it's funny, I don't think we really focused very much on what occupations people had, but maybe more on their interests.  So my friend Claudette [ph.], her father was an incredible baseball fan.  He went to all the games.  He took us twice.  He took me twice.  I don't how many times she went.  And, and then there was a young--a woman my age, a girl my age, and she had grandparents who lived in Framingham [Massachusetts]; and Framingham in those days was rather rural.  Her grandfather had been a jockey, and so we would go out there, and I would go out for weekends and ride horses with her.  Her father was in the [U.S.] military; and then--and she died as a youngster, I think a kidney condition, and so her parents, who had been estranged forever, reunited and subsequently had another child, and her mother--I can remember her mother saying, "You know, Jackie [ph.] always said to me, 'Why don't I have a sister or a brother?'  And now, of course, she would."  It was very sweet.  And, and then my dear friend Phyllis [ph.] who is still a dear friend, her father--I don't know what he did for a living, but I know that he sang with a gospel group, and they were on the radio; big deal for us.  On Sundays we would hear her father on the radio.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She had lived in town.  She moved to our n- our block, et cetera.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 660208
Speaker 1: Who was Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Lane] the student as, as a young girl?
Speaker 2: Well, I was--you know--I was just--I was active in high school activities, and, you know, active in student government.  Also, as a youngster, I had the privilege of being in a neighborhood [Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts] where we had a library with an extraordinary librarian, Mrs.--she became Mrs. Lehane [ph.], and she had a different name earlier when I knew her; and, and so we had--in the summertime--we had a reading club, and, and that was super, and then at the end of the summer, they would have this sort of costume party, and also that librarian introduced me to Mary Poppins books [P.L. Travers] and so on.  You know, she always knew--you'd go to the library, and you'd say, "I'm looking for something.  What, what, what do you have?"  And she knew just what a girl my age would want to read.  And the incredible thing is that subsequently, when I was in college [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], one of the part time jobs I had was working for the woman who was in charge of Judaica for the Boston Public Library [Boston, Massachusetts].  I worked in a Boston Public Library on West Street, which is near Beacon Hill [Boston, Massachusetts]; and one day Mrs. Lehane--she had married, you know, she became Mrs. Lehane--walked into that library, and I--you know, she was such an influence in my life, so to meet her again when I was a young adult was such a joy and such--so wonderful for me to be able to tell her what she had meant to me.  And the woman I worked for was quite extraordinary, Fanny Goldstein.  I didn't realize it at the time, but she founded what became Boston--not just Boston--Jewish book month or something like that [National Jewish Book Week], and so within the world of librarians and who care about Judaica, Fanny Goldstein is very well known, and so that was a great part time job (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And this--when you, when you worked there, at what point is this in your life?
Speaker 2: It was when I was going to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it was your--that was your after school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a part time job, yeah, right, right.
Story_ID: 660209
Speaker 1: So where did you go to college?
Speaker 2: Well, I did--my undergrad degree comes from Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts], and I graduated from there in 1962.  And while I was an undergraduate, though, I thought, I'd love an experience which won't be so influenced by color.  And so I wrote to ten universities around the world and said, "Here's my name.  Here's my background.  Would it be possible for me to have a scholarship and spend a semester with you?"  And the University of Oslo [Oslo, Norway] said yes.  And so when they notified me, they said it would be free tuition and free room and board.  So I said to my mother [Gladys Lane], "Gee, mom, I don't think I'm going to go because there are the expenses involved in travel."  I really didn't want to go because my boyfriend was in Boston [Massachusetts], and I didn't want to leave him.  And my mother said to me, "Of course, you're going to go."  Now, my mother had been to New York [New York] maybe once in her life as a youngster, and she had been to Maine.  That was it for her travel at that time.  But she said to me, "Of course, you're going to go."  So stop me, Harriette [HistoryMaker Harriette Cole], if this is a little more than you want to know.
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: So I said to my boyfriend, "I've got a chance to go far away for a whole semester.  It was a summer semester."  And he said, "How good for you."  Well, that wasn't the answer I wanted from him.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And so I said, "Well, you know, it's far away."  And he said, "You're going to love California," so he took me to the airport, and that's when he learned I was going to Norway.  I didn't tell him until then.  (Laughter) But, and I was so angry about that and so forth, so, anyway, so--
Speaker 1: Because you wanted him to say--
Speaker 2: I wanted him to--
Speaker 1: --"Stay."
Speaker 2: --say, "No, no, no."
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: He said, "Yes, yes, yes," so off I went.  And so just following up on my education, so I did the, the degree came from Boston University, semester in the University of Oslo; and then for one semester, I was a teaching fellow at Boston University.
Story_ID: 660210
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And--well so I want to go back.  I want to ask you some things--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --about your time there.  You mentioned that you wanted to have an experience that was not--
Speaker 1: Not bound by color.
Speaker 2: --not bound by color.  So I, I'd like to know, what was your experience, you know, being bound by color?  Because the--you know--the--you graduated [from Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] in '62 [1962].  So leading up to that, the United States was in turmoil.
Speaker 1: Yes.  But I must say that--and also people, when they speak of Boston [Massachusetts], they always tell me how racist Boston was, but my experience was somewhat different; in that--so even though I wanted to go away where it wouldn't be bound by color, evidently, there was that much of an influence, and so I wanted to see what would life be like.  And so life for me in Boston, it was what life was for any black girl growing up; and I don't remember--you see, we didn't have relatives in the South to visit, so I didn't know very much about that kind of experience, and my neighborhood [Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts] was mixed racially, so I mentioned the, you know, the library club and all of that, so I never--
Speaker 2: Which was racially mixed.
Speaker 1: Which was racially mixed.  And though I'm sure there were many experiences that were affected by color, I don't remember them--with one exception.  I never had a black teacher until I was in graduate school [University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], so there was one--I knew growing up that there was one black teacher at the high school [Roxbury Memorial High School, Boston, Massachusetts].  She taught French, Ms. Brown [ph.], and so, so, therefore, there was that level of awareness.  I also went to summer camps, and those were black camps, which was wonderful because that's where I learned about black history.  But, but other than the sort of things that happened in high school--I mentioned the teacher, the guidance counselor not supporting my interests and so forth, I don't remember being restrained by color.  But, nevertheless, clearly, I was because I went all the way to Norway to see a life that was different.
Speaker 2: So you weren't necessarily conscious of it, but you--
Speaker 1: That's right.  It wasn't a big factor in my life, but--
Speaker 2: Did your parents [Gladys Lane and Samuel Lane] talk about--
Speaker 1: Never.
Speaker 2: --race at all?  No.
Speaker 1: Never, never, never.  Now, my uncles were very active with political organizations and so forth.  My uncle was--my uncle David [ph.] ran for city council and he worked with Robert Weaver [Robert C. Weaver] in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] on housing, and, as I told you, my uncle John [John T. Lane (ph.)], but my uncle John was quite successful; and so--but the subject--my uncles were also active in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and the Urban League, and my uncle David was the chair of the board of the Urban League, but in my family, we, we, we weren't--we didn't talk about it very much.
Speaker 2: And they didn't talk that much about what they were doing with the Urban League around you?
Speaker 1: My uncles?  No.
Speaker 2: You just knew that they--
Speaker 1: I knew what they were doing, but, no, no, no.  Our lives were very different (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 660211
Speaker 1: So you go to Norway.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: This is your first time going anywhere, is it?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's my first time abroad.
Speaker 1: First time abroad.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what is your experience being in Norway?
Speaker 2: So wonderful.  First of all, you know, I remember getting off the train and wondering--getting off the plane, and somehow getting into Paris [France].  I, I was able to get a cheap fare from Boston [Massachusetts] to Paris; and then I had to find the train station to get to Norway, and I remember I saw a group of black people, and I raced after them, and I said to--, "Please tell me where the train station was."  Well, they only spoke French.  I was kind of stunned, you know, I mean, here I am--I expected everybody that was black--
Speaker 1: And you hadn't taken French from that one black teacher (laughter).
Speaker 2: From that one teacher, right.  And so there I was just stunned that here were black people all speaking French, you know (laughter), and so I somehow got to the train station, and, you know, it was the least expensive fare, so you slept in the, in the seats and so forth, and, and I remember the train had a layover in Copenhagen [Denmark]; and I'd met a man and a woman on the train, and the three of us went to a restaurant to eat lunch, and people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They were American?
Speaker 2: No.  She was--I don't remember what they were--
Speaker 1: They spoke English.
Speaker 2: --but they were not American.  They spoke English.  And I remember that we were in the restaurant, and people gathered outside to look at me, you know, they were gathered there outside of the restaurant.  I guess we ate in the outdoor restaurant, and they were all just agog, you know.  And I felt great.  I knew it wasn't a negative or a hostile group.  And so--and then when I was there in Norway, there were, there were no other black women in the program that I was in [at the University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway], but there were a couple of black guys that--well, there were black guys from South Africa, refugees from apartheid, and, and there was a--one black man who I got to know, but he was very urbane.  I always felt, you know, like kid from the hicks with him.  But--and--but, also, in Norway, this was the first time that a black person was appointed the ambassador to a non-black country; and he was a family friend, a friend of my uncle's.  This was Clifford Wharton, Sr. [Clifford R. Wharton, Sr.].  His son (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 2: --is well known.  Clifford Wharton, Jr. [HistoryMaker Clifford R. Wharton, Jr.], having been a university president [at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] and heading up foundations and so forth; but Clifford Wharton, Sr. was there, and my uncle had told me to look him up and so forth.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And so he and his wife [Harriette Banks Wharton] were very gracious to me, having me over to the embassy for dinner and so on.  And then there was a black woman who was originally from Cambridge [Massachusetts], and a friend had told me about her, and I looked her up, and she was just a gem to know, and we continued our friendship after I left Norway; and--you've got the time for her story?
Speaker 1: We'll pause for one moment.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 660212
Speaker 1: So you were telling me in Norway (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  That friends told me about a woman there; and she, as a child, had always wanted to be a veterinarian, and, and at one point during her childhood, someone gave her a book on Norway.  But, anyway, at that time, only two colleges in the country, two veterinarian colleges admitted women: Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute School of Veterinary Medicine; Tuskegee School of Veterinary Medicine, Tuskegee, Alabama] and Cornell [Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, Ithaca, New York].  And so she went to Tuskegee, but while she was there, she became ill a few times, and her sister, June Jackson Christmas [HistoryMaker Dr. June Jackson Christmas], renowned psychiatrist, et cetera, was still in medical school [Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts]; and so the one I knew, Geri [Geraldine Jackson], her family said to her, "Geri, we can only afford to have, at this point, one child in medical school," and so Geri left veterinary medicine school, came home, and one day--and she stayed with her grandmother--one day she said to her mother [Lillian Riley Jackson], "Mommy, when you come to visit on Sunday, bring my trunk," and Mommy did.  And that's when she said to Mommy, "Mommy, you know my interest in Norway?  I'm going there to live forever," and so she did.  She moved there.  She'd written to a college of veterinary medicine there, and they arranged for her to live with a family and learn the language, and she began knitting.  She loved everything about--everything in Norwegian culture, and so when I met her, she had moved from being with that family to working in Oslo [Norway]; and we would go out on dates with Norwegian guys, and she would debate Norwegian history with them and Norwegian government.  She knew everything about the country, and she also avoided Americans, and so when Americans would speak to her, she would speak in Norwegian.  She was so committed.  And she, of course, became a citizen, married twice--both Norwegians, of course.  But the joy of her story, too, is--and, you know, it's a constant message.  At one point she said to herself, I have Norway, my long dream.  Why don't I make it happen to become a veterinarian?  And so later in her life, she went back to college and became a veterinarian.  And I was with her, Geri, and her sister June once; and June said, "To study medicine in a foreign language takes such discipline.  I so admire what you've done."  And so she became a veterinarian.
Speaker 1: So for you having--you're, you're all the way across the world, meeting people you know, people you've come to know who from the states, but also immersing yourself in Norwegian culture.  How, how did that affect your sense of self?
Speaker 2: I'm glad you asked because it was another thing I wanted to mention (laughter), which is, you know, I had, I had so much more self confidence as a result of being in an environment where I was automatically admired, automatically accepted, welcomed, et cetera, rather than accepted, and so with a French student, a woman, I went hitchhiking.  You know, I mean, there wasn't--yeah, I mean, and so she and I hitchhiked around in Norway.  People picked us up, and not only picked us up and gave us a ride, took us to their homes.  We never stayed at a hotel.  We stayed in people's homes overnight, and, and never had a problem.  Never had anyone say anything inappropriate to us, always welcomed us.  She was white French, and I was me; and, and it was just a wonderful time.  You know, after experiences like that, you, you just gain your ability and your self confidence and a sense of what you can achieve.
Story_ID: 660213
Speaker 1: At what point is it forming in you what you want to do with your life?
Speaker 2: Well, I still didn't know, and so I came back home and completed my studies.
Speaker 1: And what was your major?
Speaker 2: Public relations, journalism.  And, and so I had applied--I was thinking of going to grad school; and, and then an opportunity came up to be responsible for a group of Americans spending time in Austria, and so, you know, the new me said, let's go.  And so I was with an organization then called the Experiment in International Living, and I had been such a fan of the experiment which was why I had written to them and gotten to know them, and I had read about them in magazines and so forth.  And so each member of our group lived with a different family in Austria, southern Austria, and in an area where during World War II [WWII], American soldiers had no gone that far south; so, therefore, people there were not familiar with seeing blacks.  I was the only black in our group, and it was also an area that was--it was in the--a small town called Bruck an der Mur [Austria], and in a section of Austria that was also very pro-Nazi, so even some of the families that we stayed with still had the Nazi insignia on the walls.  I mean, it was a whole different world; but other than people staring at me all the time, which became a little tiresome, but never saying anything inappropriate, I, I had a great experience.
Speaker 1: And this was right after you graduated college [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: That was the summer of '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: So, now, you've described being in two different European countries where people are staring at you, but it sounds like the energy was different in Austria--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --than in--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --France [sic.].
Speaker 2: But it wasn't negative.
Speaker 1: It wasn't.
Speaker 2: It was just curious.  I once went with the woman who--whose home I was in, you know, was a woman and her husband and two daughters.  Well, when we went to the local spa, and we went in the steam room, there was not an inch that wasn't examined.  You know, nobody touched me, I mean; but everybody got a good hard look at every single inch.  And, and then also what happened was because I, I didn't speak German, much less the Austrian dialect of German, must less the dialect in the little, (pronunciation) dialect in the little village that I lived in, so everything I learned was classic for that area.  And one day I'm walking down the street, and a man asked me a question and somehow I understood the question, and I was able to answer it, and we chatted for a bit, and then I learned he was studying English, so that made it easier; and, and so we dated a few times, but he told me that my dialect, he said, was so pure from that area, that he just assumed somehow I had been born there.  I loved it.  Such a great compliment, you know, so, yeah.
Story_ID: 660214
Speaker 1: So you are blossoming in these, in these--
Speaker 2: Yes, I was, Harriette [HistoryMaker Harriette Cole].
Speaker 1: --experiences traveling globally.  How are your parents feeling about you going across the world?
Speaker 2: My mother [Gladys Lane], you know, she wished me to go to Norway, and I had expected that I would--I, I wasn't exactly sure what I was going to do immediately after college.  I had been offered a teaching fellowship, but then something happened.  And so, so she said, "Take the summer off, Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Lane].  You've worked hard.  Take the summer off; and then when you come back, you can make up your mind about what you want to do."  My father [Samuel Lane] was dead at that time, you see.
Speaker 1: Ah.
Speaker 2: And so what happened is that while I was in Norway--I mean in Austria, I got a letter that my mother had forwarded from one of my favorite Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] professors saying that the person he had selected as a teaching fellow was not going to be able to come.  Would I like to do that?  So I came back and I spent a semester as a teaching fellow at Boston University.
Speaker 1: So was this your first--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --job after graduating?
Speaker 2: It was.  But I also said to myself that same question--I said, Nancy, are you sure this is what you really want to do?  Because if you're not sure, why pursue a degree in this field at that time?  And so a classmate from Boston University said to me, "Nancy, why don't you come and work where I'm at?"  And it was a sportswear company in Boston [Massachusetts], and my job was in employee relations but writing the company newspaper, organizing events for the employees.  It was an organization that didn't have a union, and in the sportswear industry, that was unusual; and so--and they were very successful and a family owned business, and so I, I said, I'll--I told my professor, "I don't think I want to continue with the master's degree in journalism, so let me move off into this," which I did.  And so I worked for them for about, oh, I guess, a little over a year.
Story_ID: 660215
Speaker 1: And then another opportunity came my way, and, as you know, I'm now into, yes, let's give it a shot.  And that was an opportunity to work in the Netherlands; and so I took a job working for what was like a student United Nations, and so people who've traveled abroad and had student travel passes that allowed you to have discounts on travel, this organization was the one that created those tickets and passes, but also organized conferences for student organizations from all over the world; and so I worked with the North American representative.  There were three of us there including me, and then everybody else was from another part of the world, and so it was very much (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And so this was in the Netherlands?
Speaker 1: In the Netherlands.  And so we worked in a small town outside of Leiden [the Netherlands], so Leiden is like Cambridge [Massachusetts] is to the United States.  Leiden is where the oldest university I think in the world exists [sic.]; and, and so we worked in a village outside of Leiden near the, near the seashore, and so I worked--I lived in a student house at one point, and then I sublet a home from a family that lived in The Hague [the Netherlands], and I was able to just take the train each day to work, and then I lived in one other location there.
Speaker 2: And how long were you there?
Speaker 1: I was there about a year, just under a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And--
Speaker 1: --year.
Speaker 2: --and this is 1964.
Speaker 1: This was 1964, right.  And so great experience.  And then also because we were all around the same age and interested in travel, I was able to travel with some of the people that I worked with, and so we went to different places.
Speaker 2: Well, because Europe is small--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --compared to the states.
Speaker 1: And the train fares were inexpensive, and we were all adventurous.  And so I knew someone that lived in Sweden, so I looked him and his family up; and, you know, we just, we just went all around.  And, and then I came--I felt like, gee, I'd been away long enough.  I wanted to come home, and so I did.
Story_ID: 660216
Speaker 1: When I came back to Boston [Massachusetts], I couldn't find a job at first, and I heard about--I heard from a local Urban League that a man had been there from New York [New York] who was running a program designed to bring more African Americans into broadcasting; and so this, this head of the Urban League said to me, "Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Lane], the next time he comes to Boston, I'll let you know and set up and interview."
Speaker 2: And had you expressed interest in broadcasting?
Speaker 1: Well, I'd, I'd been, I'd been on the radio, WBUR [WBUR Radio, Boston, Massachusetts] while I was a student [at Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so, therefore, I had that kind of experience; and so, so this fellow said--the head of the Urban League said, "Next time he's in Boston, I'll let you know."  I hung up the phone from that conversation and immediately called New York and asked for this man, George Norford, and George said, "Well, come to New York and let me meet you."  The world is so small.  George Norford's wife [Tommy Norford] had once worked for my uncle David [ph.], and I came to work for him.  Okay.  So I took the job [at Westinghouse Broadcasting Company], which is how I came to New York.
Speaker 2: And, and what was that job?
Speaker 1: It was called project manager and working with him on finding people who would be candidates for jobs in broadcasting, and they also arranged for me to have an interview and, and be considered.  Didn't work out, but that was the way it was.
Story_ID: 660217
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: So, at this point, you are--you had--you earlier described yourself as shy.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Is it fair to say that at this point that's gone away?
Speaker 1: Well, there's always some of that in the core.  The core of the person stays.  But I guess what I didn't know also was that in the core was also a very strong and determined individual, and I didn't realize that until later.
Speaker 2: And your, your time in Europe because you're so far away from home, you really have to be independent.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: How do you think that formed the person--the, the woman who you've become?
Speaker 1: Well, it was a great experience for me because I continued to meet people who were very open and, and welcoming again to me.  So I'm on the bus one day in the Netherlands, and a black woman drops her handbag, and I call her and give it to her.  She and I became friends during the whole time that I was there in the Netherlands.  We did things together.  And would you believe I met her again in New York [New York].  One day, I'm in a store, and she walks in the store here in the Village [Greenwich Village].  And then--so I'm always meeting people and finding a way to make a connection, and those connections have been such a resource for me and such a joy.
Speaker 2: And your interest in media, which you majored in this in, in college [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts]--where did that come from?
Speaker 1: I'm, I'm not really sure, but I knew I liked--you see, I was more into the journalism aspect, and so--and with the PR degree--my degree is a bachelor's of science in public relations, so I envisioned that I might be [HistoryMaker] Harriette Cole one day.  I might write.  I might do maybe television as you've done.  I might do (background noise) any number of things like that, and so, indirectly in ways, some of those things did happen.
Story_ID: 660218
Speaker 1: You come to New York [New York] to work with this gentleman.  How long are you there?
Speaker 2: George Norford--well, so I worked with George.  You see, it was--
Speaker 1: And what year is this that you come in?
Speaker 2: I, I think that was probably late '64 [1964] also.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so George was doing this project with the National Urban League, and the league had a history of various skills banks programs, and so this became the--it was all part of their effort to provide candidates and open up employment opportunities.  So this was the broadcast skills bank, and so what happened was that the league agreed to have me run the broadcast skills bank from their offices, and Westinghouse paid my salary, Westinghouse Broadcasting [Westinghouse Broadcasting Company]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --paid my salary, so they were still very committed to this project.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and so what happened was that while I was doing that project for the league, I decided that I also wanted to do a graduate degree, and I was going to go to Columbia [Columbia University School of International Affairs; Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs, New York, New York].  They had a program in public administration and international affairs, and I wanted that international affairs kind of experience, and it was consistent with my own background; and the league said to me, "Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Lane], you can go to Columbia, or we have a full fellowship program that we're doing with the University of Pittsburgh [University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]."  I don't remember what foundation funded it, but they said, "If you take our fellowship, here are the circumstances: free tuition.  We cover that.  Room and board.  We cover all of your expenses, including books and everything, but in return, you must work for the league for at least one year."  Irresistible.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And so that's how I went there; and you might know one of my classmates in that program, [HistoryMaker] Carl Ware, Coca-Cola [The Coca-Cola Company]?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Carl ran Africa for Coca-Cola.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, he started with one part of Africa, and, ultimately, et cetera.  So Carl was in the program and another fellow, whose field was housing.  So, anyway, the--
Speaker 1: So you moved to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: I moved to Pittsburgh.  And a woman I knew in Boston [Massachusetts], Marjorie Rice [ph.], she was also, through a fellowship program she'd had, she had to go to Pittsburgh to work; so she and I were roommates in Pittsburgh.  And Pittsburgh people were so welcoming, really fascinating.  Marjorie got to know the family who owned the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier], and they invited us for Thanksgiving dinner and things like that.  We were never really alone.  It was a good community.  And so when I completed that program--
Speaker 1: And what was the degree?
Speaker 2: It was a master's of public administration.  And I did my, my thesis on a housing program that my church [St. Mark Congregational Church, Boston, Massachusetts] had created in Boston, 221(d)(3) housing, et cetera, et cetera.  And so then I worked for the league when I came back, and they gave me--
Speaker 1: And how long was that program?
Speaker 2: The (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The master's program?
Speaker 2: --the master's program, I did it in one year.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, yeah.  Maybe it was sixteen months or--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --eighteen months, but it wasn't two years.
Story_ID: 660219
Speaker 1: And then you came back to New York City.
Speaker 2: Came back to New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Where were you living in New York City when--in the early days?
Speaker 2: I have sort of been--I won't say a gypsy, but I will say moving around, so I lived--when I first came to New York I lived in a hotel, you know, a small, small, accommodation, Madison [Avenue] and 34th [Street] or 36th Street; and then I moved.  And then I had the experience of subletting people's homes.  A woman was going on the road for a theatrical program.  I read about it in the newspaper, and so I sublet her apartment; and she lived in a building owned by the woman who wrote 'My Sister Eileen' [Ruth McKenney].  We know the book.  We know the, the movie ['My Sister Eileen'] and so forth.  Well, this was the sister who wrote about Eileen [Eileen McKenney], and she lived in the ground floor apartment with her daughter [Eileen Bransten].  Anyway, and I sublet an apartment up there.  And they took me to events and so forth, and so, you know, it's so funny, Harriette [HistoryMaker Harriette Cole].
Speaker 1: There's that theme (laughter).
Speaker 2: This, this is the theme, and I was a good girl, and so they brought me with them, and I was an adventurous girl by this time, so I was eager to do those things, so I lived in various parts of the city.  And I ultimately moved to the East Village [New York, New York], and I had a landlord who said to me, "Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Lane], we've got properties all over, and we've got places in the West Village [New York, New York]," and one day George Norford gave me tickets to go to the Cherry Lane Theatre [New York, New York], and I went to the Cherry Lane Theatre, and when I saw that, that was the West Village and saw what a community that was.  The buildings are of a scale that made me feel like Boston [Massachusetts], and--
Speaker 1: Meaning, not too big.
Speaker 2: Not too big, not skyscrapers, not overwhelming; and they had what, I guess, I didn't realize then were rent controlled apartments, and so the next day after seeing Cherry--the Cherry Lane Theatre and seeing the West Village, I called them up, and I said, "Tell me about your other places over there," and that's where I moved, and, and, in fact--
Speaker 1: So this is in the early days you, you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --came to the Village.
Speaker 2: Yes.  But, you see, also that was before I went to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], but while I was working for the broadcast skills bank [at the National Urban League].  Then when I went off to Pittsburgh and left that apartment, and when I came back, I called them up, and I said, "I'm back.  Do you have anything for me?"  And bless their hearts, they said, "Nancy, come on.  We're happy to have you again."  And so, so I moved back into the same building, and these were good sized apartments.  It was wonderful, just wonderful.  But ultimately, I moved from there to where I am, still the Village.
Speaker 1: Hm.
Story_ID: 660220
Speaker 1: So you work as project manager for the National Urban League--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --for, for about two years?
Speaker 2: Well you know, it was supposed to be for a year.  They gave me the job of the century.  I had an assignment they called the Summer Fellowship Program, so we know that African Americans who taught at historically black colleges [HBCUs] often had to teach subjects where they might not have had corporate experience- experiences themselves.  So, for example, there was a professor who taught applied mathematics at Grambling [Grambling College; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana], and that was when they said it was harder to make the, the team, the, the music team, the band, than it was to make the football team at Grambling.  And, so, anyway, I guess they had so much--
Speaker 1: They had great--yes, sure.
Speaker 2: --talent in football. You know, and so on.  So, anyway, my job was to visit the college campuses, interview faculty, and talk to them about spending summers in industry, and then, during the fall, work with corporations that were tied to the Urban League and talk to them about hiring for a summer one of these faculty members; and the pitch was, hire this person.  Help them expand the program and the curriculum at the college that they're at, and when you go back to that college to recruit, you've got your person on the campus who knows the students, who knows your corporation, and who will be your, your onsite recruiter for you.  And so--and then what would happen, so my job was in the fall to go to the college campuses, in the winter to work with the corporations in terms of making matches; and then in the summer, visit the professors on assignment.  How is it going?  What did you like?  What would you like to have that would be a different kind of experience?  And to say to the companies, can we sign you up again for next year?  So I did that for the Urban League, and I guess it was maybe after two years--you see, I couldn't leave the job.  I mean, you would agree.  That was a job.  You're making a contribution to others.  You're meeting faculty, et cetera, and so many areas.  The head of the business department at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] had never worked in industry at that time.  He was an economist, wonderful man, Dr. E.B. Williams, wonderful.  People who know Morehouse know him.  And, and so anyway (background noise), what happened was that I said to myself, but when these professors come back to their campus, they're going to have new ideas about what should happen, but their ideas might meet some resistance.  What can I do to make a difference for them and also to ensure that the programs are going to be effective?  And so I thought about it, and in those days, executive in residence programs did not include black colleges, and so I created what became known--and ran for forty-five years--I created what became known as the Black Executive Exchange Program, and so with that program--it's the joy of my life--with that program, we would, you know, when I--when it was just an idea, I said to black executives I knew--of course, mostly males in those days in the '60s [1960s]--I said to them, "How would you like to spend some time on a college campus?"  And they said, "Well, we'd like to, but I wouldn't dare leave my job for any period of time."  "You wouldn't leave for a month?"  "I wouldn't leave for a week," they'd tell me, "It might not be there when I got back."  And so I then thought to myself, how do I get around that problem?
Story_ID: 660221
Speaker 1: And so the way the program [Black Executive Exchange Program] operated was that the prof- the executives in residence would go down for two consecutive days, and each week--so let's just take, for example, we did a course in marketing.  Each week, a different black executive who was in marketing would come to the college campus and would teach the class.  And what we would say to them is, "Don't talk about affirmative action.  Don't talk about those things.  Talk about the specific skills that are needed for people to be successful in marketing."  And, and so we would have one who was with an agency, one who was in marketing for a pharmaceutical company, one who was in banking even, talking about marketing in banking.  And each week, a different black executive would come to the campus; and the liaison would be the professor who had been with our program in marketing at a company, and so we did this in marketing.  We did this in architecture.  I have a fascination with architecture, so we did it in architecture, and so on; and we did it in accounting and on and on.  And I said, for example, to the American Institute of Architects, I said to them, "Will you join us along with the Urban League [National Urban League] and be co-sponsors of this program?"  And so, therefore, for example, just staying with the architecture program, we could say that our program was accredited by the AIA.  And we brought black architects who were working with their own firms, who were working with other firms, et cetera, or working in a, in a corporation as the in house architect, and so we did it in architecture.  We did it in chemistry.  I said to the American Chemical Society, "Will you be a co-sponsor with us for this program?"  And we tried to have chemists who were bl- all the participants were black.  We tried to have chemists who had their Ph.D.'s because we wanted to always talk aspirational and so we did architecture.  We did it in, in chemistry.  We did it in American Marketing Association.  We, we had that agreement with them.  We did it with the AICPA [American Institute of Certified Public Accountants] at a time when very few blacks--this was before Bert Mitchell [Bert N. Mitchell] really made his big impact and did so much, and so we did it in archi- in, in accounting.  And, and we had the founders of the black accountants organization [National Association of Black Accountants]--they were all participants.  And also the expenses for the participants were covered by their corporations, and so I would call the corporation and say to them, "If you lend us this black executive for two consecutive days, that's all we want, two days, and cover the expenses, you," just like the professors who came that way, "you will have on your campus somebody who, who goes to the campus who knows the field and can represent your company and represent the field in total," and so that's what we did.  And just one example of how meaningful the program was.  We approached a labor organization and said to them, "Would you lend us somebody?"  And the amalgamated meatpackers union [Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America] had a man, Hilton Hanna, and Hilton Hanna was scheduled to go from Minne- Minneapolis [Minnesota], I think it was, down to somewhere in Louisiana, probably Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], my favorite school, and, and teach a class on labor relations, and there was a huge storm, and he couldn't--the trains weren't going.  He had to take a bus from there to Louisiana.  Didn't he do it?  And when he got there, instead of staying at a hotel, which is, of course, what most of the people did.  He stayed on campus.  He slept in the dormitory.  He said the students had him up all night.  He was as charged up as they were, and they were excited to hear.  And, of course, being a labor person, no surprise that he would want to stay with the client rather than, you know, wanting to stay off in a hotel.  But we had people like that, and we had people, you know, too (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How many schools were participating in this?
Speaker 1: I have the numbers and in that bio from the Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts], we have the numbers, but can I just say that we had, I believe, over twenty-six colleges and universities, and we had well over sixty thousand black executives.  People are going to say, "Well, were there sixty thousand black executives?"  Yes.  Because, remember, this is a program that went on for forty-five years.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: So over sixty thousand participated over the course of--
Speaker 1: Of the time.
Speaker 2: --of this time.
Speaker 1: Or perhaps I should say, partic- so maybe one person did it more than one year--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or something like that, but that's it; and we have photographs of them on the campuses with the students, and, and they loved it because, yes, and our pitch to them was--that's right--I told you the company pitch and the college pitch.  We'd say to the college, "You've got an, an adjunct faculty member at no cost who's going to be good for you, and you can talk to that person and find out whether or not their company gives money to black colleges [HBCUs]," and so, and so we would say to the executives, "You want to give back?  Here's a chance to give back, and it only takes two days of your time, and it takes sharing your knowledge, what you've learned.  That's all we want from you.  We want you to be open and tell everybody.  Tell them the good and tell them bad, but tell them also the skills that they need for those jobs."
Story_ID: 660222
Speaker 1: --The executives that participated in the program.
Speaker 2: And, and so how many years did you work with the Urban League [National Urban League]?
Speaker 1: So I worked with the Urban League, I would guess, maybe three or so years because what happened was, I also said to myself--you see, I went to American Bankers Association conference, and I approached them.  They were so supportive of--I was talking about the summer program, and the Black Executive Exchange Program, and, and that meeting just went so well, so I said to myself overnight, what can I do to take advantage of this good audience?  And I asked them--I made a proposal that day that we do a study on how students at black colleges [HBCUs] feel about careers in banking, and so we did the research, and we published that particular report; and--but I also said to myself, meeting all of these various black executives, I want to be that.  I want to do that, too.  And so I, so I said to the league, I'd like to transfer from doing a job I love--because I loved it so much, in fact, when I, when I came to the league about the Black Executive Exchange Program, I was then doing the Summer Fellowship Program, and I gave them a one page summary.  I didn't discuss it with anybody until I had completed every aspect of how it would operate; and then I pulled it together in a one page summary.
Speaker 2: For the--
Speaker 1: To my boss at the Urban League.  And the foundation, I don't remember if it was the Rockefeller Foundation--I think it was--said it was the most innovative program that they had heard about in some time.  And so I then said to my boss, "Well, you know, I'm eager for us to get started with the Black Executive Exchange Program," and he said, "Well, Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Lane], now what are you going to do?  Because are you going to give up Summer Fellowship, or are you going to do Summer Fellowship Program and have somebody else do the Black Executive Program?"  And I said, "I want to do them both."  And he said, "We are only going to pay you for--salary for one."  I said, "That's all right.  I want to do it."  And so, so I did that for maybe, I don't know, three years or so.  And then I went to the league and said--realizing that, really, I was not going to able to move to a corporate career with the kind of assignments that I had, and I asked if I could move into their HR department, and I became deputy director of HR [human resources] there; and I went from there to banking.
Speaker 2: And did you get the banking bug by making these strategic relationships for--?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Story_ID: 660223
Speaker 1: So how did you get to banking?  What did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened was that there was a person at the league [National Urban League] who was with Chase, and he had been the liaison for Chase and the league, and I sent him my resume.
Speaker 1: Was it Chase then or Chemical [Chemical Bank]?
Speaker 2: No.  It was Chase then.
Speaker 1: Oh, Chase, okay.
Speaker 2: Chase, Chase became--Chemical became Chase.
Speaker 1: Right.  That's true.
Speaker 2: Right.  And so, anyway, but through these contacts and these people I met, my--they said, "Come and work for us," and so I was offered position where I would be responsible for executive recruiting, which meant people who came into the bank at an officer level as I did, and also for M.B.A. recruiting.  And so the person that I reported to, he said to me, "Well, Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Lane], we'll have you go to Howard [Howard University School of Business, Washington, D.C.], and we'll have you go to Hampton [Hampton Institute School of Business; Hampton University School of Business, Hampton, Virginia]," or something, and I said, "I'll go to those two as long as I go to Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] also."  I said, "I don't want to be limited in the colleges that I recruit at.  I want to be doing all of them."  And so my job was all executive and all M.B.A. recruiting for the bank.
Speaker 1: And you started at what level?
Speaker 2: I started at the bank as a--I became an assistant vice president, but I became, ultimately, an officer, which made me the first black woman officer in the history of Chase Manhattan Bank [JPMorgan Chase and Co.].
Speaker 1: And you started in this position.
Speaker 2: I started in that position.  That's right.
Speaker 1: I read that.  I thought that was a typo, but you--(laughter).
Speaker 2: I'm surprised, yes.  But, you see, because--well, it was, it was--and what happened was, they said to the person that I would be reporting to, "She's gonna need a little help, so commit to us that you will stay and not retire for--," I don't know how long they said, but a few months later, he was gone 'cause I was doing the job.  Right.
Speaker 1: And you started there in '72 [1972]?
Speaker 2: I guess so (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I believe so.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you start at this--
Speaker 2: Yes, at an officer level.
Speaker 1: --high ranking position.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: An officer level.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The first black woman--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to do this, but even if you weren't a black woman, it--to start at that high of a level is not the common starting place.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: But it was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --because of your, your experience--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at the Urban League.
Speaker 2: Yes, and my determination.  Right, right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: --and then you're, you're setting the parameters so, so you're in executive recruiting.  If, if I don't get Harvard and Howard, then it's not going to work.
Speaker 2: That's right.  I want it all.  I didn't want to be limited.  I didn't--you know, at that stage in my life, should I be limited?
Story_ID: 660224
Speaker 1: So you're in an environment that is predominantly white male.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You're in a bank.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You certainly have a position of power.  But are you ever feeling any lack of confidence in pushing back?
Speaker 2: God, Harriette [HistoryMaker Harriette Cole], you're good (laughter).  I debated whether I would mention this part, but what happened was that on the job when, you know, meeting with people in their office and so on, everybody was very good to me, but when I went to the executive dining room, it was a very different story.  And I thought, well, Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Lane], maybe you're being a little bit sensitive, but one of the professors from a historically black college [HBCU], Tennessee A and I [Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], happened to be spending some time at Chase [Chase Manhattan Bank; JPMorgan Chase and Co.], and he was in the dining room one day, and he saw me, and I was seated at what--they had like community tables.  If you were by yourself, you just came to that table and so on.  And he, he came to my office afterwards, and he said, "Nancy, I could see how they treated you.  They were cold.  They ignored you.  I could see.  How do you stand it?"  So I said, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  But I--when he left my office, I put my head down on my desk and I cried.  And then I said, I'm not going to tolerate this anymore.  And so every day, I had guests in for lunch.  I never went to that dining room alone.  Sometimes I would have a room--I had a particular dining room that I loved, and I would often use that one; but every day, I had guests in for lunch.  And if they were not outside people, they were people who were in the credit training program to become bankers, and there were some African Americans in that program, Barbara O'Neal, and another woman whose name I'm blanking on right now--Mary K. Bush [HistoryMaker Mary Bush] and so forth, so, so I would have them up for lunch, everybody.  And, of course, they couldn't come to the executive dining room unless they were with an officer, so that's how I dealt with that.
Speaker 1: And before this person bringing it to your attention, were you aware of it?
Speaker 2: I guess I was aware of it, but I was suppressing it.  And--but then once I realized that it really was happening, and, and so once again, it was my responsibility to make something happen so I didn't have to tolerate it.
Speaker 1: And so what's happening, they're not speaking to you?  What--?
Speaker 2: They're not speaking.  I don't know if I asked for the salt and couldn't get it.  I don't remember what, but it was very--yes, they certainly didn't speak, but--and, and I guess they also sort of turned their bodies, you know, I mean, they were just--again, on the job, everything went very well.  It was only in the dining room.  And, as I say, over time, that was irrelevant because--
Speaker 1: You figured out (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) I was too busy entertaining.
Speaker 1: Which is what you had tr- I mean, you'd spent a lot of time organizing events and social--
Speaker 2: That's right.  So I organized luncheons.
Speaker 1: --engagements.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Very good.
Story_ID: 660225
Speaker 1: So how did you m- was there moving up since you've come in at officer level?  How long were you at Chase?
Speaker 2: I was at Chase, you know, I, I'd have to double check, but I was at Chase, I guess, for about two years.  And then I decided that when you're in a staff function--in any organization, when you're staff, you're not quite the same as when you're in a line position and you're impacting the bottom line; and so I contacted a man who was responsible for government relations--not government relations, but government clients and so forth; and because in order to go into the credit training program at Chase to be a banker, you had to have a sponsor.  If you were an internal person, you had to have a sponsor; and so I asked him, would he sponsor me?  And I said--you know--I said, "After all, you're going to be going to organizations--," I didn't have to tell him.  It was obvious that an African American could bring something special to the initiatives that the--Chase was doing as it related to government organizations, and, presumably to not-for-profit organizations.  And he agreed to sponsor me and--for that--for the credit training program.  So I told my boss, who said, "Well, congratulations, Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Lane]."  But he was--he said, "We'll, we'll let you know when we can release you for that."  And I waited and waited, and then along came an offer which I don't talk very much about, but along came an outside job offer, and I said, I think I'm going to take it.  So it was a position working for off-track betting [New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation].  And so I--they offered me a chance to have the entire HR [human resources] function, so at Chase, I'd had executive recruiting, M.B.A. recruiting.  At OTB, I would have it all.
Speaker 1: And where--what year is this now?
Speaker 2: Let me try to think.  I--
Speaker 1: Maybe be '73 [1973]?
Speaker 2: No, it was before.  Well, maybe so.  Yes, yes.  I think you're right because I--yes.  So it was maybe '72 [1972] or '73 [1973] somewhere--
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: --in there.
Speaker 1: --at this point, off-track betting was huge.
Speaker 2: It was huge.
Speaker 1: And, and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, it had a moment where it was huge.  I mean, I remember--
Speaker 2: I'm so happy you remember when it's huge.
Speaker 1: I remember the glass walls, and, and you would see like, like gambling changed because they were located in business neighborhoods.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And people would go in on lunch hour or--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --whenever it was, but you would see--because it was glass, you would see people in suits.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: I mean there would be all kinds of folks who would go in there.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: But you would see a lot of businesspeople going in, and then they were everywhere.
Speaker 2: I love that you remember this.
Speaker 1: I remember it very well because it, because it changed the--there was a stigma about gambling.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And I feel like off-track betting changed that.
Speaker 2: Thank you, thank you.
Speaker 1: So, so, you--
Speaker 2: And the money went to the city and helped the city.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It was a quasi public organization.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And when he--so--
Speaker 1: So--but how was it for you?  Because since, since gambling did have a stigma, what was your thought when you were first approached?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You're good.  What happened was, I said to myself, who's going to leave Chase Manhattan Bank [JPMorgan Chase and Co.], executive this and so forth and so on for off-track betting?  I said--
Speaker 1: 'Cause you were a good girl.
Speaker 2: --to myself, you know.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And then what happened was, I went by chance into Grand Central station [Grand Central Terminal, New York, New York], and I saw all of the windows that they had at Grand Central station set up for OTB--branches, and I was astounded at how large OTB was.  Now, my mother [Gladys Lane] loved horse racing, so she was familiar with it, but, of course, she was in Boston [Massachusetts]; and, and she was also opposed to it, you see.
Speaker 1: Sure (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, yes, because it impacted the tracks, of course people didn't realize that the tracks still made money, that it was an arrangement of sharing money from OTB revenue.  But, anyway, so I said to myself, who in the world would go there?  But I went.  I saw it as an opportunity to have--to grow.  I would have liked to have gone into training at--you know, the credit training program at Chase, but heaven knew when they were going to let me go, and so, therefore, I said, then here's a chance, Nancy, to move from just executive and M.B.A. recruiting to the entire operation HR function, and for a while, for labor relations as well; so I took the job.
Story_ID: 660226
Speaker 1: And so I worked there, and--
Speaker 2: So it was a much bigger job.  Did it come--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --with a much bigger paycheck?
Speaker 1: I never think about money, you know, I never think--so it--maybe it did, but I hope when we talk about Johnson and Johnson [Johnson and Johnson Products; Johnson and Johnson Services, Inc.], I can tell you my attitude on money there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I guess, I guess it gave a bigger pay.  I don't even remember anymore.
Speaker 2: But that wasn't a focal point for you.
Speaker 1: I was looking for the experience--
Speaker 2: The experience.
Speaker 1: --always.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so, so I worked for them; and, and then--
Speaker 2: How long did you work there?
Speaker 1: I worked there for, I don't know, maybe two years, something like that.  And I decided to apply to the Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts].  You see, my Urban League boss had been in a program for senior executives at Harvard Business School, and it had been funded by Reader's Digest.  Reader's Digest foundation [Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund; The Wallace Foundation] had been very supportive of the Urban League [National Urban League] in those days.  And so I applied to the Harvard Business School for a program that was for middle management people.  My Urban League boss had been in the senior management program.  And so they interviewed me, and they said--the person interviewing me, faculty member who ran the program in those days said, "You know, Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Lane], we'd love to have people like yourself in this program, but if only you were with General Electric or IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] or something," but he said, "but off-track betting [New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation]," he said.  In, in my own heart, you know, I had some of that same feeling myself.  But I said to him, "If you want people like me, then you have to take us where you find us, and off-track betting is where I am today."  So I then assured him that I could get fellowship support since I didn't think OTB would pay for it.  Little did I know, they wouldn't pay for anything, you know.  So, anyway, I said, "I'll get foundation support," and I contacted the Reader's Digest foundation, but they were no longer doing that; and so, so I was accepted at the business school and no way to cover it, and I don't remember what it cost then, but it costs now for that same program--I don't know if it's sixty thousand or eighty thousand--it's in that ballpark at least, so it was comparable dollars in that time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was expensive.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And this was 1975, January.  Well, the fall was when I was applying.  And so I'm--I, I was talking to my mother [Gladys Lane], as I mentioned earlier one day, and I was crying.  And I'm not a big crier but I was crying, and I said, "Mother, it just doesn't look like it can happen."  Well, first of all, OTB said to me, no.  And I convinced them.  A friend said to me, "Here's what you do.  You write a letter to your boss indicating why you want this experience, how you feel it will help you, and you hand it to your boss and say to him--," what was his name?  Bob [ph.], I think. "Bob, I want you to give this to the president of the organization."  And Bob, for some reason, felt he couldn't say no.  But--and I said, "And I want you to give it with your support."  I don't know how much support he gave with it, but he ultimately gave it, so the arrangement we worked out, ultimately, with OTB was, I could take my vacation time.  The program was a full semester, so maybe it was four months.  I could take vacation time, and after having used up my vacation time, then I would be on leave without pay.  But that meant that I had to pay for my apartment in New York [New York].  I had--and there were expenses associated with the program separate from the tuition.  There were also the social activities and so on.  It was just a lot, and--because that's all part of how you operate in the business world.  And I didn't know where in the world I was going to get that money from.  I knew I didn't have it.  So I'm on the phone with my mother, saying, "Mother, it looks like it's just not going to happen."  And that's when she said to me, "Well, think of your faith."  And I said, "My faith says you have to make things happen."  And, ultimately, my mother said, "Nancy, I'll lend you the money."  I was overwhelmed.  Who thought she had that kind of money in her bank account?  And so, in fact, I went to the program, and it was really great.  A hundred and twenty, I guess, participants.  One other woman.  She was white.  Three other blacks, and, and so just a great experience, people from all over the world.  And then at the end of the program, when I went back to work at OTB, I said to my mother, "Well, mommy, now I can start repaying you."  And she said, "Nancy, it's a gift."  I still am tearful to think, you know, but she also--interestingly, she waited until I'd completed the program so it was very clear this was very important to me and so on, and I guess--and she didn't want me to feel indebted or I don't know what.  I mean, because, you know, and so that made an enormous difference in my entire life.  So I went back to OTB, and I was there for about a month or two; and I had been contacted by Johnson and Johnson prior to going into this program at Harvard Business School, and, and so then, I guess I let them know I was back, or they knew I was back, and--
Speaker 2: And you moved (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I went to J and J.
Story_ID: 660227
Speaker 1: So I want to go back for a moment because as you're building your career, I want you to tell me when did your interest in art begin?  Because you joined the board of the Studio Museum when you--before you went into this program [at Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you know, it's one thing to, to go to museums and look at art and, and enjoy art; quite another to join the board--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of a museum.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And you were very young, so--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --how did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I'm not really sure how my interest in art began.  I showed you a portrait that's been--was painted of me when I was like ten and so forth, so I--evidently--I had some interest at that point, but as it related to the Studio Museum, what happened was that I was working at Chase [Chase Manhattan Bank; JPMorgan Chase and Co.], and I saw a television program on the Studio Museum.  I had visited there once, and, and I was so moved by the program, and it was a program focused on the artist in residence program; and that afternoon, I went up to the museum and [HistoryMaker] Ed Spriggs was then the head of the museum, and I introduced myself to him, and I said, "Ed, what can I do to help?"
Speaker 1: After having watched the program.
Speaker 2: After having watched the program.  That was all I--you know, I had been there once with a girlfriend, and so he said--I don't remember what he said, but--so I did little volunteer things.  This was before I joined the board.
Speaker 1: And just for, and just for perspective--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you're living in the West Village [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And the Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York] is on 125th Street.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Between Adam Clayton Powell [7th Avenue; Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard] and then Lenox Avenue [Malcolm X Boulevard].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It's far away.
Speaker 2: Far away.
Speaker 1: In many ways.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --the, the life is completely different uptown at that point, much like now, though the neighborhood has changed a lot, but that was like the beacon in the midst of, you know, a questionable neighborhood let's say.  What is your experience of, you know, just traversing New York [New York] and moving--?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure I had ever been to Harlem [New York, New York] until I went up that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And but also one of the things that happened was that the young man who was the focal point in that particular television program, though he was an artist, he said he was interested in architecture.  Well, I had been involved, as you know, with the American Institute of Architects, and so I said to him--I contacted a partner with the firm, Skidmore, Owings and Merrill [Skidmore, Owings and Merrill LLP], and I said--let--and he arranged for us to visit, so that artist in residence and I went down to SOM, and we had a tour, and they had a new architect, someone who had recently graduated from Harvard school of design [Harvard Graduate School of Design, Cambridge, Massachusetts], take us around, and we talked about what's it like to be an architect.  You know, in a way, Harriette [HistoryMaker Harriette Cole], as you've said, this comes back and forth in life, I was doing with him what I had done with the professors in the--from the black colleges [HBCUs] through the Urban League [National Urban League] and all.  And so I remember that as we stood at the elevator to say goodbye, that's when the student said, "And what sort of salary do you make?  And this architect told him, and he said, "(Laughter) Oh, no."  But he did become an architect ultimately.  I learned many years later.  So, so I did that.  And then two of the other artists in residence, because I was then at Chase, so they were interested, of course, in Chase's collection which was renowned; and I took them to the bank, and because I knew various people in the bank--with my position, I was able to meet just about everybody--I took them to the executive floor, which I don't remember what floor that was in those days, but it was the floor where all of the top level staff--the chairman of the, of the museu- of the bank was there and so on, David Rockefeller in those days, and so we went into their offices when they were not there, of course, I took--what's her names?  I will think of them I hope.  Two wonderful women.  One is a painter; one is a sculptor.  And we visited the various offices, and in each office at the Chase, you could have a piece of art, and if you were a senior executive, you could, you could say what type of art you had an interest in.  I was a junior executive, but the woman running the collection knew that I was interested in Romare Bearden's work, so I had a wonderful Bearden piece in my office.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and so I took these two people from, from the Studio Museum, and we went through and, and so forth.  So those were some of the things that I was able to do and enjoyed doing.  And then, as a result of my interaction like that, Ed Spriggs proposed my name to the board to join the board; and so I joined the board in 1973.
Story_ID: 660228
Speaker 1: And so as a, as a child, did your, did your parents [Gladys Lane and Samuel Lane] collect art?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was--
Speaker 2: No, no.  And I don't ever remember going to a museum as a child.  No, I mean--
Speaker 1: When you were in--
Speaker 2: I don't remember them--
Speaker 1: --in Europe did you--
Speaker 2: --taking us from school.
Speaker 1: --did you--
Speaker 2: Not in--
Speaker 1: --go to museums--
Speaker 2: --not in that.
Speaker 1: --when you were in Europe?
Speaker 2: I went to museums when I was there living in the Netherlands, but when I--and in Norway, when I was a student there [at the University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway], we had works by famous Norwegian artists, and we had them even in our rooms in the dormitories because in those days, people weren't as interested in his work, and so, therefore, we had access to everything there, and so I had--my interest was developing during those days.  Yeah.  And then Chase [Chase Manhattan Bank; JPMorgan Chase and Co.] was fabulous.
Speaker 1: Because you were just in the environment of a wonderful collection of art.
Speaker 2: Wonderful collection.  Everywhere, everywhere you went in the bank, there was superb art.  And then so I was at Chase with that, and, and then my interest continued but moderate, but, as I say, after Ed nominated me for the Studio Museum board, then I really became far more intense because that also gave me the opportunity to get involved with art by--we say from the museum--work by artists from the as- African diaspora.  And--but until that time, other than the pieces that were in Chase's collections, I didn't really know a lot about black artists--little bits I'd heard when I was a summer camp student and so forth but not very much.
Speaker 1: So your education came primarily through being part of the Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  That was a big factor and other things happened later, but that was a big factor.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And so you're--the formal beginning relationship with the Studio Museum was in '73 [1973]?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right, when I joined the board, so it was a little volunteer activity before, but I joined in '73 [1973]; and I'm still on the board.
Speaker 1: Right.  So you've been involved--
Speaker 2: Right.  I've been--
Speaker 1: --ever since.
Speaker 2: That's right.  And truly involved.  I've been chair of the board.  I've been in various positions, and I'm now head of the acquisitions committee for the museum; and I'm also vice chair for the building committee because, as you know, we're in the process of a new building, developing that.
Speaker 1: So let, let's explore the Studio Museum before we go back to Johnson and Johnson [Johnson and Johnson Products; Johnson and Johnson Services, Inc.].  Because it has--it--first of all, tell me, what is the mission of the Studio Museum in Harlem?
Speaker 2: Our mission is to be supportive of artists from the African diaspora, but not--and, and in many ways to me, the mission has grown beyond that.  And so, in fact, our work with our artist in residence program, which is a signal program, and it's why the--the title studio is in our name.  That is, that is really where the mission--where we began with the opportunity.  When no one else was interested in our artists, the Studio Museum made a home, made a place for their work to be seen; and, and there were artists, for example, [HistoryMaker] Elizabeth Catlett told us that her first exhibition in the United States was at the Studio Museum in Harlem.  That was her first exhibition, her first solo exhibition.  And, and so that's the kind of institution that the Studio Museum always has been, so pioneering; and so but what we're now involved with, I think, is a mission beyond our mission, and that is the fact, particularly, under [HistoryMaker] Thelma Golden, our extraordinary director and chief curator of the museum, we have developed other people who can be the Thelma Goldens of the future.  Whenever I go to a museum anywhere in the country, and I meet someone who is in a curatorial role or in any other position, I always say to them, "Tell me about your background."  Overwhelmingly, these people have spent some time at the Studio Museum in Harlem; so our alumni, it's such a broad group.  It's just fabulous.  Very, very moving to see what's been achieved.
Speaker 1: And over the years, so who, who came after the--?
Speaker 2: It was [HistoryMaker] Ed Spriggs; and then it was Courtney somebody, Courtney Callender maybe.  And it was--I've forgotten who, but during the time that I was on the board, our then chairman was Richard Clarke [Richard V. Clarke], you know, who created the whole recruitment business for African Americans and was such a significant collector.  And one day Richard was talking with Romare Bearden--Romi, his buddies all called him.  I never dared.  And he said, "Romi, we're looking for somebody to be the head of the Studio Museum," and Romi said, "You know, there's a young woman at Syracuse University [Syracuse, New York] who's doing her dissertation on me.  You guys ought to interview her."  And, thus, [HistoryMaker] Mary Schmidt Campbell came into our lives; and Mary's husband [HistoryMaker George Campbell, Jr.] and Mary also have said that remember my being one of those who interviewed her, and I have a letter that they wrote to me at one point that reflects how meaningful all of those experiences were; so, in fact, I, I succeeded Richard Clarke as chair of the board, and, and Mary Campbell was our executive director.
Story_ID: 660229
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mary Schmidt Campbell, I'm curious as we go through, I'd like to talk about the different leaders who've been part of Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York] and what you, as being integral to the Studio Museum, think are highlights of their career.  So let's start with Mary Schmidt Campbell.
Speaker 2: Well, Mary, of course, brought her academic background was so--was exceptional.  I mean, Mary had--she was wrapping up her Ph.D. [at Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York], her subject for her dissertation was Romare Bearden, so she was steeped--she was a scholar of the arts; and, and Mary was originally from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Her father [Harvey Schmidt] had been a judge.  But I guess this was her first time working in Harlem [New York, New York].  She lived in New Jersey, she lived in New Brunswick because her husband [HistoryMaker George Campbell, Jr.] was then a scientist at Bell Labs [AT&T Bell Laboratories, Inc.; Nokia Bell Labs], and he has his Ph.D. in physics; and, and so Mary and--I guess they had three boys at that time, and so she commuted in daily, and, and she, she brought--she knew the art world, and what the Studio Museum gave was the opportunity for her to meet artists of various types.  At one point, we had an advisory committee.  Charles White [Charles Wilbert White] was on the advisory committee.
Speaker 1: The artist?
Speaker 2: The artist.  Catlett [HistoryMaker Elizabeth Catlett] was on the committee.  A number of extraordinary artists were--
Speaker 1: Was this when they--
Speaker 2: --on that committee.
Speaker 1: --were married?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Ah.
Speaker 2: But that didn't--they were not married, but it was still, you know, they were all committed to the mission of the Studio Museum as well.  So then Mary decided--
Speaker 1: And excuse me.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But this is when they are huge artists at this point, aren't they?
Speaker 2: Huge in the black world.
Speaker 1: But not yet?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Right.  Remember, Catlett's first show was with us.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So--and Charles White, you know, they were huge to us.
Speaker 1: They were huge to--yes.
Speaker 2: They were on our calendars.  They were on--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --our walls, but they weren't in the museums.  Yes.  They were not in the museums.  And, in fact, you know, even women were not in the museums all that much.  I mean, you would think of the Guerrilla Girls movement and so forth, so, so--and there's a new book out on museums and the whole history of their, their evolution around women and around minorities and so forth.  Susan Cahan, I think here name is, has written this book ['Mounting Frustration: The Art Museum in the Age of Black Power'].  So--
Speaker 1: So this is an interesting point that I'd just like to look at for a second because, as you pointed out, for those who are aware of black artists and their contributions, they would be considered big artists, but because they weren't being purchased for the--
Speaker 2: Right, museums.
Speaker 1: --collections of the museums.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That's what they--
Speaker 2: Or collectors themselves.
Speaker 1: Or--that's what made the Studio Museum that much more important.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  And that's why people applied--and still do from all over the country--to be in our artist in residence program.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Because that brings a level of exposure that many don't have.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Just one example of that is right now at the Metropolitan Museum [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York], they opened this week with a show by [HistoryMaker] Kerry James Marshall.  He was an artist in residence thirty-five years ago with us.  Today, according to The New Yorker, his show is the biggest show of the season, but no one was interested in Kerry James in those days.  And, by the way, he met his wife [Cheryl Lynn Bruce].  She was working at the Studio Museum, and they--that's where they met and subsequently married.  But artists, also, for example, [HistoryMaker] Carrie Mae Weems, she, she also studied photography.  She was not an artist in residence, but she had key times in her life she was involved with the Studio Museum; but the roster of artists who were in our residency program--Mark Bradford today, Mark is one of the hottest artists going, and Mark is going to be the United States of America's representative at the next biennale in Venice [Venice Biennale].  Mark wasn't, though, I should say, Mark was not an artist in residence because he was living in California; but [HistoryMaker] Thelma Golden is acknowledged as a person who discovered Mark.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And it goes on.
Story_ID: 660230
Speaker 1: Back to [HistoryMaker] Mary Schmidt Campbell.  She brought a great scholarship about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She did.
Speaker 1: --African American artists, which was important--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --again, to this point of what do people know?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And so also with that, of course, under Mary, we had significant publications about the artists as well.  Benny Andrews, I have one of the early catalogs that he--that was a part of his show.  I don't know where he showed before with a solo show, but I, I'm sure we are one of his first.  It just goes on and on.
Speaker 1: Well, I was speaking to an artist the other day about the importance of the catalog.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Because that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that becomes the document--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that this artist's work--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is important, and others can access it even if they may not be able to purchase the art to put on the wall.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: They, they--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --there's--the catalog makes a big difference.
Speaker 2: And Mary was a scholar.  And, in fact, [HistoryMaker] Thelma Golden says--because Thelma was either a high school or a col- she was a college intern with us in those days, and she talks about the influence of Mary Schmidt Campbell on her and her career choice.
Speaker 1: And following Mary, who was the next director?
Speaker 2: So Kinshasha was Mary's deputy, [HistoryMaker] Kinshasha Holman Conwill; and so Kinshasha who had a M.B.A. in arts administration became our next director of the--
Speaker 1: And this is when--
Speaker 2: --Studio Museum.
Speaker 1: --Mary went to Tisch [Tisch School of the Arts, New York University, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: When--yes.  So one--no.
Speaker 1: Not yet.
Speaker 2: Mary went to the City of New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Oh, right.
Speaker 2: One day, Mary said to me, "Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Lane], I'm thinking of--," I was chair of the board--she said, "Nancy, I'm thinking of throwing my hat in for the position of cultural affairs commissioner"--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --because Bess Myerson, was--of course--was forced to step down.  And Mary said that to me, and my heart went from here (gesture), here, to there.  And my first words were, "How can we help?"  That's the corporate training.  Makes you--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --think like that, you know.  "How can we help, Mary?"  And Mary said, "I think I'm going to be okay."  Well--and she was, so she became the--I imagine she must have been the first black cultural affairs commissioner--
Speaker 1: Right.  I forgot about that.
Speaker 2: --for the City of New York; and, and then from there to Tisch, and now--
Speaker 1: Spelman.
Speaker 2: --running Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia].  Yeah.  And so then after Kinshasha, we had Lowery Stokes Sims.
Speaker 1: Who had come from the Whitney [Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: She came from the Met.
Speaker 1: Excuse me--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --from the Met, sorry.
Speaker 2: And Mary--and Lowery, I believe, was the first and still the only black curator at the Met.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so Mary--I mean, Lowery came, and so she brought the extraordinary experience that the Met had given her; and also--
Speaker 1: So she's been there for quite some time.
Speaker 2: She was there a long time.  And, in a way-- although, I don't think Lowery might say this, but, you know, just like when I said to myself, who's going to leave Chase [Chase Manhattan Bank; JPMorgan Chase and Co.] for OTB [New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation]?  But Lowery had a different vision, and so when we approached Lowery about leaving the Met and heading the Studio Museum, she was totally committed to our mission.  She was totally familiar with the art world in New York City, she brought so much to us.  Everybody knew her.  Everybody respected her.  She was known at all the other museums.  And that also helped move us into that particular world.  And Lowery became the head of the CIG, the Cultural Interest Group [sic. Cultural Institutions Group], I think it is.  That's the group that has responsibility for funding from the city.  The city provides funding to the museums, and Lowery was, at one point, the head of that while still, of course, being our executive director.
Speaker 1: And, and so having someone like her come from, you know, arguably, the best known museum in the world, the Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York, New York], it raises the profile tremendously of--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --where people who outside of the community may not have known about it.  What did, what did that do for, you know, for financial support?
Speaker 2: Well, I must say to some extent, we've long had good financial support from various organizations, corporations, foundations.  Ford Foundation [New York, New York], for example, has consistently been from the early days all the way through.  They've been very supportive.  But, also, with Lowery, of course, that, that meant that we were a person--we were an institution with a known leader.  So Mary came from the academic world.  She came straight from her Ph.D. program to us.  (Background noise) Kinshasha came I guess from her M.B.A. program.  I'm not sure.  I don't remember where she was.  But Lowery came from the Metropolitan Museum.
Speaker 1: And she was known.
Speaker 2: She was known.  She was respected.  Mary, of course, and, and all of the others were respected as well.  And let me not forget [HistoryMaker] Ed Spriggs who I met from the very beginning, who was a fighter and so forth (background noise) because in the beginning, the museum was small, and, you know, well, so many issues to deal with--
Story_ID: 660231
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So with Lowery [Lowery Stokes Sims], we had also a different level of prestige; and Lowery, also, like Mary [HistoryMaker Mary Schmidt Campbell], had her Ph.D. degree, but, again, she had a--she was known and well loved.  Well loved as well.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: And Lowery brought Thelma, didn't she?
Speaker 1: She did.  What happened was that when we approached Lowery about joining the museum, we said--she said, "Well, I'll come under a couple of circumstances."  She said, "I want to bring two people with me," she said, "I want to bring [HistoryMaker] Thelma Golden, and I want to bring Sandra," then Sandra Jackson.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I think it was Sandra.  And I believe she also brought Christine Kim [Christine Y. Kim] at that time as well.  Christine had been at the Whitney [Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: I remember, sure.
Speaker 1: And Sandra, I believe, had been in the Whitney program.
Speaker 2: And Thelma had been at the Whitney and she--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --by this point, she's made that historic show--
Speaker 1: 'Black Male' ['Black Male: Representations of Masculinity in Contemporary American Art'].
Speaker 2: --'Black Male.'
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Which received a tremendous--
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 2: --amount of international--
Speaker 1: Even though--
Speaker 2: --acclaim.
Speaker 1: --she was a baby in those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It was very early.
Speaker 1: She was a--strongest baby we'd ever known.  Yes.  I mean, that was a show that just--you know, it's still talked about.  I treasure my catalogs from that show.  I, I--yeah.
Speaker 2: So, so for Lowery to bring people away from these major institutions when they're doing really well, was a testament to, to her--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --fire power, I guess.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: As well as the Studio Museum.
Speaker 1: And as well as Lowery's commitment to developing others who could move on in her--in the field.  Yes, Christine Kim did great work for us.  Christine was very knowledgeable about African American artists; and she went out, subsequently, to the West Coast.  But--and she's an example of what we're talking about.  People come to the museum so it's, it's--unquestionably, what we've done in terms of supporting artists is major, major, major.  But now also what we've done in terms of developing curators and so forth, so people go from our museum, the Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York], to others, and so at MoMA [Museum of Modern Art, New York, New York]--we have--now we have--seeing his face, I'm just not thinking of his name right now but a fellow who is there working with--in the film department; and a woman who went from us to MoMA in development, Hallie Hobson, and she went from there to the Met [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York], and now she came back to us.
Speaker 2: Well, and, and Sandra Jackson--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --was at the Studio Museum, and then she went to--
Speaker 1: Seattle Art Museum [Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 2: --Seattle, right.
Speaker 1: And she said at that time that her budget at Seattle Art Museum for her department was bigger than the entire budget for the Studio Museum, and now, as you know, Sandra Jackson Dumont now runs the education program at the Metropolitan Museum.
Speaker 2: Which is a huge--
Speaker 1: Huge.
Speaker 2: --huge role.
Speaker 1: They've given the statistics of what percentage of every visitor that comes to the museum, how--what a percentage have interaction with the education department, enormous.  And Sandra runs that.  And still is as committed as ever to our museum and supportive of us as well (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Story_ID: 660232
Speaker 1: And so now, Thelma [HistoryMaker Thelma Golden] comes on as a curator, correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And after not that many years, Lowery [Lowery Stokes Sims] left, and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and Thelma became--
Speaker 2: Became the executive director and chief curator, right.
Speaker 1: And do you remember what year that was?
Speaker 2: I don't remember what year it was, right.
Speaker 1: Right.  But it's been--
Speaker 2: Oh, but, in fact, she's now been in that position--is it ten years?
Speaker 1: I think so.
Speaker 2: Something like that.  You know her staff gave her for that anniversary a wonderful gift.  They knew that when she was about nine years old, a neighbor gave her a, a gift that was a box called something like Museum Masterpieces [ph.], and it showed miniatures of major artworks; and Thelma said that she would sit on her bed and curate shows at the age of nine from this masterpiece series, and she said they gave it to her and her brother [Arthur Golden, Jr.], but he didn't have the same interest, so she had a chance to keep that.  And for her--I think it was her tenth anniversary about a year or two ago, the staff found on eBay, an original of that--of that particular game, masterpiece--Museum Masterpieces and gave it to her in commemoration of her anniversary at the museum.
Speaker 1: Well, how nice.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now, that was really inventive and so forth, right.  But it shows how early she became interested in the field.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And during her tenure, which is ongoing--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --she's raised the profile of the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York] to meteoric heights, let's say.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Nationally and internationally--we're well known all over the world.
Speaker 1: And what are some of the things that she's instituted since she's been there?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's just say--well, first of all, our publications, so, previously, we did maybe catalogs.  Now we do books.  Thelma has done a book called 'Home' [ph.] and she's--we've done other books.  And then Thelma would probably say, I should be sure to mention the role that her staff played in creating programs.  And so, for example, we have what we call Expanding the Walls [Expanding the Walls: Making Connections Between Photography, History and Community], and that's a program that Sandra Jackson [Sandra Jackson Dumont] created, supported by, by Thelma, and where we provide training in photography for probably a cadre of maybe twelve or so young people, high school students, maybe even a little bit earlier than that, where they get training by a photographer and as a part of it, they visit and meet with professional photographers.  I remember being at a gallery one day, and they were meeting with [HistoryMaker] Dawoud Bey, and, and so they meet with professional photographers, and at the end of their year in this program, they not only have--they have an exhibition.  Their work is shown at the Studio Museum, and they receive a camera as a gift.  They have these serious cameras, you know.  And, and so that's one of the programs that's, that's been operating.  And, also, for example, we have any series of--you know, it's hard to know what started with whom, but--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --with Thelma, they've all been burnished in such a way that they have really just increased in visibility; and so I imagine we got reviews occasionally by the major press previously.  We get them always now.  And the joy of it is also that even our executives, our studio artists in residence, their, their show is reviewed, and so--and, also, the junior curators on our staff, they devel- they also curate shows, and so, for example, lately, Thelma has not been curating.  Instead, she grows her own team, and, and she's been very, very effective at that.  One of our, our curators has just joined Crystal Bridges [Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, Bentonville, Arkansas]--that's the Walton family's museum.  Lauren [Lauren Haynes] has just gone there.  We talked earlier about the guy who I adore whose name I can't think of at this moment who is at MoMA [Museum of Modern Art, New York, New York], and then we also--Christine [Christine Y. Kim] is, is in Los Angeles [California].  Also Nadine [ph.], she's in Chicago [Illinois].  She has an endowed chair.  She was with us.  And it just goes on and on (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well an another--
Story_ID: 660233
Speaker 1: --On and on (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, and another thing because fundraising is a challenge for many museums across the country, even the big ones.  I remember when the Studio Museum event was not a gala, it was a dinner.  And it was in a small room.  I remember attending many years ago, and now, the Studio Museum in Harlem Gala, fundraiser, is arguably, one of the most prestigious events in New York City [New York, New York].  I mean, I guess, second to the costume ball [Costume Institute Benefit] maybe.
Speaker 1: Maybe.
Speaker 2: Maybe.
Speaker 1: Maybe.  We--we won't--
Speaker 2: Maybe.
Speaker 1: --give them that, but let me just say, a senior person at the Metropolitan Museum [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York] came to our gala for the first time and said to staff at a meeting, "Why can't we have an event like that?"
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: So this is under Thelma's leadership that--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --it has become the hottest ticket in the city.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Thelma [HistoryMaker Thelma Golden]; and we also had a trustee, Gayle Atkins Perkins [sic. Gayle Perkins Atkins].
Speaker 2: Yes, of course.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And Gayle was the trustee who took that on.  Now, I can remember, as you do, when our event was a small event, and in order to fill up the room, we used to bring the staff in and have them fill up the chairs.
Speaker 2: I remember, I (laughter).
Speaker 1: And Susan Wright was with us then.  Susan, by the way, was Thelma's boss when Thelma was an intern, and Susan said to her when she was an intern, "You've got the capacity to be the leader of this museum," and, and Susan is still with us and still playing a role with that but with all of our other activities, but our gala was just this week.
Speaker 2: Right.  And so I think it, it is stated how much money you make, so what--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --what did it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Two million.
Speaker 2: Two million dollars was earned--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --this week.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yeah, this year, right.
Speaker 2: Excellent.
Speaker 1: Moving on and up, right.
Speaker 2: Excellent.
Speaker 1: Each year, essentially, we do better each year (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And--
Story_ID: 660234
Speaker 1: And so as a board member, what is your role in supporting the evolution of the museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: So my focus has been in different areas.  As I mentioned, I was chair of the board, and I think--and before that, too, my focus has been on recruiting talent for our board; and so people sometimes would give us names, and other times, it would be somebody I would see.  So I don't want to say the name, but I was chatting once with someone, and, and they said, "Gee, have you ever recruited this person," and the guy was standing right there beside us, "for your board?"  I said, "I'm embarrassed to say no, but we'll go after it now."  A longtime board member now.  And so we--so I was interested in, in recruiting people.  [HistoryMaker] Carol Sutton Lewis heads our nominating committee, and I serve on that committee, so that's one of the areas that I'm focusing on.  I'm focusing on the, the building campaign.  Yeah.  Master, master--major, major, major, major.
Speaker 1: When will the--will--when do you imagine that will come about?
Speaker 2: They tell us to say soon.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) But you know that our architect is David Adjaye, who's just done the--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --Smithsonian [National Museum of African American History and Culture, Washington, D.C.], and we've had great support from a number of organizations and people here in New York City [New York, New York], and so we're very excited about it.  And so we said, where should we be with our new building?  And we said, where else but in our current location?  So we'll be taking down the new--the current building; and at the suggestion also of [HistoryMaker] Theaster Gates, we are going to incorporate a work of art that's reflective of the old building, our current building in--as a piece of art--in our new building.
Speaker 1: Huh.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And so that's going to be incorporated into the design and on exhibition permanently.  And there are a couple of other pieces that I expect will always be up such as our 'Me/We' piece--that neon piece, beautiful piece that Glenn Ligon did; and so, so I'm focused on the building, and I'm also focused on the acquisitions for our collection.  And I'm so proud of our committee.  We have a great committee, and I would say we have about thirty-odd people on that committee; and the joy is that when Thelma [HistoryMaker Thelma Golden] and the museum staff present work to us to consider purchasing, and we always purchase one work from each of the artists in residence, by the way, so that we will always have their early days, like Kehinde Wiley.  We have--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --early purse--piece from Kehinde.  And Kehinde, when he was an artist in residence--
Speaker 1: I remember.
Speaker 2: --and he also lived in the--in his studio because times were tough for Kehinde then, and now look at him, you know, international star.  But, anyway, so, so my focus is also on building our collection; and the committee not only--the funds that they contribute each year are the funds that we use to purchase work, and then so often at our meetings--and we had one about three weeks ago--what will happen is, we don't have enough money to buy something, and someone will say (gesture), "Let me buy that and contribute it to the museum," and so that happens repeatedly at our meetings, and I think of our permanent collection, I've never asked Thelma, but I think it's fair to say--I'm a little biased--but I think it's fair to say a good 30 percent of that permanent collection has come through our acquisitions committee, so that's just been wonderful.
Speaker 1: And so are all purchases made by the museum approved by the board?
Speaker 2: Technically.  And like other museums.  You know, there's a meeting at which Thelma--when she does her annual report, she will then report to them on the acquisitions and what's the--additions to the collection, which includes not only those we purchase but work that have been donated to the museum by others who care about us, our mission, and who admire the artists that we do.
Speaker 1: Excellent.
Speaker 2: And so that's when we take an official vote.
Speaker 1: Excellent.
Story_ID: 660235
Speaker 1: I'm going to turn the page and let--go back to your corporate career.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Good.
Speaker 1: You, I believe, join Johnson and Johnson [Johnson and Johnson Products; Johnson and Johnson Services, Inc.] in 1975.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Tell me how that came to be.
Speaker 2: So, you know, it's always a friend, and so someone I knew proposed my name to J and J; and, initially, I was interviewed for a position, and they selected somebody else; and, and I wrote a letter to--handwritten, handwritten note to every person at J and J that I met during that interview process, and I said to them how impressed I was with the corporation, and I said, "If there's ever another opportunity that's right for the company and right for me, I hope you'll consider and give me a call."  Subsequently, they did.  And so I was brought onto the staff of a very senior executive.  He reported directly to the president, and the president in those days was Jim Burke [James E. Burke], who took us through our Tylenol crisis.  And so, so he brought me in for an interview, and at that point, he said, "You'll join my staff, and, subsequently, Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Lane], you'll move out to one of our operating companies because that's really where, where the real action is," you know.  And so I said to him, I said, "John," his name is John Haldridge [ph.], "could we consider something a little bit different?"  I said, I said--yeah, this is the kid (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where's the shy--
Speaker 2: --that was shy.
Speaker 1: --where's that shy Nancy?
Speaker 2: I said, "John, what about my moving--what about my staying where I am right now, and when there is the position at an operating company--and I interview for it and all and I'm--and hopefully selected, then let me come to J and J."  And he said, "Nancy, you know, you need to know our culture well."  I said, "But, John, let me just make one other approach to you."  I said, I said, "If you bring me on into a position immediately into the cor- into the operating company, pay me less than you would pay me if I joined your staff because I think in time, I'll, I'll earn, you know, I'll, I'll earn the other promotions and so forth, and so I'll earn a better salary, but I'm far more interested in the job and far more interested in what I'm doing than in the salary."  He said, "Nancy, it's a great idea, but we have to bring you in."  (Laughter) And so they did.
Speaker 1: So what were they--what was the conflict?  I'm not sure I'm clear.
Speaker 2: Well, the conflict was that I would be on his staff, but that meant that I didn't have a staff of my own to manage.  I didn't have--I had a variety of roles, but not the kind of position that I was really interested in, which was, I wanted to be a vice president of human resources, or a head of human resources in an operating company because with that came the position of being on the board of directors of that operating company; and the Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] experience had really trained me for general management, and that's what I wanted the opportunity to do, and so to me, you know, the, the salary was irrelevant.  And, in fact, on my first day when I got off of the, the train, and I came down off of the station, and I had to walk through a kind of a horrid little lot because this was before J and J had its present fancy location, and as I walked through that lot, I said to myself, Nancy, you'll go anywhere for a job.  And I said, (gesture) no, no, Nancy.  You'll go anywhere for an opportunity.  And so I saw the opportunity there and I went.
Story_ID: 660236
Speaker 1: And I worked for him [John Haldridge (ph.)]--I don't remember--maybe a year.  I don't remember how long; and a position opened up, and I was interviewed and selected, and it was with an operating division that was the developer of blood tests for, for hospitals and for laboratories and so forth, and so that's where I worked and served on that board of directors; and so I came into that position, as my predecessor in that position had been, as a director of human resources, but, subsequently, I was promoted.  Based on performance, I was promoted and became a vice president, which then made me the first woman in the history of Johnson and Johnson [Johnson and Johnson Products; Johnson and Johnson Services, Inc.] to be a vice president, so there--
Speaker 2: First woman, period.
Speaker 1: First woman of any race anywhere in the world with J and J, and so--
Speaker 2: When, when did that happen?
Speaker 1: I probably made that promotion--I guess, maybe in '77 [1977].  Yeah.  And I had a great boss.  He was Canadian.  He was just a fabulous guy, and, and I worked with a wonderful team; and so I loved the job because there was the HR position, and then there was the management position, so you would, you'd go to meetings every week, every other week.  We would be talking about marketing.  We'd be talking about sales.  We'd be talking about finance.  We covered everything.  And then also at one point, too, we would go out periodically with a sales rep [sales representative], visit the hospitals where the--so that we had a real sense of what it took for our business to continue to be so successful, and we were the leader in the blood bank business.  And then we also had operations--subsequently, we had an operation in Texas, and we had one in California, and so we would go out to those locations.  We changed presidents a few times in, in that particular division.  But we'd go out to those locations and do things and so forth.
Story_ID: 660237
Speaker 1: --The country.  I mean people are constantly moving like in the [U.S. military] service.  That didn't happen for you?
Speaker 2: Fortunately, no.  Thank god, you know (laughter).  In fact, when I joined--when I joined J and J [Johnson and Johnson Products; Johnson and Johnson Services, Inc.], they offered to relocate me from New York [New York] to New Jersey, and I said, my interests in New York--I was involved with the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York] and so on, and other things.  I said my interests in New York are such that I really wouldn't want to relocate.  And then when I moved from the operating company--I mean, from corporate headquarters to the operating company--
Speaker 1: And where are corporate headquarters?
Speaker 2: So that was in New Brunswick [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Right.  So that's not far.  You can--
Speaker 2: No.  That's right.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) commute.
Speaker 2: I commuted.  No.  Round trip three hours a day by driving, but, you know, you do what you do.  And then I came back to the corporate headquarters, right.  But, also--are we on or not?  Right.
Speaker 1: No, you're good.
Speaker 2: Oh, sorry (laughter).  I was also not able to continue my involvement with the Urban League--I'm sorry, with the Studio Museum, but with other things.  So, for example, I have long had this interest in black colleges [HBCUs].  I joined the board--I joined a couple of black college boards, but I join the board of Bennett College [Greensboro, North Carolina], which was opportunity for a feminist like myself, and I became chair of their board; and then I also joined the Harvard Business School Club of Greater New York board [Harvard Business School Club of New York], so that included--at that time, it was the largest Harvard Business School alumni club in the world because it included Manhattan [New York]; New Jersey; Westchester [Westchester County, New York]; and Long Island [New York]; and so we had the largest one in the world.  That club is, I don't know, maybe, seventy or so years old, and it's--and it's the only time in its history that they've had a president who was not a Harvard M.B.A.  I had my certificate from Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts], and I had my graduate degree, but that, that--our club, the Harvard Business School Club of Greater New York has always been one of the most outstanding.  As an example, once I was talking with someone who was president of the London club [Harvard Business School Club of London], and in those days, they were number two in size.  And I said to them, "How many programs do you do each year?"  And they said, "We do ten a year."  I said, "We do ten a month."  (Laughter) So, so, so I was involved with those things and with others, the United Way [United Way of America; United Way Worldwide], other activities like that.
Speaker 1: In speaking about Harvard, the program that you participated in gave you a lot of strategy for how to negotiate your job.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's you were describing.
Speaker 2: Yes.  But also how to use your relationships in ways--yes, that--so not only internal but external as well, and it's been just fabulous for me, and so I'm still on that board, and to think that I graduated from the Harvard Business School program in management development--it was then called--in '75 [1975] and I'm still--and I've also been the secretary for the Harvard Business School alumni club worldwide, so my involvement--and who doesn't mind being involved with such an outstanding institution that does its job so well, you know, so that's a joy.
Speaker 1: That was an invest- a very worthwhile investment, huh (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mommy [Gladys Lane] was smart.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 660238
Speaker 1: How long did you work at Johnson and Johnson [Johnson and Johnson Products; Johnson and Johnson Services, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Twenty-five years--from, from 1975 to 2000.
Speaker 1: And what would you say during this period--because that was a long time--were highlights, significant gains that you were able to make happen there?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I liked working with other women, so I pulled together a group of black women at J and J and we worked together on development--career development.  Also--and, again, remember, those times--now, over those years, of course, you know, J and J has done a stellar job in terms of now having women in positions and African Americans in positions, but I'm talking early days; and so I enjoyed my working with them.  Also, for example, a J and J person created a program call LEAD.  There are similar programs now all over the country, where J and J funded scholarships for minorities, not--overall minorities--and in return, they would spend a summer with us, but this program picked up their tuition and expenses and everything, and so at one point, I heard--though I wasn't involved with that program at all--I heard that the students were--it was in the early days--they were wondering, why would one corporation do this for people from all over the country?  And the sense of it was, the lesson I learned that the J and J culture is so very specific; and so I went to the man who was the founder of that program, and I said to him, "I hear that it's not working as well as we might--just in the sense that the students are wondering why--they're glad for the opportunity.  But why?"  And so I said to him--he said, "Well, what do you want to do about that?"  (Laughter) You know, so I pulled together a couple of people, and we organized a retreat for those students who were in the program, and they were located all over the country; and so we organized a retreat.  At the start of the retreat, we said to them the first afternoon, "There are only three things J and J wants us to do.  Other than that, you determine how our time is spent for the entire weekend.  They want to be sure you know about the Johnson and Johnson credo."  So important to the corporation.  I brought my credo copy home when I retired.  That's how important it is to us.  "Learn about the credo.  Learn about our commitment to decentralization, so very important in the structure of the company; and then get a sense of why we're doing this."  I said, "So other than that, anything else, it's up to you."  And what we did was, a friend of mine was then teaching at Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts].  We said, "You tell us your questions, we'll write them on the board," well--, "or you can go out and play tennis."  And so they, they started writing them on the board.  The boards were filled, and so they had all of their questions, and then we broke them up into groups, and so some had time to do other things, and, and then we rotated them through, so that was a real pleasure and treasure for me.  And some of those--one of them is still with J and J in a very, very senior position.  He's on the executive committee of the corporation, and others have done--do you know Bridgette Heller?
Speaker 1: I don't think so.
Speaker 2: Well, I'll give you her name for this.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Bridgette is a super star.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She came through that program and so forth, so--
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And--
Story_ID: 660239
Speaker 1: Speaking of the early days, you know, it--there were so many changes happening in Corporate America in the time that you were there because it was--when did you start, in seventy--?
Speaker 2: Seventy-five [1975] to 2000.
Speaker 1: Seventy-five [1975] to 2000.  So--you know for, you mentioned women--it was really tough and may still be, but it was really tough for women to get into Corporate America and move up, and, you know, there's a lot of turmoil business wise, and, and many people talking about it, as well as for African Americans to get in and move up in corporations.  You're human resources, so it's, it's coming at you.  How strategically were you approaching the leadership at Johnson and Johnson [Johnson and Johnson Products; Johnson and Johnson Services, Inc.] to open those doors?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, I can't say enough about J and J.  And so it's a corporation that, based on the credo, it's committed to doing things that are good for the business, good for the community and, ultimately, good for the corporation.  And that's what affirmative action really is as well.  And so I, I don't remember--I--certainly, we had challenges and we had times, but, nevertheless, I, I can't really speak of anything that was extremely inappropriate; and I never had an inappropriate experience there during my twenty-five years, no, no.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: But people moved.  African Americans moved in that company.
Speaker 1: Well, because I was going to ask, staying at that one place for twenty-five years, what made you stay?
Speaker 2: Well, I had three different jobs.  I had that first job where I said pay me less, et cetera, but they didn't, and I'm thankful for that (laughter).  My mother [Gladys Lane] took the offer letter, the job offer letter, took it to her job.  I sent her a copy.  Everybody at her job saw it.  When I visited them, I was embarrassed.  They all knew my salary.  They knew my total stock compensation.  They knew everything.  And J and J was generous at that time, et cetera.
Speaker 1: And so, and, actually, that was leaving OTB [New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation] to go there.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And so this was a promotion and a significant pay raise.
Speaker 2: Everything about it was good.
Speaker 1: Even though you had said--
Speaker 2: Pay me less.
Speaker 1: --it doesn't matter.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Salary was not relevant.
Speaker 1: Do you think you got more because you said pay me less (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, I got--you see, he--I guess he must have said to me what they would pay, and I said you don't have to pay me that amount.  Just--et cetera.  And then in the end, of course, they did pay me that amount, but that amount was good to me, so there we were.  And so--but just on, on the whole issue of what was happening for African Americans, so there were a number of people--well, and why I stayed for twenty-five years.  I had three different jobs.  I had that initial job with John [John Haldridge (ph.)].  I had that job at Ortho Diagnostics [Ortho Diagnostic Systems; Ortho Clinical Diagnostics], VP and, and member of the management board; and then, subsequently, I went to the corporate headquarters, and I worked in government relations doing a variety of government lobby activities, so all of that made it--
Speaker 1: So it made it a diverse (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that's the advantage of decentralization.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So many opportunities in one corporation.
Story_ID: 660240
Speaker 1: And so you were there during the Tylenol crisis--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --when--what they called the Chicago Tylenol murders.  That was a tough period.
Speaker 2: Tough period.
Speaker 1: Because Tylenol was the top--
Speaker 2: Big money maker.
Speaker 1: It was big money maker.  I mean, everybody used Tylenol.
Speaker 2: And, and still do.
Speaker 1: That was the--a pain reliever of choice; and then people started dying because someone had laced the, the Tylenol with poison.  How--what was your role during that time?
Speaker 2: All of us who were at the operating companies, our responsibility was to be sure that we kept employees fully informed, and our corporate headquarters team did a superb job; and so what would happen is, you know, every day you'd wake up and you'd hate to read the newspapers because the news was so bad, and so what they did was, they had very special presentations.  I don't remember if it was every week or every other week.  We would shut down the manufacturing line and bring all employees into the auditoriums, each of our operating companies; and we would see a video presentation, showed all the bad news, all the headlines, and we all sort of shuddered with that, and then also it would tell what the corporation [Johnson and Johnson Products; Johnson and Johnson Services, Inc.] was doing. And so, for example, when the crisis occurred, the man that I mentioned who created this particular program that brought minorities in [LEAD], he had just been promoted from a position running our McNeil operations [McNeil Consumer Products Company; McNeil Consumer Healthcare]--and that's where Tylenol is manufactured--to corporate headquarters.  He came back from corporate headquarters.  He went onto the floor where Tylenol was manufactured, and he said to the employees, "We know that none of you had anything to do with this, so we want you to come to work every day even if there's nothing to do.  You come to work.  You're going to be paid for every day, and, and we know that we're coming back."  And employees started wearing badges that said, "We're coming back."  And then employees brought family members in, and they covered the phones.  They, they handled the phone banks, so that we could--you know, there was product being returned, all sorts of things, so that the corporation also had been a very private corporation.  In the days when General Johnson [Robert Wood Johnson II], one of the--the son of one of the founders, and he had the title general because of the--his work with the Red Cross [American Red Cross].  When General Johnson was in charge, and we had stockholder meetings, if he felt there were too many questions being asked, he'd say, "That's it," and walk off the stage.  So it was a very private, rather insular company.  But Jim Burke [James E. Burke], the visionary that he was, he knew that this is a time when we had to be very public, and so he was on television programs.  The corporation was as open and as transparent as we could possibly be because we knew we had a good product.  We had trust in our employees; and, and all of us--in my role, our job was to ensure that everybody knew we had full trust and confidence in them, whether it was because we had the first incident in Chicago [Illinois], and then we had what we called a child of Tylenol or something like that.  We had, you know, there were, there were two or three crises, but it was never associated with the corporation, and, and in the end, the product has come back and has continued to be number one.
Speaker 1: Did they ever figure out who did it?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  But it stopped.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So whoever was doing it knew that evidently, we--the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], I guess, everybody was involved, the FDA [Food and Drug Administration]--everybody.  Must have been so close they knew they couldn't continue.  And then you always had the danger of copycats, so--right.
Speaker 1: And then packaging.  Did packaging change--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --after that?
Speaker 2: And packaging changed for our product and around the world.
Speaker 1: And--right.
Speaker 2: Everybody else.  In fact, now, it's hard to get into packages.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: But that's, that's--that was one of the things that Jim Burke led in.
Speaker 1: So the--every product like that, over the counter product, became safer--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as a result of this--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --crisis.
Speaker 2: So that's really taking a tragedy and really doing something positive with it.  And Jim Burke, by the way, is a Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] graduate from a class that's renowned in the HBS world, the class of '49 [1949].  It's a big class.
Story_ID: 660241
Speaker 1: So you leave in 2000?
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: Is that retirement?
Speaker 2: It's retirement--well, of course, you flunk retirement, but it's retirement, and so what happened was, I then went to grad school.  I decided that I wanted to--you know, when I was going through college [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], who pays attention to art 101?  And so what I did was, I enrolled in a graduate degree program in art history at Christie's [Christie's Education, New York, New York]; and I was a--what is the--
Speaker 1: I don't even know Christie's did that.
Speaker 2: Christie's has an accredited program.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And so I was an auditor, which meant that you attended all of the classes, and you took--you did all of the readings, but you didn't have to take the tests.  And it was interesting because there were other women like myself in that program.  Barbara Vogelstein [Barbara Manfrey Vogelstein], for example, who is the chair of the board of the Brooklyn Museum [Brooklyn, New York]--she was there.  She had just moved from her career in the financial world and had a strong interest in art, so she was in the program; and there were others like myself.  You know, we were in a--sort of a transitional stage.  This program was perfect for us.  And J and J [Johnson and Johnson Services, Inc.]--yeah, I adore the company.  And so what happened was, they asked me would I do some consulting, and I said, well, you know--.  And, so--because I knew I was going to be enrolled in this program, so the person at that time who was my J and J boss--and to show you things have changed.  He had been with our Chicopee Division, and had moved up from being a bench chemist to being the president of the Chicopee division of Johnson and Johnson, and then he was--when I was in government relations--he was in charge of that area.  And so he said to me, "Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Lane], you know, we'd love for you to do some of the things you've been doing."  And I said, "Well, you know, I, I'm going to be going to school."  And he said, "Let me tell you the compensation we have in mind."  I said, you know, "Al [ph.], that sounds awfully good."  And he said, "What do I have to do in order for you to say not just good, but great?"  And I said, "Well, Al, since you asked--," you see, I had changed on the issue of compensation (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: Over time.
Speaker 2: Right.  And I said, "Since you asked--."  And he said, "Well, I'm not sure if I can do that, but let me see what I can do."  And so, anyway, I did a little consulting for them, but I was really interested in being in this program, and I was, at that point, still involved with the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York].  I was on the board of the International Center of Photography [New York, New York], and, and I was doing other things with colleges and so forth, so, so, therefore, I was in that program, which was a year long program; and that was just a great transition.
Speaker 1: And then you--well, you've served on a number of different boards; NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]--
Speaker 2: National board--we always want to emphasize national board--
Speaker 1: Yes, the national board.
Speaker 2: --NAACP.  Thank you, right.
Speaker 1: Yes, of the NAACP.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The Board of Governors for Rutgers University [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey].
Speaker 2: A wonderful opportunity, yes.  Big--Rutgers had something like sixty trustees and eleven governors, so to be a governor was a big deal.
Speaker 1: The board of trustees for Freedom House [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, and what do they do?
Speaker 2: They're in cor- they're concerned with the opportunities for democratic development all over the world.
Speaker 1: Very important.  The board of directors for the SEED Foundation [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: I'm on that now.  A friend of mine, a woman I served on another board with, Ann Friedman, whose husband is Tom Friedman [Thomas Friedman] from The Times [The New York Times].  Ann was the chair at that time.  She asked me to join.  So it is a charter school that's a public school and a boarding school; and so the students for--who are a part of SEED, and we have three different SEED charter schools--Baltimore [Maryland]; Washington [D.C.]--I'm sorry--Baltimore, Washington, and Florida, and, and so I serve on that board.  Cheryl Dorsey--do you know Cheryl from the Baltimore?
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 2: Cheryl is on our board, and so forth, so--and, of course, I'm on the nominating committee, co-chair (laughter).  And, and so, anyway, I've been involved--continue with SEED.
Story_ID: 660242
Speaker 1: You also took up the charge to, to establish an endowed professorship to honor N. Naylor Fitzhugh [sic.] at, at Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Well, I was one of those, and so the concept was presented by alums and by Jim Cash [James I. Cash, Jr.], superstar and so forth; and [HistoryMaker] Dennis Hightower.  You may have known Dennis in his--he's probably one of yours.
Speaker 1: He is.
Speaker 2: He is.  And so they were the people who were going to lead the campaign to raise the money along with the other corporate people, but the two of them were leading the campaign, and when I heard that Dennis and Jim had agreed to lead it, I said to Dennis at a fundraising event, I said, "Dennis, tell me how I can help."  He said, "Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Lane], join us and be one of the co-chairs for that initiative."
Speaker 1: And tell me about, about H. Naylor Fitzhugh.  Who, who he--?
Speaker 2: So Naylor Fitzhugh was one of the early African Americans to graduate from the business school, not the first.  Maybe the third, and it was in the '30s [1930s]; and, of course, Naylor Fitzhugh, when he graduated, no one was interested in having an African American--even with a Harvard M.B.A.--on their team, and so he taught at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  I think Howard may have been his univers- alum--he may have been an alum of Howard, but, anyway, he taught, and he taught business courses in accounting and so forth at Howard, and--but he continued his involvement and continued to be really a wonderful mentor to students and to people when they graduated; and, ultimately, he joined the--ultimately, Pepsi [Pepsi-Cola Company; PepsiCo] came calling for him, and he went to work at Pepsi.  And, in fact, the first black woman to be a graduate of the Harvard Business School was one of his students from Howard, Lillian Lincoln [HistoryMaker Lillian Lambert], and she's probably one of yours. (Laughter) Anyway, and so, the feeling was, let's establish a chair--endow a chair for Naylor Fitzhugh, and, and so that's, that's what's happened.
Story_ID: 660243
Speaker 1: As you think about your dynamic life and career, what do you, what do you believe your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: No question: the Black Executive Exchange Program.  So how many students have been exposed to that program over forty-five years?  And in--when the program was thirty years old, we did a count, and I think at that time, we had, we had twenty-six colleges [HBCUs], and I've forgotten how many thousands of black executives.  All of those people have been touched by it.  Stan O'Neal [Stanley O'Neal], you remember Stan O'Neal who ran--you know, Stan was one of the people who went to the campus and, and taught the students.  I mean, and it's still on his resume today, which is a joy for me to see.  It doesn't say the Black Executive Exchange Program, it says the National Urban League program--and that's what it should be, you know.  And so, no question.  Number one for me is BEEP as we call it.  And number two is the joy I've had from the Studio Museum.  I'm fully committed there 100 percent, so there I've been involved with other organizations and still am involved, you know, SEED [SEED Foundation, Washington, D.C.] now; and Bloomfield College in New Jersey [Bloomfield, New Jersey]; and other things.  I always say--and there's no question--number one in my life in terms of my volunteer activity, and in terms of how I hope to be an ongoing resource even when I'm not sitting in the chair is the Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York].
Story_ID: 660244
Speaker 1: When you--if, if you were to give advice to a young African American female or male about walking in your footsteps, doing what you've done with your life, what advice would you give?
Speaker 2: I would say being open to every new experience possible.  And, of course, also, I should say, too, that my involvement with developing people has been strong with black women, and it's been strong with other women as well.  I'm on the teams no matter what.  And I had a woman that I adore so, who was an intern with me, Carol Alouise [ph.], and Carol was an intern, and she kept in touch with me.  In fact, I would say to them do what Carol did.  Carol was an intern, and after she completed one month, a January program with me, she kept in touch.  Carol would come and see me twice a year.  I never encouraged her to come back.  Twice a year she would come and visit; Christmastime and during her summer vacation, and, ultimately, I finally said (laughter), "Carol, how about joining us?"  Because she was, she was good as an intern just like, like Susan Wright has said that Thelma [HistoryMaker Thelma Golden] was good as an intern, and, and Carol joined us and, ultimately became my number two person; and then I went looking for another position for her.  She moved into marketing and she ultimately became responsible for the, the major, the number one product for my division at Ortho Diagnostics [Ortho Diagnostic Systems; Ortho Clinical Diagnostics].  She was just good.  And so I'd say--
Speaker 1: I need you to pause for a second (cough).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: My advice would be to appreciate those who support you.  Be--keep friends with, with people who've been a part of your career.  And, and always recognize there's so much more to learn; and, and there are lots of people who can teach you.
Story_ID: 660245
Speaker 1: Do you have any regrets?
Speaker 2: I do.  I do.  My career has been, you know, my sole focus.  That business of recru- of commuting really takes a lot out.  But I, I wouldn't name any one thing as a regret because the other things have all been so good.
Speaker 1: What is Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Lane] doing in the future?
Speaker 2: Thank you.  So I'm mapping out a new plan.  And I'm doing a five and a ten year plan, and that's now in the process.  I'm currently, as, as you know, still at the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York] and so forth, but I'm also looking at other organizations and activities that have meaning for me.  So, for example, I'm an enormous fan of A Better Chance.  I was vice chair, I think it was, of their board at one point.  And there's some other organizations that I am--so admire their success.  Somebody said the other day, and it's not a new expression--that ideas and plans are good, but it's execution that really matters in the end, and those are organizations that execute very well.  So I think I want to step back and see, is there another opportunity for me there?

Speaker 1: And, you know, I didn't ask you about your art collection.  When did you start collecting?  And, and you have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --quite an impressive collection today.
Speaker 2: Well, thank you.  I didn't really start collecting--you know, though I've been with the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York] since '75 [1975], I didn't collect then, and, you know, I so--that--there's a regret I'm happy to name.  But I--so at, at Chase [Chase Manhattan Bank; JPMorgan Chase and Co.] I became interested.  And then at Johnson and Johnson [Johnson and Johnson Products; Johnson and Johnson Services, Inc.], they have a great person, a curator, who's also in their philanthropy area, Michael Bzdak.  And Michael--and J and J has a collection, and through Michael, I--my interest and, and thoughts about collecting expanded.  Then he introduced me to the people at the International Center of Photography [New York, New York], and I joined that board; and, and so those are the things that helped me grow in terms of my interest in art.  And, at the Met, for example, now I'm co-chair of a sort of a friends of photography group at the Metropolitan Museum [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York], so I'm co-chair of the Stieglitz Society [Alfred Stieglitz Society] at the Met, and so, so there are just so many different ways that I've continued to be involved, and it just started and grew and grew.  And I'm involved also with some other museums.  For example, in Boston [Massachusetts], I'm a overseer at the Museum of Fine Arts [Museum of Fine Arts, Boston], and I'm--
Speaker 1: What does that mean?
Speaker 2: That means--it's sort of like a wannabe trustee.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, but it's sort of like a junior in that category.  Some people move up and some, some don't, so I, I was an overseer for five years, and now I'm an overseer emeritus--right, honorary.  I've forgotten which.  And then at the Harvard Art Museums [Cambridge, Massachusetts], I'm on their collections committee, so I'm enjoying that.  Lots of activities tied in there, and, you know, so it's--it's a good busy full time.  Couldn't ask for better.  This is how I flunked retirement.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Extremely well.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you'd like to share that I have not asked you?
Speaker 2: There couldn't be (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: There couldn't be, no.  You've given me lots to think about so that I'll be thinking about the questions you've raised, trying for some answers and also pushing myself for more.  And don't I love to be pushed?  So thank you, Harriette [HistoryMaker Harriette Cole], for doing that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Thank you.  Thank you so much.
Speaker 2: My pleasure.
