Speaker 1: Alright.  My name is Larry Crowe, and I'm the interviewer today with the HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, can you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My full name is Albert Guy Crenshaw.  Albert, A-L-B-E-R-T, Guy, G-U-Y, Crenshaw, C-R-E-N-S-H-A-W.  Did I go too fast?
Speaker 1: No, that's fine.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born March 20, 1952 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: Currently, I'm a research physiologist, associate professor and--yeah, that's my occupation and title.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you're an associate professor, where?
Speaker 2: I'm an associate professor at a university in Sweden.  It's the University of Gavle.  I can spell that for you, because it has one of those umlauts.  But we can, I'll spell it for you--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the American way.  G-A-V like Victor, L-E.  Okay.
Speaker 1: And it's pronounced?
Speaker 2: Well, the 'a' actually has two dots on top.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, and when you have two dots on top, instead of saying 'a' or 'ah', you say 'eh'.  So that's getting into another language.  So, we say 'Yavle' if you pronounce it like that.  But usually for an American writing or American keyboards, you have to write the 'eh' with an 'a', yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, alright.   Okay, and sir, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is April 21, 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Specifically, or just the town?  I mean, right now?  We're in the Hilton Hotel in the Financial District in downtown Boston in Massachusetts.
Story_ID: 27970
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we ask as kind of a warm-up, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Salmon.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Good?
Speaker 1: A favorite color?
Speaker 2: Purple.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summer.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: California.
Speaker 1: And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I'm a poetry writer, so I have a lot of favorite sayings.  Can I, can we get back to that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Story_ID: 27971
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'll do the best I can, yeah.
Speaker 1: We'll start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we'll try to put them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Reva Louise Crenshaw.  R-E-V-A, L-O-U-I-S-E, and Crenshaw's spelled just like my name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is Crenshaw her maiden name, too?
Speaker 2: No.  Her maiden name was Sampson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: S-A-M-P-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mom was born November 20, 1931 in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Now, how far back can you trace your mother's side of the family, and what kind of activities were your ancestors doing?
Speaker 2: I can only go back to my mother's grandfather, okay, because my mother lives in the same house now that her grandfather lived in.  I vaguely remember him.  I must have been one or two years old when he died.  But I've had this uncanny ability to remember things that happened when I was really young.  And it's, people tell me it's unusual, because usually you forget.  But my mother's mother, she died when, she died in 1955, in May of 1955.  I remember that distinctly, too.  I can even go into details about the day, but I won't.  But she was forty-two years old.  And I think you'll have to guide me a little bit as to what you're after here because--
Speaker 1: Well, what, your mother's grandfather is who we were talking about in the beginning, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Overton, O-V-E-R-T-O-N.  And his last name was Curry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: C-U-R-R-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, okay, so he was your mother's maternal grandfather, I guess?
Speaker 2: He was the father of my mother's mother.  Yes, maternal, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And he had this large house?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it wasn't a large house.  It was a pretty good-sized house in Virginia.  My mother has since added on and rebuilt and blah, blah, blah.  But she kept it, the basic structure, and she wanted to stay in the house, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: So, now what, do you know what he did for a living?
Speaker 2: He worked on the railroad.  He was a railroad worker, and exactly what he did, I'm not sure.  I think, I assume it was laying track.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, there are no--now, Charlottesville is an historic area--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: You know, [President Thomas] Jefferson--and you know, all the books about Sally Hemings [an enslaved woman of mixed race owned by President Thomas Jefferson through his wife's inheritance] and all that stuff that come from the Charlottesville area--and a lot of other things, too, you know, in Charlottesville.  Are there any stories at all about what your ancestors were doing back in those days?   Were they--
Speaker 2: You mean connected to any something that's--
Speaker 1: Not necessarily something famous, but what were they, you know, what kind of occupations they had.  It's an area that's really--you know, the University of Virginia there--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, as far as older black people back then, I mean, most of the stories were not so much about them, but maybe about the people that they worked for.  So, there isn't much documented about what they did.  So, I don't, I don't, they never told me any stories, either.  No stories were handed down that connected them to anything that--historic, or what they were doing or anything like that.  So, I don't have that strong of a memory about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, your great-grandfather worked on the railroad.  So this is--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, did he do any farming or was he strictly urban?
Speaker 2: No.  No, no.  He had some--I mean, like most blacks back then, or African Americans, they--he had chickens and he had a few pigs.  But it wasn't officially a farm.  And we, he did some planting and he cured hams and stuff like that.  And I remember the smells and the activity around the yards.  But it wasn't a farm per se, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And, now, okay.  So, can you--do you know the name of your great-great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: My great-great-grandmother--
Speaker 1: I guess it would be the spouse of Overton Curry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know one of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I think she was--
Speaker 1: The paternal side?
Speaker 2: I think she was married to my grandfather after my grandmother's mother had died.  So I think he, it was more like a step-mother for my grandmother.  But I don't know the name of my grandmother's mother.  Do you understand?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So this was the step-mother.  I know her name. Her name was Lucy, and that's all I know.  And we called her Miss Lucy, but she's not really connected by blood in that way.
Speaker 1: So, was your mother raised by your great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.  And mom--and her mother, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now, what did your grandmother do?
Speaker 2: She was, oh, I guess she just cleaned up for people.  She didn't, she didn't--she was around the house mostly.  But she just, you know, took care of people's houses around there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Story_ID: 27972
Speaker 1: So any sense of what life was like in terms of, you know, growing up, for your mother [Reva Louise Sampson Crenshaw] in Charlottesville [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: For my mother?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Ah--
Speaker 1: She would have grown up during the days of segregation.  I don't know what it would have been like in Charlottesville--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was--
Speaker 1: --compared to other places.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was typical, a typical segregated Southern town.  And even after, even when I was growing up, when we get to my part of the story--I was fifteen years old before I even knew a white person by name.  So, I mean, of course, my mother was also quite isolated in that sense.  But she went to the, say, colored only schools and she had to sit in certain places in restaurants, and so on and so forth.  I saw some of that myself, and I remember that, but it wasn't to the same extent.  So, of course, it was quite segregated, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: So, I'm just, I'm just asking you as if you would, you know, want your kids to know about, you know--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: --the difference between what's going on today and what happened then, you know.
Speaker 2: And, yeah.  I don't know if I can, if I have any specific incidents.  But in general, I just know we were subjected to the normal segregated laws, and so on and so forth, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Normal for then, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, normal for then, exactly.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  I mean, if we can talk about--I mean, this is something that a lot of people experienced.  I mean, like I said, my mother had to--she wasn't allowed to go to certain places--the movies, for example.  She had to sit upstairs, she couldn't sit downstairs because the downstairs was for the whites.  And it was a little worse for her than it was for me, obviously, because you know, time had moved forward twenty-something years.  But she had to go in through the back of certain stores and restaurants.  And, of course, we grew up quite poor.  And she, she worked for white people, cleaning their floors and stuff like that, and cleaning their houses and--.  So, it was, you know, it was a little bit--blacks were not put on the same level as whites.  But that kind of is common knowledge nowadays, that we know, that we know that's how it was, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 27973
Speaker 1: So, did your mother [Reva Louise Sampson Crenshaw]  get a chance to finish school?
Speaker 2: She finished high school.  My mother turned out to be, and she still is, a very very bright lady.  But one of the women that she worked for, recognized my mother as having some kind of skills.  I mean, intellectual skills.  And she helped my mother go to night school, and she helped my mother get her credentials as a secretary.  And eventually, my mom got a job at the University of Virginia [Charlottesville].  But if it wasn't--I mean, those were the kind of breaks you needed back then.  You didn't just get anywhere because you were black and smart, because you never got a chance to show that.  But in this particular case, she got a break.  She met this woman.  And I know this woman by name today, because my mother--of course, she talked about this woman for years and years and years after that, about how good this woman had--how much this break had meant to her, yeah.
Speaker 1: Who was it?  Because this is for history, so--(laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'll just tell you her name--Mrs. Blanton, B-L-A-N-T-O-N.  I don't remember her first name at the moment.  But if my mother reads this about Mrs. Blanton, it will bring a tear to her eye, because I think she'll be impressed that I remembered it enough to tell you today.  Because she's told that story to us several times, as if to say, you know, I got that break.  So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So even in the midst of segregation and this, the racism in Virginia, there's somebody that really helped her--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a white person that she worked for identified her as somebody that--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: --should be, you know, could be elevated, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, exactly right.
Speaker 1: --with some help.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, your mother--now did Mrs. Blanton also help her get the job at the University of Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is, this is important, because the University of Virginia is quite a facility.  And you know, it's an institution with a lot of resources and that sort of thing.  So, when you're associated with that, it just forms a whole other world of--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --associations and aspirations.
Speaker 2: I mean, socially--
Speaker 1: Uh huh.
Speaker 2: --but also from a security point of view, too, because my mother retired from there.  And it being a state job, she's doing pretty well now.  So, it did a lot for her, yeah, to be there.  And she met so many people.  And I think getting in that environment also--instead of getting away from the environment that she had, she was working with--she would, say, interact and socialize mostly with other people like her, maids and people like that.  But once she got into that environment, she, I think she even realized more of her potential.  And she blossomed like a flower.  So, because of her, this social aspect, I mean--.  Now, my mother, she's probably one of the more intellectual non-licensed doctors you ever want to see, because she, she can talk the talk, because she has been around that world, and we have very, very nice conversations.
Speaker 1: In terms of the doctors, did she, was she a secretary for--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: --an M.D. [Doctor of Medicine]?
Speaker 2: She worked at--yeah, yeah, I mean--
Speaker 1: --in the medical?
Speaker 2: The University of Virginia is a high, it has a lot of--she worked at the University of Virginia Hospital, yes, as a secretary, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then she worked in Student Health.  So, she's always, she had always been connected to that part of the University of Virginia that had something to do with health.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: And I guess it may be that, say, subliminally or subconsciously, it had an effect on me because--.  It was funny, though.  I--just to sidetrack--because whenever I'd go and visit my mother, I couldn't stand to be there.  I hated the smell of a hospital, yeah.  And I told her I'd never get, go anywhere near a hospital as my job.  And I was this close to getting into medical school.  I even, almost got an offer, but I had other interests at that time.  So, it's just funny how things are.
Story_ID: 27974
Speaker 1: I wondered if that, you know, you had a few other aspirations.  You know, a lot of people, it's almost like a standing story.  I mean, immigrants come to this country.  They want to--they scrub floors so their son can be a doctor--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, you know, that's the story of poor people in the United States.  What they want for--the highest aspiration they have for their children, or their sons, really is to become a doctor.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it's kind of a prestigious--it's more prestigious here in the States than it is in Europe.  But it's, it carries a certain stigma with it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You have, it's a, I guess on a popular culture level, it seems the highest attainment.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Even though--so some of the scientists we've interviewed, actually, you know, feel like apologetic to their parents because they went into science instead of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  (laughter)  Yeah, but I didn't feel that, because we come from a kind of unprivileged background.  And I mean, I had an older brother [Gregory Crenshaw] and he never finished high school.  So, just to finish anything was kind of an honor for my mother.  And I, I had choices, and I chose what I chose.  And so, I didn't have that kind of pressure, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And I'd never seen it as--it would be more--I would be more of a success if I had chosen medical doctor instead of a Ph.D.  I never, I've never seen it like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 27975
Speaker 1: So you were born in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Now, did your mother [Reva Louise Sampson Crenshaw] live in Philadelphia at one point, or--
Speaker 2: She lived in Philadelphia for a couple of years.  She, of course, she was married to my father [Albert Eugene Crenshaw].  But by the time I was born, that marriage was about to break up.  My father, he was, he was hanging out in the streets too much and got into some trouble.  So, three months after I was born, my mother said this is enough, she's out of here.  But she had already had my brother [Gregory Crenshaw], and she had stayed up in Philadelphia with him a year earlier.  So, at three months, she moved back to Virginia.  She was born in Virginia.  She moved to Philadelphia, and then I was--, I was born there.  And then she moved back to Virginia because of this situation with my father.  So, I was raised in Virginia.
Story_ID: 27976
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to go to your father's side.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My father's full name is Albert Eugene, E-U-G-E-N-E, Crenshaw.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story as to why you became Albert Guy Crenshaw instead of Albert Eugene, Jr.?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I don't know.  I guess--but you wait until you ask me about my grandfather.  His name is also Albert Crenshaw, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: But I don't remember his middle name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, so some reason--so sometimes I'm considered Albert Guy Crenshaw, III.  But that's not, that's not correct, because it's not the same middle name.  I have no idea what they, what they were thinking.  I guess I should ask my mother [Reva Louise Sampson Crenshaw] about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what is your father's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Virginia.  Let's see now.  My father died, he was fifty-one years old in 1981.  So, he was born in 1930.  His birthday, I think, was February 20th.  I mean, I have, he had--I hadn't been living around him so much because of my mother being separated.  But, so February 20, 1930 in Virginia, he was born, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side, the Crenshaws?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I became, I actually became pretty close with my father's mother, the grandmother on the paternal side.  She and her husband moved my father, and maybe one of his brothers, up to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  I don't know why.  But they moved up there when my father was young.  And from that, after that, they had four or five more kids and they were, they were born up in Philly [Philadelphia].  But she was a good woman.  She didn't work at all.  But my grandfather, the big Albert, the other Albert, he worked at a meat cutting plant, or what do you call it?  Some kind of butcher, butcher place.  And my father actually did construction work when he was not in trouble, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 27977
Speaker 1: Did your father have any stories about growing up in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] that he shared with you?
Speaker 2: No.  We, we weren't that close, because there wasn't that much time to really get close.  I used to meet him periodically, but it wasn't like we had--I can't even, I can't even really say that my father and I ever really talked.  I think a few years after my mother [Reva Louise Sampson Crenshaw] left Philadelphia, my father started drinking heavily.  And he was a street, on the street alcoholic.  So, it was kind of hard to keep a relationship with him.  I would go up to try to do that as I got older, fifteen [years old], and up till, to college age.  But he was a little bit too far gone.  And it was mostly my [paternal] grandmother that I stayed with and talked to, and so on.  So, I didn't really have that much of a relationship with my father.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, was he able to finish high school, too, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he finished high school in Philadelphia, but Overbrook High School--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: For some reason, I remember that.
Speaker 1: Well, Overbrook is the high school of the Dipper, they call him, Wilt Chamberlain [Wilton Norman "Wilt" Chamberlain; American basketball player].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's why I remember it, because (laughter) they said he went to the same high school as Wilt Chamberlain, that's right.  So, he did graduate.  But then he, he became a, he went to the [U.S.] Army.  And I think that's where--my mom claims that they had met right after he had finished high school.  But then he went to the [U.S.] Army, and I think my mom claims that that's where he started going downhill.  He hooked up with some, the wrong crowd, and--
Speaker 1: So, was he in the Korean War?  Yeah, he's not the age of the Korean conflict.
Speaker 2: I don't know if he was in the war at all.  I--
Speaker 1: He never left the U.S., you don't think?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 27978
Speaker 1: Now, did they [Crenshaw's parents, Reva Louise Sampson Crenshaw and Albert Eugene Crenshaw] meet in Virginia or Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father had moved to Philadelphia.  And this is a bizarre story a little bit.  Not bizarre, but it's just freaky.  And I asked my mother fifteen times, explain this to me.  My father's father is the brother of the person who lived in the house next door to us, okay.  So, they're brothers, they're both, but they're both Crenshaws.  So, this is my father's father, Albert, and my--the guy who lives in the house, his name is James, so Uncle James.  So, my father's father, Albert, had taken his family up to Philadelphia.  But he would come back and visit his brother, James, sometime, and he would bring his children with him.
Speaker 1: So Uncle James lived next door to your mother (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) Uncle James lived next door to my mother, my mother and his family--
Speaker 1: --in Virginia--
Speaker 2: --anyway, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I mean, I think that's not so uncommon.  There was no blood there.  I asked my mom a whole lot of times, you know.  "Hey, you didn't let us know?"  You know, "Ain't no relatives here between you and my father, is it?"  "No, no, no, no."  But I mean, that's how they met, people, back then, you know.  And we called Uncle James "Uncle James" but he wasn't--my mother called him that, but he wasn't really her uncle, you know what I mean?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  So, but he was the brother of my father's father.  And so, my father's father would take his kids down and they would visit.  And that's how my mother met my father.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, they met in Virginia, and then she married him--
Speaker 1: Came back to Virginia, yeah.  But then he, of course, he was living in Philadelphia.  So, she decided to go up there and marry him and try to make it up there, but it didn't work, yeah.
Story_ID: 27979
Speaker 1: And this [Crenshaw's parents getting married] is before the war or after?  I mean, not the war, but before he joined the [U.S.] Army, I guess?
Speaker 2: I was born in 1952.  So, World War II was finishing, about what, 1945?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, probably in that little interim there between the end of World War II and the--in 1952--they had a relationship for six or seven years.  And during those six or seven years, in the beginning they were getting married.  And then my father [Albert Eugene Crenshaw] went to the Army for a couple of those years.  And then he came back, and my brother [Gregory Crenshaw] was born, and I was born.  My brother was born in 1950, 50--, in 1950.  And then I was born in '52 [1952].  But around the time--but by that time, at the end of this seven year period between the wars--between the war and my birth, things went a little sour with my mom [Reva Louise Sampson Crenshaw] and my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, by time you were three months old, you say you moved--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were back in Charlottesville [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mom had taken me back to--she didn't want to stay in Philadelphia.  So, she took my older brother and I and went back to Virginia.
Speaker 1: So is, is your older brother your only sibling?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  I mean, I had, he's my only full sibling, because my mother had two other kids by another guy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, so there were four of you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's four of us.
Speaker 1: So, when you were growing up, it would have been you and your brother, and your brother first.  And then--did she re-marry the other guy?
Speaker 2: She never got married to him.
Speaker 1: Okay, but she had--
Speaker 2: She had two kids by him, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they are five years and six years younger than I am.  That's my brother and my sister, respectively.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, can you name your siblings and put yourself in the order of all of you?
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  My oldest brother's name is Gregory.  And he's, like I said, he was born in 1950, in November.  My, and then it's me after that.  And then it's my, my younger, youngest brother, younger brother.  His name is Todd, T-O-D-D.  And then the youngest of us is Reta, R-E-T-A.
Story_ID: 27980
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: About anything?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.  It was kind of traumatic when my grandmother died.  I think I told you that.  I was, it was in May of 1955, and I was, that means I was only three years old.  And I was sitting on her lap, on the porch, and she just started to urinate.  I was sitting there, and she started to urinate.  And I realized something was wrong with her.  And I jumped off and I shook her, and she looked like she was about to go.  She was having a heart attack.  And she actually died.  And I can see that day quite well.  And my mother [Reva Louise Sampson Crenshaw] came running and, she was, of course, she was a little, just really upset.  And then I remember some days later, when we had the funeral.  And we weren't allowed to go to the funeral, but the hearse was pulled up in the yard, and so many people, a lot of people, came to the house and stuff like that.  And, but this was when I was three years old, and I thought that was kind of, I've never forgotten it.  It was so vivid.  But there's a thousand other things that happened when I was three years old that I don't remember, but that one I do, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Now, can you describe the house you grew up in, and the neighborhood?  Did it have a special name or, you know, and what was the demographics of Charlottesville [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Charlottesville is not a big town, as it is.  It's primarily a University of Virginia town.  We lived about five miles outside of Charlottesville.  We lived east of Charlottesville, going toward Richmond [Virginia].  You would drive down the main road, and you would take a left on a dirt road, and you'd go up a hill, quite a ways up a hill.  Maybe it would take you a couple minutes to get up to the top of the hill.  Going up that hill, on the left side was my mother's [Reva Louise Sampson Crenshaw] house.  If you continued up that hill, Uncle James lived up there.  That hill was called North Hill.  I don't know why.  But anybody in that area, if you throw out the name North Hill, they know exactly what you're talking about, okay.  So, there was actually one road--two roads--going up to North Hill, off of the main road.  You could take a left, or you could continue down and take another left.  You could go up on the other side.  So, we had friends over here--or relatives--and then acquaintances over here.  And on this side, we could walk across the hill like this.  We were like on a hill.  So, it's called North Hill.  But it's near a little, another suburb of Charlottesville called Shadwell, S-H-A-D-W-E-L-L, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  And, you know, so I know your uncle's an African American, so is your immediate family.  Was that, like, an African American--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --enclave?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, all me, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I don't know who's related to who, but everybody called everybody cousins.  So, I mean, we have treated each other like family, actually.  And my mother was, I mean for a large part of the time she was alone, because she didn't, she hadn't met her new boyfriend for some years.  And so she, she had people help her out with taking care of us.  So we had, you know, Aunt Nancy and Aunt Ellen and people like that all around us all the time, yeah.  But even though--I don't know if they were related or not, but it didn't matter.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1: Now, was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  We, we were not asked, but forced, to go to church and to be a part of the Sunday school and to be--sing in the choir, and you get baptized.  And yeah, yeah, it was definitely something.  Every Sunday we would, my brother [Gregory Crenshaw] and I would dread it, because we knew it was going to be boring, you know, but--
Speaker 1: What kind of church was it?
Speaker 2: It was a Baptist church.
Speaker 1: Baptist, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, just a little Southern Baptist--
Speaker 1: And the name of it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.  Union Run, Union Run Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: Union Run?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now was that, that sounds like a stream or something.  Was that a, was a stream over there named Union Run, or was it a--
Speaker 2: No, not that I know of.  I don't even know where the name came from.
Speaker 1: It might have come from Reconstruction, you know.  I mean, just the idea of Union Run--
Speaker 2: Union Run.
Speaker 1: I mean, Union control, or it could mean a stream.  I mean, I'm just thinking of all the different things.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Anything named Union usually, you know, is referring to the Union in the Civil War, rather than a Union, you know, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  (simultaneous)  But you might be right.
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) making a statement--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, in those days, you know.  In the rebel capitol, you know, you got Union Run Baptist Church.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But that was Richmond [Virginia], right, or--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the capitol was Richmond.
Speaker 2: The capitol was Richmond, yeah.
Speaker 1: And Virginia, you know, takes kind of credit for--but, so that's interesting, Union Run Baptist Church.
Speaker 2: Uh huh, uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you and your brother didn't like church very much.
Speaker 2: Kids, man.  I mean, who does?  We were just kids, you know.  But I appreciate it now, though.  And I appreciate--the church still stands, and it's, of course, it's been remodeled five or six times.  But I kind of like to go there now.  It's because I know I have a history there.  My grandmother went there.  And my mom [Reva Louise Sampson Crenshaw], she's really active in the church.  She's been an usher, and the treasury, and working for the condolences committees and stuff like that.  So, when we go home, it's a way--and also it's a way to meet people.  You go there and you meet your friends.  And, you know, you haven't seen them for--especially for my case.  I mean, I'm out of the country for sometimes a year at a time.  And I go back and hook up with my buddies and--yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I didn't like it back then, though, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Did you get involved in youth activities in church?  Like, what was the place where they, you know, kind of gave promising youth, like, roles to play in the church?
Speaker 2: Not that much.
Speaker 1: Not that much?
Speaker 2: No.  I mean, we had the junior choir, and we had to practice in the choir a couple days a week, or something like that.  And so, I don't know.  We were, we were just members of that, but nothing else, though.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 27983
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights.  I think the summer in Virginia can be kind of sightful.  I remember as a kid I'd always dread these--I don't even know what these things are officially called, these things called chequers.  They were these little white flowers that would come out in the beginning of summer.  And as I walked through them--if they ever get on your leg, you start itching like crazy.  But I've always associated that with summer, and a part of growing up.  We played a lot of--baseball was really popular when I was growing up, and we played a lot of Little League [baseball] and so on and so forth.  And every Sunday, we would play in a local black league.  And it was, people were talking all the time--just the chatter, the chatter, the chatter, the chatter, you know.   Sometimes I, I'd sit down, and I realized that it would be good to put some of this chatter on a rap song, or something like that.  So, those sounds I remember--
Speaker 1: Can you give us an example?  I've heard of baseball chatter--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, I'll tell you.  We had this one guy, he couldn't talk.  He was a really, really, really good shortstop.  And his name was Rudy, Rudy Barrett.  And Rudy--I say this to my kids over in Sweden sometimes.  And he would stutter, you know, "uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh," and he was like [making mumbling sounds], something like that.  And that means that he was telling the pitcher to throw the ball in the hole, you know.  And I just said something that I understood.  But I'm not going to tell you what he said, because some of it's not--it's profanity, you know.  But he would say that.  And I could hear Rudy say that all the time.  And even when I got older--if I would meet Rudy when I was going to school in West Virginia or somewhere--and I'd come home and I'd look at him, and I'd go, [making mumbling sounds], and he knew exactly what it meant.  So, and I do that to my kids.  I don't tell them what it means, but they tease me about it, too.  So, that's one of the sounds that was always there when we played baseball, you know.  And the music--and then we always had some good old, you know, rhythmic music to move by on those Sundays when we played.  So, that was also--
Speaker 1: Was the music off the radio, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, back then it was just radio, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Or maybe somebody had a little machine, and playing those little what, 45s [45 rpm gramophone records], or something like that?
Speaker 1: 45s.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But it's mostly just radio music, but soul music.  Percy Sledge [an American R&B and soul performer who recorded the hit 'When a Man Loves a Woman' in 1966]--and I could start naming them, but the music, I remember.  And, like, the chants when we were playing baseball, yeah, uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Other sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: Sights.  Let's see, what can I--I went to--okay, growing up--Maybe this was when I was a little older.  I went to a junior high school called Jackson P. Burley.  And it was, it was also an all-black school.  And we had these--I didn't--I played junior varsity basketball there.  But, we had cheerleaders there.  And they used to have these cheers, and they were really, really good cheers, you know.  And I can hear them now, saying some of those cheers like that.  So, that was--
Speaker 1: What was, give us an example of a cheer.
Speaker 2: "You don't know, you don't care.  We're going to beat you anyway.  Boo boop, boo boop."  And then it was just the rhythmic, you know, stuff like that, yeah, something like that.  I could probably give you some more, if I thought about it but (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But they were very good, though?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were good, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright, and in rhythm and stuff, huh?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Did they do a lot of jump rope and stuff in those days, with the songs and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, no.  They didn't need the rope.  They could jump anyway, without the rope, yeah.
Story_ID: 27984
Speaker 1: Alright, Jackson P. Burley [Crenshaw attended Jackson P. Burley High School].  Now, who is Jackson P. Burley?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: He was a, he was a, he built that school [in Charlottesville, Virginia], actually.  He was a local educator.  He had moved there from somewhere, maybe North Carolina, back in the late 1800s.  And he had just, he was just interested in education.  Now, he probably had some kind of advanced education himself, but I don't know that.  But he built the school, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was black, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: African American.
Speaker 1: That's the junior high school, right?
Speaker 2: No, no.  But it was, it was, I played junior varsity.  But we had, we only had a high school back then, eight to twelve, eighth grade to the twelfth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was all Jackson P. Burley--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --High School?
Speaker 2: Jackson P. Burley High School, yeah.  We didn't have, we didn't separate junior high and high school at that time, yeah.  Later, we did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I never went to a junior high school, per se.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, did, was there a separate elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There was a separate elementary school.  And that's called Albemarle Training School.
Speaker 1: Albemarle.  A-L-B-E-...
Speaker 2: A-L-B-E-M-A-R-L-E, Albemarle.
Speaker 1: Albemarle?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Training School.
Speaker 1: Okay, called Training School.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And, alright, so Albemarle was the neighborhood, or--
Speaker 2: Uh huh, it's a county.
Speaker 1: County?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Training School--now, did you have any idea why it was called a training school instead of an elementary school?
Speaker 2: No, I think it was just another way to distinguish that it's a lower school that's maybe training you for high school or something.  It was grades one through seven.  I don't know, other than that.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: It's actually the same school my mother [Reva Louise Sampson Crenshaw] went to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, Albemarle, now did you go to kindergarten, or did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We called it nursery school back then, yeah.  But I went to nursery school, yeah.  Of course, because my mom was single, a single mom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we, my brother [Gregory Crenshaw] and I both, I think through the time we were two--two or three years old--up until the time, yeah, we started school, yeah.
Speaker 1: It was held, was it a local--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was local--
Speaker 1: --somebody's house or--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) No, no, it was local, yeah.  She had to take us from the--, out in the sticks where we lived, to Charlottesville.  So, it was a special school in Charlottesville for kids, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Now, did you like school, growing up?
Speaker 2: When you talk about growing up, you're talking about during what period?
Speaker 1: Well, early days, I mean when you first were exposed to school.  Did you like it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thought it was--I think I liked more of the social aspects of it, meeting people and friends, and stuff like that.  Actually, to this day I still have a couple of friends that I started school with back then, and I always hook up with them when I go down to Virginia.  So, we--from that, in that sense, yeah, I really liked having those friends.  And I don't remember school itself, if I ever liked it or disliked it, if I had a good time, you know, with math and writing and stuff like that.  I don't remember that, whether I liked it or not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did okay, so I guess I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were there any particular teachers or subjects that you were drawn to more than others?
Speaker 2: You know, now that you mentioned it, I did like math.  And there was a fourth grade teacher I had, called Alberta Key, K-E-Y, and she was the math teacher.  And then in the fifth grade, I had a teacher named Miss Poindexter, and she taught a little bit of everything.  But she also was good at math.  And I think those--, mathematics has been kind of my pet peeve when I was younger.  But I didn't go into it, I didn't get so deep into it when I was in college though, but still it kind of was, I think I was stimulated by that more than some other subjects, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 27985
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any other talents that you, you know, manifested as a youth?
Speaker 2: I had one fascination.  I was pretty--I was okay to be by myself.  My mother [Reva Louise Sampson Crenshaw] tells me that now, and I knew that, too.  But I would take walks.  And I like nature--and I like--and I think that has a big impact on how I, how and why I am what I am today.  But, I used to love bugs.  I used to love watching bugs and watch them work, and I used to always want to try to get inside their head and see what they were thinking.  So, bugs, and especially--I used to--this was a little bit cruel.  I used to catch bugs and take them to spider webs and put them in there just to see how the spider comes out, and see how they wrap them up and what they do with them.  But I was fascinated by bugs, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, did you play an instrument or anything, or do any artwork or that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, I played this thing called the flute-a-phone, just because we had to.  But I didn't, and I was awful as an artist.  I couldn't draw.  I had friends that could draw, and I used to be so jealous of them.  But no, I could never do anything artistic.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  But you liked sports, apparently, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've always played sports.  We grew up--and around the hill where we were living, there was enough guys and girls to put together a softball team, softball game or something--or kickball or--but we had homemade baskets, and we played basketball.  So, we played football--We kind of kept with the seasons.  And it was, everybody, all of us around there was pretty enthusiastic about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, were you like getting games on television in those days, too?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't even know if we had a TV.  Let's see.  I'm trying to think now when we got it.  We had a black and white TV--we must have been getting some games by the time I was ten or twelve [years old], because I started playing Little League baseball.  And I remember knowing all the names on the [New York] Yankees [baseball team], Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris.  I don't know how far back you remember, but--. So, I had to have seen those guys somewhere.  So it may, it probably was on TV.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is that the team that Virginia focuses on, the one with the Yankees?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No, it just was me, I liked them.  I've actually played for a Little League team called the Yankees.  So I probably identified with the New York Yankees that way.  I knew every player.  I knew how old they were, and I knew, I just was, had a wealth of knowledge about the Yankees back then, yeah.  So, I must have seen them on TV, but that doesn't stick.  It doesn't--
Speaker 1: Did you collect the cards, the baseball cards?
Speaker 2: We did, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we collected them mostly for the sake of the bubblegum, but we collected the cards, though.  Yeah, we used to read them, yeah, and trade them with friends.
Speaker 1: And that's a good way to keep up with who's who on one level.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 27986
Speaker 1: Now, were there any black doctors in the area?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had black doctors.  Oh, what's his name?  Yeah, I remember going to a black doctor a few times when I needed to.  I need some time to think about his name, though.  I can see his face, though--kind of short, stocky guy with a white coat.  I can see his--Dr. Garrett, Garrett was his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was wondering, you know, who was in the area, because I know your mother [Reva Louise Sampson Crenshaw], you know, worked at the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia].  Did she start, I mean, how soon did she start working at the University of Virginia when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she got this training--when she was getting this training, my brother [Gregory Crenshaw] and I was trying to babysit our younger siblings.  So, we must have been 10, 11, 12 [years old].  And my youngest brother [Todd] is five years younger than me, so somewhere around that time after--So, probably after about ten years, she moved back to Virginia.  When I was three months old, she moved back down.  And then she started going and getting this training.  And then I think it took her maybe six months to a year to get this training.  And then she got a job.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She actually sold insurance at one time, too.  I don't know remember where, I don't know where that came in.  But I can, I just have a vague memory of it.
Story_ID: 27987
Speaker 1: Now did you have any, you know, scientific aspirations as a, you know, when you were a--
Speaker 2: A kid?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't think directly.  But what I told you about bugs, I realized later that that's hardcore.  Anybody who wants to sit around and look at bugs all the time, you know, they (laughter)--either they're nuts or they see it as some kind of, you have some kind of enthusiastic interest in it.  And apparently, that's where my scientific interest was kind of, was generated there, I think.
Speaker 1: Yeah, did you read about the bugs?
Speaker 2: Not at that time.  I just watched them.  I knew what they were going to do, and I knew what they were, and I knew, I could see different ones.  And I knew what, how they worked, and what time of the year they were going to be out.  I mean, I was really, really into it.  But I didn't, I wasn't so much into reading about them.
Speaker 1: What was the most memorable--I mean, can you identify them by name, or did you--
Speaker 2: The bugs?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mainly liked spiders and the spider webs.  And I used to, and even when I, later on when I grew up, I became interested in taking photography with the spider webs.  I didn't know where they came from, but then I--one day I was talking to somebody, and I realized--But, how spiders--how they protect, how they build this web and then they catch these bugs--and then how they come out and how they wrap it up and sometimes they save it for a little while.  I mean, those kind of, that fascinated me.  So, I don't know, I just like, just like watching bugs.  I still do.  I can get, I can just get fascinated by it.  If you take me somewhere and there's an ant farm or something like that--watching those little suckers working, and really focusing in on one of them, and seeing what they do--and you're realizing that they're carrying, they can carry three times their body weight or something crazy like that.  And you know, you just kind of, just get amazed, yeah.
Story_ID: 27988
Speaker 1: Now, are there any memorable science teachers on the, you know--now I guess as you get further in the school--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: --in [Jackson P.] Burley [High School]--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: --Were there any, you know, science teachers that come to mind that--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --anybody that kind of encouraged you to take--
Speaker 2: I don't think that I knew that I had an interest in science at that point.  I think it was when I went to junior college later.  And I had, I mean, but then at Burley I had to take certain courses.  I kind of, I didn't dislike English, either.  I liked the novels.  And I write poetry now, and I like writing.  So, that's probably also something that I did okay in.  And I think I did okay in English.  But there was nothing in my high school days or time that connected to science at all.  I mean, I had math and physics and stuff like that, you know.  I don't know if I was taking physics back then, either.  But you take those things, and later on they become a complement to science, but they're not science per se, you know.
Speaker 1: How far did they teach you in math?  Did you get to calculus, or?
Speaker 2: I think I had, I think I had calculus.  If I didn't take it in high school, in my twelfth grade, I took it in first year of junior college.  But I went, I went pretty, you know, to the extent that I could go.  You could stop, you could--, other people could take another route.  But geometry and trigonometry and calculus and stuff like that--that was, it was okay for me.  I could handle that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Now, were you attracted to biology at all in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but we didn't have, really, biology in high school.  I mean, not like--not, not, not, not like that.  We had, we had maybe a science book.  And I--to be honest with you, I don't think science was that, was such an isolated subject.  I think it was kind of inter-meshed with other things.  But if we did, I don't remember it.  It didn't stick out as being something that was isolated, not until I got to junior college, and I actually took a course called biology, yeah.
Story_ID: 27989
Speaker 1: Now, at the high school level then, now, what did you do?  Were you a popular student in high school [Jackson P. Burley High School]?
Speaker 2: Not because I was--because I was a good basketball player.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And that's all you needed in my area in high school, just to be--and everybody wanted to hang around with you, you know.  So, I kind of rode that and used it, yeah.  But I was probably one of the best, better basketball players in my group at the time.  So--
Speaker 1: So, you played point guard.
Speaker 2: I played point guard in high school.  And I mean, I was in the newspapers on a regular basis, and even on the radio, and I was written up.  And so, I was kind of good.  And that really helps your popularity (laughter) in high school, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the team?  I mean, it was the Burley High School--
Speaker 2: I played for the Burley Bears.  But there, I played JV [junior varsity].  When I was in the tenth grade, we were bussed to a white school.  And that white school was called Albemarle High School, like you spelled Albemarle earlier.  And there, I played point guard for the varsity team in the tenth, eleventh, twelfth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, and this was the Albemarle--what was the name of the team?
Speaker 2: Albemarle Black Knights.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, really interesting.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: Right. (laughter)
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Black Knights.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That is, that's very interesting, that in the age of segregation that the team would be called the Black Knights.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was hard for my mother [Reva Louise Sampson Crenshaw] to get us to get on that bus the first day, though.  We were afraid, we were cocky, I mean we created all kinds of scenes about it.  "I ain't going to let nobody call me a nigger."  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  We were really--we really had a chip on our shoulder.  But it wasn't like that.  We got there and it was okay.  And slowly but surely, especially when I was playing basketball, I got to know some of the, some of their names, you know.  But before that, I had only seen white people on TV.  I had seen them, but I hadn't talked to them.  So, I only knew the names of white people on TV, up until I was fifteen [years old], yeah.  But you probably grew up like that, too?
Speaker 1: Well, pretty much.  It was there.  You're about right.  I didn't know any white people as such--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I think until I was in high school.  I mean, I knew teachers in our school, you know, the teachers were white.
Speaker 2: You had white teachers?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In maybe fifth grade--
Speaker 2: Where were you growing up?
Speaker 1: Dayton, Ohio.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, it may have been a little bit different there.  This was in the South.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 27990
Speaker 1: At Albemarle High School [Charlottesville, Virginia; integrated school that Crenshaw attended for the last years of high school]--so you still weren't really focused on science [in high school], you said?
Speaker 2: No, not at all, not at all.  I didn't even know that I was interested in science.  And this thing about the bugs, I knew I liked bugs.  But I didn't even see bugs as science.  It was just something to, something to do.  So no, I had no idea that science was something I was interested in, in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were you a member of any clubs in high school, or--
Speaker 2: I probably was, but I don't remember, because I was into a little bit of everything.  But I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And with your notoriety in basketball, did you get any scholarship offers to college?
Speaker 2: I had some junior college offers, and that's why I actually went to one of them.  But they were mostly junior colleges.  So I went to, I ended up going to one in North Carolina.  Do you want me to tell you the name of it?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Chowan, C-H-O-W-A-N.
Speaker 1: C-H--
Speaker 2: C-H-O-W-A-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Chowan Junior College [Murfreesboro, North Carolina].  And they paid my tuition and helped me get a little job, and I was playing basketball for them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 27991
Speaker 1: So, when you were graduating from [Jackson P.] Burley High School [Charlottesville, Virginia], were there any important teachers, counselors, advisors, mentors, coaches, that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, we can backtrack a little bit, because I didn't graduate from Burley.
Speaker 1: That's right. (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (simultaneous)--because I was bussed off to Albemarle [High School, Charlottesville]--
Speaker 1: (simultaneous)--I'm sorry--
Speaker 2: (simultaneous)--that's okay--
Speaker 1: Albemarle--well, if you lived in--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) and--
Speaker 1: (simultaneous), well, you did Burley the first year, right?  And then your--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: The first two years.  I was at Burley for two years.  And then I went to tenth, eleventh and twelfth grade--I was at Albemarle, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I probably should have said your high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: Ironically, there was one teacher--and I'll tell you this story first, and by then maybe I'll remember her name.  But she was an English teacher.  And she tried, she played this reverse psychology game on me, you know.  She, I don't know if she did it on purpose, but it worked like that.  But she, she really tried to push me.  I thought--I was, I was a little lazier than I should have been, but, and she tried to encourage me to, she knew, she could see that I liked poetry.  And she wanted me to be a little bit more creative, and read a little bit more about people that were writing poetry.  But I took every shortcut I could take.  And she, I remember one day she said to me, along the lines of, "You're never going to be anything if you--"  I didn't hear the part about "if you do like this," but I heard her say, "You're never going to be anything."  And of course, that knocked you down at first, because this is an older person telling you this.  But then, you, if you have anything inside of you, you take it as a challenge.  And that's what I did, and I remember that.  And I, of course, I was angry at this person for a couple of years after I started junior college.  But then one day it dawned donned on me, that if she hadn't ever said that, I never would have pushed myself like I did.  So, I took it as--.  But I don't, maybe I give her too much credit.  I don't know if I should give her all that credit for being that smart, to purposely have done that.  But it worked out like that.  What is her name?  I can see her face, though.  She was kind of a thin, she was a thin older lady.  I'm sorry I can't think of her name right now, but she, she definitely made an impression on me.  I can see her, I can hear her words, and it stuck with me a long time later, because it gave me a drive that kind of defined who I am, helped define who I am now, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Do you understand me?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 27992
Speaker 1: Did you, at this time, by the time you were about ready to graduate [from Albemarle High School, Charlottesville, Virginia], were you getting feedback from your mother [Reva Louise Sampson Crenshaw] about, you know, her workplace [University of Virginia Hospital, Charlottesville] and about, you know, medicine and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Not so much.  I still didn't like--, I hated hospitals.  I couldn't stand the smell.  So, no, I didn't want to have anything to do with that place.  The only thing I got feedback from my mother from was that you should, you should try to keep your grades up so you can go to college.  And that was, she was hounding me with that.  My brother, older brother [Gregory Crenshaw], he had, he had dropped out of high school, but he was much more intelligent than I was.  He was just a whiz.  And he became, actually became a chess master.  But he didn't finish high school.  Yeah, he could just, he read books about chess, and he could just do it.  But he didn't finish high school.  So, because of that, she became really hard on me.
Speaker 1: Now, why did your brother drop out?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: The streets, in the streets.  He was, he preferred the bottle of wine and some hanging out with some guys in the streets than he did going to school.  But he didn't need to go to school.  He was, because he could, whenever we would force him--my mother would force him to get back in school when he had missed two weeks.  He would study for a day, take the test, and do okay on it, because he was smart, yeah.  But no, he never would take it all the way, yeah.  So, because of him though, my mom really put me in a box and said, "da da da da da da da."  And she hounded me.  And some days, I didn't like my mom too well, but now, of course, you could understand, yeah, what she was trying to do, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 27993
Speaker 1: You say you were more than just a good basketball--you were a top--a really good basketball player, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in that school [Albemarle High School, Charlottesville, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, that's not saying a whole lot.  I mean a small school, you know--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) --that there is a small like--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: --like A, the basketball, you know.  I know they rate them in different states.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Double A, Triple A, and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: But that's based on the population of the school.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And we were probably A or Double A, it wasn't that big.  We didn't have--, we didn't play the big competitive teams, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, that's why junior colleges are trying to recruit you, rather than the big schools.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got some letters from bigger schools, but it was small big schools.  It wasn't like, you know, universities and stuff like that, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was junior colleges, it's--yeah, uh huh.
Speaker 1: Alright, alright.  So when you were on the verge of graduation, what were your aspirations?  What did you think that you would be?  I mean--
Speaker 2: I didn't know.  And I didn't have a goal in mind.  My only goal was to go to college, because my mother [Reva Louise Sampson Crenshaw] told me, "You should go to college."  It wasn't like I sat there and said, "Oh, I'm going to be an engineer."  I had no idea.  I just went to college because my mother told me I should go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what kind of college counseling did you have at Albemarle [High School]?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I don't remember at all.  I know we did, they did have them.  They had what they called guidance counselors.  And that was their job.  And I remember, I remember some of the people who were that, but I don't remember what they talked to me about, yeah.
Speaker 1: It says something about the effectiveness of the counseling, I guess, (laughter) on some level.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know.  But I mean, you know, that's a few days ago.  It's funny what makes an impact on you, and what doesn't.  It's hard to predict that.  And I think psychological studies can't show that either.  I mean, some kids remember things for some reason.
Story_ID: 27994
Speaker 1: Okay, so, at Chowan Junior College in North Carolina--this is where in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: It's a little small town called Murfreesboro.
Speaker 1: Murfreesboro, oh, that's a famous Civil War town.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, not--
Speaker 2: There's another Murfreesboro, also.
Speaker 1: In Tennessee, yeah.
Speaker 2: In Tennessee, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Murfreesboro, okay.  Alright, so, you played, you were playing ball-
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: --and going to school.  Now, did you, now did science come up at Chowan?
Speaker 2: Uh huh, that's where it came up.  But that's--I went to school one year, and I played basketball.  And I was taking the, what we call general education requirements, with the thought that I would play for a couple of years and then I would try to go to another college and finish up, with absolutely no idea what to major in or anything.  A lot of my buddies were saying, "I'm playing sports, man, I'm going to play sports the whole way.  I'm just going to major in PE [physical education] just because I have to do something while I'm here."  But I didn't, I didn't like PE in that way, though.  So, I knew I needed something else.  But so, I went one year and I took the basic courses.  And I kind of did okay in biology.  As a matter of fact, I did well in biology, of course.  But then I had a girlfriend back home, and she had gotten pregnant.  And I had done it.  So, my mother [Reva Louise Sampson Crenshaw] kind of just talked, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, you can't have a kid being born like this," and blah, blah, blah.  So I decided to sit out a year and work.  So, my son was born, and then my mother started talking, "You know, if you don't go back to school now, you're never going to go back to school, you're never going to go back to school."  So, then I decided to go back to school.  (laughter)  So I left the girl and went back to school.  So I had a year gap in between that.  But then when I went back, here I'm a year older.  And back then, a year older is quite a bit.  You're, say, maybe you're twenty-one [years old] instead of twenty.  And then, by then, I kind of thought, what courses did I do well on in the first year?  And it was--I realized I had done well in biology.  And then I really took it to heart, that this is something I like, I enjoy doing.  So, when we did field experiments, when we'd go out and we'd collect water and stuff like that--and there was, you could see little bugs in the microscope.  Then it kind of started clicking on me, I like these bugs, and these are even smaller bugs I couldn't see before with my naked eye.  So that's when I really realized that I kind of like this biology stuff, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, just for the record, you graduated from high school in what year?
Speaker 2: 1970, yeah, 7-0, yeah.
Speaker 1: '70 [1970]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you go, you're at Chowan for a year, I guess--
Speaker 2: And then I laid off a year, and then I went back a year.  So, I finished there in 1973.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 27995
Speaker 1: But I did pretty well in Chowan [Junior College, Murfreesboro, North Carolina].  It's called Chowan.
Speaker 2: Chowan, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: And then I started getting combination academic and athletic grants and aides, and stuff like that.  So, you can call it a scholarship.  And I must have gotten about thirty of them from mostly small schools, but even some major universities.  But it was--, they were more interested in my academics than they were in my athletics.  So I said okay, I'll try to do something with these academics.  And I ended up enrolling in West Virginia University [Morgantown, West Virginia].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I was contacted there by the, by the Affirmative Action Office, or whatever you call it, yeah.  And there was a black couple there, that worked there, and they had been trying to recruit people, African Americans, to go to school there.  So anyhow, I went to school in West Virginia in 1973, and I finally finished in 1977.  I had sat out there a year or two because I worked, okay.  Some of that, I think, is in my report, because there I started--I didn't know, I didn't start off there being a science major.  I started off trying to do something with PE [physical education] and playing basketball, and so on.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, you didn't start off as a scientist at West Virginia?
Speaker 1: No, I went in and I, I had been given credit for two years.  And then I started more or less in junior year, but I--at West Virginia University.  But it ended up taking me--, I ended up being there four years anyway, because I was on and off.  But I was, started off playing--I walked onto their junior varsity basketball team, even though I was junior.  It wasn't the varsity, the big team that, you know, kids got scholarships.  It was--and that was more fun to me at that time, instead of hitting the books like I should have been, yeah.  So, my grades were just kind of, you know, so-so.  But after a couple of years I was trying to play basketball, and trying to do that more than regular school.  But eventually, I realized that I wanted to go to regular school, so I stopped playing basketball, and I finished.  And I think that story is in there a little bit, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So, are there any key figures in this story, teachers or coaches or anybody that--
Speaker 1: You mean during the whole time at West Virginia University?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Who--
Speaker 1: I almost didn't graduate.  And there was a guy there that helped me out.  It was hard for me to get out of school.  My grades had taken a serious dip.  And I needed to have a C in a course, and I was about to get a D, and he helped me out.  I don't remember his name, but he really helped me.  But that's at the point I realized that I need to--if I want to do anything with my life, I need to get my grades up, especially--And then I started thinking about medical school and stuff like that, yeah.   No, I don't remember any distinct names, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 27996
Speaker 1: And how was the University of West Virginia [West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia], in terms of--was there a significant black student population there?
Speaker 2: No, it was--was it 20,000 students there?  It was a big university.  And it may have been 200 blacks.  So, that was small back then.  But now, it's quite a bit more.  So we had a small group.  And we kind of stuck together, and we had a Black Student Union.  So, we used to do things like that.  And my, I actually met my--you never asked me about my wives, but you asked--I actually met my second wife there.  And she was very active in these black movements.  She was a cheerleader and--
Speaker 1: Now, okay.  Well, let's go back to--the first one is the one that you--it was the one that you--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --that had your son, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, when I was in junior college, that's right, uh huh.
Speaker 1: So, you all got married and everything?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we got married.  My mom [Reva Louise Sampson Crenshaw] said get married, so I got married, yeah.  And then she started telling me you can't stay married, you've got to go back to school.  So then I went back to school.  So, yeah, you listen to Mom.  (laughter)  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright.  So--
Speaker 2: But anyhow, my wife was the connector that I had.  And she was quite a sociable girl, so she had a lot of social friends.  So, we had a pretty strong black community back then.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, you had speakers come to campus, and things like that?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: Speakers would come to campus, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, but your second wife, she was really, really involved in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, she was the one that got me kind of involved in some of these things, yeah.
Story_ID: 27997
Speaker 1: So when you graduated from the University of West Virginia [West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia], you were thinking about, you know, what can I do to get myself in the position to go to medical school?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I got married on a Saturday, and then about on that Monday, I think I hopped on a plane on the way to San Diego [California].  I had some friends there, so I knew that it was a place that was, they had a lot of research going on in San Diego at the time.  And it was not easy, but with my background, I thought I could get a job there as a researcher.  And then I could get my grades up and then apply for medical school.
Speaker 1: So, this is 1977, right?
Speaker 2: It's 1977, exactly.
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, did your wife go with you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you went to California, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, okay.  So, you became a, it says here a staff research associate--
Speaker 2: Uh huh-
Speaker 1: --at the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's just a big name.  It just means a lab technician.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they call it that.  That was a way--that was a way they could pay you, because they had different steps within that, and it had something to do with the longevity, how long you were on the job, yeah.  But I, I became that in 1978.  I don't know if I wrote that down, because--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --I took a year to try to find a job.  And I, in the meantime I was selling vacuum cleaners and calling, telephone soliciting, and doing a little bit of everything--driving a cab.  I did a little bit of everything for about a year, yeah.
Story_ID: 27998
Speaker 1: Alright, 1978 at University of California, San Diego.  Now, as a lab assistant, I have a note here that you helped test and modify a method for measuring the fluid pressure between muscle fibers.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you want me to put that English for you, don't you?
Speaker 1: Well, that's pretty--(laughter)--okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's, usually, if you're a lab assistant, usually you're just doing things that other people tell you to do.  But the guy I worked for, he kind of gave me and another guy kind of responsibility, and let us kind of grow at our own pace.  So, he put me in charge of these, these probes, and he told me to test them to see if they could be used in a certain kind of way.  And his, his background, or his interest, was to look at what happens inside of a muscle.  Muscle is like spaghetti.  But in the middle of this spaghetti, you have a little river, a little stream, going through it.  And when that spaghetti grows, it squeezes on that fluid.  So, you need to measure those--that pressure, for certain conditions, certain clinical conditions.  So, he put me in charge of these methods that he had been using.  And he said, these are not good enough, so play around with it, and come up with an idea.  So I was able to create a technique using fiber optics, and so on and so forth, to do that.  And then I was able to write a paper.  He helped me write a paper.  So, as a lab assistant I was allowed to publish a paper, and that was kind of unheard of usually.  Usually, that's for graduate students, if you, you know, or for people that are doing post docs [post-doctoral research].  So, yeah.  I was able to develop that technique, and it helped me.  And what it did was--okay, all the time I'm trying, trying to get more experience so I can apply to medical school.  But what that did was, it kind of, it kind of wet my whistle a little bit about that kind of work.  So, I became interested in research.  And if I had not had had that opportunity, I probably would have still have tried to pursue medicine.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the paper--is this the title, 'A New Transducer-Tipped Fiber Optic Catheter for Measuring Intramuscular Pressure'?
Speaker 2: That's it. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, 1978.
Story_ID: 27999
Speaker 1: Now, who was your mentor?  Who was the mentor?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this guy, his name is [Alan] Hargens.  He's on that, do you see his name on the paper?  H-A-R-G-E-N-S.
Speaker 1: Yes, right, that's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He gave me that opportunity, and he, even today--last summer I met him in San Diego [California].  We're still good, really good friends, yeah.  But he became a really big shot scientist for NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration].  And so, he's, not only is a good friend, he has plenty of good connections, and he's just a bright guy, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he's from Minnesota, though, I guess.  I don't know too many people from Minnesota.  I guess people from Minnesota are pretty laid back, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, this is interesting.  Hargens is, sounds like a Swedish or Norwegian name, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I don't know, I know you end up working in Sweden for most of your life.
Speaker 2: That's pretty good of you, because he actually worked with a guy named Scholander.  And Scholander, he did some papers looking at penguins' feet and all kinds of stuff.  And the stuff that he did, this guy Scholander, was published in magazines, in journals like 'Science', and he actually was on 'National Geographic' and so on and so forth.  But Scholander was from over there.  And Alan [Hargens] became, hooked up with a girl from over there.  So, he married, ended up marrying a Danish woman, okay.  So, he, and if you're in Minnesota itself, I mean there's a lot of Swedes there, and a lot of Scandinavians.  So, it's not so unusual that his name is like it is.  And it's also not so unusual that his interest was connected to the Norwegian and the Danish, you know, so yeah.  But because of that, though--that was my later connection to Sweden, because he had collaborators from over there, and that's when we did the lab exchange switch that we talked about earlier.  But we can, we'll get to that I guess, soon enough, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Well, that's good.
Story_ID: 28000
Speaker 1: While at the University of [California,] San Diego, you're working on a master's [degree] right, I guess?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You're not?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You're just still working as--
Speaker 2: I was just a lab assistant, yeah.  And I was just getting my grades up and trying to figure out what to do.  But I was just working in the lab and just enjoying myself, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you also worked for the Veterans Administration Hospital [San Diego, California]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I started off working for a cardio-thoracic surgery research group, okay.  And what they did was, I mean, when you do heart surgery on someone, you have to put tubes in their heart, and you have to actually beat, beat, beat, beat for them.  You have to have an external machine that beats, and the heart has to be laying there still.  So, to keep a patient from dying, you're circulating the stuff.  But one problem, one complication that they had, is they were getting swelling in the muscle.  And I used, I was using this pressure thing to go into the muscle to see how much swelling and how much damage this could cause.  This guy [Alan] Hargens, he wasn't working, he didn't work for this cardio-thoracic group, he was just the collaborator.  He was actually working for an orthopedic group, okay.  The orthopedic group was located at the Veteran's Hospital in La Jolla [California].  So, that's how--and later--the first guy I worked for, his name was Dr. Peterson.  But because I met Alan Hargens through Dr. Peterson, I later became connected with him, and that's how I started working with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At the Veteran's Hospital.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Dr. Peterson was your initial supervisor, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was the initial guy, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And Hargens, you met him through--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Hargens became--
Speaker 2: Hargens became my mentor.  And he was the one that I actually, that gave me the kind of room to write the papers, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28001
Speaker 1: So, now, tell us about how you became a lab assistant in Sweden in this exchange program.
Speaker 2: I had started working on these pressure techniques [at the University of California, San Diego, under the mentorship of Alan Hargens].  And they were kind of curious about them over in Sweden.  So, instead of asking Alan to come over--Hargens to come over and do that--Alan told them that I was, I had become an expert with some of these pressure devices.  And they thought it would be a good idea to send one of their lab assistants over to San Diego, because she had some techniques that--I mean, this is how you do in science, you know.  You shift around expertise so you can learn about that.  So, and at the time I was ready to get out of San Diego.  I had just had a divorce from my second wife, so I thought, okay, this is a way to wash it out of my head.  And I knew it was only going to be for a short time.  So I left to go to Sweden in April of 1990--no, 1983.  And I stayed until the end of the year.  So, my idea was to take my pressure technique over there to a lab in Gothenburg [Sweden], and to do some stuff for them.  But when I got over there, they weren't, they weren't equipped for it.  So I ended up learning a totally another, another kind of technique.  I started looking at nerve regeneration.  And it was totally unrelated to stuff that I'm doing, but it was kind of fun, and I actually ended up co-authoring a paper.
Speaker 1: Okay, nerve regeneration.  Well, tell us about--well, before you do that, I just wanted to point out that the technique that you developed in the lab in San Diego--
Speaker 2: Uh huh?
Speaker 1: Now, would you consider this like a groundbreaking--this is something that hadn't been done before, right?
Speaker 2: They had, they have other techniques for measuring pressure.  But they have certain, they had certain flaws in them, and they had certain, what we call artifacts.  Like, if you put the other technique in the leg, if you move the leg, you get a pressure reading.  But the reading is due to the fact the leg moved, not to the actual measurement.  And this technique that I developed, you could move the leg any kind of way you want to, and you would not get those changes.  So, I wouldn't say it was, I'd invented a new technique.  I just modified a technique to make it better.  So, I wouldn't say groundbreaking, but I think, I think it was kind of useful, because then you could use it in other aspects.  If you have a patient laying on a bed, and you want to use the old technique, fine, because the patient is not going to move anyway.  This is just one example.  But if you want to look at athletics--you want to look at the pressure in their muscle while they're running or something, then this technique was much better.  And we actually did some work with people on treadmills, while they were running.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So if you want to get movement, data and movement, that's just an example of how this technique was better, that you could use this fiber optic technique.  So, it was an improvement on an existing idea that was worth publishing.  So, I wouldn't call it ground-breaking.  I would just say it just made things easier to work with.
Speaker 1: It advanced a few things.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of people still prefer to use the old technique, because it was a little bit smaller.  And if you know that your patient or the thing that you're measuring is not going to be jumping around and it doesn't do certain kind of movements or subjected to certain kind of, whatever--.  So, it didn't replace that technology completely, but it helped when you want to use it for other applications, yeah.
Story_ID: 28002
Speaker 1: So back in Sweden now--
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh huh.
Speaker 1: Now the nerve regeneration--
Speaker 2: Yeah?
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know how many people are going to see this, but we're very careful in my business of talking about animals, using animals in research.  So, I don't know, maybe we can, I don't know if you want to edit it out later or whatever.  But it's just the way that it is.  You have to in some cases use animals.  So, we used rabbits.  And we wanted to see--when a nerve is cut, a nerve is like a rubber band.  When it's cut or severed, like, if you get your spinal cord severed in a car accident, it pops like this [makes popping sound], and it goes every kind of way, like this.  And these don't grow back together, because they don't know where the other end is.  And they withdraw like this, okay.  So, while I was in Sweden we, we actually cut nerves on the animals on purpose.  And then we sutured the tips, quite a distance apart inside of a tube.  And then we gave them growth hormones, and we wanted to see if we could speed up how well they could re-connect, okay.  So, we used rabbits for that, and we cut it and we--I'm sorry--we used rats for that.  And we cut the nerve and we put a little tube in there and we gave them growth hormone, for example, to see if it could speed up the regeneration, and we were able to do that.  And the whole idea is that maybe we can help doctors repair these things, and we can give, we can see what kind of supplements, whether they're vitamins or whatever, can speed up their regeneration process.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what I did there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well, I mean today--I mean, has that advanced the nerve regeneration studies today in terms of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  It wasn't my work, though.  I mean, I worked with another group, and I was a co-author on the paper.  I wasn't the primary author.  It wasn't my primary research.  But I think today people are doing that.  They have, you know what carpal tunnel [syndrome] is here?  If you have something wrong with your medial nerve that's running through here--sometimes it gets cut.
Speaker 1: Tightness in it, right, from--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, you can get it like that, yeah.  That, those kind of things, those kind of--you can give growth hormones because it can make the nerve--sometimes you get a little, little frays in the nerves because they've been, they've been stretched so much.  And you can give growth hormones and it helps it grow back together.  So, there is some extension of that knowledge that's being applied.  But on a human level, it's very difficult to--I mean you can have a person that's in a car wreck and they've got a spinal cord that's broke [popping sound].  We know that the problem is the nerves can't find each other again.  So, they're doing other things to try to figure out ways that they can re-direct it.  Just to line it up, though, is enough to get it going.  If you don't line it up, you'll never find, you'll never walk again.  So, they know that.  So some of that research--it wasn't--that particular project was seeing how we could speed up that.  But some of that--some of those ideas came out earlier, from the guy that I was working with.  And he is, he's kind of gone down as a pioneer in this field, and orthopedic surgeons are taking in some of these ideas.  They've taken in some of these ideas for regeneration.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: His name is Goran Lundborg, L-U-N-D-B-O-R-G.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 28003
Speaker 1: Now, did you experience any kind of language barrier in Sweden when you were there working?  How did you deal with that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean they are so good at speaking English.  And as long as you stay within the academic community, you don't have to worry about it, because they would prefer to speak English.  I mean, English, you can speak in a lot of different countries.  But Swedish, you can only speak in Sweden.  No one understands you, except maybe the Norwegians and the Danish.  So therefore, it's not that popular of a language.  But, when I went there in 1983 just for that short period, I didn't even, I didn't even make an attempt.  I just spoke English, and I helped people with the language.  But when I went back, then I made an attempt, and I realized how difficult it was.  It took me about four or five years before I could give a lecture in Swedish.  So, it took me a long time.  But then I realized that it wasn't that--not only the language, it's also the person.  I'm not--so, I wasn't as good at the language as some people, who would come over there for two years, and they would pick it up.  But I was slow.  But now, it's okay.  But I mean it's just the nature of the beast, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, even on the student level, do the students there, you know, speak English pretty much?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they all do.  I mean, extremely--.  Even up north where I am, it's not a big metropolitan city, but there's 30,000 students.  And everybody--once you get in those walls of the academics, then you, yeah, I mean English is, you hear it everywhere.  And if you talk to someone in English, they speak to you back in English, yeah.
Speaker 1: It's almost like the way Latin used to be in the Middle Ages, that all the academics could speak Latin.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right, that's right.  But in Gothenburg [Sweden], even when you go out amongst the town folks, you could get by with English.  But up in Umea [Sweden]--for example, I end up marrying a Swedish girl.  And her mother, she doesn't speak English.  So, there's quite a few people up there that you--so you had to learn, you were forced, more forced to learn in a smaller town like that than you are in a bigger town.  But once you're in academics, it doesn't matter, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I just thought that was an important part of this.  So, did you meet the, your present wife, in Sweden on this trip, or did you, or was it--
Speaker 2: I met her--no, I met her in 1990.  You know, I was--maybe you know this, but I was in Sweden just for part of 1983.  Then I went back to San Diego [California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I worked there and then moved up to San Francisco [California], and hung out until 1990.  Then I went back, yeah.
Story_ID: 28004
Speaker 1: Okay, so in '84 [1984], you came back [to the United States, from Sweden].  Then you'd been working on the nerve regeneration?
Speaker 2: I had worked on the nerve regeneration in Sweden--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then I came back to San Diego [California].  And I continued with the research on pressure, and we actually worked on something called compartment syndrome.  We did a lot of work on that.  But they're intricately related.  Compartment syndrome and intramuscular pressure are very much related.  It's an orthopedic condition that you get.  You know what it is?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.  When you get too much swelling in the lower leg--here.  And in order to detect that, if the swelling goes up to a certain point, you have to have a surgical procedure, you have to.  Otherwise, you could end up losing your, your, your, the use of your foot.
Speaker 1: Now, this swelling in the lower leg--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: --you hear older people complain of this all the time.  Their ankle's swelling up, you know--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Does that have to do with diabetes exclusively, or is some other--
Speaker 2: That swelling you're talking about has to.  But the swelling I'm talking about has nothing to do with that.  It's in the actual muscle.  It's not in the joint.  You're talking about swelling in the joint.  This is in the muscle.  If you--you can have this kind of swelling in the muscle if you have trauma.  If you have a--take a baseball bat and you hit yourself on this leg.  You break some blood vessels, and it starts swelling like this.  And this compartment gets really, really tight.  And when it does, it will kill other vessels in there.  And then those vessels will spill over, and they will get more pressure and more pressure.  And so that's why it becomes a syndrome, because it feeds itself, okay.  So, what you need to do, be able to do, is to put something in there to measure how much pressure is in here.  That is what those little tubes and things that I have been working with--to be able to measure the pressure.  Once you have measured the pressure, if it's above a certain point, you have to go in and do what they call a fascia, a surgical procedure.  You have to cut the balloon from around the muscle so that muscle can go "aaah", okay.  So, when I went back to San Diego, I started working on these methods again, and worked, doing a lot of work, on compartment syndrome, trying to understand it better.  And we had a model of creating it, in a dog model, and then we could take different kinds of measuring devices and see which one was the best, okay.  So, we were trying to figure out how to best measure it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, alright.
Story_ID: 28005
Speaker 1: Now during this period of time [1984, while Crenshaw was in San Diego, California], now, are you thinking about getting back in school?  I mean it seemed like it would be the natural thing, the most natural thing in the world to consider.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  That was 1984, right?
Speaker 1: Uh huh.
Speaker 2: I think it took me another couple of years.  Okay, I'll tell you what happened.  In 1985, it's very common that if you're a Ph.D. and you have some good ideas and you have something that's unique, that people seek you, they come to you.  So, this guy, a guy I'm working for, [Alan] Hargens, he has this specialty in compartment syndrome and measuring pressures.  And I'm working as a part of his team.  And there was a guy that came to us in 1985 from Umea [Sweden], where I am now.  And he came to the lab as a post doc.  He had just finished his thesis, looking at DOMS, D-O-M-S, what we talked about earlier, delayed onset muscle soreness.  And when he came there, he came there with the idea that he understood what this DOMS was.  But he thought it had a pressure component, and he'd like to measure it.  So, he came and worked in the lab for one year.  And in 1985 I met this guy, and he was rather impressed by the fact that I was the one who was behind all of these pressure devices.  So, he thought that we could explain this muscle soreness by measuring the pressure in the muscle.  So, he asked me in 1985 to come back over to Sweden, bring that pressure technique, and let's do some experiments together.  And I said, "Why would I want to come to Sweden for, way up north where it's cold?"  And I said, "Absolutely not."  But he didn't give up.  That was 1985.  He kept bothering me--every year, every year.  And then finally in 1990, I decided, "Okay, I'll go over and try this for just a short time and see what happens."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 28006
Speaker 1: Now, we don't want to get you out of there too fast, because we have some questions.  Now, you worked also as a lab manager at [NASA; National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Ames Research Center [California] in '89 [1989]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's before you go to Sweden, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right before I went to Sweden.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that's connected.  That's 1989, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And it had something to do with NASA, right?
Speaker 2: That is NASA.  That is NASA.
Speaker 1: That is NASA, Ames is--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ames is the, is the Air Force Base--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that NASA's research was located on.  So, they called it--
Speaker 1: This is Moffett Field [California].
Speaker 2: So they called it--yeah, Moffett Field, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.  And there we were trying to help the astronauts design exercises so that they wouldn't lose their muscle when they go up in space.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, does this have something to do with how zero gravity affects muscles?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, you look like you look because you're walking around on Earth, okay.  Your head is the size that it is, and your legs are like they are, and so on and so forth.  We have what we call a pressure gradient in our body.  The heart is up here, and it's pumping blood throughout our body.  When the heart pumps blood down to your feet, it starts with one pressure, but it's higher down here.  And when you start, it goes up to the head because it's going uphill.  It's lower up here.  When you go up in space, the pressure equalizes throughout the whole body.  You have a pressure gradient that goes low to high, all the way up.  And that's why when you're in that gravity situation--but when you go up in space, things go crazy.  Everything is equalized.  You know what happens?  Your head and your face get big, like this, because they have a lot more pressure in them.  But your legs get small like this, because they have a lot less.  So, you get what they call bird legs.  So, the astronauts are very weak if they've been up there a long time.  They can't, they don't have muscle to be able to move around.  So, they need some kind of exercise to do that they can do in a non-, or a micro-gravity environment that can keep them going.  So, we tried to look at different kinds of contractions.  I mentioned to you earlier there's three kinds--isometric, eccentric and concentric.  So we focused on one of them, because it's a very effective way to keep muscle mass.  And that's the eccentric part of it.  So, yeah.
Speaker 1: What's the difference between these three?
Speaker 2: Okay.  It has to do with the direction that the muscle moves when it contracts, okay.  A muscle--if you take the muscle in my arm here.  If I wanted to contract it like this, to make a big bulge like this, you take--actually you're sliding muscle fibers beside each other.  So they are--they're like this.  But then when you slide them like this, they get a little bit bulgy like this, and so they become bigger.  And you see that, right?  If you keep that muscle contracted--and then if I was to take my, some kind of force, and I'm trying to stretch it out, that means that this muscle is being lengthened.  It starts to become longer while it's still contracted, okay.  The shortening of this is called concentric, because you're contracting towards the center.  When you're doing the other way, it's called eccentric, because it's moving away from the center.  When you do an isometric contraction, it doesn't move at all.  It's like if you are lifting a weight and you're just holding it, just holding it right there.  The muscle is not getting bigger or longer, it's just staying in the same place.  And there is some things that you do sometimes that are called static contractions, where the muscle is just--If I was to push on that wall and just hold myself as long as I could, then that's a static contraction.  If I hold my arm out like this, and just keep it there as long as I can, it will start shaking eventually.  But that's a static contraction, or isometric contraction.  So, those are the differences in those types of exercises.  We try to get the astronauts to use eccentric.  Eccentric builds more muscle mass.  And in a gym, they call it resistance exercise.  Resistance exercise is much more economical.  So, we tried to get the astronauts to do that up in space.
Story_ID: 28007
Speaker 1: So resistance exercise will be, what?  An example would be?
Speaker 2: That would be trying to keep the muscle contracted against the resistance.  So, if I'm trying to keep it contracted--If you're on a machine and you, you push, you're pulling up a lever and it has a motor.  And that motor is pulling you down while you're trying to keep it, you're resisting the direction of the motor.  So that is resistance exercise.  And when people lift weights--I tell you like this.  When people lift weights--a lot of times, if you're really going to do some weight-lifting and you're really going to get a workout economically, someone else will lift them up for you, and you will hold them while they're coming down.  Then they'll lift them again, and you hold them while they're coming down.  That is when you build muscle mass.  And the other way--if you're doing like this, you're pushing them up and you're using these back muscles to push them up.  But these muscles are becoming shorter.  But when these muscles are being lengthened while you are holding it, that is resistance exercise.  You're going against the resistance.  And in this case the resistance is gravity.  You don't have gravity up in space.  You have to be creative, yeah.
Speaker 1: There was a--on the back of comic books--I think, Joe Weider, a guy named Joe Weider, would advertise--
Speaker 2: Yeah?
Speaker 1: Dynamic tension, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as the, as the fastest way to build muscle power.  So he would, that was his technique, I think.
Speaker 2: Resistance exercise?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Kind of resistance--yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Charles Atlas, too.  I think that's what he suggested, you know.  He would like push one arm against another--
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and he didn't even use weights to get muscle mass.
Speaker 2: You know, but he was strong enough that he could push his own arm.  He could, yeah--
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: But most of us can't, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, yeah, that's--so there's something to that, the tension--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --being a mass muscle builder.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, is that what the astronauts actually did in space?  Would they push against something or pull against something?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Static?
Speaker 2: But because they don't have weights in space--now, what I've described to you now with this resistance exercise is mostly dependent on weights or some kind of machine.  And you couldn't take a big machine up there.  But one of the, actually one of the guys I worked with, he actually became an astronaut.  He became pretty prestigious, also.  But--
Speaker 1: Who is it?
Speaker 2: His name is Scott Parazynski.  But if we--if you want his name, I can give it to you, because I have his name on some of my--. We co-authored some papers together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, what he did, and what we did together, was we developed a thing like an ergocycle.  You would push with one leg, and the other leg has to resist against it when you're pushing.  So it's like a bike that you could use.  Because as you're exercising concentrically with one leg, you have to resist it by using the eccentric part of it on the other leg.  You follow me?  So, they, we use this.  But in this bike you don't need to have gravity for that.  So that was one of the things that we did.  We tested them in the lab, and we tried to do measurements with electromyography and stuff like that.  So, it was more to see how the muscle is behaving, and is it okay?  And then we could recommend it for the shuttle and so on and so forth, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, this is the work you did just before you went to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Sweden?
Speaker 2: I started doing that work right before, and I, we did a couple of--we did three projects, actually that we had papers.  And I, we published those.
Story_ID: 28008
Speaker 1: So, when you went to Sweden in 1990 [to Umea University]--now, you're going there, and you're going to be going to graduate school, too, or?
Speaker 2: I went there to do a research project.  I went there to help this guy out, because he needed to measure pressure, because he thought that was the reason that people get this delayed [onset] muscle soreness [DOMS].  So, I went there to help him measure pressure.  When I got there, they had a way of paying me as a project person.  But they paid me through funds that were designed for a Ph.D. student.  So, I was a disguised Ph.D. student.  But then after we started doing some research projects, we looked at how--what is required of the Ph.D. there?   And I didn't have to do any class work because I had gotten credit for a lot of the papers I already published.  And he said, "If you publish a couple more papers here, you can get a Ph.D."  So, I said, "Wow, what a deal."  I had only expected to stay there a couple of years and I was going to go back to NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], because I had a really good position there.  But I said "Okay, how long will it take?"  "Well, maybe three years," he said, "to do all of this."  So I said, "Okay, we can try this, anyway.  But if I get tired or get bored, I'm out of here."  But then in the meantime I met a woman.  So, I mean, one thing led to another.  And then I think in 1994, I had finished my thesis before--well, before that--but I waited until 1994 for me to defend my thesis.  So, I did my thesis in 1994.  But then because I had met a woman earlier, I decided to stay for a little while.  And that was twenty-three years ago.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I thought something like that might have happened.
Speaker 2: (laughter)
Speaker 1: That was when I was reading the [research] outline.  I said he probably got married over there or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did, I did.  I met a, yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 28009
Speaker 1: So, the Ph.D. was on DOMS--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: --the delayed onset muscle soreness.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your dissertation [titled, 'Intramuscular Pressure Techniques for Studying Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness'].
Speaker 2: We, we wanted to answer or address a question.  And the question was, do people with delayed onset muscle soreness [DOMS], do they have high pressure in their muscle?  It's a very simple question, it's a very straight-forward question.  But, if you're going to do that as a Ph.D. [degree] work, or some kind of experimental work, there's a lot of things to think about.  So the first thing you have to do is you have to make sure you have a good model to create this soreness, okay.  And because I had worked with this eccentric [muscle contraction] exercise--it took me a year to play around with different kinds of activity for these, for the thigh muscles, that I could do.  And then I had to design an experiment where I could make sure that--. What we did was, I had one--I had people using the left leg and the right leg as different--to do different things with.  So, I had some people doing--if I kick up like this, this muscle on top is shortening.  But if I try to keep it straight, it kind of, it's being lengthened while it's shortening.  So, I did eccentric exercise on one and concentric on the other one.  I took biopsies, muscle biopsies.  I looked at it under the microscope, and at the same time I put probes in there and I measured the pressure, to address that question.  So, basically what I did was I wanted to see if pressure was a component of delayed muscle soreness.  And the answer was no.  But people have been--every time you read a paper people say, "Well, it's probably because the pressure is higher there, and we need someone to do these measurements."  So, I had--my thesis was a negative finding.  But nonetheless it was an important finding, because I had addressed that question in a very scientific approach, and I had found out that the answer was no, so it must be something else.  But we still don't know why you have the pain, but we know what it's not, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, this is important in science, to find out that something is not what you--
Speaker 2: That's right.  It's important, especially if the general consensus is always that a lot of people are saying that it could, it must be that.  So, therefore, it was popular to study it, because there was maybe 25, 30 other papers that every time they write, they discuss it-- "Ah ha, because the pressure in there was too high."  But now they, they had to stop saying that.  They couldn't say what it is, but they could say what it wasn't.
Speaker 1: So, they've actually pretty much stopped saying that now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They know that it's not due to high pressure, yeah, because of my thesis work, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, it was definitive in that sense then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, but we still don't know what it's due--
Speaker 2: No.  Well, someone else can--someone else can do that.  I did my part, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, this is 1994--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: The Ph.D. in physiology and anatomy from the University of--and you pronounce it, Umea?
Speaker 2: "Ooh-mee-oh."
Speaker 1: "Ooh-mee-oh?"
Speaker 2: "Oh." It's an 'a' with a circle on top.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it's, the 'a' becomes an 'o'.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: "Ooh-mee-oh", yeah.
Speaker 1: "Ooh-mee-oh" in Sweden.  This is northern Sweden, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's quite--it's way up there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is the land of midnight sun, right?
Speaker 2: (laughter)  You got that right.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Story_ID: 28010
Speaker 1: So, you could have come back [to the United States after earning his Ph.D. degree at Umea University, Sweden in 1994]  but you--
Speaker 2: I had my wife there.  And I wasn't so crazy about the town, and I wasn't so crazy about all that snow.  But I mean, I had my wife.  And one month after I finished my thesis, my daughter was born.  So, my wife was not only there, she was pregnant.  So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us about, you know, life in Sweden for an African American.  I mean, were there other African Americans there at all, or--because I, we've heard different things about it.
Speaker 2: It depends on where you are in Sweden.  Down around Stockholm and Gothenburg, your bigger cities, there's, I wouldn't say a big community, but there is a community.  But up where I live, there are days when I probably, and I'm not exaggerating, that I'm probably 100 percent of the African American population.  But there are students that sometimes pop through.  And you see them and you look at them, you know, because there are, there's quite a few Africans.  But if you've been there long enough, you can tell the difference.  There's something, you know, that kind of sticks out.  So, every now and then, you'll see someone in the student hall or somewhere, or walking on campus.  And you look, and you look, and you just go up and you ask them.  "Where are you from?"  "I'm from Georgia."  And then you kind of like say, "Wow, okay, you know, we've got a connection."  But it doesn't--as far as living there--there was another guy there from New York.  But he, like most people, they, he moved south.  He moved out to Stockholm to a bigger city, yeah.  So, it's a hard place to live, because of the weather, and because the people up there are very, very reserved.  And they kind of, they kind of adapt to the weather.  When the weather's cold, they're more reserved.  When it's warmer, they get to be a little bit more active.  Sweden is a very expensive place.  It's basically a socialist, socialistic society.  That means that everybody takes care of everybody else.  And that means that when you work, it's not so uncommon to get 50, 60 percent of your salary taken by the government, okay.  So no one gets rich, but no one gets poor, either.  But then you, if you're there long enough, I think you can start looking at this in another way.  Because my kids, for example.  They were born there.  Their education is paid for, because they're born in Sweden.  My wife, when my daughters were born, she was off, given off work for a year with 90 percent of her salary, okay.  But all that money comes from a pot of money that you build up by the tax system, that the government can afford to pay these things.  You go out and you eat dinner.  It may cost me maybe $85 for a steak or something like that.  So, I don't do that often, okay.  So we don't do that, any luxuries like that.  But if my kids, if they get any kind of injury or anything, we run to the hospital, we get the best care.  It's free, fairly free, you know what I mean.  So, that's, that's one thing about Sweden.  I mean, extreme weather.  People are kind of more reserved than what we're used to.  Where I live is the midnight sun, and things are expensive--highly educated people, because there are free universities.  They are, they're really at the forefront of some physiology and some science ideas, yeah.  And they're very, extremely high technical.  We have a much higher technical level in Sweden than they do in the States.  Everybody has computers that are the latest, the fastest.  And my daughters, they are so gifted with connecting things.  And so it's--yeah.  So that's Sweden, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 28011
Speaker 1: I can tell you one more thing about Sweden, and this is in general.  About 66 percent of the land is uninhabited.  It's forest.  It's a big, long country, like California.  But it's only about eight, nine, million people that live in the whole country.  And California is about the size.  California has 20 million.  And Japan, for example, it's about the same as Sweden.  But Japan is 80 million.  So, you can understand that there's a lot of unpopulated areas, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they have reindeer, yeah.
Speaker 2: Reindeer, too?
Speaker 1: (laughter)  You got to be careful when you're out driving in the country, yeah. (laughter).
Speaker 2: This is like, Lapland [a cultural region in Sweden and Finland]?  Where is Lapland?  Is that--
Speaker 1: It's a little bit further north, yeah.
Speaker 2: Further north--
Speaker 1: That is Lapland, that is--yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, northern Sweden?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And they are actually the reindeer herders.  Yeah, and you get, you drive snowmobiles--so snowmobiles, yeah.  And you drive--you ski.  Some people ski from door to door, yeah.  And that's the way of life.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, you settled into it pretty much?
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm this kind of guy.  I don't like snow, but if I'm going to be there, I might as well learn to play with it.  So, I mean I have learned to deal with it.  I don't like shoveling snow, though.  We have a, we built a house and we have built a four-car driveway.  I don't know why, because no one has more than one car in Sweden, because you can't afford the gas.  But, that means that every time it snows we have to shovel that damn thing.  So this becomes really, really stupid.  But it looks nice in the summertime, yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, how long does summer last in Sweden?
Speaker 1: When I left, it was snow on the ground.  And I when I come back, it will be snow on the ground.  The snow, we'll probably see the ground again--we haven't seen it since probably late November--so, we'll probably see the ground again in, about mid-May.  But it'll still be cold in the air.  So, summer will probably come the first week of June.  And then by the end of July, it'll be--yeah, that's it.  So, probably a couple of months.
Speaker 2: So, two months of summer?
Speaker 1: Two months of summer, yeah.  Yeah, I mean a real summer like we know summer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean, it's more months that we don't have the snow.  So, but that ain't the same thing because at night it gets--it can be freezing, yeah, even though it's not snow yet, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And you want to know why I'm still there, right?
Speaker 2: Well, I--
Speaker 1: (laughter).
Speaker 2: --you know, you got family now and everything, so--.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 28012
Speaker 1: Has your mother [Reve Louisa Sampson Crenshaw] ever come over to visit [Sweden]?
Speaker 2: When I did my thesis in 1994, she, my youngest brother [Todd] and my sister [Reta], they came over.
Speaker 1: And how did they like it?
Speaker 2: My mother, you know, she's a southern Virginia woman, you know.  She just kept saying, "These people are sure quiet.  It sure is clean over here."  She just kept saying that over and over again. (laughter)  Yeah, she thought it was--and she came the--my thesis was done on the 30th of September.  And the day after that, she left. They left about three or four days later.  But the day after that, it snowed.  And I remember that.  And she couldn't get over it.  "This is the 1st of October, and it's snowing already."  You know, so she--yeah.  But I couldn't get her to come back.  She's a little bit too old now.  She has a little bit of arthritis.  But, yeah, but it was fun having her over there.  My brother's been back two other times, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Story_ID: 28013
Speaker 1: Alright.  In 1994, you finished your Ph.D. and, so you began to teach at the University of Umea [Sweden].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I don't know if I ever can be classified as a teacher, in the sense of a classroom lecturer.  But I, we had this system over in Sweden.  I have had several Ph.D. students.  So, of course, I'm teaching them.  But that's more in, they have it more like an occupation.  They have a project, and they do, and then they--so, it's more like mentoring or supervising.  I don't--I lecture, of course, but I don't do study lectures.  So, I began to work as a researcher when I finished in 1994.  But I did what I call sort of a post doc [postdoctoral training] for a couple of years.  I was working a little bit in Umea and also quite a bit more in Gothenburg [Sweden].  So, I was taking the train and going down to Gothenburg.  Between 1994 and 1996, I was doing somewhat of a post doc, working as a research scientist at both places, in Gothenburg and in Umea.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  What were you working on, you know, during this period?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it had also to do with--and when I did my thesis, there was two methodologies that I put together.  One of those is morphology.  Do you know what that is?
Speaker 1: Studying of shapes of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in this particular case it was the structure of the muscle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And to look at it through high powered microscopes, and to see, "Oh, oh, there's something wrong there, there's something wrong."  And to be able to recognize what's out of place and not.  And then the other thing I did was also continuing with this [muscle] pressure stuff.  So, the guy in Gothenburg was interested in pressure.  And the work I was doing at Umea still, was to continue with the morphology, the muscle structure stuff.  So, when you do your thesis, usually you--if you're doing like we do in Umea and other places, you generate a lot of research data.  And then you, in Sweden you're required to publish some of that data.  So, I published half of that data.  But then I had the other half of that data left.  So they hired me to work on the other half of that data.  And that's what I did at the anatomy department.  But I did a new project in Gothenburg.  I was--but a guy down there was one of my, also, very good friends that worked with pressure.  So, I was using those, still working on those same methods, but in different places.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 28014
Speaker 1: Now, I have a question here about you describing for us a day in your life as a scientist.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You get up early.  I mean it's--I like to get to my, I have an office.  I have a dual computer screen and I have all of the, a nice table in there that we can have meetings at.  So, but, we are always--I have, right now I have one, two, three, four--off the top of my head I can say--five papers in the pipeline that I'm working on with other people.  So, I like to get to the office really early, before the other people come in.  We have a kind of a big group.  There's secretaries and there's technicians and there's Ph.D. students, and so on.  And I like to spend an hour on my own.  So, I usually get in there early, and I try to answer e-mails and I do any kind of web searching I need for papers.  And I also try to communicate to my co-authors on those papers that we're writing.  So, I try to do that early in the morning.  And then, you know, I'm in the process now also of building up a lab.  I'm trying to build up a pipetting station. Do you know what pipetting is?
Speaker 1: (Inaudible)
Speaker 2: Okay.  Pipetting is when you take little amounts of fluid from here and you put it in some kind of tubes.  It's what people do when they're working in a lab somewhere.  It's quite proficient in the pharmacy in--. But those people who do pipetting, they get a lot of pain in different places.  So we're trying to build up a simulated pipetting station in our laboratory.  So we're trying to put together--we're trying to make it like, like you come into our lab, like you would be at your own workstation.  So, we're building that up.  And I'm trying to, I have a team of people that are working with me.  There are carpenters, there's engineers, there's a master's student, and myself.  And we're trying to put it together.  So, I have spent a lot of time on that right now.  I have students on the undergraduate level that are doing--writing projects.  And so, I have to communicate with them during the course of a day, too.  There's almost always some paper that you need to read to enhance your own knowledge, or you read it for-, to give comments to someone else.  A lot of times you're reading a paper, and you're not a co-author, but you're just helping a friend out.  We're also required to give feedback to journals.  A journal will take a paper in, and they will want someone to read that paper, and say, give us your comments back to see if this person is worth publishing.  So, there's a lot of journal review that we, that we're expected to do.  We get paid nothing for that.  But when you send your papers away, you want someone to review them.  So, there's a lot of paperwork that I'm doing now.  And we also have experiments going on right now.  I'm looking at older women and younger women.  I want to see why older women, if they get more of a condition called low frequency fatigue than younger women.  And I can explain that to you later.  But the point is that we have an active, very active experiment where we have to, we take twelve younger women and we take twelve older women and we compare their results.  But we have to do all kinds of different things to them.  Okay?  So, we do experiments.  We're doing a lot of--if I'm in the lab--I try not to be in there too much because I have other people that can do stuff in the lab for me while I'm doing some kind of paperwork and stuff like that.  But I like being in the lab, though, yeah.  Okay?
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your day starts early and--
Speaker 2: It starts early.  And usually when you go home at night, there's still some e-mails and stuff like that you can do.  I try not to, because I mean everyday there's thirty-five papers on your desk that you should read to enhance your knowledge.  And if you miss a day, the next day it's seventy papers.  So, it's overwhelming.  So, it's always something to read.  So you have to force yourself not to.  So, but usually when I go home, if I haven't had a chance to finish my e-mails during the day, I try to do them at night, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, it's a long day.
Speaker 2: It can be even longer if I want it to be, but I try not to, yeah.  But they are long days, and I try to--when I walk in the house at six o' clock or something like that--I get there at seven [o'clock] , and maybe I get home by six.  I try not to do anything, but occasionally there are some e-mails that you have to, have to answer, yeah.
Story_ID: 28015
Speaker 1: Now at the University of Umea [Sweden], student population I guess is overwhelmingly Swedish, right?  But--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is.
Speaker 1: --are there students from other--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  They have an international office, and they encourage international exchange and students from the [United] States.  Occasionally, you'll see an African American girl.  I don't know if they have them as--to go the full student route, four years.  But they have certain sections of courses that they have students there from, yeah.  But there's quite a bit of Africans, and there's quite a bit of Iraqi people and Chinese people.  So, they are, they are--they have a little bit, a little bit, quite a few of them, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28016
Speaker 1: Now in '99 [1999], you were working on the causes of human occupational muscular skeletal problems.  Is this, especially in the shoulder joint, this is similar to what you're doing with carpal tunnel [syndrome], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a type of, it's a result of doing work.  You get problems in your wrist, carpal tunnel, from sitting at a computer.  And you get problems in carpal tunnel primarily because of the angle of your wrist while you're using the computer.  Some people, some ergonomists out in California, they recommend that your wrist is like this, extended.  Because then it's open.  But if you're compressing your nerve and you're doing like this, then you're putting a lot of pressure on there, yeah.  And people don't realize that.  But you know what causes that, and you know how to treat it, and you can fix it.  But the stuff that I'm studying, we don't know what causes it.  You get pain here in the muscle, right here.  This is called the trapezius muscle.  So, I have spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out what causes that pain.  I've also tried to figure out how come a man and a woman can sit right beside each other, but a woman has twice as much chance of getting that pain than men.  So, what I have done is I've taken all of these techniques that I worked with over the year, and tried to use them in a way to look at the physiology--whether it's the oxygenation, whether it's intramuscular pressure, or whether it's the morphology that I talked about earlier.  And I even have some other techniques.  So, I'm using my techniques to try to understand the mechanism of why we would get pain from sitting in front of a computer.  And I have to, you have to use your creativity and fantasy, because you will try to simulate that in a laboratory.  A person who's sitting there typing for four hours--and you have to give them something to type.  And you have to do measurements all the time, and see that this happens on a woman but this doesn't happen on a man.  Maybe that's the reason.  So, that's what we try to do.  So I've been working with trying to figure out the mechanism behind work-related muscular skeletal disorders for quite some time, yeah.
Speaker 1: This seems to be a common pain or common syndrome.  Now, I've never had it myself, but I've always wondered what people are talking about.  You know, the first thing that tired people do--this when--they rub their shoulders like that, and rub this muscle here.  It gets--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think we have a tendency to do it. There's a lot of biofeedback.  And what that is--you can put this electricity that I told you about earlier--the electromyography, the myoelectric signals.  You can put electrodes, you can put little pads on the muscle here.  And you can have a recording, and it can see--. And when you do the muscle like this, the needle goes up like that.  And if you put a sound alarm on there, that needle goes, "dit, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit."  So, there's a lot of people now that's sitting in front of--.  We think that if you do like this all day because you're stressed, and you have your shoulders up like that, eventually something's going to happen and you're going to get pain.  So, if you're able to discipline yourself to the point that you can sit up straight and you can sit relaxed, you won't get the pain.  So, there's a lot of people that's sitting with these biofeedback systems where you put the electrodes on,  you have a little monitor on top of your computer screen.  And when you do like this too much, "dit, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit," you're relaxed.  So, eventually, it's almost like some kind of behavioral therapy.  Because eventually you learn not to do that, you know.
Story_ID: 28017
Speaker 1: Does your research impact the ergonomic furniture industry--
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely.
Speaker 1: --of which Scandinavia, is--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --the leader, I guess?
Speaker 2: Uh huh, definitely.  I'm working now with a guy who's a vision, vision specialist.  And if you have bad--when we talk about ergonomics, you talk about how you're sitting, but you also talk about the lighting.  You talk about the blur on the screen.  And we are trying to get people to--we can--first of all, we can give them uncomfortable chairs.  And we can see how that can affect their physiology in this muscle.  That's where my specialty comes in.  But we can also put on different glasses to make it more blurred or less blurred.  And we can change the lighting, and we want to see how that affects the physiology in the muscle.  So, it's not just the chair when you talk about ergonomics.  It's also, ergonomics mean how do you interact with your environment.  So, it's also the lighting and everything.  So, yeah, we are very much tuned into how you sit, and so on and so forth--how high the table is.  And we in Sweden, almost everybody now has tables that elevate.  When I get, when I've been sitting, they don't want you to sit too long.  The rule of thumb is after fifty-five minutes, you should get up and do something.  But you can also be effective if you--I come into my office, some days I don't want to sit.  I press the button and table goes up, and I'm standing up for working.  So we stand up and work sometimes.  Because it's the sitting that we think that can cause the shoulders to do something that's not good for them, and eventually they can be in pain, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So can you summarize, you know, some of your work with other muscular skeletal disorders and--
Speaker 2: I think that term, muscular skeletal disorders, in my context, it simply means related to work.  Muscular skeletal disorders in a bigger sense can mean any kind of pain in the muscle, or damage in the muscle.  But I don't work so much with those.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think, so I think we can just leave it at the work related muscular skeletal disorders.  But we usually abbreviate it as muscular skeletal disorders, but we mean just related to work, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I worked for a couple of years without a, trying to use a mouse without, on a desk.  That gave me no place to rest my elbow.  And I was getting pain in my arm, but I didn't relate the two of them until one day I finally felt it, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But it was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  A couple of my papers are looking into mouse work, and looking at this particular muscle here.  This is an extensor muscle, extends the wrist, like this.  So, we have done some, we've actually had people do what they call time pressure.  If you--you're using a mouse to do a task like this.  And then you got to hurry up, because the time is going like this.  And we actually have had some interesting physiological measurements there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28018
Speaker 1: Now, in 2000 you were appointed associate professor at the Center for Muscular Skeletal Research at the University of [Umea], is it--oh, you gave me the pronunciation--
Speaker 2: Umea  [ooh-mee-oh].
Speaker 1: Umea, [ooh-mee-oh], okay, right.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: --in Sweden.  And at the same time--we were saying off-camera that you had some training in science education?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: And ironically--
Speaker 2: About that time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, ironically, today on 'CBS Sunday Morning' Alan Alda discussed this very topic, how to explain science to people who don't--so that other people will understand what scientists are saying.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And this can be very important in terms of getting funding.  Because if people don't know if you're doing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or are baffled by it, they're not likely to give money to it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, talk about that.
Speaker 2: I think it's a big problem.  Because it's easy to close your door and get so absorbed by your work that you lose, you lose context with how much other people don't know.  And then you end up, what we call, you end up speaking this kind of jargon that's, that's so removed from other people.  And I think in my group, this was recognized when I started working for the National Institute of Working Life, and this was about 1997 when we started.  But then I became an associate professor in 2000, and it was just a coincidence.  Because then about that time, it was the bosses, so the management, that we had at that time.  They realized the need for us to be more interactive with TV and radio and newspapers.  And therefore, to do that, we had to be able to talk popularly about what we do.  We had politicians we talked to.  We went to schools and we talked sometimes to kids.  So, for that reason we were trained in that.  So, and I think it's a shame that more--there's a couple of things I think is missing in scientists, in science, though.  I think there's not enough emphasis put on how to write.  And there's not enough emphasis put on how to explain your work.  If you can explain your work on a level that is popularized, then you should--that means, that's a sign that you really know your work, okay, instead of speaking this scientific language.  So, I kind of agree with Alan Alda, that's a problem.  But just to emphasize that, I mean that's how we, that's how things happen.  They change.  They emphasize that in the curriculum of these Ph.D. trainees, that they are forced more to take these kind of things, yeah.  Nowadays, I guess it's established scientists, too.  They should be more--go to workshops and stuff like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they actually, I mean they--now the training that you had was sponsored by the university, or by--
Speaker 2: It was just by our group.
Speaker 1: By just your [research] group?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because the stuff we would--people were interested in what we were doing--the public, the general public.  So, therefore we were required, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Story_ID: 28019
Speaker 1: What did you do during the decade of the 2000s, in terms of research?
Speaker 2: It was mostly looking for the mechanisms for this work-related pain ideas, and designing experiments to test that.  But I picked up another method, a very interesting method.  And that method is called microdialysis.  And what that is, you put a tube in the muscle and it simulates the capillaries.  And we published a few papers during the 2000s, the early--well, the first decade of the 2000s--using that method to look to see what kind of substances there are that accumulate in the muscle when you're doing this kind of low level work, like computer work or assembly line work, yeah.  So, but it was, I was just, I continued in that line of looking for the mechanisms.
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever discover why females get this pain in the trapezoid muscle more than men?
Speaker 2: No.  We haven't, not conclusively.  We don't know that.  But if you talk to enough people, they claim that--okay, one theory that we're following right now--and we have, I have some data on it actually that I'm going to present here.  But one part of that data is missing.  And what we think is that how a woman perceives stress is different than how a man perceives stress, along with some other things.  So therefore, if a woman becomes stressed, it affects the local circulation in a muscle that is being used in a different way than if a man is perceiving stress.  Women have a lot more psycho-social stress pressure on them than men do.  They take in things more.  They're more worried about the kids.  They're more worried about what they're going to have for dinner, and so on and so forth.  So, we have designed an experiment to look at--like, you're taking a can of beans and you're putting it down, like this.  So, we have men doing it, and we have women doing it.  And then we have a computer screen sitting in front of you.  And then you have to solve these mathematical equations sometimes.  So, we have men doing that, and women doing that.  So, we put in a tube.  We have sampled the fluid here.  And I can't wait to get back, because I want to see what the fluid is.  So, to answer your question, no, we don't know yet.  But we have taken it one step further.  We think that women are more influenced by stress than men are.  And if a woman is stressed and she sees it, we think she tenses up and she wants to more hurry up.  Where a man takes his time.  We have some data on this measuring the electrical activity on the poster that I have here.  But we don't have the other stuff, but we're looking at the substances that accumulate.  So, no, we don't know yet.  But we have--it is--say, a popular idea now has kind of encouraged how we are designing experiments, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, you also studied the effects of repetitive low intensity work.  Well, that's what you just discussed, right?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: That's what you just discussed, actually.  And well, you know, so this the balance of what you did for the, until--. Well, your recent work has really been about, as we were saying before we started, about oxygenation in the muscle?
Speaker 2: Oxygenation in the muscle, yeah.  And it's just, you know, it's the same idea.  We're looking at low level repetitive work.  You brought up that term, so I can use it now, right?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And that means that you're doing something the same way all the time.  It's repetitive, and it's not a heavy load.  It's not heavy, it's very, very low.  And that's what I like.  That's what I, my, that's where the challenge comes in.  Okay, you can stick on the methods that you had back in the '90s [1990s], and you can find information.  Or, you can try--you can say okay, it's not because you have different kinds of pressure that can be measured with a fiber-optic thing.  Or, you can look for new methods based on--. If you take a biopsy, you can say look, there's something wrong with the circulation here.  Maybe we should measure the oxygenation.  So, then you get new ideas.  So now we're looking at the same old question, but with newer methods.  So, now we, I'm using this oxygenation method quite extensively, yeah, to look at.  I  think that there's something in there.  Because if you look at the biopsies, there's indication that there's a problem with blood flow in these people who have this work-related pain.  But they can't measure differences in blood flow.  But I don't think it's a problem in blood flow.  I think it's a problem with the oxygenation, how the muscle uses oxygen and how oxygen is replenished, and so on and so forth.  If you have don't have blood flow, you won't get oxygen.  But you can have plenty of blood flow, but if the muscles don't use the oxygen then you've still got a problem.  Do you follow me?  Yeah, so I think it's how the oxygenation is, not so much the blood flow, yeah.
Story_ID: 28020
Speaker 1: Now, can you explain again for those who are watching this, about the technique called infrared spectroscopy?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's a, it's become a more or less common method for measuring [muscle] oxygenation.  And you shine the light down into the muscle.  And it--, some of that light will be scattered or reflected from the muscle, and will come back.  You have a tube, you have a probe that's, I guess it's about two inches long.  And on the probe, on one end of the probe there's a light that goes down.  On the other end of the probe is a receiver.  So, the light is going down into the muscle.  And what's coming back, it tells you what the hemoglobin looks like in the muscle.  The hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying molecules.  So, if they, if they are coming into this field of view, and they're leaving oxygen, then you can see those changes by using this method.  This method is called near infrared spectroscopy because it's on the spectrum of--the light that's going in there is near the spectrum of the infrared, okay.  And without going into a big spiel about how light spectrum works, there are certain wavelengths of light that go into the muscle that are, that give you information about hemoglobin with oxygen and hemoglobin without oxygen, okay.  So, it's just a way of measuring oxygen.  But it's, it's becoming a very common tool for looking at muscle oxygenation and brain oxygenation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're also exploring myoelectric activity with something called an EMG, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  EMG stands for electromyography.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When the muscle does some kind of activity, it gets a signal from the brain.  And you can actually measure that activity.  If you want a muscle to do a small thing, you give it a little bit of activity.  And you measure--you look on the scale, or look on some device, and you see a little bit of activity.  If you want to try to lift up an elephant, you can't do it, but you're going to use a whole lot of your muscle.  Then you're going to see a lot of activity.  So, it's a way to tell you about how much, how active that muscle is.  So, we can see how active it is.  We can see how it's using oxygen.  And those two bits of information, we put them together always.  We use those two methods always because we want to appreciate what the muscle is doing.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 28021
Speaker 1: I'm still interested in these gender, sex differences.  It depends on who you ask, whether you should use the word gender or sex nowadays.  And so, why do women have this problem [pain in the trapezius muscle] and men don't?  So, I'm using my methods.  I'm continuing to use my methods in more clever ways.  I use the same methods, but you just change the mode that you're looking at.  There are some other interests that I have.  For example, I'm working with an orthopedic surgeon in Umea [Sweden], and he is looking at diabetics who get muscle pain in their lower leg.  And we're using, we're looking at the oxygenation, there because diabetics have problems with circulation.  And we're also looking the intramuscular pressure in the lower leg of diabetics.  And it's kind of a new idea, because people haven't really focused that--isolated that group before, yeah.
Story_ID: 28022
Speaker 1: Alright.  When you look back at everything you've done to this point in science, what today would you consider to be your scientific legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I think--in fact, I have always been a, I always had a strong interest in methodologies.  So, if I could maybe kind of coin-phrase it or something, I would say a person who would try to find out as much about muscles without causing much pain.  So, I would think, alternative ways of looking at what they're doing now.  So, my legacy would be to, would have been, to develop existing ideas to further--to make them more applicable and to get out more information, but also to make them less harmful.  So, I think that that would be my legacy, with muscle and focus, of course, yeah.  Understanding a muscle much better, by, not necessarily taking a shortcut, but by finding another way so you can do it more--. For example, this method I'm talking about, oxygenation.  You attach something to the skin.  You don't go into the muscle.  If you want to go into the muscle, you can't do that too often.  You go in the muscle and you have to wait two weeks, and go back in.  And then people will start telling you no.  But this thing I put on, you can put it on and even while you're working, you can see real time changes.  So, I like those kind of things.  I think I'm more interested in new methodologies and for ways that make things more accessible, yeah.

Speaker 1: When you look back over the trajectory of your career, is there anything you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: I mean, you can always publish more.  I don't think so.  I mean, I've often asked myself would I have stayed at Umea [University, Sweden], or should I have encouraged my wife to move.  But I mean those are--those are, you know, they are too abstractive questions, because you don't know how that would have gone.  So, no.  I've had a good time, and I enjoy my work, and I get excited every morning when I wake up.  So, I mean, I'm, I came from a poor family and we--and I'm doing okay.  So, no, I can't see anything that I would put my finger on as saying I would do differently, no.

Speaker 1: Now, are you, yourself, actively engaged in anything that you would call like a mentoring program at Umea [University, Sweden]?
Speaker 2: My, part of my job is to teach Ph.D. [degree] students.  So, I just had two students graduate.  And a part of that teaching is mentoring.  I have one guy from Brazil and one girl from Sweden that just finished doing their Ph.D.  And we teach them how to write.  And now, we also teach them, help them, get post-docs [post-doctoral training positions].  So now I'm helping him, trying to--this guy--trying to get a post doc.  I have a meeting here with someone while I'm in Boston [Massachusetts] here, about him.  So, I don't know.  Part of our job as a supervisor, as a Ph.D. supervisor, is to mentor.  So, I have a small business that I do.  And it is to help people write scientific papers.  And it's not because I'm a native speaker.  It's because I like to write, and I've been kind of given a lot of credit for good writing.  So, in that sense I interact with a lot of Ph.D. students.  They send me their papers, and I tell them what's wrong.  I tell them how to change this--and I edit it for them.  Of course, they pay me.  But that is also a type of teaching and mentoring, about how to write and how they can get better.  But this is from physics, chemistry, all kinds of surgeries.  And these are students from all over the place.  But my personal group, it is just within my Ph.D. supervision role, yeah. (simultaneous)

Speaker 1: Now, I should have asked about this earlier, I guess.  But this is not too bad a time.  What about your own creative writing?  I know you mentioned--
Speaker 2: My poetry?
Speaker 1: --writing poetry, and do you still--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, I like it.  It's a kind of therapy.  You can kind of get away from everything.  You kind of just put yourself in a bubble.  I like writing poetry.  I don't--it seems like I have to be stimulated by--my mother [Reva Louise Sampson Crenshaw], for example.  Well, my mother's--the Uncle James that I talked about earlier.  When he died, he was like, he had been like the father of this North Hill [neighborhood where Crenshaw was raised in Charlotesville, Virginia].  So, I wrote a poem called 'The Father of North Hill' and I read it in church.  For example, I wrote one for my mother.  But it has to come from really--I don't do it as, to sell it or anything like that.  I mean, I don't do it now as much as I'd like to, because I seem like I've always got something else in my head.  But I have to be totally isolated.  So, I enjoy it, I really enjoy it.  But I read a lot, too.  I read a lot of books.  I've read all of Toni--for example, I read the whole Toni Morrison [novelist, writer] series.  And I like, I like to read people's writings that can write.  It's not just the story, but it's also how they have written the story, yeah.

Speaker 1: Is it hard to keep up with African American activity in Sweden?
Speaker 2: I mean, it was in the beginning.  But with this, with all the IT [information technology] and stuff nowadays.  I mean, I Skype.  I talk to people all the time and I see their face, and we laugh and joke.  It's almost like they're here.  I mean, so, it's, it has become less difficult, yeah.  But my brother, you know, he's--he lives around [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia] and he's very much involved in the African American community down there, and he's very much a party guy, you know, he likes to--.  So, he always pulls me aside when I come home, and go, "Man, how do you make it over there?  Ain't no black people.  Man, what do you do?  Who do you talk to?  Who do you get down with?"  (laughter)  And I just say--you know.  But I got friends from England and places like that, that I made.  But at times, you get a little lonely over there because you, you know, you can't go, you can't run away from yourself, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28027
Speaker 1: This is another question we always ask.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I think I like this program--. Okay, the reason, I think that the reason they got me into this program was that-'African Americans in Science'--that is a website out of Louisiana that I joined a long time ago.  And what that did was, that gave, it put my name out there so that young African American students can, could contact me.  And during Black History Month for about six or seven years, they would contact me.  And I have a dialogue, I send them a picture, and they would write a little something on me, and so on and so forth.  So, I would hope that they would be inspired by others like--well, I don't know about me, but people that are in science.  I know that there is, this is a way.  I mean, if you want to do something in your life, you know, I think it's--I don't know if it's overwhelming now, but I think African American kids are getting a little bit more, say, abreast of what's happening.  It's not just the singing and athletics, and so on and so forth, like it used to be.  But I would like to see, I would like to see more African Americans in science.  It used to--when I was growing up it was like, I was always the only black dude in physics and stuff like that, and maybe it's a couple of Africans.  But so, I would like to see more of those kind of encouragements and steps and programs and so on and so forth, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Tell us something about your family.  Now, you've got--
Speaker 2: I have two daughters.  One is eighteen [years old] and one is fifteen, and they drive me, they drive me stone crazy.  Two teenage girls, yeah.  My wife is Swedish.  She's from a small town right outside of Umea [Sweden], so she sees Umea as a big booming metropolis, and I see it as a, you know--(laughter).  The girls are--the eighteen-year old is in her--there's a little different system there.  They go to school up to the ninth grade, and then they have what they call, it's like a high school, okay.  We take it as a high school.  I have another word for it, but you wouldn't understand it.  So, she's--my oldest daughter took, went to a year of high school.  She took a year off and she worked, and now she's back in her--she goes to a music high school.  That means that she's--she's quite gifted as a singer.  But she's also, she plays a lot of instruments.  And this music high school--you take the regular courses that prepares you for college, but at the same time you have a lot of time to be in the music studio, and you get to know how music is produced, and so on and so forth.  The youngest one is--that's the oldest one.  The youngest one is in the eighth grade.  So she has one more year of regular school.  The youngest one is quite gifted as a technical person.  She knows computers and she knows--, she just learned it on her own.  But she's also interested in music, too.  So, she wants to go to a music high school.   But she's, she's an extremely bright girl, yeah.  So they're, and they're very active.  They are, they have both been figure skaters up to a high level, and they have competed.  I mean, you have all that ice over there, so, what do you do.  My wife, she works at the university.  She's, she is a technician, but she works for the chemistry department and she takes care of some chemicals and stuff like that.  And she likes it, and she's--.  We travel a lot.  The girls--my daughters and wife, we've been here to the [United] States maybe ten, twelve times.  And they, we always, I want to have that, keep that connection with my family in Virginia.  Yeah, I mean, they're typical teenage girls, nothing more than that.  But sometimes they don't come home when they should and I get upset and, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 28029
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I think I'd like to be remembered as someone who was trying to help others.  If we can connect that primarily to science, I think I'd like to say that my door has been open for students to--so that they can--and I've been accessible, been reachable, and that I'm, I'm not a stuffy type scientist.  I like to be a little bit more down-to-earth and a little bit more popular in my way of doing science.  I'd like to be remembered as a person that had easy access, and that you could understand what I'm about and what I'm saying--talking about, yeah.  That's, that's, that's good enough.  If I do that, then I feel like okay, I've reached that goal, yeah.
