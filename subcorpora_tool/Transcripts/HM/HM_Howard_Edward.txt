Speaker 2: I'm sure it is--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --if you heard it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes, all right.  I heard it around somewhere.  But what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace her side?
Speaker 2: I have not, I guess I haven't gone into that to an extent to really tracing it back.  Portsmouth, I believe is, Portsmouth, Virginia, I believe where she was born.  But I don't recall any family tracings, so to speak.
Speaker 1: Okay, so are there any stories about family members that were from, on her side of the family that were from other place other than Portsmouth, in the area there?

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had a barber shop.
Speaker 1: Now, did he cut black people's hair or white people's or was it separated like that in those days?
Speaker 2: It was in sort of a white neighborhood.  I'm sure it was, it would be both in that respect.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know often black barbers, there were some black barbers that only cut the hair of white people, you know, and that was how they made their living.
Speaker 2: No, he wasn't that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think he--I don't think I had the privilege of going to him as a, for haircuts.
Speaker 1: So you never went to his shop?
Speaker 2: I believe I--I can recall visiting where it was and that sort of thing, but not for the purpose of a free haircut or anything.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so are there any stories that your grandparents told about, you know, the previous generation, your great grandparents?
Speaker 2: No, I cannot recall any such.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 33489
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Edith Brinkley] have a chance to go to school, I mean to go to college or--
Speaker 2: Yes.  I can recall visiting New York, Columbia [University], and we stayed at a, in New York, we would stay at a lady's house every time in the summer when she was working on her Masters [degree].  And I can recall one day saying that Mrs. Nash, these pancakes are so delicious, I could eat 50,000 of them, some such thing as that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is when she was in graduate school, right, or--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at Columbia University.  Now, your mother went to Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: For undergraduate school?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so did she have any stories about Howard University back in those days?  I think she came out in 1916, right?

Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Again, I can't recall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His, I believe August was his birth month.
Speaker 1: Was he older than your mother [Edith Brinkley]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Roughly, about how many years, five, ten years--?
Speaker 2: I don't believe it was a big gap, I just--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --don't have a feel for that one.
Speaker 1: So you think they're close in the same age?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: All right, so maybe he was born 1894, 1895, something like that, I guess.
Speaker 2: (No audible response).
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us what you know about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace his side, the Howard side?
Speaker 2: Well, I, he was born in a little place called Kittrell, North Carolina, I believe.  And he went to Kittrell College.  I recall he played baseball with the team.
Speaker 1: Now, what did his parents do for a living?
Speaker 2: I don't recall.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, but he was able to go to college and went to Kittrell College.  Now, does that college still exist?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: There again, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't imagine it does, but--
Speaker 1: All right, now, did he go to, did he attend Roosevelt University at all?  I see that on it, but I don't--
Speaker 2: That doesn't ring a bell, Roosevelt University.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That doesn't ring a bell at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, but he went on to Boston University Law School, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories about him going to law school that are passed down?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Was it hard for him?
Speaker 2: There, again, I really don't know.  I just, I can't recall getting into any discussions like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I would imagine that he was one of the few black students there, you know.  I would just have to imagine that, and then--so did he talk about how he was treated in school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or who his mentors were or--
Speaker 2: There, again--
Speaker 1: Now, did your father serve in World War I?
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --he did not serve in the military.
Speaker 1: All right.  Did he talk about why he wanted to become an attorney?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know that.
Speaker 1: And was he the first in his family to graduate from college?
Speaker 2: That's another detail that I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 33491
Speaker 1: So is there a story about how your parents [Edith Brinkley and Edward William Howard] met?
Speaker 2: I can't answer that question, how they met, no.
Speaker 1: Do you think they met in Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia] or in New York City or--
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Did they get married in Washington?
Speaker 2: In all probability, they did.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, but they established their home in Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, so, well, can you tell us something about them in terms of their personalities and what they were like?  What was your mother like?  What was your father like, and who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, I would imagine, it'd be my mother in the sense that I would visit New York when she was working on her advanced degree, and spent more times and trips with her.  My recall was that she allowed me to sit on the animal that I sat upon, the alligator and that was a boyhood experience.
Speaker 1: An alligator?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: A real one?
Speaker 2: A real one, a real, live alligator.  You have a picture of that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you can see.
Speaker 1: Now, where was this?
Speaker 2: This was out in California somewhere.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, when your mother went to Columbia [University], did she stay in New York during that period of time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you would go with her?
Speaker 2: I would--during the summer, yes, I would go with her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, 'cause she was working on her Master's degree over the summer, the summer months.  Now, what about your father?  What kind of personality did he have?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was, you might say, a warm personality in the, dealing with people as an attorney.  He was a member of a law firm, Kane, Brown & Howard, and they had a new partner join the firm, Leaks.  So I used to say, Leaky Brown Howard for the firm that (laughter) he was part of.  And he worked as an adjudicator for the Veterans Administration.
Story_ID: 33492
Speaker 1: Growing up in your household, it was your mother [Edith Brinkley], your father [Edward William Howard], you--do you have any brothers and sisters?

Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did anyone else live with you besides your mother and father?

Story_ID: 33493
Speaker 1: Well, sir, do you have an earliest childhood memory, the first thing that you remember?
Speaker 2: No, not of the first thing I can remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well, that's all right.  Now, where did you grow up in Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia]?  What neighborhood or street?
Speaker 2: Well, it's Northwest, I remember the house address was 932 T Street, Northwest, and that was near the old Griffith Stadium.  When they would have games, people would always invade the neighborhood parking cars and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Was this a large house?
Speaker 2: It was a three-story house, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was pretty large.
Speaker 1: And was it a row house or did you have--
Speaker 2: Yes, it was a row house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember I had a ping pong table down in the basement.  And I could always, people would accuse me of playing the favorites by--there was a post supporting the house structure, a post near the table.  So I could, I was used to playing that so that I would have an advantage on them, putting them in the corner where they couldn't get to the ball.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Laughter) Was this true, was this allegation true?
Speaker 2: Well, I--it might be true.  And we had a little club down there which I think there's a picture showing that.  We made models.
Speaker 1: Right, there is.  I saw the picture, right.  I think you're holding a model ship.
Speaker 2: Ship, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, so all the young men made those models themselves?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That's what we did.
Story_ID: 33494
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what were--we always ask this question like this.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, in the backyard, there were--one of my good friends had a dog.  We used to say that Frank had more dogs than anything else because he kept, I don't think he kept dogs too long.  I had one little dog when I was growing up.  This was a little dog named Fritz.  And there was a dog next door who was a large German Shepherd-type, and I called him "Bigsby" because he was so big.  He was Bigsby.  But that was where I grew up on T Street.
Speaker 1: What other sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: (No response).
Speaker 1: I guess I'm kind of looking for, like I know it looked different in 1929 than it does now, you know, or 1930.  So what was the difference between today's T Street and what it looked like when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I can't place any main differences.  I'm sure--
Speaker 1: In terms of the traffic, you know, were there horses or streetcars or, well, I don't know.
Speaker 2: I don't (laughter).  I don't think there were any horse traffic or anything like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, none of that was going on when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I know T Street has gone full circle, you know, from what I understand in D.C., from a nice place to live to a pretty rough place, you know, in fact, a rough and tough place, to now, it's being gentrified.  So do you have any thoughts about how that area has changed, you know, over the years?
Speaker 2: No, I haven't been back lately, been through that area.  So I couldn't comment on just what has changed.  I know that, for instance, we lived on T Street, and from there, my mother [Edith Brinkley] bought a house on Taylor Street, 1616 Taylor, NW.  And, of course, that was, more of a upscale neighborhood compared to the T Street location.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did your parents move there together.  You said your mother bought it.  I mean--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So 1616 Taylor Street, NW.  Now, okay, what was that neighborhood like?
Speaker 2: It was a nice neighborhood, I think.
Speaker 1: About how old were you when you moved there?
Speaker 2: That would have been--
Speaker 1: Were you still in grade school or--
Speaker 2: No, I would not have been in grade school then I don't think.
Speaker 1: Okay, were you in high school, I guess, at Dunbar when you lived there?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 33495
Speaker 1: Well, tell us, what did you like to do growing up?  I know you liked models and you liked playing ping pong.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What else, what else?
Speaker 2: Well, soapbox derby was one of my favorites.  I can recall winning three--I was in it for actually, I guess two years, three years--I won three heats, so to speak.  I recall going to the championship derby in Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you win in Ohio?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, no, I recall going to it.  But I didn't, no, I was not involved in it at that level.  I made it through the local derby.  But I meant the championship derbies.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you weren't in it, but you went there to see it?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, to see it.
Speaker 1: Did you go with your father [Edward William Howard] or your mother [Edith Brinkley]?
Speaker 2: My mother, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now, were you involved in the Boy Scouts at all?
Speaker 2: No, no, I was not.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: I took music lessons from Howard University, played the violin and we would play in the symphony orchestra, so to speak, even though I was not a particularly good violinist, I struggled through it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So did you like sports?
Speaker 2: To some extent.  I was not too active in sports.
Speaker 1: What about art?
Speaker 2: Art?
Speaker 1: Yeah, did you do any artwork?
Speaker 2: No, I couldn't say that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so what else in the neighborhood?  So you were involved with the soapbox derby, building models, which is all--these are all things that a young engineer should be doing.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So, did you have any inclination or any idea that you were going to become an engineer or were thinking about engineering?
Speaker 2: I don't think I did at that time.  I don't believe so.
Speaker 1: Now, did you like to take things apart and put 'em--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a common signal of a young engineer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, take 'em apart, put 'em back together again (laughter), the best you could (laughter).
Story_ID: 33496
Speaker 1: Now, when you went to school--now, where did you start in grade school, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Well, I can recall school in the neighborhood school, Rempke.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's R-E-M-P-K-E?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, Grimke.
Speaker 1: Oh, Grimke, oh, this is named after Archibald Grimke, I guess, right, G-R-I-M-K-E, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, Grimke Elementary School--.
Story_ID: 33497
Speaker 1: Okay, so Grimke Elementary School [Washington, District of Columbia].  All right, so you're--it's about 1931, I guess when you start school?  Now, did you go to kindergarten?
Speaker 2: I believe so, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you go at Grimke?
Speaker 2: That would have been the first school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you would have started maybe in 1930.  You were born in '25 [1925], you'd a been five years old in 1930.  So, well, did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  What did you like about it?
Speaker 2: Well, you had the little, I guess activities at the school, games sort of thing as well as the educational side of school.
Speaker 1: Okay, as a young engineer, did you use the blocks and the construction?  I mean did they have things for you to do that would enable you to make structures or--
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember anything special.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I just liked to tinker with things.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, did you have a favorite teacher at Grimke?
Speaker 2: No, I can't recall a favorite teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay, and who were your friends?
Speaker 2: Well, the people in this little club that you have, I guess, the picture of, one was Frank Turner who was the son of a doctor.  Robert Henry, Phillip Jordan, these were people that made models and, as I say, in the basement, we would do those things.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you know--now, what did you--I saw a picture of you with a ship.  Did you know the different styles of sailing ships and that sort of thing in those days?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think in a sense that was the Cutty Sark, I think, ship, and the square, regular type.  So that the, I tried to keep up with that.  And some had model airplanes and various things of that sort.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so was there any particular subject that you were the most adept at in grade school?
Speaker 2: Oh, nothing really.  I had math, I guess, I liked, mathematics.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're a good mathematician.
Speaker 2: In those days (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, did you read a lot?
Speaker 2: Not too much, not, I was not a, really a deep reader or anything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 33498
Speaker 1: Now, was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, I would go to Sunday school.  I guess that would be part of it.
Speaker 1: Did you have a family church?
Speaker 2: Yes, Metropolitan AME [African Methodist Episcopal].
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's Metropolitan AME.
Speaker 2: AME.
Speaker 1: And who was the pastor?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: It seems to me there was a Reverend Thomas, part of the time, I can recall.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So did you have any special roles in the church?
Speaker 2: No, I don't recall.
Speaker 1: Did they have like youth activities in church?
Speaker 2: I can't recall that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 33499
Speaker 1: Now, in--for high school, you went to--or did you go to a middle school or a junior high school [in Washington, District of Columbia]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went to, oh--Garnett Patterson, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Patterson?
Speaker 2: Garnett Patterson, two names.
Speaker 1: Oh, Garnett Patterson, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  That was my junior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, named for Henry Highland Garnett and I don't think, I don't know the Patterson, who it's named for.  It's named for Henry Highland Garnett, and who is the Patterson, do you know?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, Garnett Patterson Junior School.  Now, by that time, had your interests changed at all?  Were you still basically a good math student and interested in building things and--
Speaker 2: Yes, essentially.
Speaker 1: Okay, and was it during this period that you were playing the violin at Howard [University]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think that would be part of that.
Speaker 1: Now, this--your parents [Edith Brinkley and Edward William Howard] were more than likely in a very new--they more than likely knew a lot of the luminaries in D.C. in those days, being professionals.  Who were some of your parents' friends that we would know about now?
Speaker 2: Doesn't ring a bell now.  I can't--
Speaker 1: For instance, did your father know Charles Hamilton Houston and Thurgood Marshall and people like that.
Speaker 2: Not on any close basis, I don't recall.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did they, now, did they get a lot of newspapers at home and magazines?  Did they keep up with current events?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think so.
Speaker 1: Was there discussion in the home about what's going on in the world and the condition of black people in this country, civil rights issues and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Nothing special comes to mind on that.  When you talk about newspapers and things, I can recall one time I was, one Sunday morning with a neighbor in the house on the corner of 10th and T [streets], and unfortunately, I made a noise which had the young lady who was reading the paper tell me, "Get away, go away, go away, go away."  But that's something that seemed to stick in my mind.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were annoying someone who was trying to read the paper (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, I was having a bodily noise which she objected to.
Speaker 1: I see, all right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, we won't explore that any further.
Speaker 2: Yes, don't do that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes, we'll let that one go.  So, I just wondered with that area over there being so rich for so many people at Howard University, and the hospital over there, and, you know, if your parents, if you knew any of the, you know, the key intellectual figures of those days.  You have like Charles Drew over at Howard and, you know, there's so many people.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Howard Thurman was there, so such a rich neighborhood.  Okay, so any--did you have any teachers who were mentors or role models at Garnett Patterson?
Speaker 2: I can't recall any.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, now, were you a good student?
Speaker 2: Reasonably good, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 33500
Speaker 1: Now, you went to [Paul Lawrence] Dunbar High School [Washington, District of Columbia], right?
Speaker 2: Dunbar High, yes.
Speaker 1: Paul Lawrence Dunbar High School.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Named for the great poet.  Now, people that go to Dunbar High School in Washington, D.C. really seem to have a great love for it.  Did you feel that way about Dunbar when you were there or now?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: And why?  What made Dunbar special?
Speaker 2: Well, I think its academic standards, and I was in the high school cadets at that time, and I became a cadet colonel over the three schools, Dunbar, Armstrong and Cardozo in those days.
Speaker 1: So were you the highest ranking high school officer?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: High school cadet?
Speaker 2: My senior year, um-hum.
Speaker 1: So you were the colonel over three schools.  And so it's Dunbar, Cardozo and--
Speaker 2: Armstrong.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother [Edith Brinkley] taught at Armstrong.
Speaker 1: Okay, now how did you involved in the cadets?
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: Did you have a friend involved or did they invite you or--
Speaker 2: I think so.  Well, it was a Colonel, Colonel Attwood who was the senior military advisor so to speak.  And--
Speaker 1: It's Colonel Attwood?
Speaker 2: Attwood, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Harry Attwood (unclear).  But it's just something I just sort of picked up on.
Speaker 1: So this was something, the Cadet Corp was something you really excelled in, apparently, since you were the head of the, you rose to the highest rank.  Now, this is--now, you went to high school, well, did you graduate in '41 [1941]?  Was that it, 1941?
Speaker 2: No, high school was '43 [1943], wasn't it?  I believe that's the--
Speaker 1: Yes, you graduated in '43 [1943].
Speaker 2: '43 [1943].
Story_ID: 33501
Speaker 1: So you were there [at Paul Lawrence Dunbar High School, Washington, District of Columbia] from 1940 to '43 [1943], and this is basically during World War II.  It was still going on when you graduated actually.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: What were your thoughts about the war in those days?  And what, being a cadet--
Speaker 2: I don't know anything specific I could say to that question.
Speaker 1: Well, this is the last world war actually, and it's a world war.  We haven't had one since.  And the whole world's at war basically, and did you realize that when you were in high school?  I mean did you have a realization that this was something that doesn't happen all the time?  I mean it's--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know whether I looked at it in the sense of that.  I can't recall any concerns, just it being the significant event.
Speaker 1: Now, in high school, did you know about the Tuskegee Airmen or the experiment at Tuskegee [Alabama] with the black pilots?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I would have guessed you probably would have known some of them from high school, you know?
Speaker 2: Not personally.  I don't think I remember any.
Speaker 1: So what were you thinking about the position of black people in the military in those days?  Did you realize that the [U.S.] Army was segregated and that there weren't many black soldiers in command positions?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I think I was aware of that.
Speaker 1: And so did that inspire you in any way to want to become an officer or--
Speaker 2: Well, I, when I got the appointment to the military academy [United States Military Academy], this was done with the assistance from the senior Army advisor.  At that time, there was nobody appointed from D.C. [District of Columbia] because of--so actually, my appointment came through Congressman Dawson at, of Illinois.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is an African American Congressman, William L. Dawson.
Speaker 2: Dawson, yes.
Speaker 1: He was one of two congressmen from Illinois--no, he was the only one, yeah, he was the only one then, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So William L. Dawson, Democrat--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So, well, before I get you there, I just wanted to find out what you were thinking in high school about the war, and if you had--did you, were you thinking in high school about become an Army officer or going to West Point [United States Military Academy]?
Speaker 2: Probably not.
Speaker 1: So, when you were in high school, what did you--did you have any idea about what you wanted to do for a career, as a career?
Speaker 2: Well, I, at that time, I think I was looking toward the mili--toward a medical career, becoming a doctor.  I remember there was a, my mother's [Edith Brinkley] eye doctor, Merrill Curtis, who sort of drew my attention.
Speaker 1: Okay, Merrill Curtis.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He's an eye doctor, okay.  Did he talk to you about becoming a doctor?
Speaker 2: No, I don't recall any particular talk to him about it.  I just--
Speaker 1: Now, did you know any of the doctors at Howard Hospital or know about them, you know--
Speaker 2: No--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Dr. Drew and, you know, and some of the others?
Speaker 2: I don't believe I followed any of those people like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know for some people, some of the--I guess I'm saying that you were in a unique position, I guess, to observe some black professionals, you know, doing things that other youth may not have access to in other cities and other places just because of your proximity to all the professionals.  You know, did you--so you knew, Dr. Curtis was someone that you knew about.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Did you know about other black doctors and what they were doing?
Speaker 2: No, I can't cite any special connections that way.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 33502
Speaker 1: What else did you do in [Paul Lawrence Dunbar] high school [Washington, District of Columbia]?  Did you, were you a part of any clubs in high school or did you run for student office or anything?
Speaker 2: That doesn't make any connections.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So how were your grades when you graduated?  Were you an honor student or did you just--
Speaker 2: Yes, I believe so.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I believe so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean to be recommended for West Point, you had to be a pretty good student.  So I would think that's probably true.  But did you graduate with any honors from high school?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, they said somewhere along the line valedictorian.
Speaker 1: Well, that's the highest honor, isn't it (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, that was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That's pretty good (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, mine was, it seems to me that I, of the boys, I was the highest, and it was one girl, I think sort of tied along with me or one notch above.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, but you didn't run for class officer or anything?  You weren't like the presi--class president or--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --or anything like that?  And who were the, were there any special teachers at Dunbar that you remember that, you know, that you looked up to or really connected with?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm trying to think of the lady's name, my math teacher there.  I can't recall her name now.
Speaker 1: Okay, but Colonel Attwood was there, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, he--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --was the senior military type there.
Speaker 1: And do you remember Captain Elijah Reynolds?
Speaker 2: Reynolds, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, he was there too, right?
Speaker 2: (No audible response).  (Nodding)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 33503
Speaker 1: So, now, the, as I said, the War [World War II] is going on.  Outside of high school [Paul Lawrence Dunbar High School], this is the era where Joe Louis was fighting, right?  He was a boxing champion, you know.  Who were some of your heroes in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess, as you mentioned, Joe Louis.  You have a picture of me with him.
Speaker 1: Did you see any of his fights or did you listen to 'em on--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, I don't recall actually seeing, just what we picked up from the news.
Speaker 1: Did your family listen to the fights on the radio?
Speaker 2: Possibly, my father [Edward William Howard] would pick those up.
Story_ID: 33504
Speaker 1: Now, how did you choose--you decided to go to or were admitted to Dartmouth [College], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In the beginning.  Now, how was that arranged?  Did somebody advise you or make a--or how--
Speaker 2: Well, I guess, there again, I, it was based on, somewhere a friend of the family who had gone to Dartmouth, and there was a fellow, Charlie Duncan, who was a skier.  So the, I admired skiing in those days, and although I was not a good skier, I did have skis.  I think I still got 'em around here now somewhere from the Dartmouth days.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Charles Duncan, this is attorney Charles Duncan, right--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --from Howard Law School--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --who recommended Dartmouth then, right?
Speaker 2: He went to Dartmouth.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, and you were attracted to it because of the skiing, I guess (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yep (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  That's as good a reason as any, I guess, to go to school.  So, did you get a scholarship to Dartmouth or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So your parents [Edith Brinkley and Edward William Howard] were gonna have to pay?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, and you were going to attend Dartmouth as a pre-med student?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you actually enrolled in Dartmouth and started school, right--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --when you found out you could go to West Point [United States Military Academy].
Speaker 2: West Point, um-hum.
Speaker 1: And so, and that's when you went to Congressman [William] Dawson or, and he interceded on your behalf and wrote a recommendation for you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.  Did you have a chance to meet Congressman Dawson?
Speaker 2: I think so, I believe I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you go over there with your dad or your mother or--
Speaker 2: There, again, I can't give you any details on that.
Speaker 1: Okay, did your father know William Dawson?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Did your aunt know him, know William Dawson?
Speaker 2: I don't recall who they might have known, but--
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you ever meet him?  Did you ever meet William Dawson?
Speaker 2: I believe I did, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so at any rate, so you were able to go, attend West Point.  So had you already applied to West Point and they hadn't processed it or what happened that you were at Dartmouth first and--
Speaker 2: Well, it seems to me it was a case where deferment so to speak was running out, and there was an opportunity to seek West Point, which I did, so that that's essentially how it happened that I--rather than be drafted I had the option of going to West Point and took that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 33505
Speaker 1: So, all right, now walk us through West Point [United States Military Academy].  What was your first day at West Point like?
Speaker 2: Well, that's when you say all hell broke, when you become a plebe and you're yelled at and these barracks, you're bracing positions and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, were there any other African Americans at West Point in your class?
Speaker 2: There was one fellow who was a, I mentioned, Charlie Smith was a turn back.  In other words, he had started the previous year and because of academic problems, he came back and joined my class so that we were classmates together.  And in those days, they put you--you were assigned to companies by height so that he was a little shorter than I, and in reality, I had a roommate who started with me, Robert Green, who was closer to my height.  So we were together as plebes at the academy.  But the, now, I don't know how they're doing it now, the height arrangement, but you--it seems to me they've made some changes the way they do it.  But that was the way it was set up that, and you [were] sized so that when you look at the Corp from a distance, you see everybody essentially the same height, the way they arranged them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Robert Green was African American too?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had a--
Speaker 2: He was the son of, I think--it seems to me his father was in the service.
Story_ID: 33506
Speaker 1: All right, so you're at West Point [United States Military Academy].  This is 1943, right?  Is that true, 1943?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is it '44 [1944]?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Forty-five [1945].
Speaker 1: '45 [1945], yeah.
Speaker 2: '45 [1945], okay.  So you were in Dartmouth [College] longer than just a year then, right?
Speaker 1: A couple of years at Dartmouth.
Speaker 2: Okay, I didn't realize that.  Okay, so, well, I mean back at Dartmouth, were there any special teachers at Dartmouth or any special experiences at Dartmouth?
Speaker 1: Yeah, you just, indicating the skiing aspects of it, I--
Speaker 2: How were you treated there?  I mean did you have friends in Dartmouth or did the--
Speaker 1: Yes, the classmates that I had, plus as you mentioned Charlie Duncan and he was a skier.  It was a fellow named Porter, a skier.
Speaker 2: So this is Charles Duncan, before he becomes a lawyer then, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He's there, and a guy named Porter, you said?
Speaker 1: Yes, there was Porter.  They called him A. Lauder, I think something.  They had a name made up for him.  And we used to pal around together.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So, but you all were definitely a minority at Dartmouth, right, of course.  And so, and you were majoring in pre-med?
Speaker 1: Pre-med, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, did you join any fraternities or--
Speaker 1: No, I did not.
Speaker 2: --anything at Dartmouth, no?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay, so no professors or any officials really stand out as being important at Dartmouth for you?
Speaker 1: I can't ring a bell of any.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, was Dartmouth all male in those days?
Speaker 1: Yes, I think so.  That--
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: --was before they--
Speaker 2: Before they--
Speaker 1: Brought in the ladies.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Okay.  So--
Speaker 1: Because--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --so at West Point, now, your roommate was Robert Green, right?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And now, Charlie Smith wasn't a roommate with you?  He didn't--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, there was another fellow who was there.  I roomed with Robert Green.  He was closer to my height.  Actually, he was a slight, taller than I.  He was the son of a military officer.  And, but we were assigned, as I said, by height in companies, so that when they looked at it from a distance, everybody seemed to be the same essentially.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, how were--I've heard it's tough at West Point for African American students, but was it tough for you all?  I mean did they talk to you and did they--I mean how, what was it like being at West Point?
Speaker 1: Well, I guess it, this was after the silencing, so to speak.  Initially, there was a silence treatment, but I didn't experience any of that where nobody would speak to you or anything.
Speaker 2: Okay, so they would speak to you at least?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, but were there black upper classmen when you were there, seniors or--
Speaker 1: I can't recall any.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Did you enter West Point as a junior in college or did you have to start all over--
Speaker 1: No, you start at the--
Speaker 2: You kind of start all over?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the thing about that.  Everybody started off at the same level, when you started, from the beginning, even though you may have had some other training prior to that.
Speaker 2: So did the training at Dartmouth come in handy at West Point?  I mean did you have like some advantage having gone to school two years?
Speaker 1: I would think so, yes, it seemed to me.
Speaker 2: Okay, and now, did you specialize in pre-medical studies at West Point in addition to the military studies or did you lean toward some other field?
Speaker 1: No, I don't think it was any--essentially, the curriculum you took was standard for everybody.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, so you couldn't--all right, so it's all basic military training then, military science?
Speaker 1: Yes, um-hum.
Speaker 2: Were there any special teachers at West Point, people that you remember, either good or bad at West Point?
Speaker 1: I can't recall any stand outs either way.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were treated professionally basically by the staff there?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, no problems whatsoever?
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know.  It must have been some problems, but I don't know of anything that I would say would stand out.
Speaker 2: Well, give us ordinary problems (laughter)?  What would be an ordinary one?  It doesn't have to be a stand out one, but--
Speaker 1: It just doesn't ring a bell.
Story_ID: 33507
Speaker 1: What was your--did you have a favorite part of West Point [United States Military Academy], I mean something that really was great that you liked the most about West Point?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know of anything that, considered a favorite.  I, I know I started a series of photographs.  Photography was one of my hobbies, so I would put--each week, essentially, I would have a new picture on the bulletin board.  And sometimes, I would have them indicate something and ask for a suggested title.  I know that I borrowed a Great Dane from one of the faculty members.  And I had a fellow who had his full dress uniform show, have that on his arm.  We had the dog, he was holding a roll in his hand, and I used that as the barker (unclear) rule in the "Tales of Hoffman."  So his name was Hoffman, and that was how, I mean I would ask, put these--as I say, put these pictures on the board, usually on a weekly basis, some significant event or something humorous or whatever you wanna call it.
Speaker 1: Okay, did people like your photos for the most part?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think so, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so--okay, what was the worst time at West Point?  Was there a time when you thought you weren't gonna make or a time that you thought that you were gonna get in trouble or did get in trouble or--
Speaker 2: It doesn't ring a bell.
Speaker 1: So you never experienced any real, you know, down times or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what would you think would be your great triumph at West Point?
Speaker 2: Greatest?
Speaker 1: Triumph.
Speaker 2: Triumph?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I guess I stayed essentially demerit free.  I didn't get into any problems of demerits or academic problems or anything so that, I could sweat easily.  And when you're showing signs of putting out, as they called it, I would give the impression that I was putting out.  So by perspiring under pressure, I just managed to survive, so to speak.
Speaker 1: I don't understand that, now, kind of explain that again for us?
Speaker 2: Well, as I say, you wanted, when you're a plebe, your first year, you wanna show that you're absorbing what they want you to get.  So by showing that I would, when I would perspire and give--it made it look as if I was really trying to do the right thing.  And it lessened any severe treatment that I would get not putting out.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Well, as I say that's, that was showing that you were taking everything that they're giving you.  I could show that I was trying to do what I was told to do.  So I didn't have any academic, any demerit problems or anything like that from not trying to follow instructions.
Speaker 1: Okay, so if they gave you an instruction, and you were--and if you didn't show that you were sweating, they would, it would indicate that you weren't trying hard enough.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah.
Speaker 1: But you could sweat easier--
Speaker 2: Yes, so--
Speaker 1: So (laughter), it always looked like you were trying.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, this is a, I guess would be a racial kind of characteristic that--I think African Americans actually sweat easier than white people.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: And I, you know, I'm not a scientist but life has indicated to me that that's true, pretty much.  I used to go to band camp, and they used to pass out salt pills to all the white people 'cause they would pass out on the field, 'cause they couldn't--they didn't sweat like me.  But I sweated a lot.  I never needed it.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But the, it's--so this is something that you can do (laughter) that kept you out of big trouble?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think so.
Speaker 1: 'Cause it always looked like you were trying much harder--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because you sweated easier.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: But you were trying, though, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Anyway, so, okay.  That's interesting, that's interesting.
Story_ID: 33508
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a favorite instructor or person at West Point [United States Military Academy] amongst the white officers and instructors there?  Did anybody look out for you at all or do anything to help you?
Speaker 2: I don't recall any incidences of that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so everybody basically stayed neutral?  There wasn't even anybody that tried to hold you back or keep you from graduating or--
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: --or trip you up or, no practical jokes played on you or any of that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Doesn't ring a bell there in anything like that.
Speaker 1: It just seems like too perfect to, you know--(laughter)--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: At any rate, well, do you have a favorite memory from West Point?
Speaker 2: Nothing, nothing stands out.
Speaker 1: Okay, sir, did Robert Green make it--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --did he graduate?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, so were you all roommate the entire four years, I guess?
Speaker 2: No, because I was a year ahead of him so that I finished before he did.  But as I say, we were of different classes, different years.  He was a year behind me.
Speaker 1: Now, I know before we started this interview, your daughter said that when you go to reunions, class reunions, certain white former cadets [from the United States Military Academy at West Point] come up to you and apologize for the things they did, and they apologize to her for what they did.  So are they having, did they do anything to apologize for?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess in a sense they do, but it's just a thing in the past.
Speaker 1: Well, this is The HistoryMakers (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So we're trying to tell the history of what happened to you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, which is--the victory comes with the history, you know.  You don't have a triumph unless you overcome something.  If you're just skating through West Point and everybody's all right, then that's not much of a story.  So I'm just saying, sir, please tell what happened at West Point, if you can, if you can remember?  But if you can't remember, that's different.  But--
Speaker 2: I don't know what the, what the item--just isn't, isn't connecting with anything specific.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, when you were approaching graduation from West Point, I mean was everything okay.  Did it look like you were gonna graduate on time?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did you have any, did you accrue any special honors when you graduated?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay, but I heard, once again, or read that you graduated in the middle of your class, right, or thereabouts?
Speaker 2: Thereabouts, I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did other people say about you at West Point?  I mean what did your classmates say about you and how did they feel about you?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was a respectable feeling, and they, I guess had respect for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you have an advisor or someone that--or counselor at West Point, someone on the staff there that was responsible for, you know, you on some level like I know when you're in regular college, you have a department chair or someone that, you know, an advisor.  Did you have an advisor?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So do you remember anybody's name at West Point that, any of the instructors or administrators?
Speaker 2: Nothing comes to mind right now.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 33509
Speaker 1: So you graduated from West Point [United States Military Academy] in 1949, yes?
Speaker 2: '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and what happened after that?  You were assigned, right, to--you had an assignment, right?
Speaker 2: (No audible response).
Speaker 1: Is this true?
Speaker 2: Had a, we all went to the, I think it was the, what they called the Ground General School.  And regardless of what branch you took, you had a little extra training.  And that was sort of a branch immaterial, (unclear) Signal Corps.  We went to Fort Riley [Kansas] and had training in Kansas.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is the, the United States had become involved in what they call the Korean Conflict, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And so were you being, were you on the verge of being assigned to go to Korea?  Is that it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's like 1949, going into 1950.  This is, now, President [Harry S.] Truman had just integrated the Armed Forces with Executive Order 9981 in 1948.  Do you remember how you felt about that?
Speaker 2: No, I can't--
Speaker 1: Did you think it was a good thing that the Armed Forces were integrated?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, kind of explain how--can you talk about how you felt or what it meant?
Speaker 2: Well, I thought it would mean you'd start off on an even keel so to speak.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, do you think that attitudes changed right away or did they--I mean did it take time for, you know, the attitudes to change in the [U.S.] Army, I mean towards, I mean in regards to race?
Speaker 2: I don't know if it, I saw that as something of significance, but I--it just doesn't connect with how it was gonna be.
Speaker 1: Okay, what were your thoughts when you graduated from West Point in terms of service?  What did you want to do and what kind of assignment were you hoping for?
Speaker 2: Well, I think we all went to, as I mentioned, Fort Riley, and that was the Ground General School whereby we would get some familiarization, some training appropriate to all people, I mean all branches and services.  And as I say, mine being the Signal Corp, the Fort Riley experience, I guess led to my meeting my wife [Willrene (Billie) Myrtil White Howard] and getting, starting off as new experiences.
Story_ID: 33510
Speaker 1: Well, tell us how you met your wife [Willrene (Billie) Myrtil White Howard]?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a pre-introduction.  When it was determined that I would go to Fort Riley [Kansas], one of the, rather where my mother [Edith Brinkley] taught school, there was someone who said that he had three nieces in Kansas.  Well, as it turned out, one was spoken for, one was married and then there was Billie, and that's where my wife came into the picture.  So this, though I had the choice of essentially one (laughter).  And that narrowed the choice down.
Speaker 1: Okay, but she seemed like a good choice, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay, what was she doing at the time?  Was she in school or--
Speaker 2: Was she in school?  I don't think so.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  [Whispering] She was a social worker.
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess it was social work she was doing.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so she was a social worker.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so you were at Fort Riley, is this 1950, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so how long of a courtship did you have before you got married?
Speaker 2: Not too long, what half a year, about a half a year.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you got married in, you know, within a half a year of meeting.  And now, after you finished Ground General School in Fort Riley, Kansas, now, you were involved in the Signal Corp, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so where were you assigned after Fort Riley?  I think your--so I'm sorry, you were married in Wichita [Kansas], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Wichita, Kansas.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 33511
Speaker 1: And I have here--I don't know what comes next exactly, but what I have here is that you were assigned to Camp Cooke in California, is that right?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Assigned to Fort Monmouth, then he went to--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, he's goes--okay, you go to Korea first, right?
Speaker 2: (No audible response).
Speaker 1: No, okay.  What was the first?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  I think he was assigned to Fort Monmouth and from Fort Monmouth, he was sent to Korea 'cause he went to Korea within six months of his marriage.
Speaker 1: All right, so.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  He goes to Korea in '50 [1950], '51 [1951].
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'm hearing that you went to Fort Monmouth [New Jersey] and then to Korea, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is that true?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you're--now, you were in the Signal Corp--
Speaker 2: Signal Corp, um-hum.
Speaker 1: --in Korea.  What were your duties as a Signal Corpsman in Korea?
Speaker 2: We, I had the communications element of the division.  The division's Signal officer was a Lieutenant Colonel, and I had the wire platoon, wire communications in those days.  We did a lot of field wire installations and that sort of thing.  We, that is cable to various units we supported, and I recall the unfortunate incident where the division Signal officer was traveling with some of my people, and we had these two and a half ton trucks with wire cable.  The trouble, the problems were with mines mostly, whereby a mine was struck by one of the vehicles that I had and the Signal officer was traveling with some people in a jeep.  I was in another jeep, and this cable, two and a half ton truck, hit a mine which didn't do too much damage, but the jeep where the Signal officer was, was--when they heard this other instance, when he heard the trouble, he backed up, and he backed over a mine.  And that took out the Signal officer and one of my drivers, I believe, was with him and everything.  So that they lost their lives in that incident--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which was a bit unnerving, so to speak.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Story_ID: 33512
Speaker 1: So this is a, yeah, you just described a horrific kind of a, I mean a casualty.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And was this the only casualty that your unit suffered in the [Korean] War?  Were there other things?
Speaker 2: I can't think of anything more serious than that.  But that doesn't ring a bell.
Speaker 1: When, in the Signal Corps when you lay wire like that, do you have to guard the wire that you lay from the enemy?  You know, if you lay a lot of wire, do you have someone posted near where the wire is stretched to protect it?  Are there patrols that patrol the wire?
Speaker 2: No, usually these are far enough back that, you could [pause], the, what I was involved with was a, we had two, there were two corps, Fifth Corp and Seventh Corp, and I had, my people were with the Seventh Corps.  But I think usually you, these lines were--of course, I guess now there's more reliance on radio and so on, radio relay installations, but I don't think--I can't see that hardly, actually protecting.  The wires were--, I guess some of it--it wasn't, I can't recall anything that, where you--
Speaker 1: Well, that was just a question that came to mind.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah.
Speaker 1: What were the concerns that you had as a Signal Corps officer in terms of land, you know, wire communications?  You had to do it with wire, right, you know--
Speaker 2: We had regular relay, and the wires were very often at the headquarters, I mean, but I just don't remember--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you actually had radio relay.  You didn't have to really communicate through the wires, but the wires were at the relay stations, you're saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: So did you have to have special radio engineering training to be an officer in the Signal Corps?
Speaker 2: Nah, I don't, just doesn't--oh, how that ties in with it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so did they send you to some sort of a technical school to learn how to be an officer in the Signal Corps?
Speaker 2: It was a base, sort of a basic officer schooling, but this isn't equating, I guess to--I don't know how much has changed by now, and then obviously, it has.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now, you served in Korea for how long?  A year or what?  Do you remember when you came back from Korea?
Speaker 2: No, I can't recall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have to check my records and see what it shows.
Speaker 1: So we know you were back by 1952, I guess, right?  Is that true?  Back--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 33513
Speaker 1: So when you came back to the [United] States, did you come back to California?  Is that where you were?  Is this when you were in Camp Cooke [California]?
Speaker 2: (No audible response).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Where, I--
Speaker 1: All right, okay, so what were your assignments when you came back from Korea?  What did you do?
Speaker 2: What was the next conflict that broke out?  Doesn't it, something?
Speaker 1: Well, it's nothing not until Vietnam.  But you went to Purdue [University], right, in 1960?
Speaker 2: [No audible response].
Speaker 1: Now, what prompted that?  Now, you got a, you went to Purdue to pursue a degree in electrical engineering.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What made you decide that instead of going to medical school?
Speaker 2: Well, I was in the [armed] Service [U.S. Army], I guess, and the chance of getting an extra degree was available and I locked onto it, I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay, so had you given up on becoming a doctor at this point?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I--that was, I guess the thing that would come to fruition.
Speaker 1: And did you see yourself having a career in the Military then, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you were able to go--so the Army sent you to, allowed you to go Purdue to pursue a Masters degree in engineering, electrical engineering.  So who was your advisor at Purdue, do you remember?
Speaker 2: No.  I can't recall.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you recall like what kind of a project you worked on for your thesis at Purdue?
Speaker 2: No.  It seems to me there was, you had--there was an option, and I don't recall just (unclear).  If I had my--you had an option of doing a project or doing something (unclear) as opposed to doing an actual thesis.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is mostly coursework then?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 33514
Speaker 1: Now, were you involved in the delivery of critical messages in the [U.S.] Army.  Did you have to have a security clearance and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, you had clearances, definitely.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and so did you communicate with the National Security Agency [NSA] and the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] as well as the Army itself?
Speaker 2: Were certain aspects, I think, but, the, this was what, the NMCC, National Military Command Center activities, which was located back here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My, then I got into sort of a branch, immaterial.  In other words, we worked with the Army Discharge Review Board which had a series of traveling teams or, and stationary activities where my last five years were spent at the Pentagon.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you reviewed discharges from people who were separated with other than punitive discharges--that was administrative separations where somebody was found to be not suitable for the [Armed] Service.  And if they were separated with a, with other than a court martial offense or something, you could review their discharge and give them an upgrade if the person showed signs of overcoming this deficiency.  This was administrative discharge versus punitive.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: So you could elevate their status, give them--and it sort of cleared up the blemish in the records of having the lower benefit, so to speak.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 33515
Speaker 1: All right, sir, what do you remember about Vietnam [War; U.S. Army]?
Speaker 2: [Pause] (No response).
Speaker 1: So nothing comes to mind, right?
Speaker 2: What's that?
Speaker 1: Nothing comes to mind about Vietnam?
Speaker 2: (No response).
Speaker 1: Well, I know we--go ahead.
Speaker 2: Oh, what do we show for it?
Speaker 1: Well, what I have here is that you directed a fixed communications facility of 800 persons as the installation commander and staff officer in Vietnam.  And you were located somewhere near Saigon, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: And so, after the Vietnam--well, toward the close of the Vietnam War, you came back and worked for the, as a chief of the Frequency Branch of the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, right?
Speaker 2: (No audible response) (Nod).
Speaker 1: Now, is this in the Pentagon?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and you also worked for, in the Office of the Inspector General, right?
Speaker 2: (No audible response) (Nod).
Speaker 1: And this is also the Office of Inspector--I don't see his name here, but in the Department of the Army, it's the Inspector General's Office.  This is in 1973, and--okay.  And the last assignment, you were telling us is when you were appointed as Signal Corps Office Panel member on the Army Discharge Review Board, right?
Speaker 2: (No audible response) (Nod).
Speaker 1: And, from '76 [1976] to '79 [1979], right.
Speaker 2: That was the last assignment.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and you retired from the Army in 1979, right?
Speaker 2: (No audible response).
Speaker 1: Now, when you were on the verge of retiring from the Army, what were you--did you have a job lined up already or--
Speaker 2: No, I don't think--at retirement the jobs that I took were strictly non-Military.  It was nothing associated with the Military, I don't think, other than just the companies that I worked with and worked for.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your rank when you retired?
Speaker 2: Colonel.
Speaker 1: So you were a full colonel--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, in the United States Army.
Speaker 2: 06.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 33516
Speaker 1: Did you receive any special medals or commendations that you can share with us?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes and no.  I guess my--is there a listing.  Didn't you--
Speaker 1: Well, let's see.  Yeah, there are some here that, the Korean Service Medal, Combat Infantry Badge, Vietnam Service Medal, the Legion of Merit Medal, the Bronze Star, Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, is--there's a list, quite a list of medals, Meritorious Service--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, all those.  What are your--do you have any reflections about your life in the Service, I mean your career as a Colonel, as an officer?
Speaker 2: I don't know how you'd put it.  I would suppose you'd say rewarding would be a term that you might use.
Story_ID: 33517
Speaker 1: And now I hear that you still attend West Point [United States Armed Services] class luncheons?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about those.
Speaker 2: They, we have a person who is known as the scribe who keeps track of the various events.  And we have, from time to time, they have a luncheon at Fort Myers, the Officers Club, and there's a coed luncheon whereby wives are invited.  They discuss, the scribe keeps track of progress of all the people essentially in the class.  And they'll give a report as to who's passed away or something and the activities that they go to.  It's a social type affair which usually is accompanied by the wives who are available.
Story_ID: 33518
Speaker 1: Now, after the, after your service [in the U.S. Army] you worked as an electrical engineer with Science and Technology Corporation, right?  Do you remember them?
Speaker 2: Let's see, how did I have that phrased?
Speaker 1: Do you remember working with NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]?
Speaker 2: (No audible response)
Speaker 1: Or working, testing high-powered microwave systems and, you know--'cause you have quite a record of service as an engineer afterwards, right, in civilian life, right?
Speaker 2: (No audible response).
Speaker 1: And I think you were--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, they were involved with some of the standards and specifications and it was a--oh, you would have to review the documents that companies used in, oh, let's see how to put it--[pause]--the, I'm just trying to see how to phrase that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to make it clear as to what we were doing.
Speaker 1: Well, that's all right if you--but, now, when--there's quite a bit here that people can read if they want to--.
Story_ID: 33519
Speaker 1: When you look back on your career in the Military [U.S. Army] and in engineering, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: [Pause] I guess I would like to say that, fairness in how people, (unclear) to be, perceived to be.  That's, I would say that's part of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 33520
Speaker 1: Can you tell us something about your family, about your children?
Speaker 2: Well, I have one child (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about her [Edith Howard Bostic], and--
Speaker 2: Well, she's, one thing that she's accomplished that I guess people don't realize that I had no part in influencing, and that is she sings in the choir.  Now, I couldn't carry a tune very far.  When you went to the academy, you were interviewed for the choir, and you had to sing the phrase "Glory to God."  Well, I got as far as "Glor," and they said, no, stop.  And they can't figure out (laughter) how my grandsons has been in choirs, my daughter, but I have no singing voice whatsoever.  So, that's something that's unique, I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you have a grandson [Scott Howard Bostic] too that graduated from West Point [United States Military Academy]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: In '05 [2005].
Speaker 1: Okay, in '05 [2005].
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And you had the opportunity of giving him his commission, I believe, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, I pinned on, I guess, his, when he was, pinned on his bars, I believe, as a Second Lieutenant--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at graduation.
Speaker 1: All right, and this is Edward Bostic, Edward Howard Bostic--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Scott--
Speaker 1: Scott, okay, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Scott Howard Bostic.
Speaker 1: Scott.
Speaker 2: Okay, Scott Howard Bostic, okay.
Story_ID: 33521
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, what was the first--
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns--
Speaker 2: Oh, hope and concerns.
Speaker 1: Yeah, for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, that, I think everybody should be judged on what they can do and what they have done, and a sense of equality that certainly the--you can't say that because a person is of a certain color that he can or cannot do certain things.  So I would look for the equality of all people.
Story_ID: 33522
Speaker 1: And the last question is: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I would like to be remembered as someone that tried to do the best he could, someone that was fair, generous.  I get involved in several charities and appeals and that sort of thing, support those.  I would like to be remembered by looking out for the less fortunate and with hope for their betterment.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Story_ID: 33523
Speaker 1: Sir, go ahead and tell us about that photograph, sir--.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's my wife [Willrene "Billie" White Howard] and I guess that was the day we were married [1950].
Speaker 1: Now, what's her name?
Speaker 2: Willrene, Billie.  She goes by Billie, I believe.  That was her.
Speaker 1: And that, of course, is a couple of cadets around Joe Louis.  Charlie Smith was my classmate who started the year before me, and he was turned back to graduate the same time I did.
Speaker 2: So he's in the picture too?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Okay, and it's got a nice caption on (unclear).
Speaker 1: And that has to be, can't recall the names.  The two (unclear), the NCO [non-commissioned officer] is, I think was my First Sergeant and my company in, was this Vietnam or Korea-
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE):  It looks younger--
Speaker 1: Korea?
Speaker 2: It looks like Korea probably.
Speaker 1: Korea.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE):  Korea, yeah.
Speaker 1: That would have been the staff I had in Korea.
Speaker 2: So are you presenting an award to the staff?
Speaker 1: I think so.  That was something.
Speaker 2: And that's my father.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: Edward William Howard.
Speaker 1: And my mother, Edith Brinkley Howard.  And the Edith, she was, is the same Edith that we have over there behind you.  She was named for her grandmother.
Speaker 2: And that's a family picture with Edie and her husband, Scott.
Speaker 1: Could you start on the left maybe and name everybody going across?
Speaker 2: Okay, that's James Bostic, Dr. James Bostic-
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE):  Junior.
Speaker 2: --Edie, Scott is in the middle, essentially.  Next is my wife, Billie, and I'm standing and the last one is James Bostic, Jr.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE):  The third.
Speaker 2: The first--the third, rather.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE):  The third.  And that was on the occasion of Scott's promotion to, I believe, Captain.
Speaker 2: And that's a cadet uniform that I'm wearing there at the military academy.
Speaker 1: And I'm with my wife-
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE):  At a West Point [United States Military Academy] reunion.
Speaker 1: A reunion somewhere.  I don't know where it was, yes.
Speaker 2: Now, those are people from Dartmouth [College].  Let's see, oh, I can't remember who's on the end, but Charlie Duncan is next and Porter--
Speaker 1: That would be Charlie Duncan.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's Duncan. I'm in the background.  Chauncey Levy is next to me.  Gads, I can't think of the other fellows, but we used to pal around together.
Speaker 1: And that's an old picture in my cadet uniform, the dress uniform.
Speaker 2: And that's the club that I, we had down in our basement when I was living on T Street.  And each one of us is holding up something that we did, models that we made.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE):  Do you remember their names?
Speaker 2: Frank Turner on the left, Robert Henry, Sonny Jordan, Phillip Jordan in the middle, and then I'm on the end with ship.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's my resting place on a, supposedly tame alligator.  He didn't move so, but he was alive.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And my mother--this is the case where my mother took me to the (laughter)--
Speaker 1: And that's the cadet staff, high school cadet corps, and I'm the Colonel commanding it.
Speaker 2: Is that the stadium over by Howard [University] or--
Speaker 1: What's that?
Speaker 2: Is that the stadium over by Howard?
Speaker 1: The old Griffith Stadium, isn't it?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE):  It says Briggs Frank--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Briggs, yeah--
Speaker 2: Briggs, Frank-
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE):  Oh, that was an ad (unclear).  It was at the Howard's--what stadium was that?
Speaker 2: I think that was when they used to use the old Griffith Stadium.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That receiving an award from the General there.  What's his name?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE):  Woodward?
Speaker 2: What?  Woodward, yes.
Speaker 1: Woodward, yeah, General Woodward.
Speaker 2: Yes, three star.
Speaker 1: Now, this is--looks like Vietnam maybe.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE):  Yeah, that would be a Vietnam.
Speaker 1: I don't know what that was, a pensive mood.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE):  I think that was taken when you were at Dartmouth.  That what I'm told.
Speaker 1: Something of that sort.
Speaker 2: And, of course, that explains what that is, a high school reunion class.
Speaker 1: This was something that was in the paper.
Speaker 2: Is that you at Dartmouth?
Speaker 1: Quite a while back (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE):  It looks like after Dartmouth.  That looks like--
Speaker 1: I'm not sure, but I had a little hair then (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now, here's the one I like.  Tell us which one is you here?
Speaker 1: Where am I?
Speaker 2: Yes, where are you in this picture?
Speaker 1: General Staff, Officers' Corps.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION):
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE):  Which one are you?
Speaker 1: I show up from the (unclear), second row from the right, one, two, three, four, five.  Isn't that where I am?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE):  Exactly where you are.
Speaker 1: I think so.
Speaker 2: That was Fort-
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE):  Where was that?
Speaker 2: Is it Leavenworth?
Speaker 1: No, this is General Staff Officer Corps Phase X, Dallas [Texas]--
Speaker 2: Dallas?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: USAR School, USAR School, Fort--oh, I'm sorry, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Fort Leavenworth.
