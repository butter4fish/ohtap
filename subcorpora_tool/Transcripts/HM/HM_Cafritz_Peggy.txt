Speaker 2: My favorite color.  I guess my favorite color is red.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Fall.
Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: (laughs) "Would you do me a favor?"
Story_ID: 4627
Speaker 1: You're from Mobile [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 2: I was born in Mobile, Alabama.
Speaker 1: And can you tell me--can you give me your mother's name?  And tell me about what you know about her background?
Speaker 2: My mother was Gladys Mouton Cooper, M-O-U-T-O-N.  She was born in Lafayette, Louisiana.  She went to Hampton Institute [later Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  She met my father there.  They married and moved to Alabama, Mobile.  My mother was--my mother was a very vain woman.  She was an extraordinarily beautiful woman.  When she was about fourteen without two nickels to rub together, she saved her money.  And she would buy 'Vogue' magazine and 'Harper's Bazaar.'  And she started dressing like--what is her name?  Katharine [Hepburn]--?  She was in the movie with Sidney Poitier.
Speaker 1: Katharine Hepburn?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Hepburn. Katharine Hepburn.  And, you know, she would wear trousers.  And she would take her father's, you know, shirts.  And she created quite a noise with her high style in Lafayette, Louisiana.  And when she arrived at Hampton, I think with virtually nothing.  Men swarmed her fairly quickly.  And amongst those men was my father whose name was Algernon Johnson Cooper.  And he was born in Mobile.  His mother's name was Pearl Johnson.  And she met his father when they were both students at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And his father's name was Oceola, Oceola Cooper. After they married, they moved back to Mobile.  And her older sister and her husband had moved there from Florida some years prior and started a funeral home and an insurance company.  And it was called Christian Benevolent Burial.  My father's mother, whose name was Pearl, my grandmother, started a school in Mobile, a high school.  It was called Emerson Institute [Mobile, Alabama].  And it was the first, to my knowledge, private school for blacks there.  This is something I'd learned recently.  And my grandmother, Pearl died when she was very young.  My father was seven.  His father then moved with him to Chicago [Illinois].  But Pearl's sister was actually--I'm sorry, I'm--my grandmother's name was Alice.  Her sister's name was Pearl.  Anyway, Alice's sister Pearl sent someone who worked for her at the funeral home, to Chicago to kidnap my father from his father.  Because she blamed him for the early death of her sister.  I think she somehow associated it with childbearing.  And it had nothing to do with that.  It was some intestinal infection or something.  And anyway, this person, Mr. Bell, who worked for Pearl brought my father back to Mobile, where he was raised by my aunt and her husband.
Speaker 1: Fascinating story there.  And you said you just learned--you learned some of this?
Speaker 2: Well I just learned that his mother had started a school.
Speaker 1: Tell me--your father--well let me ask first about your mother.  Did she share any stories about her growing up?  Other than what you just recounted?
Speaker 2: Very few, very few.  More of the stories about their growing up, I got from her sisters.  My mother was not proud of her growing up until shortly before she died.  She was proud of--you know, she was proud of certain things.  But she wasn't proud of the economic, you know, basis of when she grew up.  Now socially, she was proud of that.  Because, you know, growing up in Lafayette, Louisiana she was from, you know, one of the important families.  But, of course, to be an important family, an African American important family, you didn't have to have anything at all. You simply had to do.  And her older sisters had gone off to college and in fact, between the time my mother graduated from high school and went off to college, she taught.  I think it was called, Most Holy Rosary Academy [Lafayette, Louisiana].  You know, briefly or something like that.  Her parents were, you know, Catholics.  Her father was an alcoholic.  Never described as, you know, as such.  But he was an affable alcoholic.  And she just never--you know, she never really talked about, about those things.
Speaker 1: Now your father.  Did he share things about growing up? He came from a very prominent family then in many ways.  Don't you--?  Wouldn't you say that?
Speaker 2: Yes, in the context of African Americans in Mobile, Alabama because he, you know.  It was one of the, if not the leading black business for a number of years.  And my aunt--his, you know, his putative mother had, you know, the trappings of being from a prominent family.  And he was spoiled, you know, as he was being raised.  So there--more so I remember people around him telling me things about him.  He was also a CPA [Certified Public Accountant].  And in exchange for gentle services or whatever, you know, he made lots--he bartered with people a lot so that they would give his six children, you know, X service.  And he in turn would do their income taxes.
Story_ID: 4628
Speaker 1: Can you give me your siblings' names and their order?  And where you fit in that?
Speaker 2: Okay, the first one--do you want me to say something about them?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, the first one is Gary Cooper.  And he was a general in the [U.S.] Marine Corps.  And he was actually the first African American to lead troops in battle in the Marine Corps.  And he was also an ambassador to Jamaica.  And he was also interesting.  In the last [George H. W.] Bush administration, he was the assistant secretary of the [U.S.] Air Force.  And then immediately following that, in the [Jimmy] Carter--I mean in the [Bill] Clinton administration, he was our ambassador to Jamaica.  He now lives in Mobile [Alabama].  And he's on, you know, a lot of corporate boards like U.S. [United States] Steel [Corporation].  But--well it's not called U.S. Steel anymore.  It's called U.S.X. [Corporation].  And a number of other, you know, major boards.  He grew up in Mobile.  And he went to [University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana].  My second brother is disease--is deceased.  And he grew up in Mobile.  And he also went to Notre Dame.  And he got married and moved back to Mobile when he graduated from college.  I think he really wanted to be a professor.  He was gay.  He could never really adjust to being gay in Mobile, Alabama.  He eventually left and went to Florida.  But his life was really, really ruined.  And he died because he was gay.  Not because he had AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome].  But because of the kind of life I think he had to lead.  My third brother--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) What's his name? You didn't give--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I'm sorry.  William Madison Cooper, known as Billy.  My next brother is Algernon Johnson Cooper, Jr., known coast to coast as Jay.  And he currently lives in Washington [D.C], where he has his own small law firm.  He was the first--I think he was the first African American official elected in Alabama when he became the mayor of Prichard, Alabama back in about 1971, maybe.  Or something like that, two [1972].  He was really harassed while he was mayor in the house that he lived in then with his family.  You can still see gun shot holes where they tried to assassinate him.  And they tried coming after him in every which way you could possibly imagine.  He was ultimately indicted and charged on something called the Hobbs Act, which is a federal statute that disallows, I think fraud and bribery or something.  He, you know, was totally innocent.  In fact, he was even acquitted by an all-white county jury in about twenty minutes.  But leading up to that, you know, his finances were drained.  His family was, you know, really hurt.  But he eventually moved to Washington, you know, where he remains.  And then I'm Peggy, number four.  Jay also went to Notre Dame by the way.  After me comes my sister Dominique.  And she lives in Marietta, Pennsylvania, which is near York, Pennsylvania, and she is an early childhood teacher in the Waldorf system.  And my youngest brother Mario [Cooper] lives in New York [New York].  And he had a largely political life for a while.  He was--as a young man he was advance person at Carter's administration.  He was the--actually he was the manager of the 1992 Clinton [Democratic National] Convention.  But more importantly, he was the first African American to head up or chair a major AIDS organization in the country.  And he's done a lot of splendid work.  And he's on the board of the Harvard [University School of Public Health, Cambridge, Massachusetts] AIDS Institute. Unfortunately now he has become pretty ill.  But he did some really pioneering work in fighting for minority inclusion in the decisions that were, you know, made about what our community needed in the context of AIDS.  He also worked--he created something called, Leading For Life, which was an effort to get African American and Latino politicians to recognize the fact that there was a terrible problem in our communities and that our people were dying at a faster rate because of HIV [human immunodeficiency virus].  And as you have probably noted, he had some success in that.  And the first African American politician to really, you know, go on record about the black communities' needs with regard to HIV, was [Rev.] Jesse Jackson.  But many, many others have now spoken out about it.  And I know that Julian Bond has been very, very helpful.  As have a number of others.
Story_ID: 4629
Speaker 1: I'd like to talk about--have you talk about your growing up.  And, you know, I'd like you to share maybe some memories.  You know, two or three memories.  You can choose them, of just your, you know, early years in Mobile [Alabama].
Speaker 2: Well I grew up in Mobile, Alabama.  It was at the peak of segregation.  I grew up in a household where my father [Algernon Cooper] was quite an activist.  I grew up in a very Catholic household.  My father was very active in the church, although he was a convert to Catholicism.  When my second oldest brother [William Cooper] was in the eighth grade, my father said to him at dinner one night, "Billy, where would you like to go to high school?"  And Billy said he wanted to go to McGill [McGill-Toolen Catholic High School, Mobile, Alabama], which was a segregated white Catholic school--high school--Jesuit school.  And my father said, "Okay."  And he registered Billy in that school.  The archbishop of the diocese traditionally visited all of the schools on opening day.  When he arrived at McGill, he said to one of the Jesuits, "Isn't that a Cooper I see over there?"  Small town, you know.  And the brother said, "Yes."  And he called Billy over.  And he said, "Get your father on the phone."  And the long and short of it is that he said that we should not attend any of his schools, including the black ones. And at that point, my father started sending us away to boarding school.  Bishop Fulton Sheen had become very good friends with my family some years prior to that--I guess about 1945, because my mother [Gladys Cooper] had made contact with him.  And he had visited our home once when he was in Mobile [Alabama] blessing a new black hospital, because they too were segregated.  And my parents contacted him.  And he, you know, sort of guided them towards [University of] Notre Dame [Notre Dame, Indiana] in terms of college for the boys.  And my sister [Dominique] and I went to St. Mary's Academy of Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana].  That probably had the single biggest effect on me.  There were times when my father had five children in boarding school, college, or graduate school at the same time, and--even though we lived very well.  And even though, you know, I certainly was always asking for something, never had any sense of the financial pressures that, you know, that he was under.  When I was a sophomore in college, as he was on his way to come and visit me with his bags packed and actually in the trunk of his car and his plane tickets on the coffee table in his house in Mobile, he committed suicide.  And I had just talked to him hours prior.  As it turns out he had been embezzling money out of the insurance fund of--out of the--what is it called?  I think the capital reserve that you are required to keep by law to cover X percentage of your premiums if you have an insurance company.  He probably didn't do it alone; I have no idea.  But that's what happened.  And that was devastating.  And it was clear to me how the accumulative effect that all of this had to have had on him.  I'm sure what triggered his suicide, to the extent that one can ever be sure about anything, is that someone must have discovered what he was doing.  But you really can't blame it on the triggering moment.  You know, I think that it's the course of events.  And while it was not right, I have great difficulty and cannot and would not just condemn him more than I would, you know, condemn I think the system that, you know, bred that kind of despair.
Speaker 1: Now why did the, why did the--?  I don't--not the bishop.  But why did he say get--you know, don't have your kids in these school?  Was it because he was--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Because he was angry with my father for having tried to integrate McGill, which was a segregated white school.  And his punishment, you know, was, you know, to do that.  And my father had been extremely helpful in raising money for black Catholics in the church.  And, you know, speaking, and, you know, everything.  So--and my family on my mother's side was intensely Catholic.  I even had a nun who was a cloistered Dominic--I mean--an aunt who was a cloistered Dominican nun for fifty years.  So, you know, it was very difficult for my father to take.  Now my parents would say, "Don't blame the institution, blame the man."  But it's very hard to forget that black Catholic kids had to sit in different parts of the stadium when they had 'plein air' mass.  That when there were parades, black kids had to march last.  That we weren't allowed to go to the same schools, etcetera, etcetera.  And, in fact, the Catholic schools in Mobile integrated a year after the public schools.  So, you know, I think that, that's been--.
Speaker 1: You know, my other--how many black--well I guess there were enough.  But, you know, you think of Catholicism in the South and they seem to be--you think of the South as Baptist.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.  And so--.
Speaker 2: In that coastal area which goes from, you know, Mobile all the way down to Pensacola [Florida], New Orleans [Louisiana], etcetera, you have great concentrations of black Catholics.  It's probably the majority religion amongst black Catholics.  That, you know, Mobile and that area existed under a number of different flags, but there's a large French influence.  And, you know, Mardi Gras actually started in Mobile.  And it started in, I believe the late 1600s even in Mobile and evolved and so forth.  But yes, there's some roots there in large numbers.
Story_ID: 4630
Speaker 1: How was Mobile [Alabama] as a place to grow up?  You know, as it--?  I mean but, you know, you've talked a little about the segregation.  But how was it to grow up in, in many ways?
Speaker 2: I hated it.  And I hated it I think because I felt hemmed in, and I was very conscious of being segregated.  So, you know, I was always mad.  There were other things, you know, there were relationships that I'll cherish forever, like my relationship to the fried oyster.  But, you know, I grew up with a group of kids who were quite active.  And who were very--who were very sharp.  And who were kind of on the cutting edge of change.  I went to school with my sixteenth cousin, Alexis Herman, who was--you know, who became great things, including being [U.S.] Secretary of Labor.  And in the summer after my senior year [at St. Mary's Academy of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana] and the summer before her senior year in high school, we organized a group of kids to test--this was the summer of '64 [1964]--to test the '64 [1964] Civil Rights Act.  And our goal was to go to every restaurant in the Mobile area, and if they didn't serve us, we would file a complaint with the [U.S.] Justice Department.  And so we spent the whole summer doing that.  And when I came here to school, which was at the end of that summer, you know, I got off the plane in an activist mode.  And the first week that I was at GW [George Washington University, Washington, D.C.], there were television cameras there, because someone I had met the day that I got there and I organized a protest against fraternities and sororities because they were being, you know, paid for in part, by my tuition money--which was full tuition.  So I said, "Hmm, this can't be." But a lot of that came from growing up in a place like Mobile.  And that's something I value tremendously, you know, tremendously.  So there--you know, there's this, you know, part of me that really hated it while I was growing up.  But there's this other part of me that wouldn't trade it for anything, because it was a tremendously valuable training ground.
Story_ID: 4631
Speaker 1: Now were your teachers, were they black or were they white?
Speaker 2: The teachers in my school, St. Peter Claver [Catholic School, Mobile, Alabama] were white.  They were nuns.  They belonged to the Order of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, and they were from Michigan.  And there were large numbers of white nuns down and around those areas of the country.  And they saw teaching us really as a mission.  And in fact, our class was the first class--our eighth grade class was the first class that was allowed to take the same exam as the white students had to take for high school admission.  They would always send us some easier exam, because, you know, we were slow compared to white kids.  And this one particular principal, whose name was Mother Maxine, insisted and insisted and insisted that we be administered the same exam.  And she was certain that we did well on it, you know.  And we, you know, beat everybody hands down.
Speaker 1: Now the other--the other question I have--were you taught like others in the South, black history as part of--because, you know, you were--you were being taught by white, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's very interesting.  I don't have an exact recollection, but it was all around us.  Okay, it was taught in school.  We were told things by those nuns about people who we could become.  And, you know, of course, it was in our homes.  And everybody knew what every--you know, what everybody did.  And I know that on Sundays occasionally, we would drive down to Mississippi to hear Leontyne Price, who was very young then, sing in the living room of a friend of her parents.  And we had--and there were people who came through Mobile [Alabama].  So when I was growing up, some of the greats were in our house.  But you just had some sense of urgency about life, born from the oppression. And I'm sure that the energy derived from the early years of the Civil Rights Movement had something to do with inspiring us.
Story_ID: 4632
Speaker 1: Were you shy?  Were you talkative?  Were you, you know, stubborn?  Were you precocious?  I mean what were you like?  You were the fourth child.
Speaker 2: Growing up as the fourth child in my family, I think that I was a bit aggressive.  I was at times contemplative and sad.  But I was stubborn.  I was strong-willed.  I think that it would be fair to say that I was socially--I don't know. I wasn't, I can't say that I was socially maladjusted, because I did have friends, you know.  But I was never into dancing and that kind of thing.  And I don't--my mother [Gladys Cooper] would invite my friends over to the house unbeknownst to me and pay them to get me to dance and teach me how to dance, because I was always, you know, a horrible dancer, you know.  But I had close friends.  I had great friends. And I used to hang out with my friends and I'm sure get into much devilment.  And I was always, I would say, rebellious.  And I was an activist.  But one thing that I think distinguished me as a child, I was always really interested in fairness.  And I always thought that something was wrong about us juxtaposed to those people.  And I completely rejected Jack and Jill [of America, Inc.] which was a social club for, you know, upwardly mobile black folks.  I completely--I would get a couple of my friends to go to parties that I was forced to go to.  And we would throw people in the pool, who were all dressed up and stuff.  And I always had friends from the crowd that was not exactly the socially accepted, you know, Jack and Jill crowd.  I could never ever stand my mother's, you know, kind of take on this.  Which is probably why at least in part why I rebelled.  And, you know, she used to say, "Oh my God "  I'd never dress up.  And she (laughs) you know, always dressed up and stuff.  But that--those things were really the trappings.  I think that I was born with an overdose of empathy.  And, you know, lots of people who get angry with me for being a little unwilling to get off the point of fairness and equity wonder why I'm like that, you know (laughs).  And I--you know, and I can't tell you.  I cannot tell you where it came from.
Speaker 1: And that--you know, you were really the first girl.  And I bet you--having you was a shock to your mother in many ways.  She  probably wanted something frilly.  I had--(laughs) and you were sort of the opposite of that.  You know what I'm saying.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  In fact, she had been dressing my three older brothers as girls for many years out of her desperation to have a girl.  So she was pretty happy.  And it was pretty difficult to wiggle out of those frilly dresses.
Story_ID: 4633
Speaker 1: You go to private school also at [St. Mary's Academy of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana]--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I go to boarding school.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Where?  Now where is the boarding school?
Speaker 2: Ninth grade.  It's in South Bend, Indiana.
Speaker 1: So it's part of Notre--is it part--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, it's not part of [University of] Notre Dame [Notre Dame, Indiana].  It's on the opposite side of town.  And it was really founded for--originally I think it was founded on the campus of Notre Dame for the children of lay professors.  But eventually it moved across town to the Studebaker Estate.
Speaker 1: And by the time you go are you the fourth in your family to go to the boarding school?  Or are you the third or the second?
Speaker 2: I am the second.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so--that's right.  Because it was--okay.
Speaker 2: But the older boys were already at Notre Dame.
Speaker 1: So how was that experience? One 'cause you're--you know, you're away from home and I'm sure it's a strict environment's still there.  But you're away from home.  But you're up in the North and how was that whole experience?  And how does it shape you?
Speaker 2: I think it helped hone my skills as a strategist.  I think it helped teach me about different kinds of white people.  I had never lived in a completely integrated society before, even though that completely integrated society just had a sprinkling of us there.  It was still, you know.  It was very--it was very different.  And I learned about, you know.  I think I learned a lot that served me well.
Speaker 1: Tell me what you learned.  Just a little bit of what you learned.  I mean it's one thing to say, "You know, I learned--you know, I've been in a segregated environment and now I'm integrated."  So what did you--what tangible things did you learn?
Speaker 2: I started thinking then in a way that I probably was doing when I was little.  But I couldn't codify it because I didn't have the vocabulary, okay.  Or the cognitive classification skills--classification skills to do it.  But I started thinking about class, you know.  And I started seeing sharp differences of class within race that--in a way that wasn't black, okay.  I think that I also began to see the difference between white southerners and northern or midwestern southerners.  In that with the white southerners you might know that they're always going to be mean to you or whatever.  But you always knew what the score was, you know.  I began to see that that wasn't always true as I started, you know, dealing with other.  And I started to notice even in terms of the social life.  When I arrived say, in the ninth grade, everything, you know, was fine and everybody was really friendly.  But we had--one of our relationships was with Culver Military Academy [Culver, Indiana]--Culver Military Academy.  And I remember this boy invited me to a dance at Culver.  And it was undone, you know, at some other level.  And I remember his name--well I can't remember his name, but his best friend's name was Ward Lay.  I remember that.  And, you know, it just made you think about more things.  It also made you more--or made me more strategic.
Speaker 1: So you--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) You know, in Mobile [Alabama] you needed a strategy to get through the day when I was growing up, I think.  And at St. Mary's it was different.  But you still had to think about it.
Speaker 1: Did you find--do you find then or now that the--you prefer the southern kind of, well racism? Or do you prefer the northern kind? Or doesn't it matter? You (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Southern.
Speaker 1: Because--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Sourthern, I mean I like to know.  I like to know what I am dealing with.  You know.  In fact one of my greatest flaws I think derives from that.  I'm too direct.  And, you know, in this world in which interpersonal skills are so very important, I err on the side of the truth and the way it is as opposed to the way one should deal with other people, too much.  And I'm finding in fact, as a politician, that's the most difficult, difficult change and adjustment for me to make.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're at--so how many blacks at St. Mary's?  It's St. Mary's right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  Well the first year I was there, I think there were two maybe.  And then by the time I graduated there were maybe six, five.
Speaker 1: So did you--the--when that date was undone, did you--did the little boy, did he do any explaining?  Or it was just undone?
Speaker 2: It was just undone.  He told me actually that--that, you know, he was told, you know, that he couldn't go.  And he told me that he had broken some rule, you know, so he was campused in the terminology.  But that wasn't true.
Speaker 1: And so did you have sort of a dating experience you know, at least, in this cloistered environment?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) In high school?  Very little (laughs).  I think I went to every prom Notre Dame ever had as my brother's date (laughs).  And they came to mine.  And then there were a few guys inbetween.  But virtually no.
Speaker 1: And did--were your--did your brothers interact with you much?  Or you were pretty much on your own over there?
Speaker 2: I saw them pretty much.  I mean we as a school were required to go to all of Notre Dame's football games, you know.  And things like that.  So I saw them probably more than I wanted to see them at the ages of, you know, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen (laughs).
Speaker 1: And so were they protective like older brothers?  Or they weren't?  You know, were you sort of on your own?  Or were they protective?
Speaker 2: I think that they were protective.  But I don't think that they were overbearing.  And I don't think that they insinuated themselves in my life in a way that they should not have.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That's what they do now (laughs).
Story_ID: 4634
Speaker 1: I think that I was heavily influenced by my childhood.  I think that I wanted to forge ahead.  I wanted to be in a position where I could challenge things.  I remember when I went to be--when I went to look at the various campuses to which I had applied, the first school I went to was GW [The George Washington University, Washington, D.C.], and I wouldn't go anywhere else, because at that moment I didn't wanna see another bucolic field, I you know, I didn't want any midwestern corn, nothing.  I--you know, I wanted to hit the sidewalk.  I wanted to hit, you know, hit the blacktop.  And when I went to GW, my interview was in the Dean of Students Office or the women--whatever.  And she knew who I was.  And I thought that was very strange.  And I was really intrigued by that.  And so I said, "If she knows who I am, there must not be very many black students here.  This must be a thing."  And so I started asking questions about the social life of the school.  And it became clear that it was fairly Greek-centered.  And it became clear to me without too much study that it was pretty messed up.  And I really--I made an immediate decision that that's where I wanted to go to school.
Speaker 2: Because it was messed up?  Or was because it was Greek (laughs)?
Speaker 1: Because it was messed up, you know--because it was messed up.  Because you know, I was like, "These people can't just get away with this," you know.  And so I better come here to make sure they don't get away with it. And then, you know, my parents [Oceola Cooper and Gladys Cooper] at that point, particularly my mother, interestingly enough were very set on my going to a Catholic school.  And, you know, there was some distress around that but that was cool.
Speaker 2: So now here you are at GW.  And you decide to major in what?  What are you thinking at that point?
Speaker 1: Well I went through a moment of wanting to be an actress.  But it was always political science, you know, but I minored in theater.
Speaker 2: Had you been in okay, we'll go back.  But had you been in theater? Had you done any theater in high school when you were at St. Mary's Academy [of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana]?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I had done some theater at St. Mary's.  But, you know, doing theater was always an extremely painful experience, because I would be cast as animals and, you know, what have you.  Or characters would be changed, you know, so that I could play them, you know.  But when I got to GW and I became active, I did play a variety of animals.  But another one of the things I did was some things on my own, and that was fun.  Like the Sojourner Truth monologue, 'Ain't I A Woman'.  You know, and that was fun.  And I made some good friends in that theater department.  But again, you know, it showed me that there's only so far you can go before the wall, you know, gets closer to the ceiling (claps hands) and slams shut.

Speaker 1: You already said you had a bent for helping, you know, the world.  And sort of making a difference.  Plus, you said the first week that you were there [The George Washington University, Washington, D.C.] you got publicity.  Because you were try--in--right? Integrating the--.
Speaker 2: Right.  The first week that we were there I met someone named Gregory Millard from Houston, Texas.  And we became instant best friends.  And we had similar views.  And we organized other kids to protest this injustice.  And, you know, in that--that first week the, you know, television cameras were there from the news stations, you know, filming us in our picket lines and interviewing us.  And that was great.  Because it made the university respond much more quickly.  And one of the things that we got to do, was play a major role in drafting a student's--a student bill of rights. And eventually all of the sororities and fraternities changed or were kicked off campus.
Speaker 1: They were?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the--what--with this, what were you saying?  They had to open up to everyone so everyone could join?  Or what were you saying about the Greek organizations?
Speaker 2: Well I didn't really care how they went about solving the problem.  Because I had no desire to join one.  But I thought they had two choices.  One is to get off campus and stop being sort of subsidized effectively by a campus support structure which we all contributed to paying and supporting.  Or they could open up to all students on campus--either one would be fine.
Speaker 1: And you came in, in 1964?  Did you come in?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so this is--?  This is--?  You are--you're taking a page out of the other things that are happening around the country though you got started, you know, in high school.  Did you--? What did your parents think of this at this point?  This activism?
Speaker 2: Well I remember the summer before I came.  Alexis Herman and I created this youth civic organization in which we tested, you know, all of these restaurants.  One night one of us had a car.  One of my friends had a car.  It was all girls.  And we drove to a drive-in.  Remember the kinds of drive-in where you used to be able to drive up to the speakerphone.  And they would, you know, be able to attach a tray to your car.  One of those places.  It was called the White Crystal.  Well we drove up there, and we pushed the button, and we ordered, and no one ever showed up with our food.  And pretty soon, we were surrounded by these young, you know, white sort of, you know, punky boys.  And one of them said, "Y'all Mexicans or y'all's coloreds?"  You know, and, you know, we just ignored them.  But in a flash one of them had spat all over me and thrown Coke in the car.  And there was a state trooper parked two cars down, and did absolutely nothing.  And I felt that if we did anything, we'd be arrested for first degree murder, you know, and sent up the river for life.  So eventually--and our windows were down.  And we were like paralyzed and couldn't--we couldn't get the handle to roll up the window, you know.  And--but eventually--well after then, a group of boys got on the front end of the car, and a group on the back, and they started rocking the car, rocking the car back and forth.  And--you know, but eventually we were able to get away.  We went to my house.  Because I lived closest to the place.  And my mother [Gladys Cooper] opened the door.  And we told her the story.  And she said, "You should have told them you were Mexicans" (laughs).  And I think that, you know, that was partially her defense from being so afraid that we would, you know, really do something crazy and really get--and really get hurt.  And--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I bet--now weren't you frightened by that whole thing?
Speaker 2: No.  I am frightened by it now, and I should have been frightened then.  But you become very defiant, you know, and there's something there that--no matter what, because of what you've grown up with and what you've been taught, and certain, you know, moral standards, idiocy whatever.  You are certainly--I was not afraid. It's a strange and wonderful feeling.
Speaker 1: Now so you and--is it Mal--what was his name?  Millard developed--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Millard.
Speaker 1: Millard.  Developed this friendship.  Is this the first of several things that you're doing that are active?  You know, sort of activism or you, you know, sort of a--I mean a friendship throughout your time at George Washington?  GW?
Speaker 2: Well Greg and I actually remained friends.  He died in 1984 in--I think the first week of October.  But we remained friends until he died, you know, we were good buddies.  And I mean I always had a lot of friends.  And I was always involved in doing, you know, something.
Speaker 1: And were there any people at this time that you admired or you looked up to or wanted to be like?  You know, at this juncture?  Not really.  You wanted to change the world?  What was.--?
Speaker 2: (Laughs) I, at that time, wanted to dominate the world so that I could make it fair, you know.  One of the things that happened when I was a student--I was in undergraduate school--I decided to stay up here for the summer.  I think I had a boyfriend.  And I got a job working at the 12th Street Y [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Association].  But it was really working for the [Washington] D.C. recreation department in a summer youth program.  And I was hired by one person.  And then that person had to go out of town.  Before that--he left, he hired a lot of other kids at this one site, the 12th Street Y.  And then--I'll never forget this.  Mr. Rumsey, the head of rec [recreation] comes back to town.  And says to this other guy, "Well son, you've hired too many people.  I don't know what you expect us to do with all these people."  And so they fired us.  And a lot of the people had come up here from North Carolina.  They had, you know, migrated to Washington.  And they were very young.  And so I said, "You can't do that.  These people have no other means."  And they really ignored me.  But by the time of the weekend before the Fourth of July, they said to me, "We'll give you a job."  And I said, "No, you can't hire me without hiring all of these other people.  And I may have to call the papers."  And the following--I think this was the Tuesday after the 4th of July.  I got a call, which said I should report somewhere.  And I did.  And they had appointed me to be in their Roving Leaders program.  So, you know, I could have a street camp.  And so they gave me the worst street they had--the one that had the most murders, everything.  And I had no idea what it was.  I had never heard of it before.  But I just said "Okay," and I was determined to make it work.  And so I rehired all of those people.  And all but one of them worked out beautifully, and, you know, we had a great summer. But with the budget that I had--it was a great budget.  It was $30,000.  I would buy food for the people who lived on the street where the street camp was. Incredibly poor and neglected street, you know. At one time I got to work, this lady said, "Miss Peggy  Miss Peggy, you have to come here.  You have to help."  And she took me to her back yard.  And there was a guy, dead guy lying there covered with maggots, and she couldn't get any city service to respond.  And so I had a cousin who was a doctor, and I called him, and he happened to know some guy in the public health service, and you know, and they did it.  But, you know, again that puts just in clear view inequity.  Because in this horrible neighborhood you could have a dead guy lying around for two days.  But, you know, over where we lived you couldn't have that.

Speaker 1: At what point are you deciding that you wanna go on to law school?
Speaker 2: At no point (laughs).  At no point, actually.  I had gotten very involved by my senior year [at The George Washington University, Washington, D.C.] in wanting to create a high school for the arts.  Which is another story.
Speaker 1: So tell me--okay, then I want to know that story then.  I didn't think it happened that early.  If, you know--.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But my parents [Oceola and Gladys Cooper], particularly my mother--and my parents were divorced by then--really worried about my not having something to fall back on.  And I figured, "You know, if I don't, you know, do something now, I'll never do it.  And this way, at least, I can be sure that they'll support me for a couple more years."  And so I, you know, enrolled in law school.  And I decided, "Well I had to stay here.  Because of--I had started working on the school."  And there was a guy at GW [The George Washington University, Washington, D.C.], a pretty well-known constitutional law professor, named Monroe Freedman--who subsequently became the dean of a law school, I think at Cornell [University School of Law, Ithaca, New York].  And he was a terrific constitutional law mind.  And somehow we met.  And he said, "You've got to come here."  And I said, "You know, sure."  And I ended up, you know, getting a full scholarship to law school.
Story_ID: 4637
Speaker 1: We started something at GW [George Washington University, Washington, D.C.] called the Black Student's Union [sic, Black Student Union].  It's now called the Black People's Union.  But during the course of that--I wasn't the president of that.  But I became the chairman of a black cultural weekend that we did under the banner of the Black Student's Union.  And in the course of putting on that weekend--it was really my first real foray into the city, deep into the city.  And I got to know a lot of people, and we brought lots of people to campus.  And we also brought a lot of kids to campus.  And I was talking to someone I had met during that weekend, [Michael] Mike Malone, who was a graduate student at the time at Georgetown [University, Washington, D.C.], working on his masters in French. And we were standing around talking.  And I said, "You know, I've seen so many talented kids in [Washington] D.C. since I've been working on this.  And it's terrible that they don't have anywhere to go.  And their talents so raw and unpolished."  And he said, "Why don't you start a school?" You know, and I felt like Julie Garden--Judy Garland, you know (laughs).  And--what is it--? What was his name? Audie Murphy or something.  Let's put on a show.  But I actually wrote a three-page proposal shortly thereafter, which is kind of--the thought is kind of laughable now.  And I took it to Lloyd Elliott, who was then the president of GW.  And whom I had come to know quite well.  Because he kept strong relationships with a few of us, wanting to assure that we didn't burn his campus down or something.  And, you know, and I said, "President Elliott, I've got this great idea.  Would you be willing to give us space and give us money and etcetera?"  And he agreed that I could do it.  And that summer--and I raised money.  I raised quite a bit of money for my age, having no idea what I was doing.  And by the end of the summer, we had ninety students.  And it was called Workshops for Careers in the Arts.  I had decided that if I told anyone I wanted a full high school, they would think that I was nuts and they would, you know, be very dismissive.  And so what we did--and then Mike came in as my partner, and what we did was build or create a program that was a summer training program.  Then it was high school in summer.  And then it was released time from school in after school and summer.  And I said high school before. And I misspoke.  But then I started realizing; "I'm raising over a million dollars a year now.  This is not gonna continue to happen."  And so I started lobbying the school system to give us a building, and to designate us as a public school.  And I prior to that had made a ten-year agreement with GW, saying, "You support us and let us use your campus.  And let us raise money under your name for ten years.  And then we'll be off campus."  Well we beat the mark by--we beat the mark by a lot.  And we beat the mark by four years.  And in 1974, we opened as the Duke Ellington School of the Arts at our present location, at 3500 R Street.  And we took over what had been a [Washington] D.C. public school.

Speaker 1: That's a picture of me that appeared on--that appeared in a magazine called 'Museum and Arts Washington'.  And it was called 'The Queen of the Arts'. And it was a feature length profile of me. And it was about ten years ago, I think. Ten years ago being about 1990 or something like that.

Speaker 2: I'll call you right back.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: My relationship with my kids has been very special for any number of reasons. Zachary, in particular, because I tried so very hard to have a child and he was the first in vitro child conceived and born in Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: Now, how old is he now?
Speaker 2: Sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay. Oh, he's sixteen?
Speaker 2: So, you see how long ago--that should be about '87 [1987], he looks about three.

Speaker 1: The picture on the left was taken during a period which I had to speak at the Institute for the Humanities at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  And it was a very interesting trip because I went with Roger Stevens who was really the founder of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts [Washington, D.C.].  And he had gone to the University of Michigan and he was about a hundred years old. He's since died. And, you know, it was just very interesting, him taking me to all of his haunts. He grew up in Ann Arbor and he had also gone to school there. And became a very wealthy Broadway producer. It was an interesting weekend for me.

But also, his cousins are also really good friends of my, my Iranian buddies. I have no idea where this picture came from. I'm sure it looks like it was taken by one of my children in some weary, unguarded moment--the one on the right, that is. I used this picture as my--on my campaign poster and it evidently fooled enough people 'cause I got elected.

Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Ma'am, can you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Peggy Cooper Cafritz, P-E-G-G-Y, Peggy, Cooper, C-O-O-P-E-R, and Cafritz, C-A-F-R-I-T-Z.
Speaker 1: And ma'am, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Four, seven, forty-seven [April 7, 1947], Mobile, Alabama--very impolite of you to ask that.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And what is your position and occupation?
Speaker 2: My--well, that's a little difficult to say (laughter) these days.  My occupation right now is getting my life back together; but I help to raise money for Duke Ellington School of the Arts [Washington, D.C.], and I am also involved with a number of kids personally, who either go or have gone there.  I'm on the governing board of the school and I'm also on The Ellington Fund [Washington, D.C.] board, which is a foundation that I established many years ago, close to the beginning, so that we would have a mechanism to raise private monies without regard to the public school system.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date?  I think it's--is it the 25th or 26th (laughter)?
Speaker 1: It's the 26th [June 26, 2012], I was looking at it to make sure myself, and yes, the 26th.
Speaker 2: You know, doctors ask you that when they're trying to figure out if you have Alzheimer's or if you're crazy, so I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: The beginning of our interview often sounds that way, but we're not trying to probe for that; that's just how we slate it 'cause it's history.
Speaker 2: Is it the 25th or 26th?
Speaker 1: It's the 26th, yeah.
Speaker 2: It's the 26th; that's right 'cause Thursday is the 28th, I know that.
Speaker 1: And the year?
Speaker 2: Twelve--2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: In my condo (laughter).
Speaker 1: I know this sounds suspicious, but--(laughter).
Speaker 2: It sounds so weird to say in my condo.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  And we're finishing an interview that we--we're proceeding with an interview that we started--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Many years ago--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --in April of 2001 [sic. June 26, 2001]--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --so that's eleven years ago.  So, ma'am, we were talking--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I was much younger (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay; we all were (laughter).
Story_ID: 671695
Speaker 1: But we were talking about George Washington University [Washington, D.C.]; we had you at George Washington, and we had just completed a summary of how you started Duke Ellington [Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I wanna go back to George Washington and just ask a few other questions, I think, that may not have been covered when we interviewed you the first time because of a time crunch, I guess--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but how did you choose George Washington?
Speaker 2: You mean how did I choose it in terms of where I went to college (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, I had gone to a boarding school in Indiana, St. Mary's Academy of Notre Dame [St. Mary's College, South Bend, Indiana], and I really wanted--I did not want to see a blade of bla- grass for the rest of my life (laughter) after that.  And I also--the reason I had gone to that school--or the reason I had gone to boarding school in high school was, of course, because of the segregated schools in Alabama.  But when I came--I also--another thing, I wanted to be a politician, and I'm sure I wanted to president or something (laughter), and so I--stupidly, I decided that--well, not necessarily stupidly, but if I wanted to be a politician, I should go to school in Washington [D.C.].  Actually, if I wanted to be a politician, I should have gone to school in a state where elective offices existed.  But nonetheless--then, when I saw GW--I, I looked at other schools here, and my parents [Gladys Mouton Cooper and Algernon Cooper, Sr.] were fairly insistent that I go to a Catholic college.  I, in fact, became the first person in my family to go to a non-Catholic school, which was college, which was GW, my brothers [Gary Cooper, William Cooper and HistoryMaker A. J. Cooper, Jr.] having gone to Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But when I saw GW and I saw all of that concrete, and also, I did look at their political science and--I mean it just--it excited me, you know?  It really did.  So that's why I picked it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --initially.
Speaker 1: So you started in what year?  When was this, nineteen sixty--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 1: Sixty-four [1964], okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So this is right after Freedom Summer, and all the activities that SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] had down in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yes, but--but a lot of stuff was still going on, so it was--you know, I hate being old, I can't stand it; I wanna be twenty again.  I wanna live my life over again, but--if I had to pick a time, you know, in the last century, in which to grow up, I would have picked that time.  It was exciting, and it was incredibly instructive--an amazing training ground, I think.
Story_ID: 671696
Speaker 1: From what I saw of the last interview, there's a implication that you--you were keenly aware of Freedom Summer and all the activities going on.
Speaker 2: I was.
Speaker 1: The signing of the civil rights bill [Civil Rights Act of 1964], and all that, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.  I mean you couldn't grow up in Mobile, Alabama without being acutely aware.  In fact, I think--I don't know what I said in the last interview; I barely know what I said yesterday, but the summer after my senior year in high school [St. Mary's Academy of Notre Dame; St. Mary's College, South Bend, Indiana], before my freshman year in college [George Washington University, Washington D.C.], my cousin, [HistoryMaker] Alexis Herman, who's my--I don't know--fourth cousin, you know, five times removed or something (laughter) but, you know, we grew up together.  We started something called the Youth Civic Organization [ph.], and we decided--and I think we did it because we really wanted to be involved, and our parents wouldn't let us go anywhere (laughter).  "March?  Montgomery Selma [Selma to Montgomery March]?  Are you crazy?"  (Laughter) You know.  And so we decided to start something, and we decided to gather up all of our friends and get very organized, and we got a list of every entity that sold food in the area, and we decided that we were going to send two to four of us to each of those establishments and--to get served, and when we were not served, we would file a complaint with the justice department because that was also the year of Johnson's [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], you know, great Civil Rights Act.  And that was really--that was really quite a summer, and I mean one of the kids got his arm broken; two of my friends and I--girls--went to this drive-in and--you're too young to remember this (laughter), but there were these drive-ins, they had microphones that you pulled into, and then, you know, the little, you know, chicks would come out with their trays and stuff with--well, we pulled up, we ordered, and we sat and we sat, and we ordered again, and we sat and we sat.  There was an Alabama highway patrolman about two cars down.  At some point, as we were waiting to be served, I think, still somewhat optimistic that we would be served, these white teenagers came up to the car and--I think there were two of them on my side, and one of 'em on the other side, and they said, "Y'all's Mexicans or y'all's niggers?"  And so we--and that, that was like the, the, the first moment, okay?  And I said something like, "Neither."  And we had not yet started using African American, okay?  But so we said, "Neither, we're black."  So these kids sat--a couple of 'em sat on the front of the car and a couple sat on the back of the car.  And actually, I think there ended up being five kids as they, you know, started teasing us more.  Now, before these kids sat on the front and back of the car and started rocking it back and forth, one of--after I said, "We're neither, we're black," they spat on me and, you know, called us names.  And then on the other side, the kid on the other side threw a coke in the window.  Now, we were too paralyzed with fear; we're trying to be cool, you know (laughter)?  We were brave, but we were too paralyzed with fear to have sense enough to roll up the windows, you know (laughter).  We were like, (makes sound).  So when these kids sat on the car and started, you know, rocking it like that, we started talking to one another sort of (unclear) and, "We gotta leave, we gotta get out of this place, and if the cop--if we run over--we could run over one of these boys."  (Laughter) "If we run over one of these boys, we'll be tried for murder and put in jail for the rest of our lives."  You know, we were having ridiculous conversations, and at some point we decided--this friend of ours, named Lolita [ph.], start--blew the horn and when she blew it, she did it really loudly and all of sudden, and they, you know, jumped off the car 'cause they had no idea what was coming.  And we immediately left--yeah, we immediately left.
Speaker 1: Close call.
Speaker 2: And my house was (laughter)--my house was the closest house to this--White Crystal [ph.]--was it called White Crystal or something like that.  And my mother [Gladys Mouton Cooper]--my mother came to the door (laughter), and she looked at us and said, "What happened?"  And we told her, and she said, "You idiots!  You should have told them you were Mexican" (laughter).  I went, "Oh."  But she eventually came around.

Speaker 1: Parents, I think, were so afraid, and I think that, you know, middle--upper middle class parents were ridic- unnecessarily afraid or even more afraid because, you know, they read so much about what was going on that they probably envisioned us dangling from a rope somewhere.  So I never--I never forgot that, and I spent much time going forward making sure that my mother [Gladys Mouton Cooper] changed, you know?  That she knew that that was really a whack thing to do.
Speaker 2: You all fell you--felt you really had to do something that day--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: We did and, you know, as teenagers who are fairly, you know, activists in our own schools or whatever, you know, we had to be involved (laughter); we had to be doing something, you know.  And there were other--in the Catholic church--my family's Catholic; you know, I had an aunt who was in the--a Dominican monastery for--cloistered for like, you know, seventy years.  But the Catholic church was horrible, okay?  If we went to Mass out of our neighborhood to the city cathedral, we had to sit in the last pews on the right; we could not go to communion until after all the white people went to communion.  Every year, there was a parade called the Christ the King Parade [ph.], and it was every September, as I recall, and all of the schools marched in it.  And the bishop, Bishop Toolen [Thomas Joseph Toolen], said a en plein air mass in a field, the name of which I forget, but it will probably come to me.  And I don't know if I mentioned it before or not, but any--a Ladd Stadium [Ernest F. Ladd Memorial Stadium; Ladd-Peebles Stadium, Mobile, Alabama], that was the name of it, in--a Ladd Stadium--pretty good, Peggy [HistoryMaker Peggy Cooper Cafritz].  And I wasn't there; I was away in boarding school [at St. Mary's Academy of Notre Dame; St. Mary's College, South Bend, Indiana], but [HistoryMaker] Alexis Herman and my sister, Dominique Cooper, they decided that they were fed up with marching last and--oh, and they were also seated in a segregated part of the stadium away from, you know, the white Catholic school children.  And so they got there early, and there was always a tent set up for the bishop--a private tent where, you know, he prepared for all of his Mass; and there was a table, almost like an altar table that had a table cloth on it, and so they hid under this table, and when the bishop came in, they jumped out and they said, "Why do you do this?"  And, again, I wasn't there, but from what they tell me, you know, he was just as red--as red as a beet, you know.  And Alexis, who was in high school by then, she went to Most Heart of Mary [Most Pure Heart of Mary School, Mobile, Alabama]; she really got in trouble.  Dominique less so because she was younger, I think, and they decided that Alexis convinced this younger innocent to participate with her; that wasn't quite the case, but--fortunately, you know, Dominique didn't get in trouble but I mean he, he was not--he was not, he was not a good man, and he was certainly not a Christian, you know?
Story_ID: 671698
Speaker 1: I would get so angry, you know; sometimes I would just seethe about, you know, all of these things and all of these people.  Even though I knew that, you know, we were taught to turn our anger, you know, into energy--constructive energy.  Now, I think that most of us try to do that; but even to this day, when I think about it--and I've gone for, you know, many years without being--you know, what I say I have tactile anger, you know, but I went for many years without having suppressed it, you know, so I could do--accomplish what I needed to accomplish.  But I still think about it, and I probably--I think I think about it more now, you know.  I was talking to one of my children the other day, and--I have two sons [Zachary Cafritz and Cooper Cafritz], and I have a very, very, very (coughs) casual relationship with them (laughter); they think I'm nuts.  So Zachary told me that he was dating someone, and I asked if she was black and he said, "No," and he says, "But I'm really tired of your asking me that; it should not matter, it should not matter at all."  And then we got into a long conversation about his friends, you know, and my friends, and the way that black parents react, the way that white parents react when their child, you know, brings home someone of a different race.  And Zach said that he thought that black parents--he thought they were quick to get over it but, you know--he thought that black parents reacted much more, and made their preferences for their son marrying somebody black much more known, you know, than the parents of his friends who are white, you know, which--you know, that's pretty fascinating because a long time ago, it was the opposite, and if somebody, you know, white brought home somebody black, their parents would really, you know--would really flip.  But as I was--one thing, I really try to be conscious of not wanting to visit upon my kids my racial baggage because their experience of growing up in America is completely and totally different from mine.  And while I want them to understand the history, and while I want them to, you know, empathize, you know, with the history, I do not want them--I really do not want them to carry the weight of the emotions, you know, that we went through back then.  And I was really, you know, I was really conscious of it as they were growing up, but as the kids have gotten older, you know, I'm much more open about teasing them, you know, and stuff.  But I was thinking the other night when I was talking to Zach, you know, he doesn't know how serious I am, or how lacking in seriousness I am, you know, or how I'm goading him or what.  You know, he's taking this completely and totally seriously.  I think it's something that we, as black parents, really have to be conscious of.  Not as we--you know, I'm not one to promote or push post racial America; we're far from being there, but I am one, you know, to, to recognize the history of it all.
Story_ID: 671699
Speaker 1: Now, well--so, fall of 1964 at, at George Washington University, had--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you ever been to Washington, D.C. before?
Speaker 2: Well, I had; in fact, I came to see the colleges that--I'm not sure when--that fall or spring, whenever, and when I went to GW, I had an appointment with the dean of women.  I had already done some research, and I knew that their sororities were segregated and, you know, so I was really chaffing at the bit for this meeting (laughter), and that was a lot of fun.  And I did ask her about it, you know?  And she was very proper, and I was certain that she was from a rather wealthy family; probably in the Richmond [Virginia] area (laughter), and she had on, you know, cakes of red lipstick, and she was as graceful as could be.  And she definitely flinched, you know, when I asked her, but she said, "You know, I don't really think that's something that you have to worry about," you know, which registered.  So, when I got to GW in the fall, the first day I was there, I met a guy, a kid, from Texas named Gregory Millard.  I met another young man from Florida, from Miami, whose family started the newspaper there, whose name was Russ Jollivette [Cyrus "Russ" Jollivette], and there were a few others.  And eventually, there were several more, and--in fact, Vincent Gray [Vincent C. Gray], who is our current mayor [of the District of Columbia], was in graduate school then, there.  But they start rush, you know, basically, as soon as you get there, and so Greg and I started, you know, talking about that, and we, neither of us, wanted to be in a fraternity or sorority, you know?  We thought we might die; but we also thought that they had no right to take our tuition and then pay the salary of someone who spent a majority of her time dealing with fraternities and sorority and Hellenic issues.  And so we--one of the things we did was we set up picket lines and we called the press (laughter), and I think--and they were like, "How do they know what they're doing?"  You know (laughter), but--and I don't know how we knew what we were doing (laughter), but I think maybe--I think growing up in the South, you know, and watching everything, and you, you grow up with a sense of strategy; I know my dad [Algernon Cooper, Sr.] told me that every action, you know and--requires a strategy (laughter), so maybe that was it.  But anyway, ultimately, the sororities and fraternities were thrown off campus, and they were not allowed to come back until they had clearly lifted the ban on accepting people of color.
Speaker 1: It sounds like you had friends in the administration; and maybe unknown at that time, but it seems like they were--if the administration acted in that way, it seems like there was someone there who was independent--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Ultimately, ultimately, you know.  But remember, Washington was hot, you know; and it was getting hotter, okay?  And I--and, and Greg and I talked about this quite a bit--how it was important for one of us to be able to not make them so angry that we couldn't go and meet with them, okay?  So one of us had to be nice and reasonable while the rest of us had to be more challenging, and so I was the one who usually met with him.  At that time, the president of George Washington was Lloyd Elliott [Lloyd Hartman Elliott], and I believe--I'd have to research this, but I think that was his first year as well, or the other guy [Thomas H. Carroll] was leaving and he was coming in, or something like that, okay?  And he was from Maine.  And I actually got along with him wonderfully; and he thought--you know, we, we--we had, we had lots of talks and we had--we had lots of challenges then, and one of the things that we were--that Greg and I did was to write a student bill of rights at GW; I wonder whatever happened to that (laughter).
Story_ID: 671700
Speaker 1: And then we became friends with people in the law school [George Washington University Law School, Washington, D.C.] and I think in graduate school, and we started--now I did not start this, but we were involved in starting a black student union; it is now called the Black People's Union, okay?  And--but that didn't happen until after, after I left.
Speaker 2: Now, I have a question here; now this is 1964, or is it later, now that black student union starts?
Speaker 1: You know, I'm just trying to sort of sink that in my mind.  It was between '64 [1964] and '68 [1968], okay (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Because the terminology--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: But it was closer to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but it was closer to '64 [1964]; like '64 [1964], '65 [1965], '66 [1966].
Speaker 2: 'Cause the terminology of black, then; I know it wasn't universally used all over America in those days--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, it was not--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --we were still Negroes in most--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, we were black.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We were black.  I don't--I, I, I, I don't ever remember calling myself Negro--even in high school, and I think that Greg [Gregory Millard] was equally conscious of that; I think the people around us were, you know, and I don't think that you could go back and find anything I wrote (laughter), you know, that--my senior paper in high school [St. Mary's Academy of Notre Dame; St. Mary's College, South Bend, Indiana] was on Emmett Till, which had just happened, basically, and, you know, it was fresh in my mind; but no, I--no, unh-uh.
Speaker 2: So you all were ahead of the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: We were black (laughter)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --the terminology curve 'cause the--we were still Negroes in Dayton [Ohio] in '68 [1968] (laughter).  In '69 [1969] we became black--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay, no--I think that other people referred to us as Negroes--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --okay?  I think--I'm not sure, for instance, when The Washington Post or the Jet (laughter), or Ebony, or whatever, changed their terminology, I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: I think around '68 [1968], '69 [1969]; between the two.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: What happened with this--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: But it took goading for them to do that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, it may be a connection here 'cause I know Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture], and I forget the--Willie Ricks [Mukasa Dada], I think, coined the term Black Power in '65 [1965] on that march.  So--but I mean that's not to say nobody was using it before then--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but they may have emanated here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], the use of black for, you know, or the popular origin of the term--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not--I'm not, I'm not sure.  But even in Alabama--you know, I'm just thinking, although I think older people used it; I mean some people still use colored, you know, but we use colored as sort of a, you know, not a--like a joke, like an affirmative, you know, embracing joke (laughter), okay?  But Negro--no.  In fact, when I was at GW [George Washington University, Washington, D.C.], in my junior year, I chaired something called the Black Arts and Culture Weekend [ph.] or something--or festival, I think, okay?  And in fact, [HistoryMaker] Sam Gilliam and Lloyd McNeill did the poster for me, and--what's his name, the great printer?  Lou--I'll think of it in a minute--printed it, you know, and he became one of the best producers of art prints in the country. [HistoryMaker] Lou Stovall--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Lou, Lou Stovall, yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Lou Stovall, yeah, yeah, yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it just came to me.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, I was so lucky because this was my first foray into Washington, and one of my goals was to bring the city into the campus, and in preparing for it, I knew that I had to just, you know, reach out and try to, you know, meet people, and get them to help.  And I--not quite sure how I did it but that's how I, you know, that's how I met them.  And everyone, absolutely everyone, was wonderful, and definitely the term of art was black.
Speaker 2: In '66 [1966], the Black Panther Party started up in California.
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: The Black Panther Party started in '66 [1966]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Black Panther Party started in California--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, '66 [1966], yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm.  So I--you know, I don't know.  And I know that that summer I told you about?  We were black, you know, and--we were black.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we were, we were something to deal with; and there were girls (laughter), you know, in the leadership.
Story_ID: 671701
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, anyway, I was just telling you about Julieanna [Julieanna Richardson] (laughter), and how incredibly proud I am of her; and one of the reasons is, of course, collecting our history is very, very important.  But, in addition, this is in--HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers], you know, is an institution with staying power, and outside of our universities being--you know, historically black colleges [HBCUs], you know, we do not have, and certainly in the arts, very many institutions that are forty years old, and that's, you know, it's stunning to me that when I found--when I started thinking about that.  I mean here there's the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum [Anacostia Community Museum, Washington, D.C.], but that's really a part of the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.], you know.  But, in terms of things that were started by, you know, run by, organically, you know, African American, it is--it's terrible, and I think that all of us have to do everything we can to make sure that those that we do have are sustained, and to start others that can be.
Story_ID: 671702
Speaker 1: Now, we, we were talking about George Washington [George Washington University, Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in 1966--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry for my tangent.
Speaker 1: And--no, no, that's fine.  But you were talking about chairing the Black Arts and Culture Festival [ph.]--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: --working with [HistoryMaker] Sam Gilliam, [HistoryMaker] Lou Stovall and others.  Who, and--who and what situations inspired you to get to that point?  Now you're in school now for two years when you get to a point where you wanna sponsor this black cultural arts festival.  So who were some of the teachers, the students, the events in the city that inspired you to do that?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  I mean I, I just thought of it; I was always interested--I was always interested in the arts, and I was always interested in African American culture because when we were growing up, you know, you couldn't go anywhere, you couldn't see anything, you know, except for when we took trips in the summer to Chicago [Illinois] or Detroit [Michigan]--mostly Chicago, you know; there might be something, but not even that much there, okay?  And, you know, never far from my mind.  And I also had--I had a political relationship with the arts from the beginning--from the very beginning, and I thought that, you know, if we had this festival, it would help coalesce us as a student body.  But it would help in so many ways--with our kids who went to GW; meeting people--really successful African Americans who lived in the city, you know; they would be able to make those connections.  And then by bringing a lot of little kids from the city onto the campus, they could see college students and, you know--and I--I still see all of this as sort of concentric circles, you know, that are just blocked, and I think that remains true; and to the extent we don't see that, we're not being as effective, you know, as we could.  But I--I mean, I--well, I'll jump a little bit.  Mike Malone, who I think I met through Vincent Gray [Vincent C. Gray], actually--I think back, I think I met through Vincent Gray.  But--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now, Mike Malone is black, right?
Speaker 2: Black, yeah; and he was in graduate school--in French--at Georgetown [Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.], but, he was really a dancer slash choreographer, and he had started working in the summers for the D.C.  rec--recreation department [District of Columbia Department of Parks and Recreation], and at that time, every year the recreation department did a big musical production, and Mike, I am told, was, you know, in charge of directing and choreographing it; so, you know, he knew a lot, and he was a great help.  Now, when he--well, at the festival, okay, we were partners, you know?  We ended up, I guess, kind of doing the festival together, I'm not quite sure and--but anyway, some of the kids from the city performed and, you know, we had these outdoor stages and, you know, I said, "Mike, it's a shame that these kids don't have any training, because if you really look, you can see some glimmer of talent."  And this is the God's honest truth, he looked at me and said, "Well, why don't you start a school?"  And, you know, I felt like Judy Garland or something (laughter).  What was it--Judy Garland and Audie Murphy (laughter) had those kinds of conversations in the movies.  But I said, "Okay, let's do it."
Story_ID: 671703
Speaker 1: And so, that Sunday night I stayed up virtually all night and I wrote a three page proposal, not to--and I talked to Greg [Gregory Millard] about it.  And the strategy was that I would not say that I wanted a high school for the arts because everybody would think that we were crazy, but instead that we wanted a summer training program, and we would do this in blocks, and every year--or every summer and then every year, we would add blocks (laughter), and Greg and I talked about that far into the night.  Now, Mike [Mike Malone] was more--Mike was purely the arts, okay?  He was not--he was not a strategist and he was not a salesman of himself, although he was brilliantly talented; he died a few years ago, unnecessarily.  But anyway, Greg was also deceased; he was one of the first people who died of AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome].  He--and I--you know, we just used to talk about all of these, you know--we tried to wrap everything we wanted to do in a strategy, you know, with a specific goal at the end of it.  And so, anyway, Lloyd Elliot [Lloyd Hartman Elliott], the president [of George Washington University, Washington, D.C.]--I went to get an appointment; I went to see him, and I said something like, "You know, you've made reference to the need for the university to become more involved in the city, and I think I've come up with an idea that can help you."  And I presented this notion, okay?  And we decided that we would call it workshops--Greg and I decided that we could call it Workshops for Careers in the Arts, and that's what we would be until we became a high school.  And so Elliot said--Dr. Elliot--said, "I will," he says, "Well, what do you need?"  And I said, "Well, I need space, I need an office, I need money, I need assistance," et cetera, et cetera.  He said, "Okay, I can do all of that but you have to raise the money."  And I said, "What?  Are you nuts?"  (Laughter) And he said, you know, something like, "I think you'll do a fine job with it."  And he said--actually, in a second conversation, okay?  I asked if we could represent ourselves as a program of the university, and the university actually had something, a division called sponsored research, and so he let us--he, you know, put us under that.  And so we were able to present ourselves, you know, as a GW program; and then also, he introduced me to a man named Henry Strong, who had spent many years in the CIA but had just come back to run his family's foundation; it's called the Hattie M. Strong Foundation, and they gave me our first grant.
Speaker 2: How do you spell Strong?
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: Is this S-T-R-O-U--
Speaker 1: S-T-R-O-N-G, like (gesture).
Speaker 2: Oh, Strong, okay; Foundation; Hattie M. Strong Foundation.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And then I figured that we needed $90 thousand for that summer, and we had--I don't think we called them departments, but--anyway--but we had units so to speak, and we had dance and we had music and we had, you know, visual arts and everything.  And I mean it was kind of structured the way you would want a high school structured in a little itty bitty sense.  And then as--and we really did, I mean we got all the kids we needed, you know?  It was fabulously successful.  We got a lot of press.
Story_ID: 671704
Speaker 1: How did you recruit the kids?  I'm just curious.
Speaker 2: We asked the recreation department [District of Columbia Department of Parks and Recreation], we sent flyers to schools, we put flyers in churches, and then I remember asking some adults (laughter) if they knew people who were in social work or, you know, anything like that--wherever we could put stuff, you know, we did.  And that's how.
Speaker 1: So was it open for any--did the kids have to audition [for Workshops for Careers in the Arts], or did they--
Speaker 2: They had to audition, yes, but we accepted almost everyone, you know--yes.  And we had, we had a mix of kids; we had some kids who were from families who, for generations, had been under the, you know, poverty line and, you know, and who were really victims of--as Leon Dash [HistoryMaker Leon DeCosta Dash] might--you know--of that generational poverty.  And we had kids who were, you know, upper middle class kids and were--we had a few kids who were upper middle class but we had, you know, a strong contingent of middle class, and we had a few white kids.  Dustin Hoffman's nephew was in that first summer, and it was, you know--it was a heady time, certainly for me (laughter).
Story_ID: 671705
Speaker 1: And there were certain things--I talked to my father [Algernon Cooper, Sr.] and--about fundraising [for Workshops for Careers in the Arts] and, you know, and the conversation was probably like, "How am I going to do this?"  And he--you know, he told me several things.  He said--well, a couple of things I remember; one was, "When you ask someone for money, you have to leave them thinking that you are doing them a favor by letting them give to such a wonderful cause; think of how fulfilling that will be for them," and I remember that to this day.  And another thing he told me that was brilliantly helpful to me was, "When you meet somebody from whom you can ask money, ask them if they will introduce you to one or two other people who could do the same, and that way," and I'll never forget this, "you'll build a spider web and it will get larger and larger and larger if you're successful."  So--and that really was--that really was tremendously helpful.  And that summer, I had asked the city for money, which we got at the--we got $30 thousand from them at the very, very, very, very last minute, you know?  So that's 60 thousand, and then the 30 thousand left that we had to raise, as I recall, I raised it from a whole bunch of people, okay?  And then the following year, I think, okay?  I have to check, but I think we had our first benefit, you know, to raise money more generally, but all the time writing proposals for foundations, trying to figure out how I can get a meeting with--Mack [ph.] was his nickname--the guy who was the head of the art and culture at the Ford Foundation [New York, New York]--ah!  I can't remember his name but I'll get it; but he was an icon, and to get a meeting with him would be like--(makes sound).  You know?  And I finally did with the help of, I think it was George Stevens [George Stevens, Jr.], who was the head of the American Film Institute [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Georg Stevens, the director.
Speaker 1: He was the director--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and his father [George Stevens] was the really, really famous director who directed 'Giant' and, you know, everything.  But George won Academy Awards for directing documentaries, you know.  And then, I think, I met a woman named Nina--I'm having a moment--Nina Hyde, okay, who was an unbelievable woman, and she was the head of the style section at The Washington Post, so she knew lots of the social people here in town, and she was so incredibly generous about, you know, introducing me to people who could help and from whom I could raise money.  And then sometimes I just did crazy stuff like Geraldine Fitzgerald was here in, I think it was 'Long Day's Journey' ['Long Day's Journey into Night,' Eugene O'Neill], with Jason Robards, at Ford's Theatre [Washington, D.C.], and I made my way backstage after it was over (laughter); I--I mean I really made my way before they completely--you know, before they threw me out; they were not happy, and--and they kept trying to, you know, like--I think they were afraid to like grab my arm or something, but it was close.  But anyway--so I met Geraldine Fitzgerald, and the reason I wanted to meet her is that I had recently read that she had started a street theater company [Everyman Theatre] in New York [New York], and Mike [Mike Malone] and I had been talking about doing a street theater here as a culmination, you know, of the summer in a way that could involve all of the students, you know, whether they were actors or not, okay?  And it was--so, I thought well, you know, she's done it in New York, so she should be able to help advise, you know.  I'm, I'm sure I can learn a lot from, you know, Geraldine Fitzgerald who is, you know, an actress that I had always admired.
Story_ID: 671706
Speaker 1: Well--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Let me just--let me just go back and get the dates now; the date--you started the group [Workshops for Careers in the Arts] the summer of--is this '66 [1966] or '67 [1967]?
Speaker 1: Actually, the first summer was, I think, '67 [1967]; let me think.  The black arts festival--is it possible for me to plug in these dates later?
Speaker 2: Well, we just--we'll be in the ballpark; this is just a source, like any other source, so anybody watching this--it's either '66 [1966] or '67 [1967], right?
Speaker 1: Right; it was, you know, right, right, right; I mean, I don't--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They can find it, but I just wanted you to give us--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right, but I don't wanna, you know, be untruthful, you know.  And--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So the program, you know, started--it was either '66 [1966] or '67 [1967]; we're unsure right now, but anybody can look it up once we get done.  It's already written, so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, it was--it was '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1967]?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was '67 [1967] because--let's see; '64 [1964], '65 [1965], '65 [1965], '66 [1966], I would have been a sophomore [at George Washington University, Washington, D.C.], you know, and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It started when you were a junior? Is that what you're saying?
Speaker 1: It was at the end of my junior year--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --yes.  So that would be--yeah.  And I'm not sure when the first street theater was; it wasn't the first summer, we know that, you know; it may have been '68 [1968], okay?  But, that's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Tell us about--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Do other people you interview remember all of these dates (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, no. I mean but if they can get us close, that's fine.  That's why I'm saying it's not that--because any historian with any credibility will check what you say with what the written record says--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right, right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --and with primary sources, you know, and then make a determination--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, at least we know that I'm not off by a decade.
Speaker 2: And sometimes the interviewee is right and the source is wrong, you know?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So it depends on what (laughter)--you know, so--tell us what, what is street theater--for those watching this that don't know what street theater is?
Speaker 1: Street theater is literally taking a play and performing it in the middle of the street, okay?  And we always opened at 14th [Street] and T [Street]--or 14th and U [Street]--yeah, 14th and U, yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, that is--what's the significance of 14th and U?
Speaker 1: Well, we did it for two reasons.  One, 14th and U was for many years, and has returned to be kind of the hub of social, having a good time in Washington [D.C.] with some of the most extraordinary performers in the world.  It is very close to the Howard Theatre [Washington, D.C.], very close to Ben's Chili Bowl [Washington, D.C.], et cetera, et cetera.  But, by then, it had fallen into disrepair, and many of the businesses had closed and many of the people who lived around there were really, really struggling, you know, and who needed aid.
Speaker 2: So, so this was the heart of the black community at one time (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Absolutely--yeah, you know.  It was us and us was it, you know; it really, really was.

Speaker 1: Well, this is a question that I had earlier and I didn't know where to interject it here, but--now you're at George Washington [George Washington University, Washington, D.C.], you all have a black student union [Black People's Union] but you're the minority there, of course--
Speaker 2: Hm, minority?  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  Yes.
Speaker 2: We called ourselves the tinyority (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But you've got like--did you have much interaction with students at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] or Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] or any of the places--or the other black colleges [HBCUs] around like Bowie [Bowie State College; Bowie State University, Bowie, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: No, except for Howard, you know; and we--well that--that came later, but yes, definitely, definitely with Howard, okay? And I used to, you know--and I had friends at Howard, you know; I would go up there, stop saying you know, but (laughter) I'd go up there and hang out and, you know, so that was--stop it, Peggy [HistoryMaker Peggy Cooper Cafritz]--that was really good.  Now, at that time, we--I remember--I can't remember exactly when, but we did have some joint meetings with Howard.  I guess our, you know, student union, you know, and their--and their leadership and, you know, we talked about stuff so--yes, and there was never--as I can recall, there was nothing but cooperation.
Speaker 1: Yeah, those were the days of the big--black student unions (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And also, at that time, the anti-war movement, you know, was beginning and we, as black people, were not involved in the anti-war movement to any great extent.  We wanted to make sure that the anti-war movement did not forget the Civil Rights Movement, you know, and that it didn't overshadow the still great need for changing this country in terms of our rights and so forth, and for that matter, even the rights of soldiers; so--yeah.
Speaker 1: There's another thing, too, that you had mentioned it in the other--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I think--I remember that [HistoryMaker] Ewart Brown--
Speaker 1: Ewart Brown--
Speaker 2: --was one of the leaders then--I think--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: At Howard--
Speaker 2: --and he ultimately became the head of Bermuda, but--
Speaker 1: So he was a student leader at Howard?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, I think that Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture] and those guys, they were ahead of me, you know--ahead of us, and--
Speaker 1: A couple of years ahead, I think.
Speaker 2: I think a little bit more than that, okay?  I have to check, but Stokely--I think a little bit more than that.  But at the same time, I think that we were--I know Greg [Gregory Millard] and I did this a lot--we were inspired by Stokely and those guys, but we also really scrutinized what we thought was working and what wasn't working (laughter), and it was, it was good.
Story_ID: 671708
Speaker 1: Also, during that time with the black student union [Black People's Union]--and I (pause) never was the--as I recall, I was never the president of the black student union but I was active, you know?  And I was maybe chairman of some stuff, you know, like that weekend.  But one of the things that was a big thing with us was whether or not we should push George Washington [George Washington University, Washington, D.C.] to have a black studies department, and where I ended up being on that subject, was that no, we should instead really challenge them--force them to hire African American professors and embed the regular curriculum with African American subject matter because these folk will never, ever acknowledge the comparative value, you know, of our history, art and culture if we separate it, you know.  And also, if we have a black studies department--I mean what is that in the beginning, you know?  Two or three professors, you know; four professors?  I mean even when you look at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] now, how many professors are there?  But I wanted them to hire--have to hire professors in every single, you know, department; every single school.  And, of course, it worked a little bit, but it continued to be infuriating, you know?  And I can't remember there being a big opposition to the way that I was thinking, and to having a black student--I mean a black studies department.  I can't remember if there was.
Speaker 2: Now, was the department at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] formed--I know [HistoryMaker] Russell Adams, I think, was the first director, and he stayed there for many years, I believe; but was that started--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: At Howard?
Speaker 2: Yeah, did they have one at Howard at that point, do you know?
Speaker 1: You know I--I don't know; I would think--I wouldn't be surprised if Howard's came a bit later, but I do know that, you know, nationally on campuses it was definitely, you know, in the discussion, you know, definitely.  And I don't know who had the first black studies department, but that's an interesting question; I'm gonna check that--I'm gonna look that up.  And in black universities [HBCUs], I don't know how important they would--how much importance they would have put on it because what do they do every day, you know, in the classrooms in many of these universities but teach black studies along with, you know, other studies.  I mean, you know, we always said--and this comes up later in my life--we had to know our history and culture in order for us to sculpt our identity, you know, and to be who we wanted to be.  But, we also had to master western white culture because we would not be able to function that well in this society without really knowing that.  So, I mean, we really had to invest, I think, double study time from--when we were very young, you know?  I'm sure when you were a kid, you know, your mom or dad, you know, might mention something about a contemporary person like [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett and a not contemporary person like Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois], you know what I mean?  And we just--it just seeped into our knowledge channels as--in our households I think it was always thought of as important.  And if you read a lot of autobiographies that black folks have written, you get that, you know, about all the music in their house, or on--even in Jay-Z's--in Jay-Z's autobiography ['Decoded,' Jay-Z], he talks about that today, you know?  So it's pretty--it's pretty interesting.

Speaker 1: But at GW [George Washington University, Washington, D.C.], we--we did the street theater as well.  Now, the street theater was unbelievably successful, and we were invited--Lincoln Center [Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York, New York] has a outdoor theater festival every summer, and I can't remember the name of it, but it's something like outdoor theater festival (laughter), and it was run by a fabulous guy, until several years ago, who is actually African American, whose name will come to me.  But anyway, when we were invited to perform there, and we performed there for many years.  In addition to that, and maybe inspired by that, we took the kids to other places to perform--Ontario [Canada], and Mobile, Alabama (laughter), which was quite an experience--quite an experience.  And I remember that was very, very early on because things hadn't changed very much (laughter).
