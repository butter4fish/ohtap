Speaker 1: This HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] interview is being conducted with Dr. Willard R. Johnson [HistoryMaker Willard Johnson] at his home at 44 Norwood Avenue, in Newton, Massachusetts, and the date is December 9th, the year 2005.  The interviewer is [HistoryMaker] Robert C. Hayden and the videographer is Neculai Berghelea.  Mr. HistoryMaker (laughter), would you state your full name for me and would you spell your full name for me?
Speaker 2: Okay.  It's Willard Raymond Johnson, W-I-L-L-A-R-D, R-A-Y-M-O-N-D, J-O-H-N-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: And Willard Johnson, what is your birth date and where were you born?
Speaker 2: I was born in St. Louis [Missouri], November 22nd, 1935.
Speaker 1: And I know that you are retired, at least from Massachusetts Institute of Technology [MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts], but how would you characterize or title your profession?  What did you do, what do you do now?
Speaker 2: Right.  I, I'm a trained political scientist.  That's what I taught at MIT for thirty-two years.  I retired in '96 [1996] from that, but I keep my office there.  I'm an emeritus.  I use it to continue my activist activities which focus on Africa and focus on black American history particularly, their connections with Native Americans.  So my office is a sort of place where we put out mailings, run off brochures and occasionally, and, you know, some more serious research.  Now more historically oriented than political science.

Speaker 1: We have a few what we call warm-up questions, People magazine type questions to, perhaps, give the viewers of your life story a little slant on your personality and so I want to ask you, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh lordy. Black-eyed peas, cooked in a good southern style, but you can add candied yams to that, and corn bread to that, you know.  Yeah, I was, I was raised in the South so.
Speaker 1: We're gone talk about that too.  Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: In New England (laughter), I think probably autumn, but spring is nice, summer is nice, winter is definitely not.  We're in the midst of a snow storm today.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, brown.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well I most often now go to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, but that's because we have a place there and we have means to get there, but I think I would, if I had the money, prefer to go to Dakar, Senegal, maybe Accra, Ghana.  We just, you know, don't have the means to do that very often, so if it's not Mexico, it would be the Caribbean.
Speaker 1: Last warm-up question.  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying, something philosophical that you use from time-to-time with your friends and colleagues.
Speaker 2: Nothing short, no.
Speaker 1: No?  I got time.
Speaker 2: You can do better, I guess.
Story_ID: 505969
Speaker 1: Well I said earlier, these interviews start by exploring your family history, your family background so that those who will view and study your life and your work will have some context in which to understand your upbringing, nurturing, decision-making processes as you went along.  So we're gonna start it with your immediate family and your mother.  Would you give me your mother's name, tell me when she was born and where?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother's name is, is Dorothy Stovall Johnson.  She was born in Humboldt, Kansas, in 1909.
Speaker 1: Where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: In Humboldt.
Speaker 1: In Humboldt?  Tell me just briefly a little bit about Humboldt, Kansas.
Speaker 2: Well, I've learned a lot more about Humboldt in recent years, but Humboldt is a little small town in southeast Kansas.  In its earliest days, it was actually the county seat for Allen County [Kansas], and I'll tell you later about some notoriety that came to it, but four thousand people maybe, five at most throughout its history.  Kansas, you know, was fairly new state, so Kansas came into the Union in 1860 [sic. 1861].  Humboldt was founded in something like 1856 or '7 [1857] by abolitionists, some of whom were probably some of those immigrants that were sent out from Boston [Massachusetts] by the Emigrant Aid Society [New England Emigrant Aid Society] to people Kansas, with grease oilers with people who would want Kansas to come into the Union as a free state, and Humboldt was a little off the beaten track for that, but they did have that reputation as being, being an anti-slavery and abolitionist town.
Speaker 1: What do you know about her growing up years as a child, as a youth?  Did she share stores ever about her growing-up years?
Speaker 2: Not a whole lot.  She was an only daughter.  Her mother [Gertrude Smith Stovall] had lost her sister in infancy, and she had, what, eight brothers, so she was a tomboy but a frustrated tomboy because they wouldn't let her do all that she wanted to do, or would her mother and her father [James Stovall].  Her father was a Baptist minister.  The house was strict, and while she loved Humboldt and all of that, I don't think she regretted moving on to other places.
Speaker 1: How long did she live there, from birth to?
Speaker 2: Until she was, well until 1929 is when they moved away.  So she's, you know, twenty-one, maybe twenty, twenty-one.
Speaker 1: Did she ever share any special stories with you about her growing up years, you know, anecdotes or things that she remembered that she wanted you to know about her life as a child?
Speaker 2: No, I think, fishing in the Neosho River nearby.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: N-E-O-S-H-O, Neosho.
Speaker 1: Thanks.
Speaker 2: Their house was very near the bluffs overlooking this river and she had a horse in her youth so she used to ride her horse around that bluff.  They used to find Indian [Native American] arrowheads 'cause it was a battleground on a number of occasions, but you know, it was the life of a Baptist minister's daughter (laughter).
Speaker 1: Your mother is still living or deceased?
Speaker 2: No, she's deceased.
Story_ID: 505970
Speaker 1: How do you remember your mother [Dorothy Stovall Johnson], her personality?  What was she like as a person?
Speaker 2: Well, she was, she was very efficient.  She could certainly stretch a dollar to, you know, an infinite end, and I think some of my own inclination towards frugality came as a sort of style from her, although it also came from necessity.  Very good cook.  She was not highly educated and I think she always felt herself a little bit, she was embarrassed by that because my dad [Willard Johnson] was well-educated and while he was not an academic, still there, you know, their orientation was toward education, but she had, she went to college.  She went the first couple of years at the Emporia State Teachers' College [Kansas State Teachers College; Emporia State University, Emporia, Kansas] in Kansas.  But she always carried that sort of sense of, you know, I'm not the educated one, which was too bad because she was very, very smart, had, you know, really good insight into things.  She was scared, I think, when my father died some ten years before she did, to make it on her own, and she wound up being able to do that quite well.  She became a cook in the Head Start program in Pasadena, California.  She started out just scooping ice cream, but she wound up, you know, in the kitchen, and that was a good job for her.  And she was able then to keep the house going, to put a new roof on it, and, you know, do a number of things that gave her a sense that, you know, yes, she's qualified in her own right.
Speaker 1: When did she go to Pasadena?
Speaker 2: We moved to Pasadena in 1946, I think, '46 [1946], late '46 [1946] from Tuskegee, Alabama.
Story_ID: 505971
Speaker 1: You mentioned that her [Johnson's mother, Dorothy Stovall Johnson] father was a Baptist minister.  Would you give me his name and tell me what you know about your paternal [sic. maternal] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, he was Reverend James George Stovall.  He was the minister, he and his brothers, he was a carpenter and a mason and so was one of his brothers.  Anyway, they, three or four brothers and so they physically built the Poplar Grove Baptist Church in Humboldt [Kansas], and while he wasn't the first minister of that church, I mean, he built a later, it was established before he was born, but the church that's there now, he built.  And he was raised in Neosho Falls [Kansas], which is forty miles maybe from Humboldt, which seems like a world out there.  I didn't have a lot of interaction with him but usually it was in the summer visits we would make coming from Tuskegee [Alabama] and spending several weeks at their house.  We'd go hunting together, we'd go fishing together, we'd sit on the porch, but I can't remember the stories he told.  It was probably mostly Bible lessons, which may be why I didn't remember it.
Speaker 1: What do you know about his parents, your great, did he ever tell you anything about them?
Speaker 2: A bit, yes, his father, the family lore was that he was from Germany.  We found out he's not.  He was not.  But, he was born in Decatur, Illinois from parents that we had always assumed were German, but in recent genealogical work, I think the most likely thing is that he was of a member of a English Stovall family that had come into Indiana in the, I don't know when, '20s [1820s], '30s [1830s], 1840s maybe and that family split up as we gather.  We haven't fully documented this split up between pro slavery and an anti-slavery, or at least the family that wanted to get away from the slave state, so they moved to Illinois.  And then that family split up again and his father, Martin Luther Stovall, then moved to Neosho Falls, and that's where he was born.
Story_ID: 505972
Speaker 1: Tell me about your mother's [Dorothy Stovall Johnson] mother.  We've talked about her father [James Stovall], the minister.  What about your maternal grandmother?
Speaker 2: Right.  Gertrude Smith Stovall.  She would always almost start when you talk about south that she was orphaned as a young girl, something like maybe twelve, maybe even earlier.  I'd have to look that up again, and my family won't forgive me since I'm supposed to be the family historian.
Speaker 1: I'm sure you have it all written down. You can always look these things up (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, it's all written down, but she then had to care for her grandmother, Mary Davis [ph.], and she cared for her for two or three years, so it may have been around ten years old, or maybe even nine, because when her grandmother died when she was thirteen, she then tried to rejoin other members of her family that she thought, she knew had come out of Indian [Native American] territory, in Tahlequah [Oklahoma], which is the capital of the Cherokee Nation.  So she went there to live with that part of the family, but she didn't like it and they didn't treat her well, and she left by herself, thirteen year old, got herself back on the train and made it back to Humboldt [Kansas].  She was a very strong person, extremely.  Strong willed, big, tall, you know, over six foot tall, and resolute.  Wonderful cook, and a matronly kind of person if you can get beyond the sternness, you know.  She was reputed to be, to have a mean willow whip, you know, if you were to step out of line, so we never did, so I never saw the whip.  But I was convinced, you know, it must be there.  Her grandmother Mary Davis, had married a man named Charlie Davis [ph.], who was himself a former slave of a Cherokee family, William Henry Davis [ph.] and his father was William A. Davis [ph.].  William A. Davis was one of the signers of the Nowata treaty that essentially gave away land, you know, Cherokee land, so he was part of the so-called treaty party, and that was a, a contentious group, that was controversial and despised by much of the rest of the tribe, and so I don't know in what way that may have affected Charlie Davis and his growing up.  I assume that he got to Indian territory with his own parents having come on the trail, but we haven't, Trail of Tears, but we haven't fully documented that yet.
Story_ID: 505973
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your father.  Would you give me his name and when he was born and where?
Speaker 2: Right.  He was born, his name was Willard Johnson.  I'm not a junior because he had no middle name.  He was born in Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1901.
Speaker 1: And where did he grow up?
Speaker 2: He grew in Leavenworth.  He stayed in Leavenworth through high school and then he went to the University of Kansas [KU], which is in Lawrence [Kansas], which is a long buggy ride away.  And then he, his intention when he went to University of Kansas at Lawrence, was to become a physician, and he did, in fact, enter their medical school [University of Kansas School of Medicine, Kansas City, Kansas].  He wasn't the first black to be admitted to their medical school.  There was one, I think, prior to him, but it was, it was not a happy experience for a couple of reasons.  The first reason was race and probably the second reason was race.  They admitted him.  We assume they must have known that he was black.  He didn't particularly look white.  He was light skinned, lighter than myself, but, you know, in those areas, they can judge.  But he got admitted to the medical school before he grad- before he had his bachelor's [degree], and I don't yet know whether that was routine or not, how many people did that, but their practice was, since they only had one black before that, and if I'm not mistaken, and there might have been two, so maybe one some years early.  There was some we found that they didn't know were black so they didn't get the same kind of treatment, was that they would do the first two years of medical school at KU, and then they would have to finish at Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] or at Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  Well, he ran into trouble in his second year, what would have been his second year of medical school, and he had to, at the end of the first year, he had to drop out and work and get enough money.  They were, his family was dirt-poor.  In fact, they tell the story that the other siblings, he had several brothers and sisters, would take whatever jobs they could get in Leavenworth and then they would dump all their money in a basket and then periodically they would somehow or another get that money to him in Lawrence, and he told stories of days on end having to just survive off of cornmeal and water.  But he did, you know, and he never finished that medical school program.  He had to scurry when he saw that this was going to be a problem to then go back and complete all of the requirements for the bachelor's, so he'd at least have that to show for it.  So he did almost six years.  In fact, six years maybe a summer at KU, came out with only a bachelor's there, but he had enough credits, you know, to have gotten him well into a medical school program, and he had done all of the standard medical school courses for the first two years.  He then took a job at Tennessee A and I [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State Normal College; Tennessee State University] in Nashville [Tennessee], and, no I take that back, his first job I think, was at Rust College at Holly Springs, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Rusk, R-U-S-K?
Speaker 2: Right, R-U-S-T, I think it is, Rust,
Speaker 1: Rust, I see.
Speaker 2: One of the historic black colleges [HBCU].  Then that was like in '27 [1927].  I guess he had done a teachers training course at Emporium [Kansas State Teachers College; Emporia State University, Emporia, Kansas] in Kansas in maybe '26 [1926], and took this job at Holly Springs, came back to Humboldt, or came back to Kansas and proposed and married my mother [Dorothy Stovall Johnson] and then they moved to Nashville and to Tennessee A and I.  I'm not certain that my mother didn't go with him to Rust for a year.  I got that in the notes somewhere, but he does have photographs of the 1927 flood, which flooded Rust.  You know, that was like a historic Katrina-like [Hurricane Katrina] major event that flooded all of the central Mississippi Valley states.  And so among his memorabilia I've seen photos of that, and it seems to me that there might be a picture somewhere of the two of them at Rust, but that I can't swear to, but I know he was there.  Then at Tennessee A and I, he taught biology, zoology, general science courses and that's where my brother Richard [Richard Johnson] was born.
Speaker 1: What year was he born?
Speaker 2: In 1930.
Story_ID: 505974
Speaker 1: Did your father [Willard Johnson] continue as a college instructor throughout his lifetime?
Speaker 2: No, he stayed at Tennessee A and I [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State Normal College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] for, I think, two years, at the, you know, at the heart of the Depression [Great Depression].  He moved to St. Louis [Missouri] and I'm not absolutely certain why.  It may be that he was invited to head a diagnostic laboratory at People's Hospital in St. Louis.  But he wound up actually creating that laboratory so they may have said come and run our laboratory when he got there, you know.  I just know that in the end, he created Peoples' diagnostic laboratory at People's Hospital, but that was run also on a commercial basis, so they, you know, had to service doctors wherever they were.  And he did that until I and my sisters [Roberta Johnson and Alberta Johnson] were born, and I was born in '35 [1935], they were born in '36 [1936].
Speaker 1: Sisters or sister?
Speaker 2: Two sisters.  I have twin sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then he took an exam for the U.S. Public Health Service and we are, that's serious ice flow outside, we are told that he was either number one or number two in that exam.  But he couldn't get a job.  I mean he had taken the Health Service exam.  He had placed very high, if not the highest, in his group, and so then my mother [Dorothy Stovall Johnson] and my [paternal] grandmother [Hattie McClanahan Johnson] wrote a letter to Eleanor Roosevelt and, I have a copy of that letter somewhere.
Speaker 1: I was gonna ask you.
Speaker 2: Oh man, it's quite a letter.  I hope I can find it.  But basically it said, where is this new deal?  You know, here's a man, by then he had gone to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  I should have put that in there because after, after he taught a bit at Rust [Rust College, Holly Springs, Mississippi], I think in between Rust and A, Tennessee A and I, actually he went to the University of Chicago and got a master's [degree] in bacteriology, but it could be, again, I would have to look at the notes, he may have done that in between Tennessee A and I and this People's Hospital placement.  So he had, you know, he comes out with a master's, he's a trained bacteriologist, and so he goes and he's running this laboratory at People's Hospital.  He takes the Health Service exam.  He passes very high.  He doesn't get a job.  They write to Eleanor Roosevelt.  And she read the letter and she responded, you know.  She assigned, I can't remember whether, I think Colonel House [Edward M. House] was like the chief of staff or something, to look into this case.  So they looked into this case and they said, you know, what's going on here?  So they forced the U.S. Health Service to hire the top of their list of, you know, of exam takers.  And, but that was an all-white hospital at Jefferson Barracks [Jefferson Barracks Division], St. Louis, so that team of people conspired to get him reassigned, and they assigned, there was only one black veterans hospital in their system and that was at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System-East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama], so they assigned him to Tuskegee, with yes you still have a job and they gave him so many days to take it up if he could get himself on his own down to Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Now you, you weren't born yet?  Were you born?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm born.  I was born in St. Louis.
Speaker 1: All right, '35 [1935], okay.
Speaker 2: And he is running this hospital at that point, '35 [1935], '36 [1936], and they moved to Tuskegee [Alabama] in '38 [1938].
Story_ID: 505975
Speaker 1: Let me just back up on this career, pathway is interesting and the obstacles, but tell me about you father's [Willard Johnson] parentage so we have that balance.  What do you know about his mother and father?
Speaker 2: Well, his father is, was a man named Joseph Johnson, who had a sister named Carrie, and their mother was Elizabeth [ph.], sometimes called Betty, sometimes called Bannie [ph.], but they had been fathered, Joseph and Carrie, had been fathered by one of the slave-owning Butler families in Vicksburg, Mississippi.  From all we can gather in this parentage was amicable, it was after slavery.  The family continued to live with that family, or came into that family after slavery.  We were told that it was the scion of the family, their father Joseph Butler [ph.], the eldest son, Henry [ph.], the next son, Timothy [ph.], and the last son, Jessie Butler [ph.], Vicksburg.  From the family lore, which is that the, Bannie, Elizabeth, had grown up with one of these children and they were best friends and they became lovers.  And, so if that's so, if they really grew up together as more or less the same age or very close to each other, then it wouldn't have been Henry, it would have been Timothy Butler, but in any case, the family, the Butler family, you know, they acknowledged but they didn't, they didn't get married.  They acknowledged these children in the sense that they wanted to educate them.  They cared for them and wanted to educate them, but they couldn't do it in segregated Mississippi.  So they were going to send those two children to some school somewhere else with some part of their family or boarding school or something like that.
Story_ID: 505976
Speaker 1: You were telling me about your father's [Willard Johnson] mother [sic. Johnson's paternal great-grandmother, Elizabeth (ph.)], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What about father?
Speaker 2: Well, let me tell you about his, his mother still (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right. Go ahead.
Speaker 2: --because I hadn't finished that story.  Betty [ph.] was fearful that if they took these kids and sent them away to school, she would never see them again.  So she gathered them up in the middle of the night with all that they could carry, and somehow or another, made their way to Kansas.  I assumed they must have joined one of the exoduster boats going up the Mississippi [Mississippi River] because they get to Kansas, Leavenworth, first probably Kansas City [Kansas] and then they made their way to Leavenworth, in that period '79 [1879], '78 [1878], '79 [1879].  That's the Pap Singleton [Benjamin "Pap" Singleton] Exoduster period [Exoduster Movement; Exodus of 1879].  She's fearful that the Butlers are going to track her down.  She starts living with a guy that she, I don't think, knew before Leavenworth, but we are not sure of that, named George Johnson [ph.].  She marries George Johnson but he does not adopt the children.  They voluntarily or they decide to just take the Johnson name, so that's how we got the Johnson name, instead of Butler.  Elizabeth, Bannie [ph.] or Betty, use those three names, in the family they called her mostly Bannie.  Her mother was a woman from Madagascar.  But we haven't been able to find a name for her, therefore I haven't been able to track that.  The Madagascan woman's husband was a man named James Grimes [ph.].  He was reputed to be a Native American but we, and we've assumed therefore Natchez or Creek or Choctaw or Chickasaw, one of those in that region of Mississippi, but I have not been able find him in the records anywhere.  Now the father, you know, my grandfather Joseph [Joseph Johnson], marries a woman named Hattie McClanahan [Hattie McClanahan Johnson].  Hattie is the daughter of a man named Alford McClanahan [ph.], Irishman, and Hattie Brewer [ph.] who was a colored woman of parentage I haven't been able to determine yet.  Alford is reputed to be born in Kansas, although family lore had him coming straight from Ireland.  But the records show him born in Kansas. But we haven't been able to determine his parentage.
Speaker 1: Fascinating. Your father's side?
Speaker 2: That is on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Oh, that is?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  On my mother's [Dorothy Stovall Johnson] side was the Charlie Davis [ph.] and the tie to the Cherokees.  My grandmother Gertrude Stovall [Gertrude Smith Stovall], her own mother died fairly young.  She had married a white man from Virginia in Kansas and he went back to Virginia presumably because there was some kind of smallpox outbreak or something that called him back and he never returned.  So, and then her mother died in childbirth not long after she had been born.
Story_ID: 505977
Speaker 1: Let's move to your early years, your growing up years.  You were born in St. Louis [Missouri], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And how old were you when you moved to Tuskegee [Alabama].
Speaker 2: I was about eighteen months or two years.  I was born in late '35 [1935], November.  So in late or mid-'37 [1937], we, we go to St., I mean we go to Tuskegee (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tuskegee.  Tell me--
Speaker 2: Which was wonderful for me.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your earliest memories as a child of Tuskegee.  How far back can you remember?
Speaker 2: Well I can remember some things in our first house, beca-, I think it must have been our first house there, you know and I have a picture or two I can show you, my mother [Dorothy Stovall Johnson] on her hands and knees mopping up the floor, you know, because the sink kept breaking.  That's kind of indelible.  But later on what I remember is playing in the piney woods, you know, of Tuskegee, which was just great.  We moved to a little house on Bibb Street.  My dad [Willard Johnson] was working at the Veteran's Hospital [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System-East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama], which is beyond Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], sort of on the back side of Tuskegee Institute so, you know, we, I went to school actually on the Institute's campus, and initially, at John Adams Elementary School [sic. Lewis Adams Elementary School, Tuskegee, Alabama] and then we transferred to Children's House [Chambliss Children's House, Tuskegee, Alabama], which was, both of those were actually on the campus.  But, so walking to school, you know, what seemed like miles and miles to me, playing with my little Bibb Street gang.  We had the guy that lived next door, Louis Driver [ph.], was a teenager at the time of these memories, and my brother [Richard Johnson] is a little bit younger than he, so Louis was kind of head of the group, and we did all kinds of stuff together.  You know, we had soap box derbies down this, down our road.  (Background noise) When we first moved to Tuskegee or to that house, the road was not paved beyond our house.  My dad could get into our driveway, but if he missed it, he would slide down this muddy hill, but then they paved it.  And that was called first hill.  First hill was where we did our soap box derbies, 'cause second hill was really fearsome.  So, it's just wonderful memories, you know, of playing in the woods, you know, but my parents hated it, you know.
Speaker 1: They hated it?
Speaker 2: Hated it because it was segregated, you know, and while Tuskegee's all black, you know, Tuskegee Institute is an all-black area.  They didn't have many facilities, and you know, you had to drive to Birmingham [Alabama] or someplace to get any real shopping done.  If you went into downtown Tuskegee proper, strictly segregated.  And then even in Tuskegee, in black Tuskegee, in Tuskegee Institute, you had this kind of strict social hierarchy, you know.   You had three major institutions in that town, that created a middle class and even an elite Tuskegee Institute, professors versus secretaries versus, you know, students, and never the twain shall meet really socially.  Then you had the Veteran's Hospital, doctors.  Then you have, you know, orderlies and nurses and my dad is a bacteriologist, he's in the lab, but that's not to be confused with the sort of professional medical staff, you know, these doctors, surgeons, and so forth.  So, it was socially rather constraining.  The third institution was Tuskegee Airmen, the [U.S.] Air Force base [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama].  So you got Colonel, Colonel Anderson [Charles A. "Chief" Anderson] lived next door to us, but he's a colonel, you know.  Do you say hello?  Do you salute?  What do you do?  I don't remember ever going over to their house, you know.  I had lots of friends up and down the street, but I mean it was just, you know.  So, as soon as they could after World War II [WWII], they checked out Pasadena, California where my dad's sister [Carrie Johnson] had moved, and then they moved there.
Story_ID: 505978
Speaker 1: Before you go to Pasadena [California], tell me about elementary school in Tuskegee [Alabama].  What was school like for you, what kind of a student were you?
Speaker 2: Oh, I would like to say now that I was a good student, but the record will not bear that out.
Speaker 1: Did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I loved it.  But I had a reading problem, and I will never forget the embarrassment, you know, of being told that I had to improve my reading and therefore I was going to be held back in the third grade until that happened, but that meant that my sisters [Roberta Johnson and Alberta Johnson], you know, who were really only a year younger than me, and I were now in the same grade.  Oh Lordy.  So I worked really hard in fourth grade, what would have been the fourth grade.  I'm still technically in the third grade, but I wound up making up that time in a hurry and going into the fourth grade and going on through with my class.  So that's my great accomplishment.  I don't know, now I think maybe I had dyslexia 'cause I still have a great problem with number reversals, letter reversals and so, and so I came pretty far with a reading problem, you know.  But it was tough, but otherwise you know, Children's House [Chambliss Children's House, Tuskegee, Alabama] was catering to a black middle class.  The positive side of all that, I say you have this strict hierarchy, but you could see black role models in almost any dimension of life, president of the university [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], you know, professors, surgeons (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who was the president then, do you know?
Speaker 2: When we first came?
Speaker 1: Was it Patterson [Frederick D. Patterson]?
Speaker 2: No, I think it's prior to Patterson to tell you the truth.  I don't remember.  But we knew that, you know, he was president of the university.  We could go to Booker T. Washington's home, you know.  I had the grade, I still remember, you know, seeing the outline of this man and my dad [Willard Johnson] talking about him, George Washington Carver, who was there then, who was alive.  I went to his funeral as a matter of fact.
Speaker 1: You did?
Speaker 2: I, I went to his funeral on my own.  I, our class had been taken to view the body.  It was the first dead body I had seen (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were about eight years old, right?
Speaker 2: I'm about eight years old, '43 [1943], I think it was.  So I go to see the body, you know.  I'm very impressed with all the aura around this man and my dad had pointed him out.  I had seen him in his laboratory and he used to have a little dollhouse like thing.  I mean a playhouse outside of his lab where he could look out and watch children.  He was a very shy man, so he wouldn't come out and mix with people but he, he would watch the children play.  And we would be taken there to play in that house.  So I went to his funeral.  So that, you know, I was impressed by, and early only, not in a way that you're conscious of it, but you know blacks can do anything.  They are doing everything.
Speaker 1: This is a, exactly the kind of history we wanna capture in these interviews, you know, that you were there and then the dollhouse thing.  That's fantastic.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it certainly impacted me in ways, you know, now, I mean and for many years now, I look back on the blessed privilege I had, you know, to have that exposure, to be able in my own psyche to know that you, you didn't meet and shake hands with this great man Carver, but you saw him with your own eyes.  You went to his funeral.
Speaker 1: Was there a lot of people there?
Speaker 2: At the funeral?  Yes, but by the time I got there most of the people had disbursed, and my parents had not taken me.  They had gone, but they left the kids at home.  Maybe my brother [Richard Johnson] went, I don't remember him, but, you know, I was supposed to be at home, but I went in my rough dried seersucker knickers and so, on my bicycle and made my way out the graveyard, and my parents did not see me there.  They only heard about it later.  I don't know if I got a whipping or not.  I don't remember getting a whipping.
Speaker 1: Not important at this point.
Speaker 2: I don't think I would've.
Story_ID: 505979
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How old were you when you and your family left Tuskegee [Alabama] and headed for Pasadena [California]?
Speaker 1: Well, we would have left, I'm pretty sure, in '46 [1946], late '46 [1946], so I'd be eleven or ten going on eleven, just at that cusp.  I think, I think we may even have gone in mid-year, so I might have started, you know, like the, what would it have been, in sixth grade and then finished that, you know, at Washington Elementary School in Pasadena.
Speaker 2: Why did your family move to Pasadena?
Speaker 1: Well, I know that my dad's [Willard Johnson] sister, who's also named Carrie [Carrie Johnson] after this sister to my grandfather's [Joseph Johnson] sister, had moved there, and I think she had moved there because her husband had moved there, and then subsequently quite a number of the family wound up in California.  You know it was a great exodus to California during the war [World War II, WWII], war industries, and it was a very open society and lots of growth.
Speaker 2: What position and work did your father gain in Pasadena?
Speaker 1: Well, he went initially just to check it out.  He had applied to be reassigned in the Health Service [U.S. Public Health Service].  First, he applied to be assigned to Lincoln, Nebraska, for some reason.  There was an opening.  And he went and actually visited there and checked it out and I think my mother [Dorothy Stovall Johnson] did not want to go.  So then he tried to get positioned in Los Angeles [California], but I think while checking all that out, he made contact with a number of black doctors there, and they needed a laboratory, so he created a laboratory again, the Avalon Medical Laboratory [Avalon Boulevard Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: How do you spell that?
Speaker 1: A-V-A-L-O-N, for Avalon Boulevard, 43rd [Street] and Avalon Boulevard.  And, and so that's what he did.  He started this laboratory and he ran that laboratory for the rest of his working life.
Story_ID: 505980
Speaker 1: Tell me about going to Washington Elementary School [Pasadena, California] and growing up in Pasadena [California] as we move into the teenage years.  What was that like for you?
Speaker 2: Well let me just talk about first coming into Washington because I had in Children's House [Chambliss Children's House, Tuskegee, Alabama], you know, I told you about the third grade and then in the fourth grade I caught up and in the fifth grade, it was still, you know, but I'm at the sort of bottom of the class in Children's House, struggling along for some reason, 'cause brilliant as I am, you know, I shouldn't have had those problems, but I did.  But, it turns out that Children's House had already covered the subjects that I was now coming into in Pasadena, so I went from towards the bottom of the class to the smartest guy in the class.  I already knew all this stuff.  And that felt really good.  And I decided to hold on to that feeling.  So it was good.  It was in northwest Pasadena which is where most of the blacks lived, but it was not strictly segregated, so in most of my classes, you know, there are two maybe three blacks at most.  They did track and I was in the smarter group and I didn't know they were tracking at the time, but when I look back on it I see, you know, where are all the other blacks?  I mean there's just a few others, you know, in the classes that I'm taking.  I have, you know, talked about this in other interviews but it, so it must have impacted on me.  When I finally graduated from Washington Junior High [George Washington Junior High School, Pasadena, California], I had gone to Washington Elementary on the junior high is on the same campus, it's very near my house on Howard Street and, you know, I have always, I mean I, I was smart and I was not smart-alecky, I don't think, but I had a real, you know, I really impressed people because, for example, and I like to tell this story.  At one point our teacher in plane geometry go sick and, I don't know, left the classroom, for some reason, we were there in the class and there's no teacher, and the kids start goofing off and I say, you know, well we have the lesson, we've done our homework and why don't we just go ahead and discuss our work?  So, we do, you know, and I sat up at the front and, and I critiqued people and you know, and they accepted it.  The principal wondering what's going on in this class 'cause he's found out that this teacher has left, comes down and he looks through the window and here I am, oh, no I think it was a woman actually, looks through the window and here's this class is going on, so forth and so on.  Now you would have thought that that would get me one of the prizes awarded at the graduation from that school, but it did not.  I had straight A's and you know for those things that go with, you know, all the A students get the little certificate or something, but no special prize, and that deeply offended me.  I could not figure out why.  I didn't, you know, I was just totally naive.  So when I got to John Muir Junior College [John Muir High School, Pasadena, California], which is actually the senior high school 'cause they had a junior high school, tenth and eleventh, ninth and tenth grade.
Speaker 1: At Washington?
Speaker 2: At Washington.  And then Muir Senior High School was eleven and twelfth grade.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Muir?
Speaker 2: M-U-I-R.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: So when I get there, I decide, you know, well, what'd I do wrong, you know?  I must not have been well-rounded enough.  So I only had straight A's so I mean, you got to do more than that.  I don't, I played tennis, you know.  I got a letter and all of this stuff, so anyway I decided that I'm gonna, at the introductory, you know, orientation meeting they tell you about the school and they try to motivate you and they tell you what's the highest award, I'm gonna get that.
Speaker 1: And you did.
Speaker 2: And I did.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: The award was for scholarship academics?
Speaker 2: Well, it's really for all-around.
Speaker 1: All-around?
Speaker 2: Scholarship and service.
Story_ID: 505981
Speaker 1: Tell me about the other types of service things that you did as a high school student [at John Muir Junior College; John Muir High School, Pasadena, California].  What were you--?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, mostly sort of student government type things, class president.  I was the senior class president for high school.  I headed the, and set up this sort of judicial court for the student body.  Right about that time, there was an effort by the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], I think, to pull together what was called the Youth Council for the San Gabriel Valley to kind of develop leadership and so folks at Muir said I should go to that.  No, in fact, I think I was sent to that from Boys Club [Boys Club of Pasadena; Boys & Girls Club of Pasadena], and I'll tell you more about the Boy's Club because that was my second home.
Speaker 1: The Boys Club?
Speaker 2: Pasadena Boys Club.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was sent to that as their rep, San Gabriel Valley Youth Council and so I became president, the Sam Gabriel first president and it was a service-oriented kind of, you know, try to get youth to volunteer to things, but mostly just sort of civic education, to find out what's going on in the city.  Just at that time, there was a big controversy around this plan, this 644 plan that Pasadena [California] had, was one of the pioneers of, and the superintendent was a man named Willard Goslin, who was nationally known as a progressive education leader, but the town rebelled and part of it was that he had refused to bus white kids from our district or from La Canada [La Canada Flintridge, California], which was even higher.  It was rose bowl hills to overlook the Rose Bowl, and they would bus them all the way across our district to the east, to an all-white high school.  So he stopped it, and they fired him, and so I went to interview him, you know, to find out what all this was about.  I asked a representative of this San Gabriel Valley Youth Council sort of thing.  It was that sort of activity.  The Boys Club was wonderful and the Boys Club really was, for me, very formative.  I, I went to the Boys Club with my cousin Quincy Adams [ph.], who was the sister--Carrie's [Johnson's paternal aunt, Carrie Johnson] son, my best friend.  He subsequently died early by the way of Hodgkin's disease [Hodgkin's lymphoma], but in those days he was active in Boys Club so I went with him my first week we were in Pasadena.  And I don't think a week went by between that time in '46 [1946] and when I leave for UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] in '55 [1955], that I wasn't in the Boys Club.  Craft shop, fantastically, well-equipped craft shop, we have a lapidary, we have a metal shop, you now, and of course we had the, you know, the swimming pool and the basketball courts and the pool room.  Even had a library in this thing.  This was a very progressive Boys Club.  And for me it really was second home, and that's where I became camp counselor and me and the leadership group.  It was wonderful.
Story_ID: 505982
Speaker 1: Tell me about your family life in Pasadena [California], your parents [Dorothy Stovall Johnson and Willard Johnson] and your siblings.  What was family life like for you?  What special holidays or events that you and your family kind of celebrate?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, we didn't celebrate Kwanzaa.  We had the standard things, you know.  We didn't have a whole lot of other family there.  We had, you know, my [paternal] aunt [Carrie Johnson], initially, then subsequently after I go off to college [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], then a second aunt came and moved in the area, so for Thanksgiving or Christmas they would, you know, we would have those kind of family gatherings.  But even though my dad [Willard Johnson] ran this Avalon Medical Laboratory [Avalon Boulevard Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, Los Angeles, California], they didn't have a lot of money.  It was only my mother's [Dorothy Stovall Johnson] capacity to use the money we did have in a very efficacious way that we looked and acted like we were middle class, but we were just barely a foot into that, so we didn't have a lot of, of ceremony and we didn't have a lot of social life.  I was into everything, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What about church life?  Did church play a role in the family?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, we went to a small Baptist church near our house run by Reverend William, it think it was, Coleman [ph.].  I, you know, at a very young age, became the superintendent of the Sunday school and I took that reasonably seriously, but we were not heavy with, my dad I don't think was very religious at all.  I mean, he's a scientist.  That made my mother perhaps more religious than she wanted to be given that she had to grow up being the daughter of a minister [James Stovall], you know, but in any case we were, we were righteous, let's put it that way.  But we didn't have the heavy hand of the church, even though I went to Sunday school and lead the Sunday school and so forth, and my sisters [Roberta Johnson and Alberta Johnson] went to them.  My brother [Richard Johnson] was older and he went with a different crowd.  But then I quit that church and I went with my cousin [Quincy Adams (ph.)] to the Seventh-day Adventist church, but I found that a little rigorous, and once he died, I dropped that.
Story_ID: 505983
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers at your high school [John Muir Junior College; John Muir High School, Pasadena, California] that were particularly influential as you moved through grades eleven and twelve?  Any teachers stand out as important to you that you remember?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  I mean, yes, in the sense that my philosophy teacher had a great impact, but I can't remember his name, I should, right now, go look it up, but he did encourage me.  He said I had a (unclear) and he imagined that someday I would be a professor, and that must have stuck with me because I remember him saying that, you know, and being kind of quizzical about it.  But truthfully, the greatest influence on me was not from those teachers, but from the people at the Boys Club [Boys Club of Pasadena; Boys & Girls Club of Pasadena].  Bob Morgan [Robert Morgan] who ran the craft shop and who ran the camp, was really my mentor and my second father.  He's a white man of great moral and, you know, just wonderful man, and his wife Lucille [ph.].  So, you know, I spent so much time under their care that that overrides all of the school stuff.  I just, you know, and I'm a leader at school.  I mean I'm president of the senior class, I'm head of the court.  I go off to, to Boys State [American Legion Boys State] and I, you know, I'm elected lieutenant governor, stuff like that.  I'm used to playing those kind of leadership roles.  But at the Boys Club, you know, you're with others that are just nurtured as a group by, by Bob Morgan who had been an engineer and had, at Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California] and had given that up and went into working with you.
Story_ID: 505984
Speaker 1: You moved into different leadership roles in high school [at John Muir Junior College; John Muir High School, Pasadena, California].  How did that happen?  I mean, did you just, was it something that motivated you to be the leader you put out there?  How did you- most of us would sit back (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I think what got it started was just being so offended by not having been, you know, not getting any kind of decent award at junior high [George Washington Junior High School, Pasadena, California] and deciding I'm gonna go and, you know, run for something.  But once that happens then all these other institutional sort of frameworks developed, the Youth Council [Youth Council for the San Gabriel Valley].  I'm in the leadership club with Bob Morgan [Robert Morgan] who organized that at the Boys Club [Boys Club of Pasadena; Boys & Girls Club of Pasadena] so it just, you know, after that it's not so deliberate, it's just you tried to make a difference in there or you say we can do this, we can do that, you know.  Let's do it.
Speaker 1: What summer jobs and what work after school did you have as a teenager?  Did you have--?
Speaker 2: Well, I pumped gas, you know.  I always had a job at Christmas putting flowers on the floats for the Rose Parade [Rose Bowl Parade], I wound up being the supervisor of the other kids putting the flowers on the floats, so that was fun actually.  And that was year in, year out.  I did summer camp counseling for the Boys Club.  I went initially, of course, as a camper, but then I, you know, became a counselor.  When I got to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] I needed some money.  I transferred from the junior college.  I stayed at Muir through what would be the freshman and half of the sophomore year of college, and then they closed the junior college portion of Muir and merged it with Pasadena City College [Pasadena, California], so for the last term, I went to Pasadena City College.
Speaker 1: As you moved into the junior college for the rest of the year and a half and you were a junior and senior in high school, did you have any notions or feelings about what you wanted to study being as an adult (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I assumed that I would, yeah, I was pre-med and I was oriented to do that because I knew my dad [Willard Johnson] had wanted to be a physician, and, you know, and they had, and my dad had this laboratory [Avalon Boulevard Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, Los Angeles, California] and I and I my sisters [Roberta Johnson and Alberta Johnson] worked with him, and my mother [Dorothy Stovall Johnson] too.  My brother [Richard Johnson] went off to the [U.S.] Army so he wasn't involved in it, but I used to go and wash pipettes, you know and slides and stuff, right, and so that also was a summer job.
Speaker 1: So you were thinking of medicine then?
Speaker 2: I was thinking of medicine until I took organic chemistry at Muir.
Speaker 1: At Muir, that early?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because it's college.  We have the first--
Speaker 1: I know, so you had to take introduction to chemistry first, and then--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Chemistry was all right but organic, oh Lord, and, so, anyway and then by that time I've done all of these, you know, went to the Model of the United Nations [Model United Nations, Model UN], while I was at Muir.  We represented Nicaragua, and that was just a fantastic experience.  When I get to UCLA, I transfer in to UCLA as a junior, but I declare my major be political science, international relations.  And even before that, I'm already saying I'm interested in international relations.  So, again, after organic chemistry and with the exposure to the Model of the UN, with Boy State [American Legion Boys State], and these, you know, sort of civic action or at least civic awareness organizations that I was in through the Boys Club--
Story_ID: 505985
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Tell me about your last two years roughly at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]. What was that college experience like?
Speaker 1: Tumultuous.  The campus was in turmoil.
Speaker 2: You got there in the mid-'50s [1950s], right?
Speaker 1: Right.  I came in '55 [1955].  They were in the midst of real crisis because the McCarthy [Joseph McCarthy] era had really impacted on UCLA, and they had put a lot of pressure on student government to counteract the demonstrations that had been going on against ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] on campus, and the dean of students was also convinced that Communists had infiltrated campus, that homosexuals were taking over everything.  He had a kind of J., you know Hoover [J. Edgar Hoover].  He looked like Hoover, he kind of acted like Hoover and he probably was very much like Hoover himself, Dean Hahn [Milton Hahn], if I can use his name.
Speaker 2: How do you spell his last name?
Speaker 1: H-A-H-N.
Speaker 2: H-A-H-N, okay.
Speaker 1: And, anyway, they had tried to get the student government to control that and stop it, and they, the student government, wouldn't do it.  And they tried to impeach the study body president, Vivian [HistoryMaker Vivian R. Johnson] was on the student council at this point and so I hear, you know, I hadn't met her yet.  I meant I met her in the context of all that.  But another thing that was true for UCLA, surprisingly, was that blacks could not easily live on campus.  Now it's mostly a commuting university anyway, but there was no dormitory at UCLA.  There was a bit of a housing program at the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] and then there were cooperative housing.  There was a big one for men, Landfair House [Los Angeles, California], and then there was a small one for women, Stevens House [Los Angeles, California], which was off campus, and otherwise, you had to live in a fraternities and sororities and they all had restrictive clauses.  They were either Jewish, there were like two maybe Jewish fraternities, and one Jewish sorority.  And all the rest were goyim, and so, you know, we couldn't live anywhere.  And so we started a chapter of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] on campus to fight that.  And, in the course of trying to do that, you know, we got stomped on by the administration that concluded that we would only cause such trouble if we were Communist.  And then we kind of played into their hands in a way, I'm not, I don't regret this at all, but, you know, we didn't think about it.  We invited W.E.B. Du Bois to come to the campus, and he came.  And so we got a chance to meet him and hear him and so forth and so on, but they were just convinced, oh, you guys, so they disbanded, they, they outlawed our chapter, and in response to that and the issue of the restrictive clauses in the effort to impeach the president, they shut down the student newspaper [Daily Bruin], you know, it was electric, it was, so then I joined with a group of people to try to change this, you know, and I wound up being their candidate for student body president.
Story_ID: 505986
Speaker 1: It was a kind of, they say, up to that point, it was kind of historic and there had been one black president before, a man named Sherrill Luke, who was pretty famous in the California area, but what made our, our campaign so important was that it was hard fought and that I brought in some new tactics.  I went in, you know, it's a commuter campus right, so I went around and met every bus and, you know, at the edge of the parking lot all the students who were coming in as commuters, try to get this notion, we ought to have a right to live on campus, and I lost by twenty-seven votes, so I asked for a recount and they went through, you know, all this fanfare and it turns out I won by one vote in the recount.  So then, that made the newspapers, you know.  So then I said oh, no, that's no mandate.  We're going to hold this election all over again.  So we held it all over again and then they had a record turn out and I won, landslide, not landslide, but significant, you know.  And then I set out to try to change the culture of student government, so my thought was, and I wasn't alone in this, but, I mean you know, it was a serious effort in the '50s [1950s], you know, coming out of McCarthyism and sort of approaching the '60s [1960s], the '60s [1960s] hadn't burst on us yet, that we should approach student government as part of the governance of the university itself, and we should participate in the governance of the university, that we were not out of society, we were a part of society on campus and all the issues in society were our issues, and were proper with what should be within the purview of student government.  So we took that position, sort of wrote that as our platform, and organized a student party and I ran, you know, with a group, a slate of people, as a, as a party, but I was the only one (laughter) on it to win, and that by, you know, by this little margin.  So then we set out to restructure student government so that it would be on an academic basis and we'd get away from the fraternities and sororities as the basis for student representation.  And so that's why they talk about, you know, my year was the constitution revision year.  And we got it through but then it, it failed in a, in a vote to the, in the general vote, so we did not achieve the reorganization, but some of the people who were with us in that campaign at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] then went to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and they became part of the later Free Speech Movement.  And at Berkeley there was also the second instance of running as a party, I'll call slate, at Berkeley and they won, and Free Speech Movement came out of that at Berkeley.
Speaker 2: Where did you end up living when you went to UCLA? We talked about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At this cooperative housing, at Landfair House [Los Angeles, California], which was great actually, when I look back on it, because all of the students of color, that's where they had to live.  Wherever they came from so you had a lot of international students, so, Hassan Nasir who later became secretary general for OPEC [Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries] was one of our roommates, Achmed Badri [ph.] who became one of the ministers of agriculture in the Sudan, was one of our housemates, and then, you know, there were others also.  Ed Thorp [Edward Thorp] who wrote the book 'Beating,' you know, beating the table or something, in Las Vegas ['Beat the Dealer: A Winning Strategy for the Game of Twenty-One'], was one of our housemates.  Yeah, we had a good time.
Story_ID: 505987
Speaker 1: You graduated in what year [from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Fifty-seven [1957].
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven [1957], and did you go right to graduate school at that point?
Speaker 2: No, when I was student body president I went to the National Student Association [NSA; United States Student Association] conferences and got interested in that and, so, in the summer of '57 [1957], they were running an international student relation seminar at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], which they did every year, and I found out about that having gone to the National Student conferences the year before.  So I, I went into that seminar and, and it was very interesting and I was enthralled and they used that seminar as a kind of recruiting device for U.S. NSA leadership, so they asked me to run for national office.  I did for educational vice president and I won.  And I brought into that job at the NSA this program that we had at UCLA and created something called the Student Responsibility and Higher Education project [ph.], which was designed to point the various ways in which students could and should be part of a government structure and culture of the university.  And we set it up with, with, I don't know, fourteen or fifteen pilot campuses around the country and I ran that for the first year.  Then there was some concern in an essay about the leadership in the international division and so I decided that I would do a second year and I'd run for international vice president and I did that for a year, and that's in between then my undergraduate and my graduate studies.  I had already been admitted to Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies [Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, Washington, D.C.], and had a scholarship to go, so I delayed that for a year and did this international relations stuff which was fascinating, you know.  I don't regret it all, but it was--
Speaker 1: Did you, where did you travel during this time?  Did you travel outside the U.S.?
Speaker 2: I did.  I had really remarkable experiences, let me tell you.
Speaker 1: Where did you go?
Speaker 2: Well, for one of the places I went was Cuba.  Castro [Fidel Castro] had come into power.  When we were, when I was in international vice president, Castro came to Harvard as you may remember.  So I met him there, he and his brother [Raul Castro], and then subsequently, I get a note from him saying that he wanted to cultivate better relationships with America and he was already beginning to get some flak from the government so he wanted to reach out to students.  And so he asked me if we couldn't send a delegation.  So I went to Cuba to try to check that out and I met with Castro in Cuba on a back street in Havana [Cuba] in the middle of the night where he, you know, explained what he had in mind, and, in fact, I set that up, but I had to do it on the sly because there were various, you know, layers of government involvement in the student and youth organizations at that time and so, and they would have gone along with this, so I just did it, I just announced, you know, Castro was going to provide a plane at the national congress that summer.  I announced that we had this delegation that could go, is anybody interested, and it was a fait accompli, and you know what, I think, one of the people that went on that plane, was Diane Nash--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah?
Speaker 2: --out of the Nashville [Tennessee] student movement, yeah.
Story_ID: 505988
Speaker 1: What other stories can you tell me about your Hopkins [Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS); Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, Washington, D.C.] days and opportunities?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I got, when I got into, into my studies at Johns Hopkins, I really buckled down.  It was an exciting time to be in Washington, D.C., however, because this was '59 [1959] now, '60 [1960], '61 [1961].  Africa burst onto the scene.  You have all of these new embassies opening up, so I'm torn, between go to the parties, or study for the exam.  Well I had one particular exam I wish I hadn't studied so hard for, and Vivian [HistoryMaker Vivian R. Johnson], instead of myself, oh, we would have both gone, went to this fantastic bash that the state department [U.S. Department of State] put on for Patrice Lumumba, trying to, you know, he had come to try to cultivate better relationships, so she got a chance to meet him and I never did.
Speaker 1: We you and Vivian married at this point?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You were?  When did you get married?
Speaker 2: We got married in '57 [1957] right after I graduated [from University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So when I go off to the NSA [National Student Association; United States Student Association] we were married already.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You got your master's degree in political science?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well in international.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, international.  And then where was the next step with you?
Speaker 2: Well then I wanted, I, when I went to Johns Hopkins I was thinking about the state department, but we had a lot of instructors at SAIS, the School of Advanced International Studies, from the state department, and I decided maybe not, and besides, I, you know, I'd been turned off really by some of the government outlets from our exposure through the student and youth movements.  There was just too, they were too behind the scenes in too many places, and so I was thinking more now, along academic lines.  So I applied to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I initially got turned down, but I called them up to say why would I be turned down, I have straight A's at Johns Hopkins and I passed my exams with distinction.  And they say, we didn't know about the distinction.  So let's look at this.  So then they relooked at it and I got admitted but I didn't get any money, but I already had a fellowship for a Foreign Area Fellow, training fellowship.
Speaker 1: Which fellowship?
Speaker 2: The Foreign Area Training Fellowship, Ford Foundation [New York, New York].  And that was to get people into the international field since the U.S. were now a world leader and had no internationalists.  You know as a culture we are still isolationists, still are today.  So anyway, so I come to Harvard.  I have just a year of money for course work and then I have money for fieldwork, so I have got to get through this thing fast.  I've already done two years as a master's.  I can't afford to do another two years of study at Harvard and then do fieldwork so I do it all in a year and a summer and then I take my, my exams that fall, do the language stuff.  I had studied French at SAIS and did very well in it, but I had to have two languages.  And I had done German in high school [John Muir Junior College; John Muir High School, Pasadena, California], and the German was the problem.  Oh, man.  So I flunked the German the first time around and then I put everything on hold.  I've done everything else, all but dissertation if I can get through these, you know, I can take my generals, so I boned up.  I passed the German exam in concentrated study, got to the orals and then Vivian and I and our one daughter [Caryn Johnson] and Vivian and the daughter [Kimberly Johnson Ogadhoh] not yet born go off to Cameroon to do my fieldwork.
Story_ID: 505989
Speaker 1: Your first daughter was born?
Speaker 2: She's born here, well, no, she's born in Washington [D.C.].  She's born at the Freedman Hospital [Freedmen's Hospital; Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.] while I am at SAIS [Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies; Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay, what year was that?
Speaker 2: Sixty [1960].
Speaker 1: And her name?
Speaker 2: Caryn [Caryn Johnson].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your second daughter [Kimberly Johnson Ogadhoh] was born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Cameroon.
Speaker 1: In Cameroon?
Speaker 2: When we got there, she's born, and I'll show you a picture of the hospital where she was born.  A little Presbyterian hospital down in the south at Ebolowa [Cameroon].  It was, it was a real experience, you know, it was wonderful, but it was also trying in that, you know, Vivian [HistoryMaker Vivian R. Johnson] has to go through child birth, she has to deal with doctors in French.  We went to the Presbyterian hospital because it was an American Presbyterian hospital, and it worked out, but then she, you know, she developed some complications.
Speaker 1: So your dissertation work was on Cameroon?
Speaker 2: On Cameroon.  I was interested in African unity.  Cameroon was the first really important example of pulling together disparate colonial legacies 'cause it had been a German colony, and then taken over by the French and the British and divided, and then you had a reunification movement to pull it back together.  That partially succeeded.  It split the British Cameroons with Northern British and Southern British Cameroon.  Southern British Cameroon voted to come back into with the rest of Cameroon, so my dissertation was the reunification movement in Cameroon and then my plan and subsequent, you know, project was to turn that dissertation into a book, which was my book on Cameroon, 'The Cameroon Federation[: Political Integration in a Fragmentary Society,' Willard R. Johnson], going from the reunification movement all the way through to the actual experience of integrating those systems, the legal system, commercial system, education system, and so forth.  All had been very heavily impacted by the colonial powers.  So now you've got to create one out of those.  And I thought that that would be a kind of pilot for the rest of the continent with regard to African unity.
Speaker 1: So your book was published when?
Speaker 2: In 1970.
Story_ID: 505990
Speaker 1: Tell me about life in Cameroon for you and the family.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it, looking back on it, we realize that when Vivian [HistoryMaker Vivian R. Johnson] got a, developed a, you know, a complication from the, from the birth, it could have been really serious.  It didn't develop to be, and I mean we got it under control, so it might have been disastrous, but otherwise it was wonderful.  It was wonderful.  It was a great time to be there, very exciting, optimistic time.  I got a chance to travel throughout the whole of the country.  I bought a Land Rover in England and shipped it to Cameroon, so I could make all of the terrain and I visited every single purfey [ph.] and suprefey [ph.] in the country and I interviewed the leadership top to bottom.  You can't do that kind of work anymore, you know, you take on a whole country and you talk to its entire leadership, you know, and you write it up as one book.  Cameroon is beautiful.  It's a very diverse country, geographically and culturally.  It's got dessert in the north, it's got dense rain forest in the south.  It's got highland plateau.  It's got grass fields in the west.  It's got Pygmies in the south.  It's got Muslim domination, you know, Islamic zone in the north.  We leaved in Yaounde [Cameroon] which is on the plateau, beautiful.  Varies between seventy and eighty degrees, you know, year round.  That was gorgeous.  It was a great town.
Speaker 1: Have you been back many times?
Speaker 2: No, not so many times.  I went back to turn the dissertation into a book ['The Cameroon Federation: Political Integration in a Fragmentary Society,' Willard R. Johnson].  I went back after that in the '80s [1980s] because they were organizing something around their version of the anti-apartheid movement, and we had already been active in Trans-Africa [TransAfrica Forum; TransAfrica] here and so forth, and so I was invite to come to that.  We took our family throughout the continent in 1976.  We took the girls [Kimberly Johnson Ogadhoh and Caryn Johnson] out of school and we became, you know, and so the homeschooling but not at home, you now.  And we went from Dakar, Senegal, all through West Africa, across the Sudan, down through to Tanzania, back up to Egypt, and then did the thing around the Greek Isles and so forth, and then to Greece and Italy and Paris [France] and back home, almost a year.  And I the course of that, we went to Cameroon, of course, and we were able to take Kimberly who had been born in this hospital in Ebolowa [Cameroon], back to her birth place, you know.  But once the book was done and I, you now, I really didn't, I turned my attention to other things professionally in terms of African development.
Story_ID: 505991
Speaker 1: What did you turn to?  Are we at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] yet or not?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I go to MIT right after Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  That's my first job.  I--
Speaker 1: So the new research avenues came as you went to MIT?
Speaker 2: No because I, I have to get, I have to turn the dissertation into a book, you know.  I'm at MIT doing that and MIT gives me support to do that.  Because I finished in '64 [1964] really, in the summer, in the fall of '64 [1964] I take a job at MIT.  My degree isn't listed until '65 [1965], but I had finished and, you know, had it all approved and so I came to MIT as an assistant professor in '64 [1964].  I have worked on the book ['The Cameroon Federation: Political Integration in a Fragmentary Society,' Willard R. Johnson] until '68 [1968].  I go back to Cameroon, I bring it up, I make it into a full book and so forth and so on, and then I take a leave of absence from MIT and I go and help set up Circle Associates [Circle Inc., Boston, Massachusetts].  And I run it for two years.
Speaker 1: Let me talk about your MIT assistant professorship.  What were your roles and responsibilities as an assistant professor?  Were you teaching?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Both graduate and undergraduate.  Your main duty is to get your research up to snuff so that you can get tenure.  But for the teaching side of it, I was teaching African politics.  I was teaching sort of general third world politics.  I was teaching something called Man in Society.  It was even more general than that, you know for undergraduate sort of sophomores, and my focal point at that point on Africa is, Cameroon and it's sort of African politics in general.  I served on some graduate dissertations in African affairs, and--
Speaker 1: Any new lines of research during this time?  I know you were working, you finished the book (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no.  I'm, I'm focusing in on African politics and getting the book out.  As soon as the book is done and handed over to Princeton University Press [Princeton, New Jersey] in '68 [1968], I take a leave.  And already by '67 [1967], '68 [1968] the various committees on the diversity, you know, in effect come into being.  So yeah, your responsibilities there are to try to open this place up, you know, create opportunities.  One of my first responsibilities though, you know, I'm happy looking back on it, was that I was on the faculty committee to choose the new president and the successful candidate, one my candidates, but it wasn't, you know, I didn't find him and it was just that.  But I played a role in the outcome of this, was Jerry Wiesner [Jerome Wiesner] from the beginning, the first Jewish president of MIT.  And so it's general, you know, service to the institution.  I take the leave because I've already done enough I think to make the tenure case decent.  I've got several chapters in other books.  I've got, I've turned the dissertation into a book and I'm intend, to do some research work at Circle, which I'll tell you about.
Story_ID: 505992
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-eight [1968], everything is in line for tenure, your book ['The Cameroon Federation: Political Integration in a Fragmentary Society,' Willard R. Johnson], on Cameroon, is published, and you decide to take a leave of absence.  To do what?
Speaker 2: To do what Mel King [HistoryMaker Melvin King] and [HistoryMaker] Hubie Jones tell me to do, which is to join this group to kind of plan, you know, after the assassination of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and so forth the city [Boston, Massachusetts] is in an uproar.  And already we've lost Malcolm [Malcolm X], so we organize a meeting of the leadership of community groups and we call that the Circle [Circle Inc., Boston, Massachusetts].  It was just a gathering of the circle, and in that we decided to create what would later be called a community development corporation.  And the idea was basically Mel King's, to create an economic base for political action in the community.  And what I could bring to that was the experience of having looked at the state-owned, parastatal development promotions organizations in Africa.  Cameroon Development Corporation was part of what I had studied in Cameroon and so the notion that you could have a sort of public or semi-public agency to organize private enterprise activities and then use recycle the gains from that into a fund for political action is what we had in mind, and job creation and land planning and so forth.  So initially we just met to try to deal with the city and, and how to get blacks a stronger voice.  There were quite a number of people, thirty-five or so community leaders in this, but, you know, the most notable people that everyone would know would be Hubie Jones and Mel King.
Speaker 1: Vivian [HistoryMaker Vivian R. Johnson], your wife Vivian, was involved in Circle wasn't she at that time?
Speaker 2: She, yes.  Once we'd gotten Circle set up and it was run as a business promotion and consulting firm, then she had been working on a teacher training component, so she created a curriculum resource center which we housed at Circle.  We got, she got funded essentially, I think, through Carnegie [Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching].  She'll have to tell you about all of that, but she wound up being able to run it on a profit basis actually.  She trained teachers in at least twenty-eight of the surrounding school systems in the Boston [Massachusetts] area.
Speaker 1: I think that's how I met Vivian. I think that was my entre (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.  I think you did some of that work.
Speaker 1: I think it was, it was that resource center, yeah, I remember that.  She put together a bibliography I remember.  Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 2: And we tried to do new business, you know, identify new business opportunities and help them get started.  Initially, we only had ourselves so we created Circle Associates [Boston, Massachusetts] as a consulting firm, and we got contracts to plan for change in our part of the city.  But then I went after a special impact grant from the U.S. labor department [U.S. Department of Labor] and we got that and that gave us a capital base then and we created a venture capital fund, and then I also got a grant from the, essentially from Merrill Lynch [Merrill Lynch Wealth Management], from Charles Merrill [Charles E. Merrill, Jr.], who was running the Commonwealth School [Boston, Massachusetts], but he was active in The Lynch Foundation [Boston, Massachusetts] and, so we got a grant to create the Roxbury Institute of Business Management [Boston, Massachusetts].  So the notion was that we would have a sort of one place where we could do all of it.  We could do planning.  We could do job creation.  We could contract for whatever economic development services were needed and we could training the managers for the businesses that we stated.  And that was a reasonably successful as an idea.  I ran it for two years.  We created a number of businesses.  Several of them failed, but the Roxbury Institute for Business Management then went on to train people in a variety of fields.
Story_ID: 505993
Speaker 1: I confronted then the problem that I had to decide whether I was gonna leave MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] permanently and do that kind of business promotion and community development work or not.  And I decided not.  You know, it was fun and, but it was frustrating, and others could do it better.  We brought together quite a team.  Quite a number of notable people in the Boston [Massachusetts] area, blacks and, you know, professional life in Boston.  Got a job with Circle [Circle Inc., Boston, Massachusetts] one way or another.  And for some of them, they say it was their first job, you know.  William Bud [ph.], for example, says, you know, I got my first job with you.  Daniel Dennis [ph.] got his first job with us as our accountant, et cetera.  But then I left it and I went back to MIT and my associate who had been in my Crossroads to Africa [Operation Crossroads Africa] team to the Republic of Guinea in 1960, William Davis [ph.] took over and ran it.  And Chuck Turner [HistoryMaker Charles "Chuck" Turner] even after that took over and ran Circle (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I remember that. I remember. Chuck's been interviewed so we have a piece of that.  So you go back to MIT and what rank are you now, are you?
Speaker 1: I come back, you know, I said that everything was in order for tenure (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Little did I know that that was gonna be a real problem, but I wasn't there to know about all the ins and the outs and thank God this blessed man, Robert Wood [Robert C. Wood], who was chair of the department when I left, saw it through, but the problem was that we had three very bright scholar activists.  One of them was even a Republican.  In fact, he was the founder of the Young Republicans, no, The Ripon Society, which was part of the Young Republicans.  And then we had a Jewish activist, who is still in the area and very noted people, and we expected all three of them, you know, yes we would all get tenure.  I mean the department was growing and so forth.  The provost said you only have one slot.  So they fought it all out.  When I come back, I get tenure, but I didn't know by, you know, what a tough thing it was.  Fortunately, I was able to come back to the table, 'cause they said are you doing any more scholarship?  Are you still a scholar?  Well Circle got a contract to study solid waste management throughout the U.S. and that contract came to a consulting firm in Cambridge [Massachusetts] who needed a partner.  And they approached us, you know, will we be their partner.  I said yes, if we are the principal investigators, you know.  No more of this using our community as a kind of laboratory.  So there was some hemming and hawing but they finally agreed to it.  So I became principal investigator on this solid waste management.  So now I can come back, now their concerned about urban America, inner city politics.  The country is in flames, but I have some credible work that I can point to in that, so that really what got me tenure, and then I start teaching a new field for me, which is American inner city politics, and now I've got the experienced community economic development.  So I create a new course called the Colonial Analogy, which is to say the inner city communities are colonies in this bigger system and what we need is a decolonization process.  And I did that for a number of years.
Story_ID: 505994
Speaker 1: And then I created a new research program called the Business Management for Economic Development and the idea there was that there, there's a trick to accomplishing real development.  It's not just a matter of job creation or infrastructure development what have you.  The key is that you localize, that you indigenize if you're talking about the African side of it.  All of those tasks, all of those skills and capabilities.  How do you internalize that to a community so that they wind up not just having an outside company come in and hire people at a low level, but you can create the business or if it's a country, they don't, you don't just get foreign aid and they build some roads and ports, but you wind up with some road builders and so forth.  So business management for economic development meant how do you handle the managerial functions in such a way that whatever is the capital source winds up creating a base that's local.  And we wanted to look at that around the world, but especially in Africa and to some extent, in the inner city in there.  So that's when I go back to, to Africa with a kind of new framework.  Now just at that time, and I come back in 19-, the end of 1970 and '71 [1971], I start this.  In '73 [1973] you have the oil crisis and African economies are knocked for a loop, but out of that comes the petro surplus, you know, dollars and all of the investment programs that the oil exporting countries, the oil surplus, you know, countries, needed to find an outlet for that money that they had accumulated and they developed a program in Africa called the African-Arab Cooperation program.  So that became my next target and I took the Business Management for Economic Development framework but did studies of the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa [BADEA], the Kuwaiti Development Fund [Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development], the Islamic Development Fund [Islamic Development Bank] and so forth.  I went to Kuwait, I went to Egypt, I went to Sudan, and put out studies on the way in which African-Arab cooperation could and should work.
Story_ID: 505995
Speaker 1: Beyond Circle [Circle Inc., Boston, Massachusetts], in terms of organizations that you took a lead in, conceptualizing and operating, there are several others I'd like to talk about.  I'm not sure which order, but TransAfrica [TransAfrica Forum; TransAfrica], would you tell me a little bit about your involvement and role with TransAfrica, both locally, nationally and internationally.  What is TransAfrica?  I think we need to be told.
Speaker 2: Well, TransAfrica was our high point, you know, with regard to black political action to effect foreign policy.  It was formally created in 1977, but truthfully, the impetus for all of that, for me and even for Randall Robinson, who wound up heading TransAfrica was earlier in the late '60s [1960s], the impetus for us was the Rhodesian Crisis, Rhodesian Unilateral Declaration of Independence in what, I think, '68 [sic. 1965] or so, and the, and then you went through a period where the international community put sanctions on Rhodesia.  The U.S. then voted in the early '70s [1970s] to violate those sanctions, and then we enacted something called the Byrd Amendment [1971] that would permit the U.S. to import strategic materials.  So in the late '60s [1960s], we, you have a spirit of activism around the international dimension of the sort of decolonization process.  And I'm in, you know, I'm connected to that.  I'm trained as an African- and I'm really oriented to the international side of things.  In 1969, I go to a meeting of the African Studies Association in Los Angeles [California] and I have a long conversation with several people there, John Henrik Clarke being one of them, about the need to have the professional societies take some responsibility for the condition of the areas that they focus on.  So you don't just, if you're an Africanist, you have to be concerned about the plight of Africa, not just because you want a job long term, but because morally you have a responsibility to people you're making your livelihood off of.  And I was not able to go to, that's '68 [1968] actually.  In '69 [1969], the meeting is held in Montreal [Canada] and John Henrik Clarke and several other notable people, organized a walk out.  Essentially, they challenged the African Studies Association to take responsibility for, for Africa in the sense of supporting the liberation movement, and they refused to do it.  So the blacks walked out of the African Studies Association.  I wasn't at that meeting, but the next meeting happened to be in Boston [Massachusetts] in 1970, so in Boston you have this crisis.  The number of the liberal leaders, and some of them are really quite, you know, really quite stellar people like Manny Wallerstein for example, you know.  They're concerned about the association.  They believe we ought to engage this political dimension.  So they asked me to run for the board and I say yes, I'll be happy to run for the board, but I have a platform.  The platform is gonna be, you know, the--and I had just read Chomsky's [Noam Chomsky], 'The Responsibility of Intellectuals' and I said we have this responsibility.  So my platform is we have to engage the struggle for liberation and we have to do it in every way we can and it doesn't mean that you, you know, distort your academic research, but as an organization, we need to identify with that struggle.  And I ran for office.  I had a person join me in that platform, who was Johnnetta Cole [Johnnetta B. Cole], who was at that point at Amherst or UMass Amherst [University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts].  So we ran on this platform and we won.  However, then somebody in the leadership of the association decided this kind of vote had to be put to the entire membership, and so they did and then we lost and we resigned.  I mean we lost that, that platform vote, so we resigned from the board.
Story_ID: 505996
Speaker 1: But in the course of all of this, we [at TransAfrica Forum; TransAfrica] are building up our concern and our activity around engaging with the liberation struggle.  So when the blacks walked out of the ASA [African Studies Association], especially after the fiasco with, with Johnnetta [Johnnetta B. Cole] and my candidacy, we set up something called the African Heritage Studies Association.  I was not the founder of that, but I was in with the group.  It was John Henrik Clarke, Ron Walters [HistoryMaker Ronald Walters], Jim Turner [James Turner] from Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York].  They were the key spirits and Hershell Shalinor [ph.] came along, and then Hershell got a grant to work with the Adlai Stevenson Institute [Adlai Stevenson Institute for International Affairs; University of Chicago Center for International Studies], I think it was, in Chicago [Illinois], and so she proposed that we have some sort of retreat where we could think through how really were we going to engage the liberation struggle, and we decided to hold that meeting in Puerto Rico.  Number one we thought it would be away from all of the distractions that might go on here.  Number two, some people might come because they could then vacation, you know.  Maybe they thought during our meeting, or after.  But it turned out to be a very important watershed kind of meeting.  And a great many of the folks, black folks, who have expertise in international affairs, were at that meeting and we decided explicitly to take on the liberation struggle with a focus, and our focus was gonna be the Portuguese territories which we concluded would be weakest link in that chain, and they weren't willing, I, I pushed that we should have one focus, you know.  Do that and do it well.  They weren't willing to go that far so we also continued to look at the rest of the array of Southern Africa.  But it's out of that group that we're looking now for an organizational framework to express this.  Hershell and people working with, you know, in the [U.S.] Congress, the congressman from Detroit [Michigan] and Walter, not Walter Fauntroy [HistoryMaker Reverend Walter Fauntroy], but, oh goodness, it will come to me.  You'll have to cut this part out of the tape.  Goler Butcher is his assistant and Hershell is his assistant and they decide that we should organize some sort of lobby and try to move in that direction to create it as a council, black council, or African American council on foreign affairs.  And we looked around for some expression.  The African Heritage Studies Association creates a Committee of Positive Action and I'm on that committee and Jim Turner and Ron Walters, and we were essentially the leaders of that. And we're bringing that out of the Puerto Rico meeting.  We look around for some way to consolidate it.  We thought initially we should do it with Howard Fuller who later changed his name to Owusu Sadaukai. And who had created the African Liberation March [African Liberation Day], and so we were gonna follow it in with him.  But he was not willing to engage the more overt political action, lobbying the Congress, and so we were trying to repeal the Byrd Amendment [1971], and we came very, very close, within three votes, which came up the week after that African Liberation Day march so if we had just gone on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.] that week we probably would have won it.  So we concluded that wasn't gonna work.
Story_ID: 505997
Speaker 1: Just at that point Randall Robinson and Chris Nteta, at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Randall is in the law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Chris is in the divinity school [Harvard Divinity School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], were engaging the Portuguese territories by asking Harvard to divest itself from its holdings in the Gulf Oil Corporation and others doing business in, in Angola.  And, of course, they refused to do it, et cetera.  So that's when I first met Randall, was in the context of our looking for some framework that make our organization bigger, or I guess, get a leader beyond ourselves for it, and we, you know, were disappointed with Owusu [Howard Fuller; Owusu Sadaukai] so then I meet Randall, I said, well, you know, let's, let's collaborate and throw our, our weight behind Randall.  Randall at that point has organized the Gulf boycott, Gulf Oil boycott, so that became our first project.  In the course of doing that project we then talk about these larger visions of having a lobby, and let's move on in that direction, and so that's the group.  It's the Committee of Positive Action out of the African Heritage Studies Association coming out of that Puerto Rico meeting.  Now Randall was not at the Puerto Rico meeting, but we have the entourage then to put with him and so he moves to Washington [D.C.], takes a job with one of the congressmen, black congressman from St. Louis, East St. Louis [Illinois].  And I mean, actually he also works with the person I'm trying to think of, and, and then we plan for launching TransAfrica as a lobby, and it's formally a lobby.  We create a second institution as the TransAfrica Forum, as a 501(c)(3) to do the public education, but we were, it was hard money, you know, we were going to be able to walk the halls and try to influence legislation and influence elections.  And it took some years to put that together, but in 1977 it was, it was together, and we all went on the board, all of them from the Committee on Positive Action became the core, essentially the first board, and then I think Ron Walters [HistoryMaker Ronald Walters] recruited Dick Hatcher [HistoryMaker Richard Hatcher] from Gary [Indiana] and Dick Hatcher may have been the one to recruit [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte or Randall may have done that.  I'd already known Harry from an earlier episode and, you know, we, we launched TransAfrica as a general lobby for the African liberation struggle, not just for South Africa.  Subsequently, of course, things came to focus on South Africa after the Portuguese, the success of the Portuguese Revolution of 1974 [Carnation Revolution] and the freedom of Angola and Mozambique and so forth.  Then you had a staging area so to speak of liberated territory around the (unclear), and you could focus in, and so that's what we did, and then, you know, we come to really hone in on apartheid, on into the Free South Africa Movement in the '80s [1980s].  I, you know, got a call today that while they were in the embassy from the office saying, you know, Randall and Mary Berry [Mary Frances Berry] and Fauntroy [HistoryMaker Reverend Walter Fauntroy] are in the embassy, you know, it went as we thought and this man was not going to sort of repudiate, you know, apartheid, and so forth.  So they're gonna stay and now is the time for the secondary stuff.  So what we decided to do here was to go after the consul.  We knew it was an honorary consulate and so therefore we had a chance to actually get that person to resign because he's got more, you know, he's an American law firm with a contract with South Africa to serve as their consul and now, you know, it's a long story, but, but that tactic worked and we were able to then stage a success within a couple of days of getting the consul to resign and it became a public event.  But knowing that that might happen, we then looked beyond that success to say how do we sustain an effort here?
Story_ID: 505998
Speaker 1: And my thought was that we try to pick the next most direct representation of the South African system here, and that was the Krugerrand, because the Krugerrand is an official coin of the realm, all right?  But it's being sold in Boston [Massachusetts] to people who want to invest in gold.
Speaker 2: I remember that.
Speaker 1: Right, so we single out, we look at various coin dealers.  We pick Deak-Perera because it was located on a corner with windows on both sides and its ground level.  So we get in there and we have to stage a sit-in, the cameras can take a picture of us from the outside.  And that worked beautifully, but we actually gave them an opportunity to, to join us, that is to say, we ask you to suspend sales of the Krugerrand.  That's all we're asking, until we have a chance to present to your national leadership, the Deak-Perera firm in New York [New York], this whole framework and why you ought not handle the Krugerrand coin anymore, and so while we were in the office they called the leadership in New York and so forth, and the guys decided not to do it and so we stayed and that started the campaign.  Now that campaign in Boston took us a whole other year, every week we had a demonstration at Deak-Perera.  We did succeed in wiping out virtually the market for Krugerrand in the U.S.  They went from, they lost something like $485 million worth of market.  But what really in the end did it for the Krugerrand was that became part then of the national agenda and the Anti-Apartheid Comprehensive Act [Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986] included Krugerrand among a whole bunch of other things.  And the Free South Africa Movement [Free South Africa Movement] also went on for another year every day.  We only had to do it once a week, people getting arrested at the embassy.  Unlike Washington [D.C], however, because, and after the first round, in fact, even the night of the first round, the embassy there decided not to press charges.  They arrested people every day, but they dropped the charges.  But they didn't drop the charges in Boston until we actually were at trial, and we show up at the court house for our trial, the Boston Twelve, and we have several people either on the plane, actually already in town coming to testify in our behalf of why you should use these tactics to get the attention, the moral attention of the country, was [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte.  And he was in town, ready to do it.  Arthur Ashe called that morning to see if it was a go or not, you know.  Randall [Randall Robinson] is still in Washington, is it a go or not?  When they took a look at our line-up of people that were on the list of the people to testify, and Harry is already there, they decided to drop the charges (laughter).  And then that's, then we return the next day to Deak-Perera and we keep up the demonstrations for another year.

Speaker 1: Once you had your victory, once you won.
Speaker 2: Well, it was an astounding victory, you know.  I mean we, but, then Mandela [Nelson Mandela] is let out of jail and the next thing for me is to join with Themba Vilakazi and Margaret Burnham has us on the steering committee to organize for Boston [Massachusetts], Mandela's first visit to Boston.  Elsewhere in the country TransAfrica [TransAfrica Forum; TransAfrica] was the framework for his visit.  But we had such a strong organization here in the Fund for a Free South Africa [FreeSA], with Mary Tesale [ph.] and Judy Blair [ph.], Themba Vilakazi and so we put together this welcoming sort of committee, the steering committee within it and then, you know, a number of other important business people, Fireman [Paul Fireman] from Reebok and so forth.  The visit for Mandela to Boston was spectacular.  It was the largest of the crowds that were assembled and it was exhausting.  And after that, you know, I went and took a Fulbright Fellowship to Indonesia with Vivian [HistoryMaker Vivian R. Johnson].  In the late '80s [1980s] we had also begun to do a lot of work in Cote D'Ivoire in Ivory Coast.  Vivian was working with Dr. David French in strengthening health delivery systems, so that took her back and forth to the Ivory Coast and I went with her a number of times.  And then we did a book together in that framework.  When that project ran out, I then took up and did a book on non-governmental organizations and she helped me do that so we put that out.
Speaker 1: The title of that book?
Speaker 2: That's, the title is 'Volunteer Development Organizations in West Africa'--'West African Governments and Volunteer Development Organizations: Priorities for Partnership' [Willard Johnson and Dr. Vivian R. Johnson].
Speaker 1: Who published that?
Speaker 2: That's the American University's press [University Press of America].
Story_ID: 506000
Speaker 1: So that's the, you know, I've done that and the activist part really culminates with the visit of Mandela [Nelson Mandela], but right at that point my [maternal] grandmother [Gertrude Smith Stovall] dies.  She's 101 almost 102.  She's lived in her house since her husband [James Stovall] built it in 1905.  Everything is intact, and so, and my uncles wanted to sell the house, you know, and I convinced them not to do that, sell it to me and we'll make a museum out of it, 'cause everything is intact, you know.  So I tried to figure out how I'm gonna make a museum out of this and I need some organizational framework so I create this new organization, the Kansas Institute for African American and Native American Family History.  Now I put the Native American in there because so many of the black families in Humboldt [Kansas] talked about an Indian connection, but I didn't really put much emphasis on the Native American.  The main thing was family history, and I thought that we could turn my grandmother's house, very modest house in Humboldt, into a museum.  It would have been the first black museum in Kansas, if we had been able to do it.  Since then, much more grandiose things have happened elsewhere in Kansas, you know, but so I set out to try to do that.  We, you know, I created this organization, a number of people that have Kansas ties that I know joined me, mostly academics, Ron Walters [HistoryMaker Ronald Walters], for example, is from Kansas, from Wichita [Kansas].  He was first president of the institute, and so forth.  Then we set out to work with families to tell their stories, you know.  If we had the equipment that you have, it was a kind of HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] notion, you sit down with people, not help them do their genealogy, but once they know something about their family, helped them share it with other people.  And then we held some seminars.  We were gonna do it town by town.  So we started with Humboldt in '91 [1991] and bring together the black families there, assemble a modest number of photos and have people come and talk about, you know, those photos, and their family background, and then bring in a speaker and so forth.  And we did that for three years running, but in the course of things, you know, I was failing to raise any money to turn this house into a museum.  Meanwhile a church in Wichita has been turned into a black museum.  There's a project in Kansas City [Kansas] to get a black museum, so it has less luster from that point of view.  And there's nobody in this house.  I have a neighbor who is cutting the grass and so forth, looking out after it, but subsequently he dies, you know.  We gotta do something with this house.  It's gotta go up or down, and I finally concluded that I can't, I can't keep this house going, so I sold the house.
Story_ID: 506001
Speaker 1: But right at that point, I realize that there is something rather unique about this story that recurs so often of the blacks in that area [Humboldt, Kansas] having Indian [Native American] connections.  What's that all about?  I get, you know, now I'm looking into my own history.  My [maternal] grandmother [Gertrude Smith Stovall] had always talked about Charlie Davis [ph.] as quote the Cherokee.  And so I try to research that and then I discover the whole world of the Freedmen, the notion that there were so many of these blacks who had been slaves to the Indians in Indian territory, and even before that in the Southeast and they had come on the Trail of Tears in many cases as slaves.  Well, when I looked into Charlie Davis, I found him on a Freedmen Roll [The Final Rolls of the Citizens and Freedmen of the Five Civilized Tribes in Indian Territory; Dawes Rolls].  You know, I had the numbers 'cause she gave me his enrollment number and so forth, but I didn't understand what Freedman Roll meant.  She didn't call it Freedman Roll, she just called it (unclear), so I researched it and I found out about that, so then we had been talking about let's do some honor to the story of blacks who came on the Trail of Tears.  A friend of ours through Vivian [HistoryMaker Vivian R. Johnson], you know, I got to know her reasonably well, was Wilma Mankiller who was the chief on the Cherokee Nation, first woman elected, you know, principal chief of a major tribe.  And so, and she wrote her biography, 'Mankiller: A Chief and Her People' [Wilma Mankiller and Michael Wallis] and in it she talks about the fact that hundreds and hundreds of blacks had shared the ordeal of the Indians on the Trail of Tears, and that we need to remember that.  So I call her up and I say we think we ought to do a ceremony, we called it a mourning ceremony, you know, to mourn the loss, but that ordeal that we'd gone through together and we could do that to this Kansas Institute [Kansas Institute for African American and Native American Family History].  And you know, she encouraged that notion and I started to work on it.  But then I get into finding out that it's the slave connection effort that is the story for so many.  Our board then decided that they weren't really ready to do a mourning ceremony around that story until we understood better the extent of the slave connection, the nature of the slave connection, was it the same kind of slavery as white slavery, you know, slavery, the slave system run by whites.
Story_ID: 506002
Speaker 1: Just to back up quickly for those who may not know for this interview.  Tell us about the Trail of Tears sort of. 'Cause some people don't know about that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the tribes, the so-called Five Civilized Tribes are the Cherokee, the Creek, the Choctaw, the Chickasaw and the Seminoles.  The Seminoles was a special case, but they were all Southeast U.S., Georgia, Carolinas [North Carolina and South Carolina], Alabama, Tennessee and on into Mississippi.  You know, white encroachment wants their lands and so forth.  A lot of permutations to it but the fundamental story is the white settlement is pushing up against them constantly, and convincing them in some cases that they would have a better time of it if they moved on the other side of the Mississippi.  And then Andrew Jackson [President Andrew Jackson] comes in and he forcibly pushes that and formally adopts the Indiana Removal Program [Indian Removal Act] in 19- in 1830.  So you have an effort to get all of the Indians out of the Southeast and move them to what was called Indian Territory.  Some of those reading, you know, the signs on the wall and so forth in the sand, decide early on to make a treaty.  I mentioned earlier that the Davises [ph.] among the Cherokee had been part of those that signed their first treaty to accept removal and they went out and they were the so-called old settlers.  But in the late '30s [1830s], this picks up and all those tribes are forcibly removed at gunpoint from throughout the South to Indian Territory, which is now Oklahoma.  All kinds of blacks go with them.  They had already been slaves to the Indians 'cause the U.S. government have fostered the adoption of the African slave system in order first to get them to give up hunting and take up agriculture because that would reduce their land claims, and you no longer have these hunting fields that cover everywhere, and then once they did that, then they took it the next step and give up the farms as well, and move 'em.  So that's the business of the Trail of Tears.  It ends pretty much by 1838.  Most of them are in place in Indian Territory.  The last great movement of the Cherokees is 1838, '39 [1839], and I think that's probably when the, when my grandfather--[maternal] great-grandfather's [Martin Stovall] family came [to Kansas].  But since he is owned by somebody who is in the new, you know, in the treaty party, he may have even come at the time of the old settlers, which would have been an easier time of the trail. That would have just been a movement of migration.  But our group was not really ready to take on the Trail of Tears until we looked into it further.  So we then held a, two seminars, one in Wichita [Kansas] and one in Kansas City [Kansas], among blacks who had an Indian [Native American] connection, to try to pull out the stories.  What do you know about that connection?  What can you say about it?  And can we build some kind of program out of that, mainly still looking towards a mourning ceremony and they decide, no, we're not ready, you know.  We need to know further how to research that.  A lot of the families, including my own, they didn't, you know, they didn't know about this business of a slave tie.  They thought Charlie Davis was a Cherokee, but he's politically a Cherokee.  I don't know that he had any genetic connection with the Cherokee at all.  And I'm not sure I'll ever be able to find out.  But our next step then was to drop the mourning ceremony and just try to flesh out the story and then we, so we did two of those seminars and then we held one in Tahlequah [Oklahoma] south, the capital of the Cherokee Nation, to figure out how to research that better.  And we had Kent Carter who was the director of the Fort Worth [Texas] branch of the National Archives [National Archives and Records Administration] come to it, Ann Cummings who was in charge of Indian records from the bureau, in, I mean the archives in Washington [D.C.] came, and that was a great, a great, great event.
Story_ID: 506003
Speaker 1: In the course though of trying to learn more about Charlie Davis [ph.] and slave business and so forth, I come across the name of this Creek Indian chief, Opothleyahola.  And I'm reading about him because he shows up in so many different, you know, ways, for the Creeks.
Speaker 2: Could you spell his name for us?
Speaker 1: Oh, it's O-P-O-T-H-L-E-Y-A-H-O-L-A, but is pronounced, the O-P is like a B, so it's Opothleyahola.
Speaker 2: Opothleyahola?
Speaker 1: Opothleyahola.  Yaholo means the speaker, the crier, announcer.  The most famous Yaholo that you know is Osceola because that's actually Asi, Asiyaholo, but we shorten it to Osceola, from the Seminoles because the Seminoles are really Creeks who ran away into Florida and they were joined by blacks.  That's a new tribe, that's why I say it's a special case.  So, we, I'm researching this family story, I'm reading about Opothleyahola, and he recounts a letter, I mean this, when I'm reading about him, he wrote a letter to Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln] proposing to hold a grand council of all the tribes in the Indian Territory but that they hold it where?  Humboldt [Kansas], (laughter) tiny Humboldt.  Now it turns out that that was the town closest to the Indian Territory that was in union hands so it made sense, but I didn't know.  I was just electrified.  So now I have a connection with this story and so I pick up on that.  Let's find out what this is all about.  Well Opothleyahola was holding this council in Humboldt because all of the leadership, the established leadership of those five tribes had all sided with the Confederacy because they were all mixed blood white Indian [Native American] slave owners, and the bulk of the pure bloods who were the traditionalists were not slave owning and did not like that leadership and did not want to be drawn into this white man's war which they felt was not their war.  But they had to show the Union that they were loyal and because that's how also they only way they're gonna get that treaty enforced.  What are you going to do with this new confederacy?  Well the Confederacy offered them all kinds of stuff actually.  But, so Opothleyahola decides that once this, well, anticipating they would have this grand council at Humboldt, he gets his folks together and by the end of it, he gets nine thousand people organized on, stealthily, you know, on the sly, to make a way towards Kansas.  But they get discovered and they had to fight it out.  It's an epic story, really epic story.  We tell it on our website for the Kansas Institute [Kansas Institute for African American and Native American Family History], but they finally make it to Kansas after being routed in the third of their battles.  In fact those battles you have to consider are the first battles of the Civil War because they are, they are directly tied to the way in which coloreds and Indians come in to fight on both sides in the Civil War.  They get routed.  They finally make their way into Kansas across a barren, snow driven, you know, icy plains, in the dead of winter.  The worst winter on record up to that point in that region.  And we decided this is what we should do.  We should memorialize that epic story.
Story_ID: 506004
Speaker 1: So I create a ceremony that I call Tracing Trails of Blood on Ice [Tracing Trails of Blood on Ice: Commemorating the Great Escape].  It is no longer the Trail of Tears, it's this trail of people, because it was a bloody trail.  They were there barefoot and they were, in some cases, totally naked because all of their clothing, their wagons, their ponies, everything had been stripped in that third battle, and they scattered across the plains.  But they made it to, to Neosho Falls [Kansas], to LeRoy [Kansas], and some of them to Humboldt [Kansas], and a lot of the blacks, they were in the hundreds.  They were nine thousand who made it, ten thousand actually in the end, but I would say in the first movement that sort of refugee, you know, column, maybe there were six or seven thousand.  But they kept coming in the months following.  And a lot of the blacks stayed, and those are the first black families in Iola [Kansas], in Neosho Falls, in Humboldt, in that section of Southeast Kansas.  And those families, you go to those families and you find out they been there for a hundred and fifty years, you know, how could that be, you know?  That's the story.  Many of them came on that escape or in the immediate aftermath.  Now I don't know that Charlie Davis [ph.] came on the (unclear), but I haven't been able to prove that yet, but I have all kinds of names for people who did come, and those family names in many cases are still viable in the region.  So we did a ceremony in Humboldt in 2000 that was just Tracing Trail of Blood on Ice and I called it the Great Escape.  Now let me just say this, that that trail that then leads on into the actual battles in the formal Civil War because the Indians [Native Americans] and the blacks who came on that escape joined with the first and second Kansas colored regiments.  It had already been organized just before all of this happened by Senator James Lane [James Henry Lane], and so forth, and these are the abolitionists that did, (unclear).  I mean they're, the leading Kansas story all connects to this story.  Robert, I mean James Redpath, the whole bit.  And the, they formed their first and second Indian home guards in LeRoy and Neosho Falls and they march and their camp is in Humboldt, and they leave out of Humboldt and go into Missouri and fight the Confederacy and then they go further south and ultimately they liberate Indian territory.  Some of the blacks then go back to Fort Gibson [Oklahoma] and Fort Smith [Arkansas] and stay in Indian Territory and became, you know, the nucleus of the black Indians who are still there.  But some of them stayed in Humboldt and in that region, in Iola, and so forth.  So our ceremony, you know, connects both before the Civil War formally or during its first emergence and after.  So the counties in southeast Kansas have now taken up the Tracing Trails of Blood on Ice and they have created a heritage tour area called the Trail of Blood on Ice, and they are asking the National Park Service to create that as a part of the Bleeding Kansas, the larger Bleeding Kansas story of, of what you would call an official U.S. heritage Tour area.  But those counties have already organized the Opothleyahola Great Escape trail on their own and it's now a tourist circuit.
Story_ID: 506005
Speaker 1: We've gone on to try to research then the rest of the story of the black Indian [Native American] connection and, you know, its problematic and troublesome now because they have, you know, had to deal with the issue of perceptions by blacks and whites that there's money with the Indians.  There's not a lot of money with those Indians.  Casinos and bingo halls there don't produce a whole lot, you know.  They have the vision of the Pequots in Connecticut, or the Seminole in Big Cypress [Big Cypress Seminole Indian Reservation] in Florida or something.  Their operations are much smaller scale, but their people coming from out of the woodworks to try to get it wrote.  So there has arisen a reaction to that and it has resulted, and even the Seminoles expelling the black bands that were part, an integral part of that tribe.  And the issue now whether they're gonna enroll blacks were only on the Freedman Roll [The Final Rolls of the Citizens and Freedmen of the Five Civilized Tribes in Indian Territory; Dawes Rolls], as, you know, readmit them in the full membership in the tribe is the big issue now.  The Freedman Roll came about because the Dawes Commission, Dawes [Henry L. Dawes] was from Massachusetts, went and organized this commission to do the enrollment in preparation for breaking up those tribes.  They wanted the Oklahoma lands too.  And so the Dawes Commission just came in with a very racist attitude and they looked at people.  If you looked like you had African connections you were put on the Freedman Roll only.  That wound up in an apartheid fashion dividing a family.  Some brothers and sisters were on the blood roll and some were on the Freedman Roll because Dawes and his people thought they looked like that's where they belonged.  The ones who wound up on the Freedman Roll now can't get back into the tribe unless the tribe itself changes its, its approach.  So that's the level now of the discussion.
Story_ID: 506006
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you'd like to add to this interview that I haven't asked you about?
Speaker 2: Well, it isn't over yet.  I mean the interview may be over, but life goes on and there's a lot of struggle left.  What we're doing now in the Boston Pan-African Forum is the aftermath of the TransAfrica [TransAfrica Forum; TransAfrica] here when TransAfrica had to slough off the building and become just a think tank and we had a membership built up here.  We transformed ourselves and I must say we were done the honor when our first kick-off event was to have a reception in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] to which a person I had met years ago and had known came to be our guest and that was Secretary General Kofi Annan.  So at Roxbury at the Museum of African American Artists [Museum of the National Center of Afro-American Artists, Boston, Massachusetts], we launched the Boston Pan-African Forum with his presence.
Speaker 1: That's great.
Speaker 2: And we go on.  Now we're trying to deal with the aftermath of Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] and Rita [Hurricane Rita] hurricanes and to see what we can do to give some voice to the victims on the ground there, and there are a number of organizations that have taken up the cause of seeing that the victims themselves have some real road to play in all the planning and the action for recovery and what Boston Pan-African Forum has decided is to make that their issue.  And, you know, so this, this work is both in the family history and still in current events, both with regard to Africa and with regard to black American history and Native American history.
Speaker 1: What do you still want to do that you have not yet done, outside of the scholarship (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I would like to write this all up in a, in a real story, you know, in a real book.  And I have a number of pieces that I still have to research and some, there embedded in it a couple of untold big stories.  I don't know if I can become the historian enough to do those stories myself, but I'd like to do that.  I'd also like to go back to an earlier passion of Egyptology and Nubiology because I got so offended by the way in which museums and National Geographic even, you know, and the other representations, depict the ancient Egyptians who were for the most part indistinguishable from the Nubians.  And so that color misrepresentation is a real thing for me.  And I've done some presentations around that.  I'd like to get back to it.
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way that you have lived your life?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think it's been a blessed life.  It's just been blessed.  And, you know, we've had to put up with the winters in the Boston [Massachusetts] area, but the resources that are here to pursue intellectual pursuits and things of interest to the mind are just phenomenal, and the ease of connection with Washington [D.C.] and New York [New York], et cetera, means that you could be a part of whatever you're interested in in the world from here.  That's been wonderful.  My health has held up.  We've had a good stable framework within which to work.  I have a wonderful wife [HistoryMaker Vivian R. Johnson] and family and all of that has given us a base that even others in our, each of our families, but especially mine, you just don't have that, you know.  So in a certain sense, we still only have one foot in the middle class, you know, but for ourselves, our own nuclear family, we've really been blessed, and our daughters are very accomplished.  Caryn [Caryn Johnson] is an artist in Bedford [Massachusetts], and has some, has worked on some projects, a great note in the Cambridge [Massachusetts] area, the glass stained windows in Central Square we always like to talk about and she is trained as an electrical engineer, but she found it tough going in that field and she gave it up after working for three companies for six years, went back to her art and she's home schooling her children.  Our younger daughter, Kimberly [Kimberly Johnson Ogadhoh] and her husband live in Beaverton, Oregon.  He works for Intel in their research department.  He's from Kenya.  And she works for the Nike Foundation.  They promote, the Nike Foundation, a project she helped to develop for them, is to bring services and support to young women and girls throughout the developing areas.  And she had worked for the Save the Children foundation before that.

Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the Africa American communities across the country today?
Speaker 2: Well, I would like to think that we could make it in America.  I would like to think that.  So much more has to happen for that to be a realistic reality.  By that, making it, I don't mean that there a few people who, you know, can achieve because you have presidents of, you know, CEOs of major corporations, et cetera, et cetera.  We reached into every nook and cranny, politically, economically and so forth, but the base of our people are still, in fact, dirt poor.  The inequalities of this country map onto race much too perfectly, and so something structural has to change here.  The talented tenth are not gonna be able to do it by demonstration.  We've got to have much more power in the hands of those committed to equality and equity in the system at large.  Lots of whites, more whites than blacks, would benefit from that.  But they don't seem to get beyond race in seeing what their interests are.  You see that in the Midwest, you know, in the far west, you just wonder.  Somebody wrote a book by that title, right?  So it's very disturbing that you, you see, almost we're going in the wrong direction in terms of income and opportunity equalities.  The lower class is growing not diminishing.  The median level of income that divides income levels for the country for the first time in the history of the country in these last, in this last decade, has gone down, not up.  The further down you go, the blacker the hue.  So that's what we have to change.  I don't think I'll see it.  I just want my own grandchildren to feel that they can do whatever their talents, and they are incredibly talented young people, could lead them to do and their interest to do, and that they could do it here and not have to become an expatriate.

Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, as an activist, I guess, more than a scholar.  That, you know, I said, you know, one of the sayings is you can do better, we can do better, but we can at least do (laughter).  That, there's always something you can do and it may or may not make a big contribution.  You never know ahead of time, you just have to go ahead and do it.  So I'm, I'm an activist.  I do believe that committed action can also be thoughtful action and that it will make a difference.

Speaker 1: And this man in the middle is my grandfather, Joseph Johnson.  His sister was Carrie [Carrie Johnson] and his mother was Betty [Elizabeth (ph.)].  And on his left, to our right, is Alfred [Alfred Johnson] and to the left is the person that we call Uncle Blue [ph.].  This was taken probably in 1942 or '3 [1943], something like that.

Speaker 2: This is a picture of my father and my mother very soon after they got married in the late '20s [1920s], probably around '29 [1929] or '30 [1930].  I don't know the year of the car.  That would date it.
