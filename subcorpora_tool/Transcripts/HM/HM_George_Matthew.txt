Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe. I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers. Our videographer is Matthew Hickey. Sir, can you please give us your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is Matthew George, Jr. That's M-A-T-T-H-E-W George, G-E-O-R-G-E and we'll just do J-R. for Junior.
Speaker 1: Alright. Now is there a story behind your name at all?
Speaker 2: Nothing more than the fact that I'm named after my father and I guess the story that goes with it is that when he got his name, when he was named Matthew, he told me that when he was born, the people looked at him and said "You're gonna be a preacher." And so this is why he was named Matthew. And the other thing about it is that he's always taken pride in his name and he really loved it so typically, people will call him Mat, and so with that being the case, my way of distinguishing us two is that you have to use the whole Matthew; I don't like Mat. (Laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay now, did he become a preacher?
Speaker 2: No, he did not. He found a woman that he loved and went on to have 11 children in about a nine-year span. So I'm from a family of 11; I am the oldest, the first, and I think my mom was 16? 17; 17 when I was born and--no--yeah about that old, and so within our family we had three separate sets of twins; that's why it was like almost every other year that somebody was being born. And so they were all fraternal twins--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright. Now I was just trying to see if there's a story and--
Speaker 2: No, no, no story. (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Now I don't wanna get--okay I just wanted to ask you what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My date of birth is February 15, 1949. I was born in Birmingham, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, and Sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: Currently I am the--I'm an Associate Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Howard University where I also serve as the Chairman of the department.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is January 17, 2013.
Speaker 1: Okay. And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are now in my office in the Adams Building of the College of Medicine, Room 3430.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25165
Speaker 1: Now, before go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we always ask that only require a short answer--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and the first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)--Do I have a favorite food. Just thinking about that right now, I guess my favorite food at this moment would be sweet potato pie.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay?
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is blue.
Speaker 1: Okay. Favorite time of the year.
Speaker 2: Spring; I like Spring.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Favorite vacation destination. It's a tie between somewhere in Italy and France; particularly Paris and things like Florence and Venice. Those are my two favorite places that I would like to go--like to go vacation in.
Speaker 1: Okay. And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)--Favorite phrase or saying. My favorite phrase or saying is simply when I'm talking to most people I usually end it by saying "Be good."
Story_ID: 25166
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother is named Rosetta Johnson George; Rosetta, R-O-S-E-T-T-A; Johnson is her maiden name, J-O-H-N-S-O-N, and George, her married name is G-E-O-R-G-E.
Speaker 1: And Sir, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Okay, mom was born August 13, 1931. She was born in Dallas County in Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay. Dallas County; now that's where Selma, Alabama is, right?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--(Inaudible response).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--County seat, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, somewhere like that.
Speaker 1: Dallas County Courthouse that the Sheriff Jim Clark stood when he hit C.T. Vivian in the face with a billy club, I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. (Simultaneous)--I mean, the thing about it is that--well, I'll let you continue your questions then-- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay, well we'll get into that but--yeah. But--so she lived in rural Dallas County?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, rural (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Not in Selma?
Speaker 2: No. They--both parents--my--were from what we describe and call the country.
Speaker 1: Okay. And how far back can you trace your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Not very far at all. I can go back to her father whose name was Handy Johnson. According to my mom, her mother died shortly after her birth so she didn't really know her mother very well but she did know and love her father quite a bit. She always talked about him and I can only visualize him as a shadow as a little kid. So even I don't know him that well, but Handy Johnson was his name.
Speaker 1: Now did your mother share any stories about her father?
Speaker 2: Oh, nothing more than that. (Laughter)--Good stories but they're a little rough in that she felt--if I can recall correctly. He wasn't a very tall man but he was a tough man, he was a demanding man. And he was someone, even though they were in sharecropping-type times in territories, he didn't take a lot of bull off other people and if it was necessary to get in a fight, he would get in a fight, if it was necessary to even shoot someone, he would do that, and I believe it was also some prison time associated with him in his lifetime so that may have been part of the reason why I don't recall seeing him that much around because he may have been in jail or in prison.
Speaker 1: Now did he go to jail for shooting somebody?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I'm sure it was either--yep, that would be the case.
Speaker 1: Now rural Alabama in those days is the easy place to get in trouble--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --Because they needed people from chain gangs and that sort of thing so it was often a lot of stories about--way back in those days, you know, taking people to prison was nothing. But he actually shot somebody--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, and not--she'll say he shot and killed somebody, you know, so those are the types of things that she would talk about but more than anything else, you know, that was her dad so, you know, she said he always had a temper but that's as much as I remember. I'm sure there were things that made her more endeared to him than she ever let on, but that's what I know and can recall.
Speaker 1: Now was she with her father the entire time growing up, or did he experience time where he was away from home because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I'm sure, yeah, there was time when he was away from home and her story is that she had older sisters and one older brother, so she had two older sisters, and older brother, and a baby brother. And I think when the parents were no longer around--because I think her dad also didn't see her become an adult as well. So she always said that she had to live and she was raised by her older sisters, and they apparently had all moved up to Birmingham [Alabama] at some point in time and they took care of her and she always felt as if she was getting in their way of doing whatever it is they wanted to do. So when my father came along and into the picture, she's--and like he had a job and this is a good man, somebody was willing to take care of her, so I think this is part of the reason why she was married by the time she was 16 years old--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, so--
Speaker 1: Now, did she get a chance to go to--to finish school?
Speaker 2: No, she did not finish school, and that's why the things she stated over and over throughout her life was that one thing that she regret was not being able to get her education.
Speaker 1: Now did she talk about life out in rural Alabama growing up and what the race relations were and the condition of the, you know, the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't get those types of stories from her. With me, she was mainly about trying to be positive and, you know, with education being the thing, she appeared to always be supporting me in whatever effort she could to make certain that I did get a proper education.
Story_ID: 25167
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it please?
Speaker 2: He is Mat (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Same as yours.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Same as mine but we would put the Sr. with him simply because I am Matthew George, Jr. so he--he inherited that part.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He is June 25 or 26; 25 or 26; I can tell you more a little later. In l925.
Speaker 1: '25 [1925]?
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 1925. He was six years older than my mom.
Speaker 1: Okay. Alright. And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in a little place called Pine Apple, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Is it Pineapple or Pine Apple?
Speaker 2: Pine Apple. Apple, A-P-P-L-E. Pine and Apple (laughter)--
Speaker 1: No, I was asking because the way you said it, you said Pine Apple; so is it Pine with a capital A for Apple, or is it Pineapple (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, it's all--it's Pineapple--
Speaker 1: Alright, okay.
Speaker 2: --like the fruit.
Speaker 1: Okay. Pineapple, Alabama.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: That's interesting. Is there a story behind (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, wait; wait. Sorry, he was born in Snow Hill, Alabama--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and he lived in the town of Pineapple (laughter).--
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)--That was the other place, that's right. He was Snow Hill, Alabama; I apologize for that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Snow Hill.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: Born in Snow Hill, Alabama and lived in Pine Apple.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story behind Pine Apple? I mean why it was Pineapple, Alabama--
Speaker 2: (Laughter)--That was one of the things I was thinking about trying to do, you know, as they got older, was to go back and start taking oral histories from them about--like "What was it that you did when you were young?" And all these types of things, you know, because--well, probably as we go along, I'll tell you, you know, more about them if you need to know.
Speaker 1: Okay. Alright. So he lived in Pine Apple, Alabama, raised--born in Snow Hill--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --in 1925. Now what do you know about his side? How far back can you trace his side?
Speaker 2: That's--I can go back to his mother and I don't know for a fact that--if he even knows who his father was. I don't think he ever knew who his father was, and his mother was named Maggie Lou Smith.
Speaker 1: Maggie Lou? How would you--that's M-A-G-G-I-E?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Then Lou is--
Speaker 2: L-O-U.
Speaker 1: Okay. Then Smith.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay. You don't think he knew who is father was?
Speaker 2: No. We never--I've never known who his father was.
Speaker 1: Alright. Now did he have a stepfather growing up?
Speaker 2: That's--that's somewhat confusing because I think somehow or another he may have also been raised by his grandmother and that's been a little bit confusing because there was a family--well according to him, he had one sister and she died early so he felt as a child growing up, he grew up alone. And he basically only had his mom and, among some of the stories he would tell over the years is that he also felt somewhat abandoned by her, you know, because she was more enamored of other members in her family and I think when he looked back at it, he realized that it's one of the typical problems that we have, say within the black community, if you are the dark child, you're not always the favorite child. And it seemed as if his mother handed him off because he was a dark child. So I think he felt some resentment about that but I think throughout his life, he always yearned for her attention and she always seemed to pay more attention to other relatives in the family clan that had the lighter skin.
Speaker 1: Now did he remind her of the man that, you know--
Speaker 2: I have no idea what her reasons were. In the end, it turned out that most things in life they will come back to haunt you so whereas early on and through most of his life, she tried to keep as much distance from him, as she got older and older and then she needed to have someone to take care of her, it turned out that the only place that she could come was to my parents' house, you know, so like during her last days, mom [Rosetta Johnson] and dad were the ones taking care of her. And my mom, you know, had problems with her because she knew how it affected my dad over the years and my dad kept saying "Well, this is my mom." And he was actually happy to have her there, but he was the old fashioned type where, okay, here is some extra person you gotta take care of and that's your job. You're the woman (laughter). So she had this--
Speaker 1: She had to do the taking care of.
Speaker 2: She had to do the taking care of, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Alright. Now do you know your grandmother's--I mean your father's grandmother, what her name was?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know that at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25168
Speaker 1: Now, did you father [Matthew George, Sr.] have a chance to go to school or anything?
Speaker 2: He, like my mom [Rosetta Johnson], they both never finished elementary school. I believe they both only got an education up to about the sixth grade; that's about as far as either one of them went in school.
Speaker 1: Okay. The sixth grade; so did your father do much farm work?
Speaker 2: As a young man, that's what he did because, you know, World War II [1939-1945] and everything like that, there was an option, you could either stay and work on the farm or you could go fight in the war. He was more valuable in working on the farm so he never had to go to the service because of that. And then when he moved to Birmingham [Alabama], he got a job working in the steel mills, so he used to work for a company called Stockham Valves and Fittings. And that's where he worked from mid-forties until he retired.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now did he have relatives in Birmingham [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Yes, some of his cousins were also in Birmingham as well, so there was--I know in particular there was a Julia Jones who was one of his closest cousins, and there are a couple other people on his mom's side. There was an Aunt Rosie and an Uncle Ollie (laughter) that I recall most vividly, so those were the more active relatives that I recall.
Speaker 1: Okay. Is there a story behind Uncle Ollie because you kind of laughed when you said his name?
Speaker 2: Well, that was just--well, yeah, the story was like we--well, Uncle Ollie and Aunt Rosie it was just that financially, you know like how some relatives you tend to think of, these are the people that may have some money? And these guys like, they may have had money, but it was always suspected that they did, but they were very stingy about it; they didn't want people to really know what their financial status was or anything like that (laughter) so you could sometimes hear little funny things like that.
Story_ID: 25169
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: I don't know the exact story; my sisters are much better at recalling those things but again, as I said earlier, because my mom [Rosetta Johnson] was staying with her older sisters, my dad [Matthew George, Sr.] apparently showed some interest in her and she was strongly encouraged, you know, to not let this good man get away (laughter). But no, according to my dad is that as soon as he met her, he knew that this was the one that he wanted you know, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I've seen him--over the years, I saw him--saw her as being the love of his life because they were married for well over 60 years--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and they stayed together through all of it. He didn't abandon anything.
Speaker 1: So he was 22 and she was 16 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was, he was--yeah, she's in August, and he was like 22, 23 when he got married to her and, you know, and as they say, life happens and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'49 [1949], you know, here I come, so--
Speaker 1: Eleven children?
Speaker 2: Eleven children, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. And can you name your brothers and sisters and put yourself in the order for us?
Speaker 2: Okay, I, I'm the first one, born in '49 [1949], I have a brother David Lee George born in 1950; the first, let's see--David--first set of twins Linda and Leonard George, okay, and we called them Sister and Butch-- that was their nicknames; then a single that was Joanne George and then we had Winfred George, single; then we had another pair of twins Vanessa and Valencia; and then there was another set of twins Ronnie and Rosalind; and finally it was Michael Wayne George; that's the ba--that was the baby I think in either 1958 or 1959.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So.
Story_ID: 25170
Speaker 1: When you consider your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their sense of humor, their talents, the way they walked, talked, looked, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I'm a combination of both of them but in terms of overall personality and demeanor, I think I'm more like my father [Matthew George, Sr.] and--my mom [Rosetta Johnson] was more of a strong, take charge type person; my dad was--he was the worker, he was the, the one that would, you know--not to say my mom didn't work or anything like that, but he felt his job was to go out and make money and, and take care of the children. If someone needed to scream and holler, fuss and fight or curse at somebody and make certain that the kids got spanked or whatever, she took the lead on that; he was much more genteel, so--yeah; he, he, he worked (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. It's interesting, both your mother and father--your mother lost her mother early--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --and your father never really had a father.--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --So did--and you said they stayed together for 60 years.--
Speaker 2: Yes, over 60 years.
Speaker 1: --So do you think they really made a commitment to, you know, create a strong family because of what happened to them? I mean a lot of people have strong families, but I'm just wondering if that was--
Speaker 2: I think that was part of it. I think, you know, based on the way they--I know my dad wanted a large family because, again, part of what he grew up with being a single child and feeling alone; he didn't like not having people around him so I think that was part of the large family thing, so I think that contributed to the, you know, why there were so many of us. While my mom--you know, the times were different of course, so if this what the man wants, this is what the man gets so--but finally, after the last child, she was able to finally tell the doctors "This is it; I'm not coming back here anymore," and so she was really proud of herself for being able to say that, you know so--"Do whatever's necessary such that I will not have another child" (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because, you know, she was still a relatively young woman even at that point in time, so she could have still had a lot more children.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's in the course of about 11 years, so she was only about 37 when she stopped having (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh no, she--if I was 16--basically, she was 17 in 1949; so you're talking about maybe 10 years down to '59 [1959]; so she was like--less than 30 years old. Think about it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--(Inaudible response).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--it's nine years because of the fact that you have three sets of twins--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: --and basically you're pregnant almost every year or every, you know, 13, 14, 15 months.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right; I don't know what I'm thinking (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, that's okay; I mean I've done the math on it before (laughter) and it's like--to me it's like amazing that these two people were able to do this and it's like wow! You know, later on through the years then you realize like everything, you know, is not as rosy as you think it was, you know, because as people age and change, they start looking back at their lives and wishing that maybe some things had been different. I think during my mom's time, she looked back and she was not always happy with the things that--and the decisions that she had made. But, you know, through it all it's--we all hung in there and so--I could see here through the years becoming more and more independent of my dad and plus there was always a need for more, so she started getting little jobs as a maid and stuff like that, you know, to have her own monies and things like that.
Story_ID: 25171
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)--Among some of my earliest childhood memories would be things like having mom [Rosetta Johnson] trying to teach me how to read; that was before going to school because both my mom and dad [Matthew George, Sr.] could read and they could write. I remember her trying to do those types of things; in terms of time frame, I don't know where these things actually occurred. I can remember one of my first days in elementary school seeing the first grade. I can vividly see myself at the school on what appeared to be like a back porch just crying my eyes out because I'm no longer at home (laughter), you know, things like that so--I can remember playing with friends a lot and typically that friend would be the little girl next door; my first friend, real friend, was a girl and she lived next door to us. Also, among some of my earlier memories would be learning who Santa Clause really was because as the family continued to grow and grow, and with me being the oldest, there was only so much to go around so you--at least I was told like, "Okay mom and dad, we're Santa Claus. Okay, we can only give so much this year so you're gonna have to help us, you know, help your brothers and sisters" so--yeah, so I became Santa and things like that. It was, it was fun to me; you know, it was like okay, they entrusted me to maintain the secret and stuff like that. And overall, you know, during my growing up time, I pretty much became the third parent of the house.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, I would suspect that, yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)--
Story_ID: 25172
Speaker 1: Can you describe where you grew up and was there a specific name for your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: We grew up in two places primarily and I guess the overall area could first be called the south side of Birmingham [Alabama]. That's where I first went to elementary school, had the best friend as a girl next door, so we were on the south side; we were in this duplex type house, a row house where you had one house on, you know--that shared a big porch and the other side. So we stayed there until, I guess I was about either in the second or third grade, then we moved, and the family had gotten so large we just needed more room, so they had just opened up a big housing project; it was called Loveman's Village. So in Loveman's Village--and you could call that section of town Titusville [Alabama]. But we moved to Loveman's Village and it would have apartments in the projects that would have three, four, or even five bedrooms because we had 13 people to deal with. And so you would double up and I think there were like four bedrooms upstairs and one bedroom downstairs for mom [Rosetta Johnson] and dad [Matthew George, Sr.], you know; the living room and kitchen and a little den type area, so that's, that was my--that's what my living background was like in the city, and when I look back at everything else, I realize that basically it was just this concrete jungle is what I call it now because I knew nothing about wooded areas, lakes and all those types of things unless, of course, you went to the country, you go visit grandma and stuff like that, you know, so--yeah.
Story_ID: 25173
Speaker 1: We were talking about you living on the south side of Birmingham [Alabama] in a double house at first and then in the third grade, you all moved to Loveman's Village in Titusville, right? (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--The projects, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, the projects in those days, were they as bad as--did they have the same stigma? They have a big stigma on them now, but I heard people say they weren't so bad, but you might have been in the transition period when they were going from--I don't know.
Speaker 2: I think because of the fact that it was relatively new, and most of the people coming there or moving there were happy to have something that was big enough for their families and it was actually a community. It was a time that I recall as being--the phrase that I hear now, "it takes a village to raise a child," that was the atmosphere that we had when we, when we first moved there, and it stayed like that for years and years. That is to say your neighbors, if they saw you doing something wrong, you were sure, you would surely know that your parents would find out about it. In some cases, if you were doing something extremely wrong and if you needed to be--this is the days of spanking and whatever, okay? If that needed to be done, they also had the right and privilege, you know, to make certain that you stayed straight, on the straight and narrow--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so that did change, but not during the initial times that I was there, which is to say--I know I stayed with my parents in the projects up until the time I was 18, and I didn't see or experience any overt, you know, violence or things like that going on, and that's mainly because I was the type of person who would do exactly what his parents told him to do. So I wasn't out there to see what else might be going on; if they said "You don't go any further than your front yard" or whatever, that was as far as I would go. So they made certain that--or instilled in us that there are limits as to where you could go and I was of those people who was like so obedient (laughter) and I was basically just dull and naive, you know, my world was like very, very small. But again, it was mainly out of respect for the fact that I got two parents and these people are out working their butts of, you know, to try to make certain that we have the things we need, and maybe some of the things that we might want, you know, so if--it was my job to stay home and make certain that the rest of the kids, my brothers and sisters, were doing the right thing, and that's what I did. And I just thought it was the natural order of things and I did it, you know, happily. I just thought that was just the way of the world and so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sounds like you took the position to being almost like the third parent--
Speaker 2: I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--like seriously; you really, you had an appreciation for what they were doing and felt a sense of responsibility to do the rest.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And I don't know how or why I developed that, but I did. And--so I know my expectation was, was that--particularly once I learned that there was something outside of the projects, there was something outside of Birmingham, Alabama (laughter), then I thought my brother next to me would pick up that role, you know. And what I learned later on was that wow, even with him just being 15 months younger than me, apparently I had him checked--you know, in check as well because when I did eventually go off to college, then to me, in my mind, everybody just went, as they would say, went buck wild (laughter). The chain was off; in other words, we were gonna do whatever we wanted to do; we were gonna have as much fun as we wanna have, and he was among those (laughter) instead of being the one, you know, to take up the (unclear) and "Oh, you can't do this and you can't do that," you know, so--a lot of transitions there. And even today when I go home, there's still that degree of deference among my sisters and brothers and apparently I was somewhat harsh or stern on them because they tell me a story that I have no recollection about, you know, about--I don't know, but they--yeah.
Story_ID: 25174
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds and smells of growing up. Sights and sounds; sights among mom [Rosetta Johnson] washing, cooking, cleaning, ironing; smells--the food; pinto beans. You could always smell some pinto beans; fried chicken; Sunday dinner, things like that. Not much else to see; we used to go to the park which was down the street and things like that. Going to church, you know, that was always--for me it was a pretty interesting place because we--people my age always talk about your Sunday Go To Meeting clothes, so--(laughter). That's' the day you dress up, you know, so you just don't go to church today like they did during the time I was growing up, I mean I see people going in their jeans and whatever else, you know, but that was almost taboo; you gotta have at least a certain type of outfit that you have to have, you know, and even growing up for sisters and brothers that didn't know what church was about or anything like that but they did know what Easter was about. And that was the day for your finest and so I can remember reaching a point in time where, although I was one of the more regular church-goers in the family and among the children, I was told that "Well, this Easter you can't go because we can't get you the new suit or whatever" or something like that, you know, so--"because your little sisters and brothers have to be dressed up nice and neat so they can go," and stuff like that, so--yeah.
Speaker 1: So the convention of dressing up was so strong that you couldn't even go if you couldn't get dressed up.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean that was, that was in me. I mean my penchant for church and listening to what we were told was right and wrong was all bent on hell fire (laughter). Pretty much if you didn't do this, you're going to hell; that was pretty much the sermon week after week, you know, so--
Speaker 1: What denomination was it, and what was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: This was a Baptist--Baptist church.
Speaker 1: And the name of it?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't know all of the churches that we went to but eventually I did get baptized and things like that, but it took me a long time to figure out like that's not really church if this is what they tell you. But that didn't happen until I went to college and found out like how religion even came to be (laughter). So again, that's my world, you know; so I can recall turning 12 years old according to one of the things that I thought--I think I learned was that--well, you know, until you're 12, all of your sins, they go to your mom, you know. And then--so on my 12th birthday, it's like oh my goodness (laughter), oh my goodness, now it's all on me. And so it's like you walk around with this level of fear that okay, if I--and just the thought, you know, of doing something wrong, you know, it's like okay, that's another thing, so you're just ticking off all of these things, you know, that you might even be thinking about. And even if your mind begins to wonder into 'is there really God?' You know you're done (laughter); you know you're done right then and there, you know, so--it was stuff like that.
Speaker 1: That kind of thinking you said didn't start until college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I--yeah, I mean once--I mean but not going, but up until the time I went to college, this is the way I used to think. I used to think that you couldn't question anything that was coming from what the preachers, deacons or whatever told you, you know; and it was--like I said, once I got to college and then you realize like this is nothing but reasoning and convention and logic and--this is some manmade convention that has put all of this stuff together to say "Okay, this is what really happened and okay, do you agree or do you not agree?" It's like are you kidding me? You know, it's--not that I stopped like--say more or less believing in anything, but then what the college experience did was to say you can think for yourself, you can ask any questions you want, and your faith does not have to be--does not depend on the person trying to deliver the message, you know, because there were other incidents that led me to realize like if you're putting your faith in a man trying to tell you what the word of God is, you're doomed because you finally realize like you're responsible for your own faith and own actions and things like that, you know, but it's a nice philosophy, you know; gives you some good ideas on how to live your life and everything like that, but--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, but not to be taken literally.
Speaker 2: No. And that's what I'm saying, it's like--I guess the big lesson is that only when you expand your world do you learn something different; that was the big lesson for me is that if you stay in the same place all the time, you hear the same stories, you can--and you will relieve these things, you know. So now I know what it's like to live in say a country that has control over all the media; this is all you hear, this is all you're gonna believe, you know, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah. That was what my community (simultaneous)--
Story_ID: 25175
Speaker 1: Did you have like newspapers coming in the house?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely; that was one of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Radio, T.V.?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, but you know, mainly during those times, all--what I wanted to do was go outside and play; that was, that was always key. But the lessons about the news and the newspaper, that was my father's [Matthew George, Sr.] thing; and that's something I got from him; this is probably why I said early on that I'm probably more like him, even today. It's not that I don't like e-this, e-newspapers or e-books, but my dad had that newspaper every day. He would always watch the evening news every day, you know, so--and that's how we stayed informed, and then I realized like, oh, this is cool; and I liked it and I still do, even today. He definitely wanted us to--at least me for certain and--my interactions with him was about, you know, news events and things like that, so--
Speaker 1: Now did he--I guess he'd have to keep up with the Civil Rights movement in those days (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh, who, who, who, oh now of course you know, we grew up in Birmingham [Alabama], which also was dubbed "Bombingham" because of the fact that we did have lots of bombs going off, we had the 16th Street Baptist Church blown up, we had the four little girls blown up there--
Speaker 1: Now you were the same age as they--
Speaker 2: --I was--
Speaker 1: --You were about--you were 13, right?
Speaker 2: --Yep. Right there, I even knew one of them; McNair; she was in my class; I think I had just moved to the ninth grade and I think it was probably over that summer that the event happened; water hoses, dogs, all of that kind of stuff. You knew as a black person growing up in Alabama that there were certain areas of the town that you could be in and be okay, you knew not to be out at night at a certain time being the only one because whenever something happens, that profile that goes up or the caricature that goes up, 'somehow it looks just like you' (laughter), or any black man.
Story_ID: 25176
Speaker 1: What was the name of your grade school?
Speaker 2: I began in W.C. Davis up until about the third grade. And then from the third grade on--elementary I was in--shoo--W.C. Davis--Washington Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Okay, now let me stop here and just ask you about W.C. Davis--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --Now you started school there; did you like school initially?
Speaker 2: Like I told you, that was why I started crying first. But school was a place I really loved (laughter). It was--school to me was just fantastic, but I left home every day with the, with the dictate from mom [Rosetta Johnson], it's like "Go to school, act as if you've got some sense, and do what the teacher tells you to do." That was my mandate from home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay? And so that's pretty much what I did, you know, throughout all of my elementary school and high school days. That was, that was it. So I didn't think doing those things that the teacher told you to do were wrong, it was just what you had to do. This was what you had to do to move on.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a favorite (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Excuse me.
Speaker 1: --subject in school, or favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: I may have had favorite teachers along the way, but I don't recall who they were. Subjects, it didn't matter, I just--again, it was like you gotta do what they tell you to do. I can recall being in the third grade and making perfect scores. If we were using A's at the time, I basically had like a 4.0 for the entire year. And that was during a point in time where the practice was that if a student displayed excellence in every subject, then they would be skipped a grade; in other words, you could move, you know like being--instead of being promoted from the third to the fourth grade, and I would be going to the fifth grade. Well, they stopped doing that for whatever reason because I think studies today would say like oh, children are too young, then they would hold the students but--so I just missed that, but that was one of my quote unquote best years in elementary and high school; in those--was to have a score like that. I kind of liked that but I didn't know why; it was just that--again, I didn't think I was doing anything special because, again, what was the dictate--go in, do what the teachers tell you to do, if you do it then things work out. And so I just thought it was a regular, normal thing. So, what was special about that? I just did what I was taught--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so, when I look back at it, it's like that was kind of dumb, but I guess it was the safe and right thing to do because that's what I did.
Story_ID: 25177
Speaker 1: So what about your teachers? Any favorite teachers there? This is--once again, it's a black school, right? (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh, everything, everything, everything is segregated there. It wasn't until I became--I think around the end of my junior year because I would have had an opportunity to be transferred to a white school, you know, because of the laws against integration, you know, like had to be struck down and stuff like that. I know--let's see, where was she? Was she in high school or elementary school? I think she was--she could have been in high school; she must have been a high school teacher. No, they wouldn't spank you in high school so--no, they weren't that crazy at that point. Corporal punishment was already outlawed so it had to have been elementary. So one of my favorite teachers and what her subject matter was I don't recall. Miss Annie Mae Mitchell Smith; if you could only think of one teacher (laughter), so based on that alone, she had to have been special. This lady cared very much about her students, okay? And she also had no fear of the rule of no corporal punishment, okay? If she felt someone deserved being paddled in the hand or on the butt or whatever, she would do it; and she had a style (laughter). And--
Speaker 1: What was her style?
Speaker 2: Oh, well one of the things was--part of it was her setup. First of all, she'd have to send one student out to serve as a spy because the whole point of the game you're not supposed to spank children in school anymore so somebody had to go out in the hallway, and if any other teachers were coming by, or principal or whatever, they could run back and tell her so she could stop her activities (laughter). And so she also had no problem in paddling a whole class, you know. She would take a ruler and just take your hand and give you about five or six whacks, and she would line up a whole classroom. I can recall one class I went--I was coming to her class and I was a little bit late that day, but apparently she didn't like the fact that everyone had come in and made so much noise with their chairs going up to the table. So by the time I got to the room, everybody was already in line and so I'm just sitting in the chair trying to figure out why is this happening? And she looked over and said "And what's your problem?" (Laughter). So I had to get up and get in line too. One of my best friends did something wrong and it must have been really, really bad in her eyes. And here it is I'm 63 years old; to this day, I have no idea what this woman told him. But whatever it was, it was--it affected him in such a way that he was told to never repeat what she said to him and he was to report to her, okay, anyone who asked him (laughter) what she said. So to this day, I have never asked him what this woman said to him, and I know she's been dead for years, okay? So this is the power of Miss Annie Mae Mitchell Smith. So she would--it must have been some type of social studies thing because I can also recall her talking about like how people should dress, how people should take care of themselves and their bodies and how they should smell. If you were to come to school and you had any body odor at all, I mean she had a little bowl, soap and water and she would, as they say, rinse you off a little bit. And she had this big demonstration--I know this is going on a while here, but I'm gonna wrap it up with this story about the way she would discipline people and put fear in all of us, and she said like "Okay," you know she would tell us who she was and she was saying "And if you go tell your parents, go ahead, talk." She dared any of us to tell our parents about anything that she did, okay, in terms of discipline. And we had tall ceilings, kind of like what we have in this office here. And we used to have this long hook to like open and close the transit. So she said "Okay, imagine your parents coming in--come in and say 'oh hi Miss Smith' and 'my child told me about blah, blah, blah.' I'm gonna say "Hey, Mr. and Mrs. so-and-so, and it's so good to see you and I'm so sorry that this thing happened to your child." But then she would tell--at the same time she would say "but see, as I'm being very nice to your parents, I'm slowly easing my way over to the window where the pole is and once I get to the pole, I'm gonna take it and (demonstration) hit your parent." And we were just like "ahhhh" (laughter). These were her tactics, but part of it was--in the end was that she wanted us to be the best people possible because she did know that without a proper education and us not taking it seriously, you know, we wouldn't be able to make it. So we had--in the end, when I look back at it, I realize that we had a lot of teachers that cared and I think that was because we had the best teachers because that was the only one place that they could go, and that would be to the segregated schools. So we got the best of the best that way so in a sense, if you took advantage of what they had to tell you, then you were actually getting a good education, you know, so--
Story_ID: 25178
Speaker 1: You all were Baptist. Did your parents ever discuss the activities of Fred Shuttlesworth?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, my dad [Matthew George, Sr.] was--oh. The Civil Rights movement was my dad's issue. He was so happy that this thing was coming. This--the Civil Rights movement was okay with my mom [Rosetta Johnson], but she didn't particularly want to be out front on that in any way at all, and she didn't want her children involved in this in any shape or form. So my dad is like keeping up with Fred Shuttlesworth, Martin Luther King, anybody coming in and out of town, and Ralph Abernathy, the whole nine yards.
Speaker 1: Now do you remember when Fred Shuttlesworth's house was bombed?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah. My dad came back, it was as sad as all outdoors because part of the movement was that they would always go meet in the churches, alright? So--and I hope I'm not making this up, I really hope I don't--I'm not making this up. But in my mind, for whatever reason to this very day, I'll always believe that, at some point in time, I may have seen Martin Luther King preaching in one of the churches--no, during one of those Civil Rights meetings; that's because my dad--I do recall my dad coming to me and he said--because they call--my nickname at home is Maine, okay?
Speaker 1: Is what?
Speaker 2: Maine, M-A-I-N-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's like Man, but they call it Maine? (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, Maine, yeah; in the south it's like "That's my little Maine," you know, so you're Maine. So at any rate, so my dad came and got me, he said "Now don't you say a thing; don't say a word; don't tell Rosetta anything." And next thing I know, like I'm in the church, you know, at the Civil Rights meeting and one of the speakers is Martin Luther King. And I'm--I'm like 95 percent sure that this actually happened, that it was King there, and that made him so proud, you know, but it's like--like I said, I don't know if this is an inventive memory but I do know that I went to one of the Civil Rights movement meetings with my dad, and I think he was on the agenda at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you remember what he said?
Speaker 2: Emm emm--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was just happy to be there with my dad and to see him happy. You know I knew something wonderful and significant was happening, because he was like--for him to like sneak out, you know, on Rosetta (laughter) 'cause you mess with her, you're gonna get cursed out. That was her thing; she had no reservations about cursing, you know, and you could be the brunt of it and so he sneaked me out that night, you know, so.
Story_ID: 25179
Speaker 1: Now you were 13 when they had the children's march in Birmingham [Alabama]--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --where--I guess it was at James Bevel and maybe some others exhorted the children to leave high school and come downtown and march--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --when the Birmingham movement was going on. I think Dr. King [Martin Luther King Jr.] was in the Birmingham jail where he wrote his famous letter--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and some of the other reverends involved in the movement, and Bevel got the kids to come out and--because everybody else was in jail, right? They didn't have anybody else left.
Speaker 2: Yeah. But see those are the things that I more or less--things like that I missed out on because, as I said before you know, mom [Rosetta Johnson] was not gonna let us be involved in any of that. (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--(unclear)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--The images of--the images on television were so violent to her that she just was not gonna let her children, you know, get hurt or be exposed to that; nothing live.
Speaker 1: You know, I think those images from Birmingham in particular were the most horrifying ones that people around the world put pressure on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--to do something about it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know I--when I moved forward to my college years and--I'm jumping ahead here, you know like--you hear the term "You're a Bama," you know, which is--use a little southern (unclear) or whatever (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--that's a term--especially in [Washington] D.C. they use a lot here (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, absolutely. But the point is is that even in Texas, a little small town that I was in--Marshall, Texas--and the kids were like "I know you're glad to get outta Birmingham," you know, I was like "Come on," I said "Without Birmingham, you wouldn't be as free as you are today." I said "If George Wallace hadn't stood in the school house door you wouldn't have your freedom today that you have." So I said, like you know, despite all of that, I said "We helped create this freedom that you have right now."
Speaker 1: Let me just back up a second (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I know, like I said, these things just make you jump around a little bit.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. But let's back up to the term 'Bama,' which is used in D.C. more than any other part of the country to describe somebody from a rural, fresh to the city and all that sort of thing, you know? Well would you take it as meaning--I just wanted you to give a definition (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh no, no, I think I kind of described that as they looked at you as a little backwards, ill-informed, easily duped type person and things like that, but when I look at the entire history of say the United States, and you look at all of the leaders and presidents that we had--we've had over the years, all these people are from the south. So people using the term in a quote unquote derogatory way, they have no sense and idea of history (laughter), you know, so I look at them and I say "Okay, we know who the real one is."
Story_ID: 25180
Speaker 1: So in Washington Elementary School, you said you didn't really have any science but were there any particular subjects or teachers that you really--
Speaker 2: It's just--it's just images and classes and things like that, you know; just the general stuff. One image that kind of sticks out is that the birthday calendars that some classes--some class would have, and you know, they'd ask for your picture to be up on your month and everything like that, and they would ask "What is it that you want to be when you grow up?" And I can recall at that time I wanted to be--fly a jet plane; that was like my big aspiration at that time. Then another year, I think I was getting into trying to figure out like who I was or what type of person I wanted to be a little bit more. You know, you start thinking about stuff and so, how would you describe yourself. And so I was beginning to get to the point where I was trying to develop a philosophy of not wanting to be just like everybody else, you know, so if--most people say "Well, I'm gonna be cute, I'm gonna be handsome, I'm gonna be that." So how could I be different? So I said "I'm gonna just be wonderful." But that was my thing, I thought that was great. If everybody likes chocolate ice cream, I'm not gonna like chocolate ice cream; I'm gonna like vanilla.
Speaker 1: Okay. Were you different when you were a kid, do you think?
Speaker 2: I didn't think so, I just wanted to be. And actually, every chance--every opportunity that I could be different, I tried to do that as long as it wasn't hurting somebody else or anything like that. So I'd signed on early to do unto others as you would have them do unto you, so I was that type of person. But I did want to have something that I wanted to try and identify as being unique to me, and then as I've gotten older, I realize it's like (laughter) what a joke that really is, you know, because things that you think you would react to differently than somebody else? Guess what? You pretty much do the same thing that everybody else does, which is to say now, when I look at it, it's like we're all human, you know. So we just have different skills--sets; different skill sets--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but--yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have any ideas in grade school about being a scientist?
Speaker 2: Absolutely zero. None. Only thing I knew I wanted to do in grade school was to be able to get through high school and get a job so I could help my mom and dad take care of the sisters and brothers. That was my ultimate goal.
Speaker 1: Now what was your impression of scientists in those days from--
Speaker 2: I don't even know if I even thought about scientists. I'm pretty sure I didn't, you know. I really, I really didn't think about things--I mean, for me, I was so--when I look back at it, I was just so naive, my world was so small. My world involved going home, helping take care of the kids at home, and going to school; that was it. Maybe getting a chance to go lead--leave school and go play basketball at the park. That was it; I'd go hang out with my friends or if it's Spring, we're gonna go play baseball or we're gonna play basketball, we'll play touch and contact football, you know. That's it--that was it; I didn't do anything else other than that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25181
Speaker 1: In high school, now where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to Ullman High School, U-L-L-M-A-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Excuse me.
Speaker 1: Ullman High School.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: And I guess you kind of--did they--were they tracking the students in terms of you're going to college or not and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: They were, but I didn't find that out until I was about like a senior.
Speaker 1: And what track had you been in?
Speaker 2: I guess general education vocation because in thinking about this upcoming interview, I realized that we had an alphabet system in place whereby the college students were even classes like A through E or something like that, and everybody else, you know, would be whatever; whatever you get. So I think by the time I initially got--I, I was like in the in-between area. They didn't know if I should be the vocation type or the college type, so I think I was in like 9-E or 9-D, okay? And then by the time you become a junior and then they split you up again and--because at that time, I was clearly not just the vocation type student, but my grades, which I didn't even know anything about, had me either being in the A or B group; that's where I should have been. And the way you got split up during your junior and senior year, particularly your senior year, was--had to have been junior, I believe--was they begin to prepare you for a business track, that's what they called it which is to say you can learn how to use the typewriter so you can go to vocation school and you could be a secretary or this, that or the other, so they had that. Now, for me in the 11th grade, that was a $35.00 rental fee for use of typewriters, you know. And we didn't have $35.00, you know. So it was like what was the other track left, and that was like the college track--science track that was left (laughter). And that was, believe it or not, free. Even though you would have experiments and things like that, some glassware and stuff, that was free. But to rent the typewriter cost 35 bucks and we didn't have 35 bucks. So I said "Okay, cool." So now I'm tracked, tracking with the college science, science, science kids and so that's pretty much how I first got into science. I recall it was one other young lady that was equally as smart as me I guess, and we ended up being paired together because you end up with a home teacher who is like the French teacher, okay? And because we're still not (laughter) really part of that track-track all the way, and we were like 'well, we want to learn Spanish,' so we'd report with the French side of them and then go do Spanish and then catch up with them later to do all of the science stuff. So that went on for a couple of years.
Story_ID: 25182
Speaker 1: Also, during the 11th grade, one of my friends she came to me and said "Something good is gonna happen to you today." "What the heck are you talking about?" So you know we have assembly, and where you have these (unclear) monthly meetings and everything, and so I'm there in assembly with a bunch of my other friends, and I'm looking at the program, it's--you think it's gonna be dumb and boring which most of them were, but that particular day it's about the National Honor Society and suddenly you hear your name (laughter).
Speaker 2: So you were on it but didn't know it.
Speaker 1: Had no clue, but she knew. And the other thing about it was that it was a lot of other project kids that were being inducted at the same time. So we had the middle class kids who normally, you know, get inducted, and then there was us. It almost like a little first; it was like we were like the project slash ghetto kids being culled in with the middle class--the kids from the Honeysuckle Circles and the Honeysuckle Hills.
Speaker 2: Now that's a real name of a real group?
Speaker 1: Honeysuckle Circle, Honeysuckle Hill, okay? That was the name of the neighborhood. If you had a couple of bucks, you could get you a nice brick house, you could be an upper-class black person and you lived it. Fred Shuttlesworth (laughter); that's when it got bombed (laughter), okay? (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--On Honeysuckle Hill?
Speaker 1: Yeah, or something like that. But here's the kicker, and Yolanda's gonna get me for this (laughter). "Don't call any names." I'm sorry, it's a part of my life. Reverend [John Wesley] Rice lived in the Honeysuckle Circles and the Honeysuckle Hills. And he was the high school counselor.
Speaker 2: And Reverend Rice is the father of our former Secretary of State?
Speaker 1: Condoleezza's daddy.
Speaker 2: Condoleezza, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay? And so here it is, we're more or less, you know, busting up the show because we may not be the right type of people (laughter), but they can't deny the numbers, you know. We got the GPA's, we got the grades and things like that, but never once--at least me, I don't know about the others, but during those three years in high school, I never was counseled by Reverend Rice about a possibility or an opportunity to go to college.
Speaker 2: So--well wait a minute; now you're saying that you're in a National Honor Society--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --you clearly are working above the level of the general course (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--But again--
Speaker 2: --but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--remember what--remember, from the very beginning what I was told by my mom [Rosetta Johnson] to do when I go to school, right? That was, that was my mind set. This is how naive, this is just how dutiful I was, this is what I do. This is what I--I followed orders, rules and regulations.
Speaker 2: And you were the first in your family to get that far because you're the oldest, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 2: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, I'm, I'm--every step I take you know, I'm breaking ground.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I guess they're looking forward to just you graduating from high school, right?
Speaker 1: Exact--this is--they told me "All we can give you is a high school education. Everything else is on your own. This is why we cannot give you $35.00 for vocational school. We can make certain that you have enough food to eat, the lights on, heat is on, gas, all that kind of stuff. We will give you what you need. I will wash your clothes, I will iron your clothes, okay? You do the rest, okay?"
Speaker 2: But to think of Reverend Rice (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--I'm not trying to--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--a counselor, I know you're not trying to do that, but if this is--I believe what you're saying that he didn't do it. If he didn't counsel you then, you know, he's missing an opportunity--I don't know if everybody with your qualifications didn't get counseled, but that seems like a really--that seems like something that really slipped by; a really important person that slipped past him that he should have helped.
Speaker 1: Well, like I said, it wasn't just me I mean--as I said, there were several other project kids that were also inducted at the time. It was the strangest honor society that they've ever had, you know. We weren't the best dressed, we weren't the most well-spoken or anything like that, but we were the kids that got the job done. We did well academically, and the rankings said this is where we belong, and once we got into the honor society for our high school, the whole set of dynamics changed, your know; it really changed. And we became little heroes, if you will, to all of the people that did not live in the Honeysuckle Circles and the Honeysuckle Hills; they were just like 'bout time, thank you guys, okay--and girls because it wasn't just guys, I mean there were some females that were inducted that year and they also didn't live in the right places. But as a little collective and as a group, they were so proud of us because we were them; we were them.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 25183
Speaker 1: Now did you know Angela Davis' family? (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, I mean--I think they were just--again, the other thing about me is that I don't mix a lot; I'm always with whatever age group or class group I'm in. I don't go too far up above me and I don't go behind me, so I'm usually with--my click is always the same, you know, so I think that's something I missed out on but, you know, there are people who can mix throughout the whole thing, but for me if I'm in the 11th grade, I'm dealing with 11th graders, not 12th graders, not 10th and 9th and so forth. So, yeah--so that was the beginning, and then I think by the end of the year or even during the beginning of our senior year, then I became like the President of the Honor Society and stuff like that. Then as a senior, I became the president of the senior class again. That was something I reluctantly ran for. I was just like--because my whole thing has been to not seek attention in any shape or form. I just want to do what I need to do and I don't like--I don't look for recognition; that's why, you know, just even doing this interview thing right here is a little bit outside of my range (laughter) or comfort zone I should say, you know, but typically, you just try and be a good person and I think things usually work out for you, but--no; so those were some things happen; when you look back at it, you realize like that.
Speaker 1: So did you play any sports or anything in school?
Speaker 2: I--as they say, I was the sandlot hero (laughter). I was the greatest that never was (laughter). But no, and I did one year to go out for varsity basketball and--but I could tell because I wasn't a part of the culture, you know, all the way from the ninth grade up, that the culture pretty much made up its mind about its team and it was like I'm wasting my time here. And so we would have physical activities during lunch time and stuff like that so you could go out and compare your skills against the people on the team and then they would come back, "You should be on the team." It's like "No, it's okay." So me--like I said, me and my friends, we would all play sports amongst ourselves and everything like that, but basketball was one of my favorite sports and I was very good at it; very good at basketball.
Speaker 1: That's one of the most curious things about culture and I've seen that. Even when I was in high school, the culture overlooked somebody for whatever--we can't figure out what reasons--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --they just didn't like certain people, didn't want them on the team already had this set guys (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh yeah, right. And they clearly knew--and that they clearly know that there's some additional talent. One of my other close friends, he stayed with them all the way to the end; he was like the last cut. But I'm saying "John, they're not gonna let us play." You know; "they're not gonna let us play." But he said like "No, I'm gonna show them, I'm gonna show them."
Speaker 1: And I could play better than John (laughter), but he--they let him stay there until the final cut. He never made the team, you know, so--but it's okay, you know. As I said, you find your opportunities with your friends and for the most part, it doesn't take that much sometimes to make me happy you know, so--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I'm okay.
Story_ID: 25184
Speaker 1: So now how did you--who counseled you about Wiley College?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)--There was this little lady that came in my senior year. Again, this is the part where for me kind of gets strange. Is this fate? Is this predetermined? What's going on? Is there a God out here, you know, messing with you or something? Reverend Rice got a job, I believe as a Dean Stillman College, and then when I look back at his history, well his family has a history with Stillman College so he bails out just as I become a senior when we still have the Vietnam War ranging wild because now we're into '66 [1966], '67 [1967]. And me and my worldwide knowledge, which is the projects, go to school, come home, go play basketball on the park, okay? That's my world view (laughter). This little lady comes in, her name is Coman, C-O-M-A-N; I wish I could remember her first name. Her first order of business as high school counselor is to call in every senior one by one to find out what their future plans are, okay? I go in, "What are your plans for college?" I laugh like "None." "Well what do you plan to do?" "I am going to get a job, I'll probably be working in the steel mills trying to make some money to help my mom [Rosetta Johnson] and dad [Matthew George, Sr.] take care of my brothers and sisters." She shakes her head and she says "Look over here on the wall." She has a map of the world. "What is this? What's this country over here?" "Don't know." "Vietnam." "Okay, okay, so what. What does that mean to me?" She said "You're just wasting brains." She said "Do you know that you have the second highest average in the school?" She said "Not in the class, you have the second highest average in the school." I says "So what does that mean?" You know? She said "Oh, okay; you're going somewhere, you're going to college." I said "I don't have any money for that." And she said "Oh my Lord; you don't need money to go to college." No one had told me that; no one told me about scholarships, no one had told me about loans, no one told me about how to apply to school, no one had prepped me for ACT, SAT or told me any of those types of things. I had no idea what was involved. I was set--my mind set was I'm gonna make it through high school, I'm gonna get a job and help mom and dad. That was, that was it. This lady intrigued me; she said "Oh no, no, no. You're going to college." So recruiters are coming in all the time. I mean people from Harvard University, everywhere; all coming down. She didn't even know what talent, how raw the talent she had that she was working with (laughter) until we went to our first interview. So--and she has--at that time she had a very brand new Thunderbird. "Don't worry about anything; I'm gonna take you to the interview and we're gonna be okay." First question from the recruiters from Harvard "And what is it you want to major in? What is it you want to do?" I had zero clue, I had zero answer; it was like "What are you talking about?" She sits there, she hangs her head. She never shows me--she never fusses at me or anything like that. She finally realizes like 'this guy really, really has not clue (laughter) about what it's gonna take to go to college' (laughter). She didn't even know the project that she had even taken on or anything like that, but that didn't stop her. We met with people from [University of] Notre Dame and other places, and then throughout the process and I was close to going to Clark--one day I was going to Clark College--Clark University in Atlanta [Georgia]. She had worked it out where I could get a partial scholarship and work study, so I'm like getting ready to go. "Mom, I'm going over to Atlanta" and yelled "Good to go." So I'm kind of like figuring this thing out. And then Wiley College comes in the next day. "Hey, we are looking for bright students, okay? And we have a full four-year scholarship." Said "I got just the person you need." And so that's how I went to Wiley College on the promise of a full free four-year scholarship, and Miss Coman's job was to make certain that if a student did not go to a college or a community college, they would go to vocation school, so that was the first year everybody in the 12th grade had an opportunity to go do something with their lives because, as she explained to me when she looked at--when she showed me that map of Vietnam, she said "This is where you could possibly end up. This is a war, and people get killed in wars; you could be there." So when I finally did get my draft number which is like 73? That's the number? (Laughter) Which is to say "Oh, you're going out like soon as you walk off the stage" (laughter) so it's somewhat ironic in coming to Washington, D.C. or visiting D.C. and then seeing the Vietnam Wall, and then realizing that, you know, by some twist of fate or whatever, I could see my name on that wall. Because if this woman hadn't come into my life, that's where I was destined to go.
Story_ID: 25185
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this. In terms of chemistry, did you--I mean biology--did you have any biology in high school?
Speaker 2: Whatever the curriculum was in that, I'm sure I did, yeah.
Speaker 1: But you didn't pay any special attention (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I didn't pay any special attention to it until--I must have had those types of things because when I went to Wiley College and because I had just come out of the--was coming out of the Civil Rights era, I knew--I kinda like knew what I wanted to do. I wanted to be in political science and so--political science, there was no major at Wiley College. So I looked at myself and said "What else do you know best?" Biological sciences; so apparently I did have those things during my junior and senior year but, you know, were they something special to me that stood out? No. Again, all of this is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--So you took--when you went to Wiley--I don't want to jump over Wiley but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, that's okay.
Speaker 1: --but let's go on and go to--so high school graduation, were you Valedictorian or Salutatorian?
Speaker 2: Salutatorian. (Laughter) Oh.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting about that event. In graduation, you're now learning, you know, Salutatorian? Valedictorian? It's like--and you realize that you scared some of your teachers that like you and even love you. You know during the time as a senior there, you get days off so--but me, since I am the Salutatorian which means I have to give the speech, they wanted to make certain that I spoke well, I was gonna be--I wasn't gonna basically embarrass them (laughter), so while all of my fellow classmates are out having fun partying and stuff like that, I'm left behind to practice, and practice, and practice, and practice, and practice. And so that's what I remember most about it, and finally I had one day where I could kind of like leave early like everybody else so apparently I had gotten it down. But yeah, it was--that was it, you know. But my French homeroom teacher who served as my homeroom teacher, she was the one that encouraged me to run for student council president, class president and things like that. And she was one of the people that also helped prep me for giving the Salutatorian speech and so when I look back at these people, I'm saying like "Okay," well you had help along the way, but for the most part it was, you know, dumb luck (laughter).
Story_ID: 25186
Speaker 1: How did your parents feel about you going to college?
Speaker 2: They were elated. They were just like "Okay, now we got somebody going to college." Plus, I'm thinking that 'alright, okay, I'm the first one so if I go, then this is gonna be another thing that my brothers and sisters could see me do, they'll see this as a good thing and they'll follow along in my footsteps.' Okay. What I didn't realize was that along the way, that as they were following me through elementary and high school, all of the teachers were telling them "And you had better be as good as your brother was." So they were being beat down with expectations of them having to do as well as or better than I had done, whereas I'm just thinking like all I'm doing is what I was told, not seeing any of this as a big thing. And so, as I said before in terms of responsibility and being the third parent and my thinking that my brother next to me is gonna pick up the mantel, he says like "No, I can go chase girls, I can have girlfriends, I can go try drinking," and this, that and the other. My sisters, "I can go try and find boys, I can go try sex," and in one year, all of those things happened. I had--my two oldest sisters graduated from high school pregnant. It's like "It was just one time." Well, that's all it takes (laughter). But the point I'm trying to make simply is that no one picked it up. I didn't realize that my influence as a third parent had run so deep. I didn't' know that the teachers that knew me put this kind of pressure on my sisters and brothers and they maybe didn't like it; maybe I shackled them down with restrictions too much. Maybe I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Inaudible response)
Speaker 2: --Maybe I was just too strict, so--
Speaker 1: What do think, that if you were around that your sister would have gotten pregnant?
Speaker 2: I don't think I would have let them out of the house. (Laughter). You know, they were--you just can't go somewhere and not tell me where you're going, or you can't go somewhere and not have a curfew you know--or whatever. I don't know what I was doing. All I was doing was what I thought was the right thing--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, so whatever the heck I was doing, it was stymying their outside activities.
Speaker 1: Well your absence stymied it maybe, or--
Speaker 2: No, that, that--whatever it was, I inhibited them in some way because once I wasn't there anymore, they could do whatever they wanted to do, and they did.
Story_ID: 25187
Speaker 1: So did you do anything special over the summer between high School--between Ullman High School and Wiley College?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I'm trying to remember when I started doing some of the odd jobs that I had. I'm sure I did something because at some point, I learned how and why it is that if you go into a grocery store first thing in the morning--even as early as 7 or 8 a.m. in the morning, you have some of the most shiny, sparkling, clean floors ever; that's because there are people like me and my dad [Matthew George, Sr.] with his second job. We're in at midnight, you know, buffing, cleaning, shining up the floors; so it was jobs like that.
Speaker 1: Did you do it for the big grocery chains?
Speaker 2: Big grocery chains--
Speaker 1: What was that? Winn-Dixie (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)-Winn-Dixie, Piggly Wiggly, and stuff like that, you know; so they did everything they could--my parents did everything they could to make certain that there were enough monies in the house, and if that necessitated getting second jobs, odd jobs, and things like so they would become parts of crews and do office cleaning, cleaning floors and things like that, so I learned those types of things. So this was my--I think it was on my evening high school jobs where--I'm sure that was probably part of what that summer was before going because one way to get money for your own clothes and stuff like that was to have some type of job. So that was the night part; so I must have had something during the day and again it was either things like cutting lawns at a cemetery that black people couldn't be buried in, you know. That was wonderful; $1.10 per hour job, you know, working in Elmwood Cemetery (laughter). So--yeah, so other special summer type jobs were working for the county, the government, you know, for youth-sponsored activities, cutting the hedges along highways and freeways and things like that (laughter); it was the manual--menial type jobs like that. And then during my college years then you got the really, really good job where, since your dad has been working at the steel mill for like forever, and then your child is one of the college kids now, you can come work at Stockham Valve and Fittings. So I was on the assembly line for a while and then there was this one guy who used to be in charge of inventory. Poor man hadn't had a vacation in years, and then they realized like 'okay, we got this kid that goes to college and he's in science, he can probably, you know, add and subtract.' That's basically what inventory was; you also had to be able to look at the orders that were due for the upcoming weeks so you needed to be able to determine how many parts of what item needed to be made and what unit should make them and things like that. But--so he brought me in and in less than a week I'd say 'okay, this is addition and subtraction,' and finally he could go on vacation. And then so now I got this whole big office and I got all the books, I know where all of the parts are, I know everything that needs to be done to put a valve together and everything, and I know how many pieces we need. And the foremen would come in and they were used to like seeing this white guy say "Okay, here's your work list for the week," and then suddenly it was me and it was like a badge--a pride thing, you know, it was a phony pride. They come in "Oh, where is so-and-so?" "On vacation." And I'd say "What can I help you with?" "Nothing, just show me the books for, you know, whatever." Show it to him, look at it, can't determine what's going on; walks away then comes back very frustrated. What do I really need to do for next week? (Unclear), then I can just give him the stuff because what goes out has to be replaced and so basically again, it's just an inventory thing but the white foreman had problems with it because they saw it as having to take orders, you know (laughter) from a black person.
Story_ID: 25188
Speaker 1: Now when--I guess you graduated from high school in '67 [1967], right?
Speaker 2: In '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: 1967, so between, you know, the Civil Rights movement when it got cooked up when you were about 11 and 12 years old when it really got going--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, I guess there were signs in Birmingham [Alabama] writing white and black and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, colored (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Inaudible response).
Speaker 2: --that's the thing, yeah.
Speaker 1: So how far did things get by 1967? Were they--
Speaker 2: Well, it got to the point where you could--oh, who--during the time before all of the laws broke everything open, when George Wallace stood in the door of the University of Alabama (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--'64 [1964], yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah. And during the time when all public facilities had to be accessible to all of the people and we had public parks, and so I attribute the fact that I can't swim today to the fact that the one public park that had the swimming pool in--for my neighborhood, rather than allow all of the public swimming pools to be accessible to all of the people, the city and county--Jefferson County and Alabama where Birmingham is decided that their course of action is that 'we will close all of the county parks,' which meant that the swimming pools were closed. And so that's when, you know, swimming pool business went up big (laughter) because people wanted their own private pools and so they wouldn't have to swim with us. But it was at a time when, you know--as you get bigger then you become like 'I don't wanna be in the kiddie pool' (laughter). So right at the time when I had an interest in swimming, that was one of the things that happened. I can recall during the times of segregation and the signs of 'Colored' here and 'Colored' there is that we kinda like had a theater just for us, you know, like we could go there because the majority didn't go. But if we went--no, if we went to some of the other ones, one of the segregated ones, then you would always have to be up in the balcony and I'm kinda like thinking like 'why is this such a bad thing?' Because you're above everything; if you wanted to throw something down (laughter), that's what you did, or if you were bold enough, 'oops, I spilled my coke' (laughter), and stuff like that. So--but no, you're not gonna eat at the same counter with the people in the downtown businesses so you saw Birmingham inner city downtown just deteriorate because everything--everybody started running farther and farther into the suburbs.
Speaker 1: So you're saying instead of integrating when the ordinance was passed, they just didn't come back anymore.
Speaker 2: Didn't come back. Emm emm, no. Don't come back, yeah. They abandoned the city. But now, when I go back now, the things--we were saying like--we talked a little bit earlier about, "Oh, I heard it's so much nicer." And it is; but it's like most major cities where re-gentrification has taken place. You want a nice--you want to be in an area close to where you work, go downtown. You want a loft, a condo or apartment? Go downtown. So it's just like being here in Washington, D.C. and you see the U-Street Corridor; the complexion has changed. I look at the surrounding areas here of Howard University and the level of diversity, okay, has changed. I see joggers who don't look like me jogging through the campus; I see people walking dogs that don't look like me walking through the campus when once upon a time it was like I'm not--I don't have that kind of nerve (laughter), you know. All I'm saying is that things change, you know, so when they do change, you know, then prices for everything go up, go up, and so the people that once lived in those areas, which is to say the minority people, you sometimes worry about what's gonna happen to them and everything else. But--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that's pretty much where it was.
Speaker 1: So that's how things actually did change (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, in terms of change. And plus, the University of Alabama, Birmingham--in Birmingham, okay? UAB is what it's called. One of the best medical centers in the world or in this country; they began to expand and expand, so my old high school, Ullman High School, was caught up in this block long--blocks long expansion of UAB, so the only thing that's left as a reminder of my school is one building and that was named after one of the last principals there, or one of the more outstanding principals there; it's so-called Bell Building. But that's pretty much all that's left of my high school, so--but UAB is, like I said, it has a--it's--it is doing very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 25189
Speaker 1: Now let's get you to Wiley [College]. So Wiley is out in Marshall, Texas?
Speaker 2: Marshall, Texas; about two or three hours--let's see, Dallas [Texas] is to the west so east of Dallas, and about 45 minutes west of Shreveport; so in 45 minutes, you could get to Shreveport, Louisiana and so it's in East Texas and like I said, it's about another two hours or so to Dallas.
Speaker 1: How did you go?
Speaker 2: As I said before, I got there with the promise of a four-year scholarship.
Speaker 1: No, I mean how did you actually go?
Speaker 2: How did I actually go there?
Speaker 1: Did you go on a bus or a train, or a car or what?
Speaker 2: Oh, first trip? Bus. Yeah, we all--it was me--I mean because Wiley just seemed like they had lots of money (laughter), you know. And so I know at least--it must have been about a half dozen of us from my high school or some other high school in Birmingham [Alabama] that received offers to go to Wiley College. And for me and some of my closest friends, we all caught the bus from Birmingham to Marshall, Texas.
Speaker 1: How many hours there?
Speaker 2: It didn't matter (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--I'm thinking like it's got a over 12-hour ride.
Speaker 2: At least 12 hours, yeah, about like that. And--because the scariest part was going from Birmingham and then having to go through parts of Mississippi. We thought Birmingham--or we thought Alabama was scary, racist and you could get hurt by just being there (laughter). But now you go the Mississippi and their governor is Ross Burnett--Barnett (laughter); now that was a rough governor (laughter) so you're just a quiet as a church mouse as you rode through (laughter). At that time, you used to like 'please bus, do not break down here' (laughter). So--at any rate--so that's how it was and plus the first night into Marshall, Texas, it was pitch black; not a street light anywhere. No one--nothing was open or anything; we hadn't figured this thing out at all. We're hanging out with luggage trying to figure out where do we go? Where are the dorms"? Where's this, that and the other? So we end up at the gymnasium where the athletes are so we're out there banging on this hang-a-light gym. Truly, it's like a big hanger, and these guys let us in and we're telling them like we're freshmen and so that's how we spent our first night (laughter)
Speaker 1: In the gym?
Speaker 2: In the gym, you know. So it's basically almost like being on the basketball court, you know? Getting some sleep (laughter), and then the next day going and finding our dormitories and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25190
Speaker 1: Now who were some of the personalities that you remember from campus from Wiley College; students or faculty?
Speaker 2: Oh, as I said, there were a number of people that I knew from my high school like one of my best friends--a couple of my best friends. A guy by the name of Carl Rollins; he and I were in the projects together and in high school, so we knew each other back from high school and he was also inducted into the honor society along with me. Believe it or not, there was another guy by the name of Donald George, who is of no relationship to me at all, so he was one of the people; there was a Charles Kelly, there were these two other females from Birmingham [Alabama] there and one other--I think his last name was Henderson. So, as I said, there were about six or seven of us so we kinda like became what is known as the Birmingham Club; that's how they have you in the Year Book anyway. So we found out who everyone was and then--so Carl, Donald and I and, to a lesser extent, Charles Kelly, we all pretty much had the same academic agenda in terms of like following the science track, and so throughout our four years, we would pretty much see each other all the time in most of the same classes and things, so it was kinda good to have them around but the key thing for me was I was finally in an environment that had people other than people--in Birmingham other than people in the projects, and this is when I began to grow intellectually and this is when I realized that there was more to the world than what I found in the little world that I inhabited there; talking to people from Chicago [Illinois], people from Houston [Texas], people from Louisiana; learning that there are different ways to think about stuff. There are different points of view about everything; then you realize, at least I realized like 'boy you really need to travel.' I think travel is a, is a, is a great thing. And so that's, you know, that was the joy and the beauty of college to me. And then it was knowing that you had this level of independence; you could take some chances, you could take some risk whether they be good or bad. At least no one really knows you, no one is watching; you could--if--for no other better term, maybe you could reinvent yourself, you know. But then the classes--again, I'm still interested in school, still trying to do the best in class. And so this is a Methodist school, so you gotta take religion and philosophy and there was this woman--there was this teacher named Miss Jenkins; Miss Jenkins was the one that opened me up more than anybody else because, to learn about religion and philosophy, that was what took me away from the fire and brimstone that I was brought up with. She told me or led me to learn how to argue effectively, you know; in other words, it's--so that it became fun. Pro's and con's; deductive reasoning; and that was like--to me, that was the bomb, okay? (Laughter); it was like 'oh my goodness, this is it,' you know. And to hear, to me with her talking about religion and philosophy, this is the most angelic person I've ever seen in my life. How could this person ever do anything wrong? And she is bold enough to say "How do you know this God?" Okay? "How did this become part of the bible and this didn't?" You know. This woman is not gonna go to hell with--and I was like cool! So (laughter)--and then so again, like I said, it's enough of the school so you got the chapel there and you go to church and stuff, and then you start going to little parties, things that you didn't really do when you were in high school, and then you start seeing some of the--since it's a very small town, you see some of the people from church in an environment that you're not used to seeing them. So I can recall going to a party one night and then we're coming back-- again, now all of this is--this is pretty much as rural as you can get as well. So we're driving back through and we see this pickup truck in the middle of the highway and the light's on, you kinda see the door partially open and so we recognize this as being Deacon so-and-so's truck and we know the Deacon has had heart trouble and it's like "Oh, we gotta stop and we gotta help." And you can't get past the door because the smell of alcohol is emanating from the cab of the truck and then it's like okay, it finally hits you. You can't put your soul in the hands of a man (laughter) or a woman; it's like they're just like everybody else. So we help him up and blah, blah, blah, you know and everything like that but that freed me of the constraints I had put on myself because my firm belief, you know, based on the fire and brimstone teachings of a Baptist church. So you gotta be--you gotta think--if you're gonna save anybody, you have to save yourself, you know. Spiritually, this is on you, you know. So--and as long as you're willing to take the responsibility for it, you'll be okay.
Speaker 1: Now, as a biology major, had you heard the theory of evolution in high school?
Speaker 2: Naaaaa, not, not, not that I can recall. I mean it was like--yeah, you kinda know about it but you don't think that deeply about it. At the time, it's just a theory, okay. It hasn't been proven, it's okay; fine, move on.
Speaker 1: So that's how you saw a theory then as something that is just an idea that someone had?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it doesn't mean that it is something that has ample (laughter) evidence, although we can't exactly--the inference is, you know, is--like these court things, the preponderance of evidence (laughter), you know. I didn't have that type of thinking at the time. I mean truly, I mean I readily and easily admit that I have been, throughout my lifetime, very, very naive and limited in thinking. But this--these are the beginning steps that allowed me to be more open and be more analytical about things. This is where excitement for me about learning really, really opened up. This is--now I'm finally getting away from just going in and doing what the teacher tells you to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25191
Speaker 1: Now you said earlier that you--I'm sorry because I said you were a biology major but you weren't right, at that point?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You were a--what did you major in at Wiley [College]?
Speaker 2: Then, I did major in biology--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because again, the reason why is that--again, because of the Civil Rights movement and it affected me so much; I really wanted to be in political science; political activist; there was no such thing there, so as I said, my fallback was--because of the track that I ended up taking in high school, that was science, that was biology; that's what led me to it. I said I gotta do what I do best; the only thing I knew how to do after that was biology.
Speaker 1: Now the movie Great Debaters is about Wiley College (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: from Wiley College in the 1930's, I guess--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: '20's [1920's] or '30's [1930's], well '30 [1930] simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but in the movie, they depict James Farmer's father--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--His influence was still there when I was there.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--The fellow that wrote The Black Oklahomans (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can't recall (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--I can't think of--the one that Denzel [Washington] played--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --but--so this was kind of a political--you would think that Wiley would have some kind of political legacy to go along with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah but that--all of that--all of that was--all of that was hidden at Wiley. At the time I was there, the presidents were--the president was Thomas Cole. He and his sons they've been in the business of education and college and university presidents for years. Thomas Cole, Jr. I think took over after Thomas Cole, Sr. left, I know Thomas Cole, Jr. was Chancellor or something like that at Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta University at one time and so it was his family--it was a--it was a nice family atmosphere, it was very small. I think at the time I was there we never got above 700 total students if we even got that--got to be that big, or anything like that. It was a nice nurturing environment and hey--as I said, during that first year, I'm just learning that you can be something different; you can actually learn for learning's sake. You learn because you want to; things are different, they're exciting, you know. So you're responsible for trying to take care of yourself. But again, it was the gathering of different ideas from different people.
Story_ID: 25192
Speaker 1: Did you have a mentor in the Biology Department?
Speaker 2: I wish I could really recall his name. They used to also hire a lot of teachers from--I guess now they would be called adjunct professors. I remember my first biology teacher, he was this white guy but he was a good teacher, but he was a little (laughter)--when I look at him, I think about some things--some incidents (laughter). Oh, he was a funny man; I'll put it like that. He was pretty good, but a lot of--some of the white teachers that we had that came to Wiley [College] during those years were also trying to run away from the Vietnam War because even then it was still raging on so some people came to meet that commitment. I don't know if his last name was Thomas but I remember--it was, it was good, and in the end, I became--one of the things--I know I'm stuttering here, one of the things that happened about those four-year scholarships to Wiley was that they had misused, misinterpreted the rules on student aid that the federal government was dealing with. What happened was that Wiley College was given a part of money and then they were supposed to match it. Wiley gave out all of their money (laughter) as full rides without matching any of it (laughter), and so by the time we became sophomores, they were like 'y'all need to come here and we need to talk to you' (laughter) so that four-year scholarship became like 'okay, you can get a loan, it's a work study' (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you got two years, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I really got one year.
Speaker 1: --yeah, one year, okay, and then you had (unclear)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, one year, you know. So--you know, the biology was good, the chemistry was good, we had this German guy, I think his name was Weitzer, he used to teach our chemistry--general chemistry, organic chemistry and so forth, and things like that. They were--and then we had some guys that taught us the mathematics, the calculus and all those types of things, and it was a nice little apartment in what was a very new building at the time. Aaron Baker Hall was the new science building and things like that, so--and the thing about it was that there was a cohort of us who were in science, and the thing about that was that we enjoyed competing against each other. In other words, our thing was who was going to make a thousand on a test. Our little stupid thing was 'it's not just gonna make a hundred, you're gonna make a thousand.' Okay, who could get the best grade? And so the competition--and this was not just me and the Birmingham guys but it was kids from--guys from all over the country and we were that group, you know, so we formed our own little elite group of like we're the scientists amongst all the rest of the campus and so we just--we could only compete with each other and so that's what we did. And then so I think by the second year, one of our group members approached me and it's like, and he was like "And you think you're so smart." And it's like--again, still my attitude was like 'I'm just doing what the teacher tells me.' It's still there; and I never thought again that I was doing anything special. He got so upset with me, you know, and he said "I'm gonna beat you." But he couldn't; and I didn't realize that he was trying and competing so hard, you know. I just thought it was all a joke, you know, but he took it very seriously. I mean he's still today one of my best friends, but I can remember oh, he was so upset, you know, about that. But, even with the science and things, I got--part of my work study was to work as a teaching assistant in science so I worked several of those classes and seemed like every time you were gonna take a day off, who do you run into but the person you're supposed to be doing the stuff for? (Laughter); campus is only about like this big (demonstration) so it's bound to happen but you don't think about it.
Story_ID: 25193
Speaker 1: So during my third year, so rather than having to go back to Stockham Valves and Fitting, Mr. Edwards--Nehemiah Emmett--Nehemiah Emmett, he had come to Wiley College and he knew about our summer program at Atlanta University and you worked for eight to ten weeks, they would pay you x number of dollars. I'm saying "Are you kidding me? I can go learn something in science and be paid for it?" He said "Sure," so he wrote me a letter of recommendation so this is my first experience with Dr. Lafayette Frederick, Dr. Luther William, you know, and we worked that summer of our junior year, and we earned credit for two--for two sciences courses.
Speaker 2: Well tell us now--this is a good time to tell us about Dr. Lafayette Frederick.
Speaker 1: Oh, Dr. Frederick was--he was just the most enthusiastic and challenging person in science I had ever met up until that time. Dr. Luther Williams was the one I was most fascinated with during that summer because the field of molecular biology was peeking. In other words, we began to understand what DNA [deoxyribonucleic acid] was, what RNA [ribonucleic acid] was, how proteins are made and things like that; the things that you could read about but things that you really can't see. This is not under a microscope, this is not something you can dissect; this is something--a concept about how information flows into a cell and how it really works. At the time, it was as if this is as close to the workings of God as you're gonna get. Luther had it down cold.
Story_ID: 25194
Speaker 1: Dr. Luther Williams you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dr. Luther Williams; he was, he was, he was my hero there at the time. I was--most impressive for me was to learn the new molecular biology. Like I said, it was--to me, one of my silly goals of life as a scientist is that I'm going to learn the secret of life. I will prove--I'm gonna discover what the secret of life is. So my so-called ultimate (laughter) dream scientific thing. I'm gonna unlock the secret of life, you know. That was, that was my thing, and I thought I could do that through learning molecular biology. So by the time I--so we worked there and--the thing that I liked about Dr. Frederick and the rest of the faculty at that time was that they treated us like true adults, okay? So we ran through the program, we did the experiments, we went on field trips and we took exams and he said "It's one final exam that you guys are gonna have to do," and it was coming up the--say like the next day. But he said "Before the final exam, you gotta come to my house for a party." We all screamed and barreled out, it's like "We gotta finish studying for the exam." He said "If you don't know it by now, you're not gonna know it, and if you don't come, you're gonna fail anyway." So we realized like 'okay, we gotta go to a party' so we went to a party, we had a great time, and the next day we went and did the exam. But the point here is that they treat you almost as an equal; they want you to learn, they want you to challenge them, okay? But--so I'm saying like here's a whole 'nother level. So again, this is another one of those things that I put to fate (laughter). If Nehemiah Emmett hadn't come to Wiley College that year, I would have never known about something called graduate school because now I'm thinking that 'okay, I get a bachelor's degree; that should be enough; I should be able to get a good job.' I'm still on the naive side of things and it's like oh my goodness, what's going on? So little did I know during that summer, my wife--my future wife was a part of the program; she had come from Xavier University in Louisiana; she was a part of the summer program. During that summer, I had zero interest in her other than she was just a member of the cohort of people that we were dealing with. And so after our senior year, after we graduated, then we--oh, a number of us who were in that summer program ended up at Atlanta University and this is where Dr. Lafayette Frederick played the biggest role in our lives in terms of the fact that now it was time to get a master's degree in science, and he instilled in us a work habit and ethic and a curiosity that hey, it was like nothing else I had seen. Again, along with his faculty, and he and his wife Ann, they were interested not only in our academic abilities, but they also cared enough about us as people and individuals. And so they--Dr. Frederick had a National Science Foundation grant, NSF grant, that provided us with tuition; so for us it was like big money at the time. Your tuition was paid and you get $250.00 a month as a stipend. How much better could it be (laughter) in 1971, '72 [1972]? So I look around and there--as I said before, there were several of us who had come back from the summer program; so my wife Yolanda, Burley, and a couple of other people--Burley Tisdale and a couple of other people were also a part of it because we were that impressed, you know, with that summer experience and the new faculty members, so we kinda like hung out with each other.
Story_ID: 25195
Speaker 1: And over a little bit of time, Yolanda and I became a couple and everything like that, so--at the time, it was where, you know, if you really care about each other then you're gonna move in and you're gonna live together so you do that, and then if you do that, things can happen so stuff happened and so next thing you know, we're gonna be looking at--we're gonna be looking at a little baby soon, you know, and so now we're figuring out like well how are we gonna tell our parents? How are we gonna tell our parents this? And so--because Atlanta [Georgia] and Birmingham [Alabama] were like maybe at the time two to three hours away so we would just drive back and forth. And so "Yolanda, you go check out, find out for certain what's going on." So the stupid thing--again, this is where I say you learn that you're just like everybody else; you think 'well, what's, what's, what's happened? This is the day to find out are you pregnant or are you not pregnant or whatever.' So she goes to the doctor, comes back and like I'm pacing, looking for her all day long because she's working for one member of the biology faculty in one building and I'm working for another guy in a different building. So I see her and meet her and she says "Okay, the rabbit died." And then what do I say? What do you say to your quote unquote girlfriend? All I could say was "Congratulations;" (laughter). That's like 'okay, that's kind of great' (laughter). But at any rate, you know, we've been together like for 40 years now so it was--everything worked out right. But in terms of telling the parents, my mom said "Look, I had 11; I knew she was pregnant when she was here last week." We called her mom, her mom said like "Yeah, I was (unclear) from New Orleans" (laughter), so I'm like--again, this is destiny or Voodoo or whatever. You always have these things about New Orleans [Louisiana] and it's like "Yeah, I was about to call you because I had this dream that you"--this is Yolanda's mom--"that you were in Washington, DC and you had a big belly." I said "Woe, I give" (laughter). You know, so one of the best things that we had in 1972 was a son born on Christmas Eve, and that was also an hilarious event because during that weekend, it was a wild card weekend for the NFL and I was spending all my time that Saturday going to the bus station first to pick up my mom, then missed the games because I gotta go back and I gotta go pick up her mom, and I said "Okay, fine." Then Sunday comes around and then Yolanda and her mom they go to church and so I'm going back to the bus station to take my mom--this is the 24th now--take my mom to the bus station so she can go back to Birmingham. They come back from church so now I think I can sit down and watch the game, at least one game on the weekend. Then Yolanda is like "I think something is happening." "So talk to your mom." All through the whole thing is Rose--that's her mom--is like "I don't know, child" to every question Yolanda asks (laughter). How can you not know something about what's going on? Basically, Yolanda's water had broken and it was really time to take her to the doctor. So--at any rate, bottom line is I get Yolanda dressed because she doesn't want to move because something else might happen so she says "Something else might break" (laughter). And so I'm dropping Rose and Yolanda off at the hospital and Rose is there to get her checked in while I go park the car. I get back, the same scenario is going on; she can't tell the nurse anything. "What's her name?" "I don't know, child." "What's her address?" "I don't know, child;" (laughter). So this is just so funny to me, but it was--only because it was, you know, it's her mom. You should be able to say more than "I don't know, child." And then because Yolanda and I are biologists, we worked with a midwife all through this pregnancy and everything, so I'm supposed to be able to go see the birth of the child. 1972, this is still like not something you--this is not a normal thing. So now, in my mind, I don't know--this I the way I remember it is that now Yolanda's checked in, I have parked the car, I'm getting ready to go back to the maternity ward to see the birth of my child, and there is this lady--it's not just a lady, so I'm telling her who I am, what I want to do, and she just puts her hand on her hips and she says "It's not gonna happen." I said "What do you mean it's not gonna happen?" I said "We've already arranged this." And so it's like "Men are not allowed back here and you better shut up and go sit down." And so, of course, my memory is that this woman is at least 500 pounds, she spans at least two doors away (laughter) and everything, so I just meekly go. But as I go get ready to sit down, I see them wheeling Yolanda across the way and she's saying "Yay, we had a boy," you know, so it was the best Christmas ever (laughter), you know, best Christmas Eve ever. But that to me was one of the funniest things, so--but graduate school was--at the master's level was good. We had fun; my parents would take care of our son when we had to study too hard, I would take time off, we would either go to school every other day or, you know, to take care of him, and things like that so we could finish up. And it was one of the best things of our life. So we got married--I got married in Atlanta [Georgia], had the child in Atlanta, learned how to grow up even more, so that's why Atlanta is one of my favorite cities today, so--and the Atlanta Falcons is my favorite team--football team anyway. So that's the attachment I had with that; but Big Fred was good and Big Fred and the rest of the faculty, they all got together and had this huge baby shower for us and so like he was the department baby (laughter) and everything like that, you know, so--
Story_ID: 25196
Speaker 1: You were saying though--earlier too, that Dr. Frederick really gave you good advice in terms of how to go get your PhD, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. Well, Dr. Frederick didn't want us to get the advance degree from the same institution. He felt like we would be much more valued if we could show a variety in our skills; let other people see our--what we could do. So that's why you could only--you had to do the degrees in steps. Get the master's first and then if you wanted to do the PhD, get it, then move on to that. Dr. Frederick was also an evil genius, which is a compliment because we had to also defend our Thesis, alright? So my Thesis was on something involving molecular biology in bacteria. Dr. Frederick is basically in plants and fungi and things like that, but he's pretty much like on everybody's Thesis committee so he has to be there. So while you're having your examination, so you give your little abstract first, or you give the presentation of your work; then you wait, and you're waiting on people to ask you questions about what it is that you've done. So Dr. Frederick's first question to me on something that has absolutely no connection at all to what I was doing was "Alright, what's been going on in science today is a question of where did we come from? How did we end up here on earth?" Leading Nobel Prize winner, I think it was either Watson or Crick--I think it was Watson--said that it's quite possible that we were left here on this earth or seeded on earth by aliens. This was actually published in Science on Nature, okay? And so that was his question and so--"So what do you think? Were we left here as seeds by aliens?" I'm thinking 'what does this have to do with anything that I just told you?' Well what it was for Dr. Frederick, was that 'are you keeping up with the literature? And based on the science that you know, how would you respond to that?' I basically had no real answer at all. So I did the next best thing, at least in my mind. We'll go to the Bible (laughter). Yeah, so that's what I did. I just came up with some story, you know, I--well, according to the Bible and Adam and Eve and blah, blah, blah because I don't think I had really read the article (laughter). At any rate--so he just looked at me kind of strange and it's like okay, he knew he was just throwing me a curb anyway. Yolanda went through her Thesis defense and she came out with a whole different story; she was just like--I was home with the baby and she came down the street and she just was shaking her head. "That's it; I'm done. I'm not going any further with this science thing, I'm through. They just gave me this degree." Her Thesis defense must have been so rough on her, it was very discouraging to her to think about having to do that again.
Story_ID: 25197
Speaker 1: We had been visited by a recruiter from the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, okay, that had a biomedical section to it. A guy by the name of Thomas Smith; he went on actually to become the Chair of the Biochemistry Department here at Howard University, okay? He preceded me. So he was recruiting minorities to come out and work in the Biomedical Science Unit at Lawrence Livermore National Government Laboratory where weapons is one of the major things that they do out there (laughter), but they did have a biomedical section, and so it was supposed to be maybe a six-month program or maybe a three-month program, and so he found out about Yolanda and I, and he was impressed that we were good scientists and he wanted us to participate in the program, and he invited us out and I said--I'm thinking that I'm gonna continue on with my PhD at Atlanta [University] and I said it doesn't make sense to go all the way to California, you know, for like six months; it's gonna take me two or three months to figure out what you're doing, how to do it and everything like that, then I have to turn around, you know, come back and do that. But another major driving reason was that suddenly my $250.00 a month for a stipend, and Yolanda's $250.00 a month for stipend, didn't seem to work now for three people (laughter) so we kind of like needed to make more money, and that also made it exciting. Other stories that go with the birth of our child and Yolanda is in there somewhere because I'm jumping around a little bit, but let's just simply say that maternal instinct for Yolanda was a little lacking and since I was the oldest of 11 and had been taking care of children for a long time--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I took over a lot of that--lot of those duties. Like I said, I'm jumping around a little bit, but the funny story quickly is that it took me two hours to try and convince the people at Grady Memorial Hospital to let me take my son home because after he was born, he didn't eat, so he had to stay in the hospital for an additional week. And so when it was time for us to bring him home, so I'm talking to the financial people saying "I will give you $10.00 a month for life if necessary if you let me bring the kid home." Yolanda's upstairs in the nursery trying to get him dressed, you know, so we can bring him home. So they finally realize that I have no more money, I cannot have an outside job, and so I go upstairs two hours later, the kid is still naked as he came into the world. "Yolanda, why isn't he dressed?" She looks at me and says "He might break;" (laughter). So I quickly dress him and bring him home so that's kinda like how it--until he got to be a real size, she couldn't, you know, do that much with him. She's still a good mom and stuff (laughter). So we end up in California but--Yolanda and I end up in California with one box, that's pretty much all we have because we get a--they get us a flight out; we don't own anything, we don't have anything. And so my parents are keeping our son because we don't have a car in California, we don't know day care, we really don't know--we hope we have the apartment that we put money down on, so we start off by walking about at least a mile and a-half to work every day, we began to draw paychecks. Well, the thing about the job in Livermore is that we are now gonna make $10,000 a year a piece--
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: --yeah, you know so we could save some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--That was good money (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--that was good money, yeah--
Speaker 2: --1973 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--'73 [1973], '73 [1973]. And so we learned the neighborhood and, as I said before, we're walking back and forth to work every day because we don't have a car, and so we're learning where everything is and then one day I get this phone call from someone I hadn't heard from since high school, since like 1967; now it's 1974 and it's like--it turns out it's the Valedictorian of my high school class (laughter). She and her husband are at Livermore working (laughter) (unclear), and the way Bernadette found out who it was--because she called the personnel office and said like "Every day, every morning, I see these two black people walking to work." This shows you how rare (laughter) it is, and so she gets them to say--tell them who--tell them our name, and she said like "I used to know a Matthew George" and so, I said "Bernadette, what are you doing out here?" And it turns out that her husband Fred was a mathematician and so that's how he ended up out there as well so--and they were living in Freeport. So actually, after all those years, I met my--the Valedictorian of my class, you know, so--
Story_ID: 25198
Speaker 1: Who was your PhD advisor at UC [University of California] Berkeley?
Speaker 2: Allan Wilson. He was the Evolutionary Biochemist. Allan Wilson; a most brilliant, brilliant, brilliant man (laughter). This man was so smart that his ideas are still coming to fruition even today, the things that he had thought about back during the time I was in school. Now Allan wasn't my first choice for dissertation mentor; the first guy I was working with was named Greg Milman, but he did not get tenure so this is things that led to an extension of my time as a PhD student. So once in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--You started with Milman but you had to switch to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--yeah, once he didn't get tenure, then he moved on to Johns Hopkins [University] and--it's like Yolanda was still working at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory at the time because once I made a decision to go on to get a PhD, I started by calling--well, Lawrence Livermore Lab was managed by UC Berkeley, okay? So they had the contract for managing Lawrence Livermore Lab, so I just picked up the phone and called UC [University of California] Berkeley and apparently, my accent and manner of speaking was such that as soon as the secretary realized that it was quite possible that she was talking to a minority--because she did ask the question, and basically, it was two things I was interested in, biochemistry and microbiology; those were the sciences I was in but because biochemistry was listed up first alphabetically, I called the biochem office and the secretary said "May I ask, are you a minority?" I said "Yes," and so she said "Okay, don't worry, you're application will be there tomorrow." So I said "Oh, okay." So I was interested so I never called microbiology and so sure enough, the next day I got the application from Berkeley and I applied. There are some other things I learned later on about how I really gained entry into the school, but it was also during the time affirmative action slash tokenism and things like that. You got lots of federal dollars and federal grants then you need to increase your pool of minorities. So that's why she was so interested in making certain that a minority was on the phone and he had a good one. I later talked to Dr. Smith and found out that he had written a letter of recommendation basically telling them that they would be fools if they did not admit me into their program (laughter) and that was years later, so--at any rate, I just felt like it was a win-win situation for both of us. Okay, you wanna play the minority game? Okay, I'll play that with you because you can use me, you can get a number and I can get a degree (laughter). That was my, that was my thinking and so I went through the dance with the people at Berkeley and I later learned during that first year that they only admitted students that they could support. But because I was their minority student out of a class of 21, only one student did not get financial aid, okay? So not quite ready to give me financial aid so--because they thought they could play the game too is that well there are financial foundations that are trying to make certain that minorities are paid to go to school. And so--but because I had made $10,000 the year before, I didn't qualify, but that's still not Berkeley's policy. In other words, don't admit a student unless the training grant can support them, which they had from the federal government. They were trying to say their training grant monies versus--means get--doing something. But I followed the rules; I applied for every minority grant there was, knowing that I had already over-stepped the limit. So I had to fight with them about that and in the end, once they came to realize that all I wanted was a PhD degree and I didn't care where I got it from--at least some people understood what that meant. Because I was at a point where, you know, everybody would know about this incident (laughter). Some people understood the implied threat and it worked out fine, but Berkeley was also not the little free hippy place that you always see depicted on television and in movies and things like that.
Speaker 1: This is 1974--
Speaker 2: '74 [1974] to '80 [1980], '82 [1982], yeah. So these are those years.
Story_ID: 25199
Speaker 1: What I found for a black person coming from the south is that the--I hate to use the term but I'm gonna do it anyway--the racism is displayed in different ways. Some of it is overt, some of it is covert, some of it is subtle. California, to me, as a whole during those times, I think they were very subtle in their way of dealing with racism, or recognizing it, okay? And so--because most of the black people I saw and talked to, they thought it was the greatest place ever, and I could see certain things happening and they just thought they were normal. It was just the sneakiest, subtlest things happen to--that's why being in the south you knew straight up, overt; we don't like you, stay over there, don't come over here, okay so--fine. So I had to learn how to work with that. So basically, I knew coming in that I was being stereotyped, had already been stereotyped. One, he just said like "Oh, you're a minority? Yeah, we want you to come on in, but we don't really want you, but it's okay." So the chairman at the time said "Oh, you're from Georgia?" I said "Yes, I'm from Georgia." "Oh, Jimmy Carter, yeah." I didn't even know Jimmy Carter that well, and plus he was a southerner that I didn't trust, I didn't like his mannerism, I didn't even like his voice or whatever. But point is is that I'm gonna be your friend because I'm gonna let you know that my son or whatever is working for Jimmy and I'm supposed--okay, fine. Can I get a scholarship with that? (Laughter); but the whole is that it was just a different game being played and there were other incidents that also told me that their commitment was a little bit half-hearted as well because when they did offer a fellowship or partial scholarship to me--that's the other way to do it is like if you can't get a whole pie, we'll just give you a piece of the pie and maybe you'll shut up and leave us alone. So I'm at a point in my life where I can recognize these things. Just give them a little slice, a little taste, and they should back off, right? So they first, you know tell me about this award in the name of a Jewish person that of course, like me, grew up barefoot in Germany and he fled the Nazis and got away from the level of oppression just like I had run away from the south barefoot and guess what? He made his way into Berkeley and even became a professor here, and because you guys have lived a life just alike, we want to offer you this little scholarship in his name. And (laughter), as the department chair said--he brings in another faculty member and this other faculty member is like--I can see on his face it's like 'What the hell is going on?' But I'm like 'it's money, don't worry about it; take it, you know, and so that's what I did, you know. Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah. (Laughter).
Story_ID: 25200
Speaker 1: Tell us about Dr. Allan C. Wilson and the Mitochondrial Eve.
Speaker 2: In order to get to Allan, I have to tell you again that the way the rotations work at Berkeley [University of California] is that you come in as a first year student, you go through some laboratory rotations, you get to interview different faculty members and it's a pick-and-choose match between the student and your potential mentor. I did not match with Allan on my first interview system, but I didn't even approach him at that time. I think I told you Greg Milman was the one; he did not get tenure; and I had to go through qualifying exams, okay? In other words, I was at a point where I had to prove to the department that I had what it takes to get the PhD degree, which is to say you have to write an original--two original proposals, and you have to defend them before a committee of five, in which there are members who are experts in the proposals area. So I went through all of that and it turns out that when I went in--because Allan Wilson had been a part of the Graduate Studies Committee during my early time they knew me, he said "Well, when you get through with this, we're gonna have a party for you in my lab." And so that led me to believe that of all of the people on the faculty in biochem, he would be one that would be willing to allow me to work with him, but he told me that; he said "But you have to pass this curriculum--this comprehensive exam or qualifying exams that we call--because pretty much, once you do that, and then you go on and do a dissertation, you don't even have to defend it because once you do your qualifying exam, it's okay; you're qualified to do it, let's get this person to the bench. So, at any rate, I passed and I ended up working with Allan.
Story_ID: 25201
Speaker 1: Allan had always been interested in evolution, that's one of the things. So within the Department of Biochemistry, most of the faculty members thought that his laboratory was a little bit strange because we were studying evolution. They didn't see the full relationship that evolution in typical biochemistry had, so not only was Allan a little strange to the faculty members, but that meant all of his people were. So Allan was--major interest at the time I was coming in. First of all, Allan got a little bit caught up in trying to deal with a minority--true minority--in his lab as well because he thought that I would want to work on sickle cell anemia. I want to work on whatever it takes to get me out of school, okay? (Laughter); and so after wasting about a year on trying to figure out 'well, what could we do?' Particularly when it's something that you know your professor is not interested in, okay? That was not what any of his grants said he was gonna do so that's where I'm taking this from. At any rate, so he was interested in trying to figure out how were humans, chimpanzees and gorillas related to each other. He had worked out a method that allowed him to say humans, chimpanzees and gorillas only separated from each other about five, no more than eight million years ago, which is complete heresy to the world of anthropology and paleontology. Fossil records tended to indicate completely otherwise how the fossils were missing. He did it using what are called molecular tools; he used proteins and antibodies and complement to say "This is what it is; these are the numbers." He didn't figure out a way to figure out a rate of change that could also determine time of divergence from a common ancestor using protein. But using that approach did not work on him being able to say human chimps and gorillas--in other words, if you had a tree, they would be on the same branch, there would be nothing to show divergence; nothing. So we began to become interested in the work of Wesley Brown who was a post-doctorate at the UC [University of California] San Francisco; he had been looking at this molecule called mitochondrial DNA. Now mitochondrial DNA is a DNA that is found in the mitochondria, which is the powerhouse of the cell. Other thing about mitochondria is that it is maternally inherited; in other words, only this DNA can be passed along by the mother. Now when you look at proteins, as Allan had been doing, you're looking at contributions that come from not only a mother, but also a father. So when you do your analysis, you gotta worry about a mother and a father, a grandmother a grandfather on one side, grandmother grandfather on (unclear) side. But with mitochondrial DNA, single line of lineage that one has to follow. What we finally figured out, and this was part of my project, was to see if I could duplicate the relationships that are found among the different species of old world monkeys; that's like macaques, baboons, and etc., okay? That's the old world monkey family. So there was good fossil evidence that showed when these different species had separated from each other. So if--the thought was that if I could use mitochondrial DNA analysis to see if I could re-duplicate what we call a tree--follow genetic tree, a relatedness, then this molecule is gonna be good.
Story_ID: 25202
Speaker 1: So the first thing we needed to do was try and figure out well how fast--or what is the mutation rate for the mitochondrial? No one had ever--mitochondrial DNA--no one had ever figured that out before so I had used mitochondrial DNA comparisons to look at these different old world monkey species. From that, I was able to calculate, based on the times of divergence, exactly how fast the mitochondrial DNA was changing or evolving and what we found was that it was changing ten times faster than what you would get just by doing protein comparisons. So let's imagine that--and to show you how--in the simplest way to show you what this means is that you use what is called the molecular clock hypothesis, okay? In other words, let's imagine that change in the form of what we call a mutation occurs in a steady manner, like a clock, over time; in other words, the older something is, guess what would happen? The more mutations should accumulate, right? Okay? So just imagine again like first the baby is born; what, it's just a little infant, right? As time continues, we just see him growing up from a child to a toddler to a teenager to an adult then finally to an old man; so you can see over time, looking at it that way. But over time, mitochondrial DNA changes way faster than what we would call single copy nuclear DNA which is the material that makes the proteins. So now we got something that is very fast. Let's apply this back to that human chimpanzee--human chimpanzee and gorilla; when you do the mitochondrial DNA data, it falls out. Humans are different than chimps and gorillas; morphologically, we can easily see that, but what you now learn is that the chimpanzee is much closely related to the human than it is to the gorilla, so our closest animal species is a chimpanzee. But the Mitochondrial Eve is the most interesting, okay. This is what started; this is how you get to Mitochondrial Eve. Again, remember mitochondrial is only from what? Females, right? So when you look at the different ethnic groups of the world and you do a mitochondrial DNA comparison whether it be DNA sequence in our back--during the time when we did it, there are these molecular scissors that we call restriction enzymes, you do a comparison to see how you get different DNA pieces from the mitochondrial. What you find is that the ethnic group of Africans has the greatest, largest number of mitochondrial DNA changes than any other ethnic group; greater than the Europeans, greater than Australians, greater than the Asians. How can that be? So what does that really tell you? In order for a large amount of change to have occurred means that that group had to have been around longer than any other group; therefore, it is the founding group. Everything else is derived from those ethnic groups that are found in Africa; that means that they were there to give rise to the Asians, to the Europeans, and etc. So that's where you get your Mitochondrial Eve, that's where it is, not a fossil data on humans; everything is coming out of Africa; East Africa, South Africa, everything. So for modern humans, when we look at the skeletal remains and everything, (unclear) is all coming out of Africa. But this was done not using a single bone, just straight up using mitochondrial DNA, all based on the fact a little simple hypothesis that says the more time it takes--the more mutations you get, that means the older a species is. You just do that same comparison on the different groups and that's how we came up with it.
Speaker 2: So you came up with proof of something that is said a lot but I think it's often misinterpreted, but that the human species originates in Africa (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --basically. (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--And then because it's maternally inherited, it had to be a small group of women (laughter), so they're the mother of us all. So that's the way you even get the Eve part.
Story_ID: 25203
Speaker 1: Now the person in Allan's lab that did the majority of this work, she is a professor at the University of Hawaii; she's one of my best friends.
Speaker 2: What is her name?
Speaker 1: Her name is Rebecca Cann, C-A-N-N. Now Rebecca, she worked more closely with Wes Brown who brought the mitochondrial DNA project to the lab but since I was the first one to work with the mitochondrial DNA in the lab, I had to teach her how to isolate mitochondrial DNA from different ethnic groups (laughter) so since we were also--this was at a time before we could actually easily and quickly amplify any type of DNA at all so we had to use tissues. So in order--since we were working with humans, one way for us to get lots of mitochondrial DNA was to get placenta from women--from pregnant women because they--of course they wanted to keep the baby, throw the placenta away in most cases, right?
Speaker 2: So in hospitals like save it or something?
Speaker 1: Well, you write up a request for getting the tissue or you go meet the women themselves, and you ask them can--will they share their placenta with you. And so--because I'm the only black per--not just because I'm the only person--black person in the laboratory, I used to, you know, go out and have fun, party and whatever, so occasionally I would run across pregnant black women and I would ask them (laughter) for their placenta. And so the first woman I met who was pregnant, she was a scientist so she understood easily. She said "Sure, you can have the placenta" so I had to get the consent, you know, from her that 'okay, I'll keep the baby and they can have the placenta.' So Becky is working on as many different ethnic groups as she can and whatever situation I'm in, I'm trying to ask these women so if I'm around black people, I can ask the black people for placenta. So she said "Fine." Then I ran into a second woman and she looked at me and she thought I was a little bit crazy. And I said "Please consider it." So I was telling her how, as scientist, you can sometimes pay to have samples sent to you and I gave her my phone number and she called me up then she wanted to know "Well how much are you willing to pay for this placenta?" I said "I don't know, I don't think I need to pay." I said "We're in Berkeley, you're in San Francisco; can just drive across the bridge and get it." She said "No, no, no, you said you'd pay." I said "Well what is it? I mean what do we consider it to be? Do we price it like hamburger? Do we price it like steak, what?" And so we go round and around about a price for this placenta, then she--suddenly she says "Look, I'll tell you what; I already got one at home in the refrigerator--in the freezer." I said "Okay." "And I'm tired of carrying this placenta around. You can have that one too; you can have it for free." I said "Okay" (laughter), so I go and I told Becky and so Becky and I we get the Degree of Consent form and so we told her we'd meet--come over to her house and pick up this placenta. So Becky and I drive over and we find her house and so she signs the consent form and she promises to give us the placenta from the baby she's currently carrying, and so we're presented with the first placenta and it's this--the first placenta was in a red and white stripe box. Characteristic box of KFC [Kentucky Fried Chicken] (laughter) because she's been carrying around in her freezer and we're like, we had to ask "Why are you doing this?" Because--she said she had been told custom that to ensure future fertility, it might be wise for her to cook the placenta and eat it with her husband or it might be wise for her to plant it in her yard.
Speaker 2: And I've read such things as health books and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Yes, well this was a--this was a true believer who had gotten tired of it because her freezer had broken down several times but I can tell you right now that I'm very suspicious of the red and white stripe boxes (laughter). I just thought that was one of the more humorous things that we had done and so Becky and I, sometimes when we get together, we sit back and laugh about what it took for us at that time to get the starting materials for us to do this Mitochondrial Eve. So part of what I do is in my overall set of studies when I give talks, I--before I get to the Mitochondrial Eve, I set it up with some other studies that I've done using mitochondrial DNA, I tell them the story about how I worked with members of the horse family to figure out their phylogeny; that's the Equus family; zebras and things like that, so it makes for good stories. As a matter of fact, I was somewhat surprised to find that--last spring we were searching for a new provost for the University and one of the candidates had once worked at Hampton University. I didn't recall her at all; she came and sat down and she said like "Hello so-and-so." She was greeting all of us and then she said "And I think I remember this one young--I think I can remember you because I can recall someone coming in telling us this story about going to parties to pick up women to get their placenta" (laughter); so it was kind of funny that way. So it makes for a cute story and you could bring come humor into it and I think people like knowing what the mitochondrial Eve story is about.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 25204
Speaker 1: Now you and Dr. [Allan] Wilson published the research findings in a paper called "Rapid Evolution of Animal mitochondrial DNA," right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that is the seminal paper that got the whole field of molecular evolution started. That's the paper that established the rate of change of mitochondrial which can be used, as I said, for looking at very closely related species and allowing one to discriminate between those. And it was so funny, I have no idea why one of my colleagues was doing this but before you guys came today, he said "I did a Google scholar search on you today and I found that your paper with Allan on the Rapid Evolution of Mitochondrial DNA has more than 2,000 citations (laughter). I said "Why were you doing that?" But the whole point is that no, that was--this paper provided--they're going to show that mitochondrial DNA could be used as an evolutionary tool and the fact that we said that mitochondrial DNA changes at a rate of about two percent per million years allowed us to make a lot of assumptions, and they've actually come out really well over the years so that was--I think that was some of my best work and most successful work with Allan. So it was a part of my dissertation and it served as the basis for the overall set of findings that I had with the old world monkeys. They are not, as we say, as sexy as--because once we got that rate, then the other people that came in--the post-docs that came, they could finally do the humans, the chimps and the gorillas and things like that, so that's what everybody focused on and then Mitochondrial Eve made it even better because humans like talking about themselves more than any other thing, so it was good, it was good. But I feel good in terms of that I feel that I made a significant contribution to the field of molecular evolution using this particular molecule. Allan also had me send out the protocol for how to even isolate to everybody. I said "Allan, I'm just a student; I'm trying to graduate." "No, you gotta let them know how to do it" because Allan's philosophy also was that information is to be shared. He was not afraid of sharing whatever information and data he had. He said "It does no good to sit and hold it."
Speaker 1: Okay, so you achieved your PhD in 1980?
Speaker 2: Yes, I left to go do my post-doc in 1981 because one of the things that we had fought with Allan about is procrastination. During the whole year of 1980, I'm thinking that he's reading my dissertation and correcting it and I'm meeting with him every week. I already got my guy up for a post-doc and then one day in 1981, the post-doc guy says "All he did was send me a Want Ad section showing where rentals were." I said "Allan, I have to go." So basically, although everything was done, my dissertation was not completely done because--Allan led me to believe that he was reading it and correcting it and proofing it and everything like that, but he hadn't. But in the spring of '81 [1981], I said 'I gotta go start this post-doc' so officially my PhD was not granted until 1982--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so that was one of the most frustrating things I ever had because you make phone calls and set up meeting dates and times to say "okay, we'll talk" and I haven't done it yet. But eventually, while working in my post-doc at the San Diego Zoo in '81 [1981], '82 [1982], and a little part of '83 [1983], I actually lived at the zoo in the Research Department.
Speaker 1: So did your family--whole family live there?
Speaker 2: No, Yolanda and my son stayed in Oakland [California] because my son was still in school. She had a job at UC [University of California] Berkeley at the time and, because of the fact that I had a one bedroom apartment in the Research Building, that meant that I could work anytime I wanted, and I actually did. I could--everybody would come to work at a certain time of the day, they'd be gone, if I wanted to get up and go do experiments at 11, 10, 1:00 in the morning, I could do that (laughter). So I'm working--so how it worked out with my post-doc advisor, Oliver Ryder, a deal such that I work three weeks there, and I could take one week home in Oakland, and during that week I would go talk to Allan in terms of trying to get this dissertation done, and so that worked out for a whole year, messing with Allan again. Still, even with him knowing I'm coming, he still wouldn't have read stuff or corrected stuff (laughter), and so even in May of '82 [1982] when graduation was coming again, I had already just left Allan and gone back to San Diego when the phone call came, said "Allan said the dissertation is done and graduation is next week. You gotta file by next week." I had to get back on the plane immediately and go back just so I could turn in my dissertation but that was the way it was, you know, yeah.
Story_ID: 25205
Speaker 1: You worked with Oliver Ryder at the San Diego Zoo [California]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What were you doing there?
Speaker 2: I was doing the work on conservation in trying to figure out the relationships of horses, zebras, asses, and also worked with rhinoceroses and things like that, yeah. So working with him was again, a further study of mitochondrial DNA. One of the things--we did--we started the study on the horse family mainly because someone had written a paper saying "The Stripes Do Not A Zebra Make." They were trying to say the bones of one extinct zebra were so outside the rest of the members of the zebra family that it should be considered to be a different species. Not only were we able to show that this was not a different species, but it was a variant of a current living zebra species, this zebra called a Quagga. It's been extinct for a little bit more than 100 years; it has stripes on the face and neck. But by using DNA that was found in museum samples and getting the skin from the stuffed animal and now the techniques have changed such that you can amplify the DNA using a machine. We got another DNA to check the mitochondrial DNA again and it was almost identical to one of the living species of the zebra family, so we got the Quagga, something that's completely no longer there. So we've began to work in the field of what is now called ancient DNA. So that was pretty good, so Russell Higuchi worked on that aspect of it as well so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25206
Speaker 1: So, while working for Steve O'Brien [at the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Maryland], again, he wanted to learn how to use mitochondrial DNA but he was interested in leukemia in cats, and so he wanted to look at not only the domestic cats, but all members of the cat family; cheetahs, lions, etc. and--as well as the endangered panda species that are found in Florida. So I used mitochondrial DNA to look at those relationships and this is where I began to actually clone the mitochondrial DNA because techniques were changing, so I have been able to clone the mitochondrial DNA of the domestic cat so we can use it as a pro to look at mitochondrial DNA content without having to go through all of those different purifications steps that we did in the earlier days. I worked with Steve as a post-doctoral fellow for about a year, and then I was offered a job here at Howard University and during that first couple of years or so at Howard, I would still commute back and forth to work in a collaborative way with Steve.
Speaker 2: Okay, this was in 1984 when you come to Howard (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, in 1984 I came to Howard.
Speaker 2: Now, who invited you to Howard? How did that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Again, we can go full circle on this--and this is somewhat--this is what I teasingly said to Dr. Thomas Smith. Remember I told you how we ended up at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory? He eventually ended up as chairperson here in the Biochemistry Department at Howard, okay? So he had been following my career throughout the time I went to Berkeley [University of California] as a graduate student, he followed me through my post-doctoral years, and how in the world the man knew I was actually coming to work at the National Cancer Institute [NCI], I'll never know because during my introductory seminar to the O'Brien Lab, he was in the audience, okay? And because of the fact that I'm giving them the story about the zebras, the donkeys, and the horses and members of the horse family, so it's a way you can make nice statements after you use the Latin name, say E-Zebra or hemionus or E-hemionus or Equus-hemionus; that means--hemionus is half-ass so (laughter) during my talk, I always try and put something that may be a little humorous, and to hear someone sit up and say "This is the full ass over here, and you show the picture of the animal, and then here's the half-ass over here." And so Thomas heard me and he got up and said like "Wow, this is the best half-ass talk I ever heard in my life" (laughter), so that's one of the jokes he always tells about our meeting. So Tom knew I was going to be at NCI and he was willing to wait for another year for a position to open up here at Howard, and so after that first year--plus Steve O'Brien and I were kinda like--it wasn't really working out the way I wanted with O'Brien and so I was ready for the next step which is to say I felt it was now my time to give back to the minority community because I had gone to minority schools at Wiley [College] and at Atlanta University, and I had seen a whole big difference in the way teaching and learning occurs at the University of California-Berkeley. It was not just about memorization; it was an application of the information you got; that's a whole different thing, and that was what I got out of Berkeley. So at any rate, got here and Thomas made the best offer he could for me; it wasn't the biggest or the best, but I was in a place that what I'm beginning to learn I have learned a long time ago about different ethnic groups is, to me--I'll just make it simple, something is--something about it is like birds of a feather tend to flock together, okay? So why are we fussing about all these things? But no, we need to increase diversity and/or increase participation, but there's something about it but I wanted to be able to come to a place like Howard and challenge our students, you know, to the types of teaching and analysis that I had received at Berkeley, I really did--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and I think I've done that over the years if you were to talk to some of the medical students. Oh, we had this wonderful love-hate relationship. "Dr. George, you okay? You good?" But those questions, where do they come from? (Laughter); you know, so--
Story_ID: 25207
Speaker 1: Now tell me about the--in 1990, I think you instituted something called the PhD Dissertation of the Year Award?
Speaker 2: I didn't invent that. I did not invent that--
Speaker 1: You didn't? Okay.
Speaker 2: --no, the graduate school, in an effort to show its appreciation for the graduate students, they decided that they would take a look at the dissertations that were submitted by the graduating students. Turns out that the first one that they ever presented went to the student that I had trained, Dr. Daryl Basham; he got the first Dissertation of the Year Award sponsored by the Howard University Graduate School. He had done some outstanding work on control or transcription in this bacteria virus that we call SP6, and it was just a lot of grinding out work, but he was very inventive. Daryl is one of the more impressive students I have ever had; he went on to do a post-doc at NYU [New York University], worked at the patent office, became a patent officer, went to school at, I believe, George Washington [University], so then he went on to become a biotech patent lawyer for several law firms; I think he is now serving in that capacity even on his own. But this guy was extremely talented.
Speaker 1: Okay. I think in the early '90's [1990's] is when DNA became very--became a useful team in legal cases--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --proving the guilt or innocence of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --people based on the DNA--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and they say the DNA doesn't lie.
Speaker 2: As far as I know, depending on which--on what you're using, okay? And knowing what's behind the techniques, knowing the things that make us unique, okay? And if you use those as a pro--
Speaker 1: Individually unique?
Speaker 2: --yeah, each individual; there is a set of what we call repeated DNA sequences that is different in every individual. And there's a guy by the name of [Alec] Jeffreys that called--it's called DNA fingerprinting, and he first proposed this and so these are like part of what we call the gold standard for looking at different individuals, and so the probability of anybody else having that same pattern is so miniscule that it's pretty much, as they say, you know, like a fingerprint. They could also use mitochondrial DNA again, as a tool for identification, but that would only show that your mitochondrial DNA and you as a man came from your mother, so in terms of familial patterns, it's not as useful, but at least in some cases--because when I think back to the OJ Simpson trial, they did have mitochondrial DNA from--they had mitochondrial DNA from him but they didn't compare his DNA with his mother's DNA--with OJ's mom. I think that would have shown that this DNA is identical and that would have been more but you know how that case turned out, in addition to the--what we would call the nuclear--the chromosomal DNA data.
Speaker 1: So do you think the reason why they didn't make the comparison was because the prosecutors really didn't understand then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I think that's part of it, and plus I think they--by the time they looked at the jury after the first expert got up there and did not make the comparison analysis simple enough for the jury to understand it, they said like "We better cut our losses here." But I think a story could have been told in such a way that anyone should have been able to understand it because when you think about it, at this point in time, the story of DNA and RNA and protein, that's in high school text--science text books. So there's no reason for us not to know at least the bare bone basics of what DNA is and what it can possibly do. We all tend to think that we do because every time we see a trial, they say "Well, there's no DNA evidence." Well that's because you've seen so much CSI and everything like that. "If it's no DNA, then it can't be right," you know. But for the most part--as a matter of fact, just the other day, there was another technique involved in DNA that was being brought up; I can't recall what it is right now, but I've also worked with the Department of Justice as a quote unquote consultant. When you have grants--people submit grants to show whether or not they can be used in a forensic manner, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think--wasn't it the Northwestern Law School that first kind of pioneered the use of DNA in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh yeah, emm hmm; yeah--
Speaker 1: --criminal cases?
Speaker 2: --yeah, and it's--as a matter of fact, I think I saw something the other day that was like one of the new HBCU schools that was--at least in that state; I think it was the state of Georgia or North Carolina, that said that they were the first ones to introduce forensic and DNA studies in their state, you know, so the use of DNA is just really, really powerful right now, and it's gonna lead to what we now call personalized medicine, whereby--it's also getting to be fairly cost-effective to sequence your entire DNA genomes, so that will help speed things along as well.
Story_ID: 25208
Speaker 1: Sometimes you can get information you may not want to hear (laughter).
Speaker 2: So, for instance, if I seem to be genetically--through my DNA analysis (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, say pre-disposed for something (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I get pre-disposed to some disease--
Speaker 1: --Yeah.
Speaker 2: --or cancer or something, then what would I do? What can I do?
Speaker 1: Now that's a big personal decision. For men--let's say the incidence of say getting prostate cancer is fairly high, particularly in African-Americans; what will happen there is that you also get a very aggressive form. Suppose you find out that hey, your genes are gonna have you set up, what do you do? Do you get--go get rid of your prostate now, or do you wait until the disease comes in? Last night, it was one of the Miss America--Miss Universe Pageant people, a female; she's going in for breast augmentation, she's actually getting rid of her breast because she's already been genetically tested. This--I'm serious; this was on the news (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, I think I heard this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--last night. And she says her mother was diagnosed with cancer at 27, her aunt and so forth--the history is there; the gene is there. She said like "I'm not gonna wait" was her, was her, was her decision, you know. But then again, do you want to know all of these things? Because that was another question with the person (unclear) medicine in the use of DNA. Suppose you did know everything that could possibly happen to you in a lifetime, based on your DNA? How do you change your life? What decision do you make, or do you wanna go through life trying to live each day to the fullest without knowing that you could possibly be pre-disposed to something? How would that affect you? Are you gonna try and save more? Are you gonna be more cautious? Are you gonna be more reckless? What? You know? Is there gonna be something that drives you into a direction you may not have been going? You know, those are personal things. But, on the other hand, it would give future MD's a great tool to help tailor medicine and drugs and treatments to a given individual, you know, so--
Speaker 2: Would it be possible one day for instance, to find--to be able to modify DNA sequence to change someone's, I guess health destiny or something?
Speaker 1: That is the hardest thing that we have going right now because trying to move DNA in and out in a specific manner--you don't want to just--you're using different strategies to make certain that that DNA gets put in and gets put in in the right place, you know, to do corrective surgeries and things like that. It is possible, but I don't think it's something that's gonna happen any, anytime soon because when you think about, say, something like HIV, one of the things that it does is that the virus integrates its RNA form into a DNA, first converts it from an RNA form to a DNA form, and that DNA form on an HIV becomes integrator as a part of your genome, and depending on where it lands, it can cause way more problems than it really, really does.
Speaker 2: So that's a natural process of modifying your DNA?
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I mean this is what I'm saying; like they use--they call them vectors, you know, so like you use viral vectors, you take out quote unquote bad parts, put in what you want, then you just let it go through its normal replication cycle in which integration is a part of it, but where in your body, where in the DNA sequence is it gonna land? It could land in a part that's say producing a lot of antibodies, then that means you're gonna get over-production of what it is you're trying to correct. And many times, too much of a good thing is a bad thing (laughter).
Speaker 2: So what you're saying we've got a really--a fine-tuning problem (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--You got a fine-tuning problem.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--to deal with until--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --so if I'm Lance Armstrong and I want to ride my bike faster the DNA way, I won't be able to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--No, I don't think so.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--not for a while; it would be risky to do that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well with, you know, with his performance enhancing drugs and blood doping compounds, this is all part of the biotechnology industry. Erythropoietin, the E-P-O, EPO, this is the blood doping--this allows you to make new red blood cells which will increase your capacity to carry oxygen, so that's what makes that so good. But it's more or less like a natural compound but you've used up your red blood cells and then you've got to wait for some more to be regenerated. But by putting in more, he's like hey, he's beating the system and everything like that, so I guess we're at the day where Oprah is gonna be talking to him so that's what people are waiting for. In my lectures, I talk about, you know, the effects of recombinant DNA, the benefits as well as the drawbacks. The other thing is--ethical thing is working with stem cells and where they are derived from; embryos and things like that, so again, it's a lot of stuff that's out there. Science is fun.
Story_ID: 25209
Speaker 1: Now this is something that's really important for--in a lot of different ways in terms of a history project like I was in, is the African Burial Ground Project in New York City. Tell us--I guess you can just set it up by saying that construction workers discovered a gravesite--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --that was identified by archeologists, I guess, as an African burial ground--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --a place where Africans brought over here enslaved in New York City unloading boats and that sort of thing back in the 1600's I guess (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, today the bones are like--well we said 200 years old, so you can just extrapolate to, yeah.
Speaker 1: So the decision was to study those (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well, right.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--(Inaudible response).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, Michael Blakey, who used to be here in the Anthropology Department, was very much interested in that because, not only--by looking at the bones solely, you could look at--you could also tell about the work conditions, where the breaks occurred; is it on the clavicle, is it on the ribs, and things like that. Look in the clothing, what else is in the coffin gives you an idea what type of life these people led. The question then becomes well, where did these people come from? What is the origin of the skeletal remains? And so he wanted to have a genetic component to it, so from the anthropological part and sociological part, he was expert in that and he'd asked me to come on as a senior scientist to do the genetic part, so part of what I had wanted to do was to not only do that by using mitochondrial DNA because I knew how to isolate DNA from what we now call ancient materials--anything that's extinct or old--because you can do this technique called a Polymerase Chain Reaction so even minute amounts--you can put in specific little pieces of DNA to get large pieces of DNA back. Then you do DNA sequence and then you can see--compare what these sequences are closely related to in terms of different ethnic groups.
Speaker 1: What's that process called again?
Speaker 2: PCR, the Polymerase Chain Reaction. When that technique was developed, the person immediately got a Nobel Prize (laughter), okay? This is what gets people in trouble; this is your CSI. This is where your single strand of hair with a hair root and some DNA, this is what can be amplified to get--this is enough working material. Your DNA does not have to be purified; you put in the right set of primers, okay, that will actually allow you to amplify a specific set of sequences--that gold standard set of sequences, and they turn out to be yours, they got you. Lick a stamp, smoke a cigarette, wherever you get cells; this is why they say just rub the cheek cells, boom; break them open and DNA will spill out, get your probes in, and you're good. So I wanted to use that technique by using hair samples, so I just use--and you wanted--since the technique is so sensitive, you've got to make certain that your sample is not contaminated, to you have to test yourself, you have to test the workers around you to make certain that the sequences that you finally get back are those only from the bone. So I'd also wanted to mix in trained graduate students in Howard to use this technique and so it takes time when you're trying to get students who have little to no experience in a laboratory. So my end of the deal was a little bit slower than Michael would have like to see and this is where Rick Kittles came in; he's working solo, independent at NIH [National Institutes of Health] and everything like that; all he's doing is research. But that's beside the point; in the end, using the set of primers that I had for mitochondrial DNA and doing the DNA sequence, we were able to determine that the skeletal remains were from a region in West Africa, in a so-called Yoruba Tribe, and that worked out really well. And the other thing about grave sites like that is that, just as I told you early on about working for a dollar and a dime cutting grass in Elmwood Cemetery, slave graves were always kept separate from the white graves too, so that's another thing that made it useful in terms of like 'hey, what we're gonna find here is simply gonna be a slave or African origin,' and so that led the sociology and sociological part of anthropology as well, so then physical anthropologies, bones, the cultural parties, the social anthropology, so it's a huge team, large effort; and I think it paid off in a whole number of ways.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you started this project in 1995--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --and I think it reached its conclusion with a publication of the findings (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, in 2009--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--2009. Okay, that was a long time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a lot of work. And you know, if you were to take a look on my book shelf, you could see--it was funded by the GSA, the government--what is it, the Government Services Administration?
Speaker 1: Emm hmm.
Speaker 2: Yeah. It was General Services Administration.
Speaker 1: Emm hmm.
Speaker 2: It was a tremendous number of people, and some things--there was some politics involved in it amongst us as scientists as well, so that probably added to it taking so long, and then plus with Michael transferring out to a school in Virginia. But Michael was a visionary and a strong advocate for this particular program, and I appreciate the time and effort that he spent, you know, in getting all of us involved in it.
Story_ID: 25210
Speaker 1: In 2006--and I don't want to get too far ahead so tell me if I am--you and your wife published "Humanizing pedagogy through HIV and AIDS prevention?"
Speaker 2: That is correct; yeah, working with the--I believe is what is the AATC, the Teaching Conference Group; so Yolanda is involved (laughter) with so many different organizations and so many different groups. It was basically a review of treatments that were available for people with HIV up until that particular year. And so she did a little research but I pretty much did most of the science and articles and things like that. They knew her and they said, you know "Can you help us do that?" And she, of course, came to me and so I'll say it was difficult writing with her and, you know, like I'm an editor, and she said "I don't"--it was hard, but it--we had fun, you know but--yeah. So (laughter), so we've done a lot of stuff together but I don't think I want to do writing articles with her (laughter). She'll fuss at me for that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. But it turned out to be a successful publication.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Story_ID: 25211
Speaker 1: The balance of your time here at Howard [University]--now you're currently the Chair--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --of the Department. I mean, but since you've been here like, do you think you get enough time for research? (Simultaneous)--That seems to be the major problem, or the thing that has to be solved on most of the black college campuses--research time as well as teaching time.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, I worry--I'm at a point in my life and career where I worry about the research time of my fellow faculty members. I think, to be truthful, most of the research that I'm gonna do has pretty much already been done in terms of that's--that I'm really gonna do, so in the beginning yeah, I would say time was a factor in terms of--wasn't so much the time as it was the constraints of doing research at an HBCU. When you--when I--as I compare conditions at say UC [University of California] Berkeley versus conditions that I find here at Howard University is vastly different. Research is much more--it's prized here, it's respected here, but I don't think--the research enterprise is not necessarily implemented well here; there are a lot of difficulties in trying to get things done and that's, that's a little sad, that's the only thing--because we have people here who are just as brilliant, just as talented as anyone else, but research is also about competition, and basically, what that is is that--trust me, if I have an idea about how to solve a research problem, I'm not alone (laughter), and the prize goes to the person that gets their answer first, you know. And if we have--if we run into difficulties in trying to get to the end point, somebody else in the field is gonna get there before us, and too often that happens; we run across impediments here that, to me, we just shouldn't have to be running into.
Speaker 1: Yeah I was described one professor of history said it was like you having the same idea and one of you gets in a limo and the other one gets on a tricycle, trying to get to the same (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh yeah, we're almost--we're on a tricycle (laughter). I know it's the saddest thing, but--the other thing too, though. Here's the thing that's unique about HBCUs that people tend to miss. I think when you stop thinking about this being about just you, okay? How bigger, or how much better will I be? How many more publications would I have if we did this, or if we did this or--this way? Again, this is gonna go back to one of my professors at Berkeley. He says "When you go to a university, okay? And he freely admits--he freely admitted "I'm more interested in research than anything else." But he said this; he says "When a university hires you, they hire you as a teacher first, which will allow you to do the research you want to do." He said "I'm tough on you guys, I'm hard on you guys; I will try and even intimidate you just so I can get to my research. But, if you need me, I'm your teacher; that's my job, that's my first job." So I always keep that in mind and realize like, 'okay, maybe I ought to just lower my expectations; maybe--and maybe not.' I don't know, I don't want to peep--I never want to say you should lower yourself or anything like that. But don't be so disappointed if you don't get everything you want. As long as, in my opinion, you're able to teach somebody. Because our kids, kids of color that are coming in at the graduate level, whoooo--sometimes it's scary because you wonder what has happened to hands-on research. They lack that; it's 2013 and these kids still--sometimes don't even know how to pipette. That's like saying "How can I measure a cup of water to put in the pot?" That's what piepetting is. So--but you gotta teach that; you gotta teach them how to think; you gotta teach them not to just memorize their information, but how to apply it; all that's teaching, so that's what we--but that's what we do best at HBCUs and that's what we should be proud of. Say it like, "Okay, research, research, research." Please, trust me; I love research; I think it's the best thing ever. But one of the things that we do at HBCUs is we teach.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 25212
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major step that you would go back and change?
Speaker 2: Go back and change. I think the one thing I would change about my career here at Howard [University] is that I would actually have spent less time going back and forth to the National Cancer Institute--NCI in Frederick--at the beginning of my career, you know, in terms of working with that lab. I should have spent more time writing grants, you know, rather than trying to get more data and more information. I should have been integrating myself a little bit more with my faculty here, but basically, that to me was the biggest mistake I've made. The second thing I think I would have done, and probably should have done, and probably will do later on is that right before becoming the Interim Chairman of the Department, I was about ready to take a sabbatical leave to go learn new techniques in terms of research, and I let the choice of coming over here to be the Department Chair--in other words, I felt like the Department needed me more than I needed to go learn new techniques; or maybe it was just the challenge of being Chair, so--but taking a sabbatical--a true sabbatical are things that I think I should have done, you know, but the beginning--although I did get grants early in my career in coming here, I think I could have gotten a little bit faster if I had spent more time, you know, working and writing on them. So those are the only real regrets I have.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25213
Speaker 1: Again when you look at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your accomplishments or your legacy?
Speaker 2: Hmm, hmm, hmm. I've made a lot of average students better, I've challenged every student that I've had here to be better, I've told every student that I'm looking for them to take my place because I can't continue on, and this this is why I do it. My faculty--I've made certain that I put none of them in a position where they can't do well, I've treated them with respect and I fight for them when necessary if they're on the right side, you know. So I tell them all, I say "You know I really work for the Dean but I'm working for you guys but if you give me the proper ammunition, I'm gonna be on your side." But the key thing is that you have to respect them and not put them in a position to fail. Don't try and get them to do something you know they cannot do, that's embarrassing, you know, so that's it, you know, for me.
Story_ID: 25214
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Whoooo (laughter), it's so many, so many. Well, I'm just gonna--if I were to use myself as the example and I guess one of the simple things I always say, you can't really help anyone else until you help yourself. So for me, and based on my own history and my own quote unquote baggage growing up in the south, they said that as an African American and as a minority, the reason why you can't do anything is because you don't have any education. So I took that as a mandate that 'okay, fine; I'm gonna get all the education that is out there so that will never be an argument,' okay? If I'm gonna go out and compete for a job with everybody else, it's not gonna be--it's not gonna end because 'Oh, well they got a Bachelor's and you don't;' got that. 'Oh, they got a Master's degree, you don't;' got that. 'They got a PhD, you don't.' 'Oh, sorry, I got that; what's the problem? Are our skills the same?' So no; education, education, education. And the other thing I suppose is that--be happy; be happy for the success of all members of your ethnic group. Too often, you see people succeed and then we just like almost backstab them; it's like 'How did they get that?' It doesn't matter sometimes. It matters--I know I'm being naive on that, but last year, I don't know for whatever reason, I seem to have come into a calm, c-a-l-m. I'm not letting stuff bother me like it used to; I'm serious. It's like, you know, you hear over and over the years what it is, but I am--I'm happy--I'm not happy--I wasn't initially happy, the choice that I want to say for Provost may not have been--the Provost of Ad may not have been my first choice but okay, so what? Let's do what we can to help the Provost we got. This is the president's choice. I was just on the Search Committee, okay? But I'm not gonna go around 'Oh, this person is'--no, that's over. This person has been chosen, to let's do what we can to help this person, you know, do better, okay? And that's what I am about everybody, you know, so I think--I try to put myself in a position where I can help myself and my family, and I just want us to do that because--I talk to some of my friends and particularly some of the--say my foreign friends, and I've been teasing her. I said "You know you're part of the Chinese Mafia, don't you?" She said "What is that?" I said "Who do you go hang out with? Who are all your closest friends when you guys are here at Howard [University] and you try to put together a grant or you have some ideas you want to put together?" And it's like (unclear). Then I showed her another poster and showing that there was another group, and it would just say "All people of Indian origin, the majority." I said it's the Indian Mafia. And I said "If you want to look at us, we're the African American Mafia," you know. But the whole point is that we as African Americans--you know when I told you before about the early days in the projects, and you know, like--it takes a village to raise a child. We used to have that--to me. I think we--we're running away from that in terms of just trying to help each other, you know. So I want to see us like continue to--I want us to get back to maybe some of that, you know, so--I don't know. Maybe again, that's naive but I always say be good, and I still believe in doing unto others as you would have them do unto you, so that's, that's just the way I try and go about life.
Story_ID: 25215
Speaker 1: Now tell us something about your family. I know you told us about the birth of the first baby in '72 [1972], your son. How many do you have, and what are they doing?
Speaker 2: I only have one, we have one; we have one child, just turned 40 years old on this past Christmas Eve; we have two wonderful granddaughters; one is ten and one is--just turned seven on January 4th, and he has a good wife and the kids call me Pa Pa; we spoil all of them, including the son, and so we have Yolanda's niece here in town so typically, we all get together at least once a month, and we all have Sunday afternoon dinner or something like that. The girls always want to come over at least once a month. So it's interesting to look at the different personalities between the two grandkids, you know, and one is more like--a little tomboyish, and the other one she's becoming a real little lady. My wife Yolanda is spoiling them all to death and it's like there's nothing I can do about it (laughter), but I think what has happened with probably all of us-I know particularly with us, is that we may be--I think that we're contributing to part of the problem because we are treating our kids to things that we had to really struggle for. But Yolanda would say like "Well that's our job is not to let them have it so hard." But you know like, yeah we got by together on like 500 bucks a month, you know, but these guys today is like "Why are you giving, you know, the grandkids this amount of money now, just because they came over?" Every time they come it's--I think we are spoiling them so much because we don't want them to go through the struggles that we had that I think they lose the value of what it cost to get anything and there's little to no struggle. And what they're calling poor now, you know, compares nothing to what we call po' (laughter), so--but no, I love my family. My sisters and brothers are still--that are still in Birmingham, Alabama, I worry about them, but I worry about me, and that's mainly because sometimes I'm up here and I have a tendency--and I get busy and I forget to think about them, you know, so that's not good, that's not good. So I wish I could do better than I could. I have now lost both parents in the last year and a-half; as a matter of fact, today is the first anniversary of my father's death; it was on January 17 last year and the year before, my mom died on her birthday; she was 80 years old--in 2011 August 13, so--yeah, so that's probably part of why I'm not going back; it's like I don't--won't have them to go see, you know. But still, I still should probably, you know, talk to my sisters and brothers a little bit more, but mainly I used to always talk to them, so--like I said, you know, being that quote unquote third parent is kinda, is kinda hard (laughter). 'Cause like I said, they still have some of that, you know, but all in all, I know that they all respect me and they're all proud of what I'm doing. My granddaughters, they're finally beginning to understand what it is that I do because their mom put them on Google search and they came running up "Pa Pa, you're a scientist, you're a doctor," and it's like "Ahhh, so how do you know that?" "We Google you" (laughter). Yeah, so these are gonna be some smart kids, you know, so--I've got some more work to do, you know, so--but otherwise, I'm fine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 25216
Speaker 1: Now is there anything that I haven't asked you about that we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Ahh, let's see, ahh, the only things we talked about--we really haven't talked about is that the exhibit that was up in the American Association of History Museum, the exhibit called Science and American Life. We could leave that alone because the exhibit is now closed (laughter).
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about it.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's nothing than--it was just nothing more than an exhibit that showed history in American for the past 125 years. It was a joy to be a part of this exhibit, or serve as a quote unquote host with a life size cut-out of you showing history that went all the way up to about--19--yeah--think about to 1975 or whatever. When we began the DNA revolution, in other words, DNA became accessible for scientific research. That was fun because that was something, again, that I really never told anybody about that much, and--but it was kinda cool to see it up there, and visitors coming in the town, your students going down when they're showing their parents when they're getting ready to come back to school. "Dr. George, Dr. George, I saw you in the museum," and it's like "You must be famous." No, it's--you have no idea. But the funniest one was I was in the Administration Building and there was this guy in line to pay his--the tuition bill for his daughter; it was an Indian guy, and that doesn't make any difference, it was just a guy. He just kept looking at me and he said "I know you." I'm like "No, you don't know me." And I'm really not even thinking about it. He said "No, I know you, I've seen you." I said "Okay," since he continued to insist on this, it's like--so I said "Okay." Then I was trying to like walk away because I'm--this, to me, is getting strange. Then he says "Oh, you were in the museum, you were in the history museum." And then he turned to his other fellow partner and said "Oh, this is Howard University; their professors are in the museum, let me go pay." It was hilarious. So--so in those little small way, you know, you feel that you're making a difference, but the greatest way is that (unclear) this time of the year when you say--because my primary job is to help teach medical students and train medical students--is that you always get that--now you get the email whereas in the past you used to get that little thank you card under your door saying 'Thank you for your help; I wouldn't have made it without you.' So that's what I'm here for at this institution, is to maybe perhaps receive a little thank you card from one or two students a year. That's just like every time you say you wanna get out, they pull you back in. A little 'thank you' note will always pull you back in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 25217
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered probably as most people say right now "Boy, he was a really nice guy." That's what I get all the time, over and over. You're nice, you're kind, you're generous; that's it. That's what they say. Students will also add "You're hard," but they say "He is fair." But basically, "He was a nice guy." That's about pretty much all anyone could say, or hope to say, I suppose. But that's all I would be looking for. I don't want people to think I've been mean or anything like that. I try to be a nice guy but hey, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. So, but like I said, in my year of calm, don't care (laughter).
Story_ID: 25218
Speaker 1: Alright. What we're looking at here at this time is a--this is a birthday card to my brother who was celebrating his 60th birthday. And what I had found was a series of pictures of us in our elementary school days, so this is eight of my brothers and sisters, including me. We're missing the last set of twins and my baby brother. So the one that you see says 'WC Davis Class of 1956.' That's the birthday boy. That's what he looked like then. On the upper level, you have--the middle one to the right is Winfred George; then there's David George, that's the W.C. Davis; my sister Joanne in her young days; and that's me in about '62 [1962], '63 [1963]. We go down to the bottom left, this is the second set of twins; that's Vanessa to the left and Valencia to the right. Valencia is the one sister who has died; she died first of the 11; in the first set of twins there's Linda George and Leonard George, so they're there. So we're missing one set.
Speaker 2: This is my baby boy, first and only child Matthew George III; we call him Bam because two people can't be running around the house with the same name, plus I was watching football when he came home.
Speaker 1: This is Yolanda George, the woman that you guys say is missing in action. This is our first trip to Washington, DC coming from California. Old days, love my hats, look like Gil-Scott Heron.
Speaker 2: Alright, as we get a little bit older, we get my mom to come; that's her on my left in the picture, Rosetta George; she passed away in 2011; Yolanda George, she is--she flew on a plane to Washington, D.C., my did didn't. He was on the train with me, had to take an overnight train to get him to DC because he wouldn't fly and mom flew in less than two hours.
Speaker 1: Alright, this is--to my right on the picture, this is Daryl Basham; this is the recipient of the first graduate--PhD Graduate Degree Dissertation Award from the graduate school. That's Basham; he is patent lawyer, lawyer, and PhD student.
Speaker 2: Alright, this is the current family right now in Maryland. This is me with my granddaughter Nia in the blue coat who is celebrating her birthday that was on January 4th, so it's me, Yolanda, Alana, that's Bam's wife, the ten year-old believe it or not is standing between the mom and the dad, and Courtney is on the end; that's Yolanda's niece from New Orleans that stays here.
Speaker 1: Alright, this is what I call the family in the early days. Matthew III or Bam, me and Yolanda. That's just us; that was kinda fun.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, we're bringing out the early, early days again. My sister, when she first saw this picture, she said "Boy, you were ruint" (laughter). She didn't even recognize me again. That was the year before. So I have a sister that says all these funny things and--I tell you. She was saying she saw a fat baby and she calls them juicy. Said the baby was juicy. I said "You can't call a baby juicy."
Speaker 1: This is the opening of the Science and American Life exhibit in which I was a part of that started in 1994, so it was a formal affair, okay? And it was at the Smithsonian Museum of American History. That's the outside. It underwent renovations a couple of years ago.
Speaker 2: That's me, as well as some--several other scientists that served as hosts. These are cut-outs--life size cut-outs of us.
Speaker 1: I was in two places in the museum, so I'm representing the era leading from 1975 to the present when DNA becomes the gold standard of study.
Speaker 2: Again, we go back to the very beginning in my formal attire, looking at the entrance.
Speaker 1: One of the themes is "Where is Dr. George in D.C.?" This is my student Allison; she stumbled across me and said "Dr. George, you're in the museum" (laughter).
Speaker 2: This is part of the African Burial Ground Project. This is me with Agnes Day and Michael Blakey looking at the bones from the African Burial Ground Project.
Speaker 1: Again, a continuation showing Michael Blakey and Dr. Day and looks like Dr. Settles.
Speaker 2: Let's get a copy of the cover of this, too.
Speaker 1: Yeah, turn it up. And so our findings for this particular African Burial Ground study is found in Part I of the report that we sent to the General Services Administration. It's about five volumes of this, and we're all proud of the work that we did.
