Speaker 2: All right.
Story_ID: 572386
Speaker 1: So, let's start with your family's history and we'll start with your mother's side of the family first, and you told me that you were born in Los Angeles [California] but raised in Arizona.  But if you can give me your mother's name, your mother's date of birth, place of birth and I wanna talk about your mother's side of the family first.
Speaker 2: Oh, my, my mother's name was Sarah Garret [Sarah Garret Anderson], and married my father [Joseph Anderson] and became Anderson, my mother was born in Hondo, Texas and reared on a farm.  She was reared by her grandparents [Sarah Johnson and Joseph Johnson] because when she was three years old, her mother died, so she never knew her real mother.  The mother that she knew was really her grandmother who took her and reared her with her many children.  Oh, she was born September 19, 1891, and when she married my father she was only seventeen years old and eventually they went to California and therefore, I was born in Los Angeles.  Now, my mother said that she went to a college, it was called a college, Seguin in Texas, now what that, mo- from what I have heard of it, it probably was about high school level.  Now, I don't think my mother finished there because she married at seventeen and so, therefore, she did day work and she worked hard, doing people's laundry, cleaning, that sort of, of work.  And we, we lived in Los Angeles until I was about four years old.
Speaker 1: But before we, let's ju- just, I wanna go and ask you--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --a few more questions about your mother.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: What had her mother died of when she was three years old?
Speaker 2: Childbirth.
Speaker 1: And what do you know about your mother's parents who raised her, her grandparents.  Do you know their names and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I--
Speaker 1: --dates of birth?
Speaker 2: --I do not know very much except for what my mother told me.  I do recall, vaguely recall, she was my great-grandmother, I called her grandma, 'cause my mother called her mother.  She did come to California and looked after me while my parents were at work and I vaguely remember her because she just was, she was just kind, and she was like, and she would let me do almost anything but she evidently died when I was around four years old.  I just--all I can remember is she was not around and I kept asking my mother where she was and my mother was kind of, you know, I guess she felt that as a child I didn't and wouldn't understand the fact of, of death.
Speaker 1: Well your mother had been born in 18, eight, '91 [1891]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So that means your grandparents were possibly born into slavery?  Were they?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: They were not?
Speaker 2: No, my, my mother's grandparents were property owners at Hondo, out, out of Hondo.  They had a big farm, my, my great-grandfather evidently had a huge acreage of it, and he was evidently, from what my mother said, was very, very much respected.  And, I don't recall how many children they had, they had quite a number of them and my mother was just brought up with them.  Her mother must have been one of the oldest of that family, right.  And my grandfather [Henry Garret] still lived on his farm there and my mother knew him very well and he remarried, my grandfather remarried and he had a family of seven children, my mother remembered the older, the older of them, she--the older couple or so, they would play together, so she did remem- she remembered her and got to know her fath- her father.
Story_ID: 572387
Speaker 1: So do you know at all how your [maternal] grandfather [Henry Garret] or, or your [maternal] great-grandfather [Joseph Johnson] would have acquired all of the land in Hondo, Texas?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  I just know that he did and when my mother [Sarah Garret Anderson] went down to, mother went down to visit when I was a child, there was still a lot of it, some of it had been sold off, a few acres, but there still was a huge part that, just some of his married children still owned and ran.
Speaker 1: Well, what did he farm?  Do you know?  In Hondo, Texas what was he farming on the land?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I just know it was a farm--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was a huge farm and he had horses and cows and they, in fact, when we were there to visit when I was twelve, they were still doing pretty much I guess like my great-grandfather, they ha- they would do the milking and, and whatever they did with milk, you know.  And they raised a lot of their own food and so, but I have no idea what he, what he farmed.  I presumed a little bit of everything.
Speaker 1: So do you remember what he looked like?  Was he of mixed ancestry?
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: Was he all black?  Was he part black and part white, Indian [Native American] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There in one of those little books that I have there, that I have, there is a picture that because in, in, in one of the books that I listed here, there are pictures of the whole family as far as I could get them.  And I know that he must have been a large heavy set, dark brown man.  My grandmother was, well, everybody looked tall to me, (laughter), I think she was rather tall, light skinned, grey eyes.
Story_ID: 572388
Speaker 1: So let's talk some then, are there any other stories you can think of about your, your mother's [Sarah Garret Anderson] childhood or early adulthood that, that you think would be important for this oral history?  I mean, you told that she was, that she was a domestic, that she worked (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh very.
Speaker 1: --very hard in people's homes.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: She met your father [Joseph Anderson], what year did she meet your father?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm not sure.  I know they married in 1908, yes four years before I was born, they met--they married in 1908.  Now, the story of my father is a whole different story and how they got together sometimes, I wonder.  My father was almost twelve years older than my mother and my father was Creole, he was a French speaking Creole and as a young man he went to Mexico and he lived in Mexico for five years.  He loved horses and he rode with Pancho Villa, he used to tell us all about that.  So of course, he became a fluent Spanish speaker, the only English he'd ever had he had been taught by the nuns, he bec- of course the family naturally, Louisiana Creoles were, were Catholic and he said that the nuns had taught him some English.  Well, by his going on down to Mexico, then coming back to the United States, his English was pretty cold.  So he was still really learning English.  But my father was a very intelligent man and he taught himself to speak.  As a child, I can remember his accent and how some words he didn't know and he might be talking and sticking a French word or Spanish word, you know?  And my mother and I were saying, oops, what (laughter) what's he talking about (laughter)?
Speaker 1: So what year was your father born and what's his place of birth?
Speaker 2: My father was born in 1879.
Speaker 1: And his place of birth?
Speaker 2: It was in Louisiana, and I'm not too sure of the name of the town.  It wasn't in New Orleans [Louisiana], but, 'cause I have relatives in New Orleans and I have relatives in Monroe [Louisiana] and in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] and, but he, h- he was poor and his folks owned, I guess they owned some land and it was probably farm (unclear) land because I know my grandmother [Eliza Talamon] would, would send us pecans she had picked from the pecan trees.  So, but I don't recall the name of the town in Louisiana.
Speaker 1: So did he grow up in New Orleans or in the surrounding areas at all, do you know?
Speaker 2: I do not know.  All I ever heard was that he grew, that he went to Catholic school and was taught English there and he was the, oh, there were eleven children in his family and he was number three.  He had two sisters older than he and he was the oldest of the boys.
Story_ID: 572389
Speaker 1: Did he [Greenwood's father, Joseph Anderson] ever say why he'd gone to Mexico?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He got himself into trouble (laughter) and back in those days, you know, you didn't know what was gonna happened so, and  we did not find this out until after his death because every time--he changed his name and every time I would try to find out why he wasn't a Talamon, because Talamon, well we call it Talamon in English, but Talamon was the family name and his name was Anderson and the reason I found this out after his death from his youngest brother and his youngest brother was so much younger than he that, I think when he was born my father must have been practically almost twenty years old.  And he said that, that they had been told that my father was, I guess working at a restaurant or something and he had quite a temper and some guy set him off and threw a mug and banged him one.  I don't know where they killed him or not but, you know that meant, so that was the reason he went to Mexico.  I was glad to find that out because it had always puzzled me why I was not a Talamon?
Speaker 1: Now do you know if the gentleman was white, which is why he had to leave town (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes.  If he'd been black it wouldn't have made any difference definitely, definitely.
Speaker 1: So he hit some white guy over the head with a cup and had to leave town?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  But he would never tell us, because I asked him a few times why we were Anderson and he w- and ever, all the rest of my, my aunts and uncles and, and were all Talamon, and he would nev- he would get upset and he'd never say it.  So, as I said, after his death, we found out.  So that's why I was--grew up Anderson.
Speaker 1: So did you, d- did he ever say why he chose the name Anderson as--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --opposed to any other name?
Speaker 2: No one knows why in the world he did, because his full name, as far as we knew, was always Joseph August Anderson.  And it, his, we found out it was Joseph August Talamon.
Story_ID: 572390
Speaker 1: So what did he [Greenwood's father, Joseph Anderson] do for a living?  You said he did all sorts of things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh he was--
Speaker 1: What some, what are some of those things?
Speaker 2: He did all sorts of things.  He was a great cook and I know when I was born he was a chef on the railroad and he, he would do anything that, any kind of work.  That was one thing, he'd worked, he was a little man and, right other there, there's a picture of my parents there.  He was a little man, a feisty little man with his hor- this awful temper and, but he could cook like you wouldn't believe and then he, as I said, he just took almost anything that, because when we left Los Angeles [California], left California and then he went into, oh what was it?  He's something, some kind of an assistant and at the army hospital out of, out of Prescott [Arizona], Fort Whipple, yeah.
Speaker 1: So he and your mother [Sarah Garret Anderson] married in 1909 you said?
Speaker 2: Nineteen o'eight [1908].
Speaker 1: Nineteen o'eight [1908]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you were born four years later?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they were living in Los Angeles at the time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you know why they'd gone from, was it di- just tell me how they met and married and, and where they were?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: So he was in Mexico, he came back from--
Speaker 2: He came back--
Speaker 1: --Mexico.
Speaker 2: --into to Texas and he, now how in the world, this is the thing that I have never been able to figure out and, and all I have heard was that he met my mother here, he was what about twenty-eight years old or so and she was a teenager and I guess he courted her and his accent and what have you and she fell because they were about as opposite (laughter) as the poles really.  And that, that's all I know.
Story_ID: 572391
Speaker 1: They had went to California but, I can pretty much figure out why they went to California.  My father [Joseph Anderson] was a nomad, he would stay just so long in a place and he was ready to move somewhere else.  So he went to California and they weren't in Los Angeles [California] at first, somewhere in California but they did finally move into California and I have no idea whether he was still hooked on the railroad or what he was doing in California because my first recollection was when I was, just before I was three years old.
Speaker 2: Give me that first recollection.
Speaker 1: Yes, I can still see it.  I asked my mother [Sarah Garret Anderson] how old I was going to be and she said, "You're going to be three years old," and I said, "Am I going to have a birthday party?"  I can remember that.  She said, "Yes you will," and I could hardly wait.  I don't know how many days it was before my birthday, but and I cannot remember very much about that day except that I had a cake and ice cream and do you know?  I don't even remember whether there were any other children there, there may have been, but that's my first recollection.
Speaker 2: And that recollection comes from Los Angeles?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You were in Los Angeles?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: What are some of your other early memories of growing up in Los Angeles and give me the date that we're talking, we're talking about 1915?
Speaker 1: Well if I was going to turn three it would have been 1915.  And oh, my father must have been working at a laundry because it seems to me that the laundry wasn't too far away 'cause I could hear and, and I vaguely remember, I have a recollection of that and then everything is blank until it seems as though we weren't living there anymore, but we had moved, I guess across the street or somewhere near and there was a big, a big house where white people lived and in the rear there was a little house and it was green, it was painted green, I think with white trim 'cause I, I visualize these things.  There was a fence that, that, between the yard and the house in front and our house and we had moved into this little house at the rear. We had to come through the front yard and through this little gate to this little green frame house.  And I was with my, who I called grandma all the time, my [maternal] great-grandmother [Sarah Johnson], I could, because it looked as though my mother and my father were gone.  Now what my father was doing then, I don't know.  I know that my mother was doing what she called day work and my grandmother would take care of me and in the, the yard in front where the, the big house was, where the white people lived, there was a fig tree.  They didn't do anything with the figs and they had evidently had told my grandmother we could have them and do you know, I loved figs.  My grandmother, I can remember my grandmother taking me out and holding me up, lifting me up and letting me pick things off the tree and I'd eat them.  Now, you don't eat the skins of figs and for some reason, I would eat them until my mouth was so sore I just couldn't eat anymore.  I loved those figs and my grandmother of course would just, she'd let me do almost anything.
Story_ID: 572392
Speaker 1: The other memory I have is that my, my Uncle J.C. [Joseph Talamon] who was my father's youngest brother, in fact, I guess he was, I don't know if there were any sisters younger than he, but he was the youngest brother, had come to California, I guess he lived in Los Angeles [California], but he'd come, come out to the house and visit and we'd have a great time.  But he had something he would do that I just ex-, it was exciting to me and it's a wonder it didn't burn the house down.  You know, in those days they had gaslights and here was this, the, the gaslight had a bulb over it and then you'd turn the gas on and light it with a match.  All right, he would fix matches in a certain way, lay them over the gaslight and they go poof, (laughter) I remember that and I would just laugh.  The other memory I have is that, I think I died that day.  I remember my, I remember my mother [Sarah Garret Anderson], my grandmother [Greenwood's maternal great-grandmother, Sarah Johnson] putting me in for my nap after I'd had lunch and I, I remember som- I couldn't figure out what was going on because it looked as though I'd rose up and I could see, I could see me lying in my crib and then I don't know what happened after that, the next thing I knew, I was being tossed up in the air, my folks my, my mother told me that when she and my father [Joseph Anderson] got home, I was still asleep which is most unusual for that long, 'cause it was after I was, I guess I was put down for a nap about two and I was usually awake again around four o'clock.  They couldn't wake me up, just couldn't wake me up, they were scared to death and my, now where my father got this idea I'll never know, he took me outside and he was tossing me up in the air and that's when I, and I couldn't, I remember, I remember thinking when I--what was going on?  And then I began to laugh because my dad was always playing with me, you know and when I started to laugh, my mother, my grandmother were standing at the outside there, and they just, my mother was crying because they had brought me back to life--and when I think of the fact that I was, I could see myself, I will always say, the Lord wasn't ready for me, that I had left my body but I was put back in, brought back to life.
Story_ID: 572393
Speaker 1: So, as a child, do you re- did your fam- was your family very, a religious family?  Did you go to church often?
Speaker 2: My mother [Sarah Garret Anderson] was very religious, very.  My mother was a hard rock Baptist and I mean she believed in the Lord and had faith and I think sometimes it was her faith that really got us through our tough times.  Now my father [Joseph Anderson] was brought up Catholic but he, he did not practice particularly.  About the only time that he'd go to church that I knew of, once in a great while he'd go to a Catholic church and then if he, after we moved to Denver [Colorado], after he'd had, if any of his sister came, they'd be sure that he went to a Catholic church.  But interestingly enough, my mother tried very hard to make a Baptist out of me and I told her when I was ten years old, I was going to be Methodist, and I am Methodist (laughter).
Speaker 1: So at ten years old, why did you recognize yourself as a Methodist as opposed to a Catholic or a Baptist (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, there were two reasons, my mot--in Prescott, we had moved into Prescott, Arizona, you know I, when I was in, in, a little child in Los Angeles [California], we lived there when I was four, my mother never took me to chur- I'm sure she went to church somewhere but, she never took me.  But, after we moved to Arizona and I guess after about five years old, she began taking me with her, they had only a, the, the black Methodist chur- I mean the Baptist church was a little missionary church there.  Now the Methodist church, I think it was A.M.E. Zion [People A.M.E. Zion Church, Prescott, Arizona], was where most of our people went.  Now in Prescott, there weren't but just so many of us, but that was the church.  After a while the little Baptist church just, it was just folding and my friends were all going to the Methodist church and my mother wanted to keep me in Sunday school so she started letting me go.  And that was when I made my decision that I was gonna be Methodist and when I told my mother, she just smiled like she'd always do and, and she said, "Oh, just wait until you're older, wait until you're older."  She'd never tell me not to be, but she still continued to make sure I went to a Baptist church which we started when we got here to Denver, but I still was gonna be Methodist and that was it.
Speaker 1: So it was 1917, that you left Los Angeles for Arizona?  You said you were five years old?
Speaker 2: For, no it must have been 1916, oh it might have been early '17 [1917].  Yeah, yeah, it would have been '17 [1917], because I remember war songs, World War I [WWI], you know they had these songs and, and I remember my mother used to sing 'It's a Long Way to Tipperary' and, and I'd heard that even before we left Southern California, (laughter).
Story_ID: 572394
Speaker 1: So, we are starting with the war [World War I, WWI].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Give me a war song.
Speaker 2: Oh let's see, (singing) "It's a long way to Tipperary, it's a long way to go, it's a long way to Tipperary, bum bum bup bump boop" ['It's a Long Way to Tipperary'] (laughter), oh there are a lot of them and, when you ask me these right off the bat it, you know, there's something I, I go around singing every now and then and then I can't recall them but that was one of them.  There was a little, they put out a little war song book, it wasn't, it wasn't but just so big, it was paperback and it had a khaki colored cover on it and it had all these little songs.  Well it wasn't until after I was in school that I got so I could read them, but I'd heard them so much I could sing most of them because my mother [Sarah Garret Anderson] sang, my mother sang a lot and then of course all around you'd hear the war songs.
Speaker 1: You said that the war, that your father [Joseph Anderson] wanted to go to the war--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but he was too old.
Speaker 2: I don't know why but he wanted to and the result was that he was sent to, he went to West Virginia I believe and what he was doing I don't know, but it didn't have anything to do with the [U.S.] military, it was a war job that they had and I don't know what they were, they were building something and I remember his talking about it and he was gone for quite a while.  But why he wanted to go into the [U.S.] Army, I will never know, but that was the reason that he didn't because of his age.
Story_ID: 572395
Speaker 1: Do you remember starting school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Around this time?
Speaker 2: Yes, I wanted desperately to go to school, being an only child I--but I just wanted to get to school and normally at five years old, of course you go onto kindergarten, well now in 1917, I had turned five, my mother [Sarah Garret Anderson] would not let me go.  Her little darling was, "She was to, too little to be going yet," and I was, I was smaller than anybody else, you know.  So, she said that when I got six years old, I could go, which of course would have been 1918, well in the spring of 1918, when I was still five, I caught the flu, you, you've heard about that worldwide flu epidemic, after the war [World War I, WWI]?  My father [Joseph Anderson] came back home in the middle of it, he had it, I got it and that's the second time that I just about died.  I don't know how long I was in bed unconscious most of the time, my fever was so high that I was wringing wet all the time and finally, and my mother was by my bed constantly, I don't know when in the world she slept because when I would become conscious she was always there and I would go again.  And finally, she told me that the doctor gave up on me, she said he absolutely could not do anything more for me unless he's got some whiskey.  And back in those days you know, you didn't go to the doctor, the doctor came to you, came to your house and, now what the whiskey would do, I don't know but it was as scarce as hen's teeth because everybody was using it and of course I guess I was just gone.  There's another time that I went up and could see me lying there and I never know how I got back in my, it, it's just blank but somehow that spirit got back into my body and my mother said that in the middle of the night the doctor came pounding on the door, he had found some whiskey and, isn't it wonderful doctors were like that then?  They aren't like that now, but anyway, he found this whiskey, now what he did and what he mixed it with and gave it to me, poured it in me, I do not know, all I know is that eventually I became conscious and for the first time I actually said, "Momma," and my mother just wept, I was and I was, my, my fever broke and I, but I had been sick so long, you know I couldn't walk?  I was five years old.  I'll never forget that and I was so small, I was still asleep in my crib because I was just a little kid, usually then she'd just have the crib side down you know?  And I could climb in and out, but while I was sick it was up and so finally I became well enough that I could get up and my legs folded right under me.  Scared me to death, I still remember, going through my mind, I've got, I won't be walking anymore, I'm gonna have to crawl the rest of my life (laughter).  So, I had to crawl, I had to get back and crawl just like I did as a baby and then gradually would pull myself up on things, you know as my legs got stronger and I was fed, I'll always remember that.
Story_ID: 572396
Speaker 1: All right now, I would turn six in November, you see?  I still couldn't figure why my mother [Sarah Garret Anderson] wouldn't pay--let me go to school in September, the, after she told me, she said, "When you turn six you can go to school," and I thought boy, after my sixth birthday I thought I was going to school that day.  But, sure enough, she put me in kindergarten, (laughter), I was having a great time and do you know, I don't think I was in that kindergarten a week when the schools all closed.  The flu epidemic was 1918 and '19 [1919], the flu epidemic had gotten so big, so massive all over everywhere in Prescott [Arizona], that stores were closed because the store owners couldn't even, well they were dying or they were sick and there were so many--the teachers were out, the children were out and finally they had to close the schools.  Oh, was I unhappy.  The schools did not open until spring of 1919, and my mother said well they're only, they're only a short time so she didn't, we had moved to a little further wh- well first we had lived right down the street from the school and then we had moved and so she said, "Well you'll just wait until fall."  All right, here I was six, would be seven in November, my mother put me back in kindergarten and, of course I wasn't even bigger than the kindergarteners and after a little while, I got to be such a nuisance, kindergarten was one boring me to death and I had a little friend that I played with all the time and she had, she had been put in first grade, she had turned six in July and here I was gonna be seven in November.  So, one day I got to thinking about this now, if Eliza [ph.] was in first grade, I wondered how she'd got into first grade and I asked her one day and she says, "I don't know, I just get in line," and I said, "That's all you have to do?"  And she said, I said, "Well you know, I'm gonna get in line," it took me several days, never told my mother now, that I had this in mind, never told anybody, Eliza was the only one that I knew, that knew, th- and she didn't think I'd do it.  And one morning I just got in the first grade line and she looked at me and said, "I don't know whether you were supposed to do that," and I never said a word, I just marched in with the first graders and how in the world, it would never cross my mind that Eliza was the only brown face in that class, yeah.  Oh, by the way, we were on the side of town where most of the white people lived, nearly all the black people were on the other side and they went to Lincoln School [Lincoln Elementary School, Prescott, Arizona], Washington School [Washington Elementary School, Prescott, Arizona] was on my side and there were just a few of us there and she was the only little brown face in this first grade.  Well, I went in, I sat down and some kid came and let me know it was his seat, well I moved again, somebody took that seat, finally I found a seat nobody claimed and, and for some reason the teacher hadn't come in.
Story_ID: 572397
Speaker 1: Now, I'll always remember her name too because I'd heard so much about her.  Her name was Miss Grizwold, now Miss (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Can you spell that for me?
Speaker 1: Yeah, G-R-I-Z-W-O-L-D, I can still see it.  Miss Grizwold had been teaching first grade forever and of course from the, from the viewpoint of a six year old, she must have been ancient.  Well, she came in the room and she took roll call and then she spotted this little second brown face and she called me up and she wanted to know why I was there and I said, "The kindergarten teacher told me to come to first grade."  (Laughter) She asked me my name.  Now, in those days, if you asked me my name, you might as well just wait until I give you the whole thing, Marie Louise Anderson [HistoryMaker Marie Louise Greenwood], born in Los Angeles, California, my birthday was November the 12th, the 24th, 1912, my mother [Sarah Garret Anderson] and father's name [Joseph Anderson], my address, we didn't have any telephone.  But you, nothing would stop me, the whole thing went and then she said, "Well come with me," and she took me to office and I, then I thought oh boy, I'm in trouble now, so she took me to the office and she, the princ- had told the secretary and the principal came out of the office and she told him, you know, that I had come in and that I said that the kindergarten teacher had told me to come.  So then he asked me my name, got the whole nine yards again and the next thing I knew he sent for the kindergarten teacher, then I knew I was in trouble, she walked in and she looked at me and went on into his office.  Now, I am sure that that kindergarten teacher was very glad to get rid of me because I had really been, I'd got so I'd tea- there was some little boy that would cry and I'd tease him to death and make him cry and then I'd put this innocent face, who me (laughter)?  You know, and at that, being in kindergarten really had had it.  So, when she came out, she didn't even kno- she just went on and then the principal came out and he said, "We have decided to let you stay in first grade for six weeks and if you get along all right, you can--you'll be there," so, then I told my mother when I got home, I was in first grade.  (Laughter) So, but you know, I was just thrilled to death to get into first grade and--
Speaker 2: What--?
Speaker 1: --my--
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Yeah, my mother somehow had got a hold of a 'Beacon Primer' ['The Beacon Primer,' James H. Fassett], now a 'Beacon Primer' is an old book back in those days that was the, the first grade reader and even when I was just five years old, before I even thought of going to school, she would read those stories to me.  And she read them to me so many times, I had the first three memorized verbatim and somehow I had figured out that every time I said a word, that it was there, that's what those things were on the page.  So, I had these first three stories, I could take the book, you know, and I would just rea- didn't know one word from the other but I had it so memorized I, and I knew how to follow the words, that I could do it.  So, it, I had a break, they were, th- and fortunately they were only on about the second story or so, you know, and I was reading away, the teacher thought I was reading, we got pass the third story and (laughter) I was as lost as I could be as far as words were concerned.  But, do you know?  I worked so hard at actually learning, that I was getting everything and I got to the point that I began to be a little pissed because I get my work done and I'd haggle somebody else, but nobody could stop me if I was working and finally I get, so Miss Grizwold said, I, I had to sit in the corner one day (laughter) and I thought oh, oh, boy if my mother finds out about this, I mean, I am in trouble so I kind of behaved.  And after the six weeks, the teacher told me the principal wanted to see me again, he wanted to know if I'd like to go to second grade, and do you know I told him no.  Why?  I said, "Because I wanna find out what every grade's like."  But, I put myself in first grade and as, since I have been an adult and look back at that, I guess I've always had a mind of my own and just.
Story_ID: 572398
Speaker 1: So it--I hear that the schools, can you explain for me the structure of the schools?  There was Lincoln School [Lincoln Elementary School, Prescott, Arizona] which were for black students and then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well it wasn't for blacks students, it happened to be on the black side of town.  Now, Arizona had a very strange law though, any city over, with a certain population of blacks, the schools were segregated, but Prescott [Arizona] didn't have enough of them, so the mountain towns like Prescott and Flagstaff [Arizona], there were, everybody went to school together, it just happened, Prescott did have the two schools and the one on the side of town where nearly all the black people lived was Lincoln School.  We, were on the side of town where there were only three families of us, living on my side of town and so we went to Washington School [Washington Elementary School, Prescott, Arizona] and there were just a few of us.
Speaker 1: Boy it's so ironic also that, that they named the schools, one Lincoln which was on the black side of town (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Isn't it the--?
Speaker 1: --and Washington--
Speaker 2: I've often thought of that too.  Yes (laughter).
Story_ID: 572399
Speaker 1: So just moving forward, you've sort of described for me the type of student you were, you were mischievous and smart and a go getter.  What happens to you in life when you sort of move forward, when you're in like the fifth and sixth grade now?  When you are more, becoming more of a teenager?  I mean, you know, in your life--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You're still going to school [Washington Elementary School, Prescott, Arizona].  What type of student are you and what are you consid- what do you want to do with your life at, by the time you're in fifth grade, have you decided what you want to become?
Speaker 2: No.  Not particularly, I just always wanted to be the best and in fourth grade I ran into a very prejudice teacher, I had not run in, the teachers were, that I'd had were just, they were just really nice teachers and they learned how to deal with me as I, after I became a teacher, some of the things that teachers did to deal with me and my mischievousness, I, I knew that they had learned.  But when I got to fourth grade, this teach- my, my little friend Eliza's [ph.] brother had had her and he told me, he said, "She, she doesn't like colored people," well I got her and do you know that teacher ignored me almost to the limit.  But, if sh- she, if I'd raise my hand as though I knew something, forget it, but if I didn't know, she'd call on me every time, and I'd give the wrong answer or I didn't know it and she'd make some snide remark.  I'll always remember that.  I finally went to the principal, I didn't get to speak the principal, I guess it was the assistant principal, to tell him, but nothing was done about it.  So, I made up in my mind I was gonna, I was going to just fool her.  So, I got to the place that if I knew it, I'd look as dumb as I could, she'd call on me and I had the answer and if I didn't know it, I'd just wave my hand and she'd ignore me and finally, I think she got a little confused, (laughter) but I, that, I pulled that one and I came out with some decent grades because I would come up with those answers.
Speaker 1: Well, when did you in your life, in this early part, part of your life recognize that you were black in a sense to whereas people would discriminate on, against you solely based on the color of your skin?
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess by the time I was five years old because my mother [Sarah Garret Anderson] and dad [Joseph Anderson] would talk about it, discrimination and what not, and then the fact that everything we did, and everywhere we went, it was only with our own people because there was no mixture.  So, by the time I went to school, I knew very well, but for some reason it just didn't bother me.  And one thing, as I became a teenager and after we came to Denver [Colorado] even, one thing my father had always said, "You're as good as anybody else," and I fully believe that, that I was as good as anybody else and if you could do it, I could do it and maybe do it better, that was my whole attitude.  And I also had developed being an individual I guess.  I never was one who went with the crowd, if the crowd was going my way or doing what I wanted to do in the way that what, and I knew was right, fine.  But, I could stand out there an individual and you could say anything, make fun of me if you wanted to, but I was me and I've always been that way.
Story_ID: 572400
Speaker 1: So moving forward a little bit, at what year did you leave Arizona [Prescott, Arizona] and actually move to Denver [Colorado] and why did that happen?
Speaker 2: Nineteen twenty-five [1925], we came to Denver.  Well, there was an interim there.  My mother [Sarah Garret Anderson], I think it was in November of '24 [1924], or November, December '24 [1924], she said she wanted to go back down to Texas to visit little, what was left of her family and so we went.  My, we had, we had bought a home in Arizona, my father [Joseph Anderson] stayed there, but my father being the nomad that he was, he had already began to get a little, he wanted to go somewhere else.  Well, while we were in Texas, he decided to take a trip to Denver, he'd always wanted, he'd heard about Denver, he just wanted to see it and he liked it here.  So, when we, when my mother and I left Texas, we came to Denver because this is where my father had moved and he had found a place, right down here on the corner of 13th [Street] and, not Pearl [Street], it's right across the street from the, the, the Brown house [Molly Brown House Museum, Denver, Colorado], what's her name Brown [Margaret Brown], boy my memory and names.  Anyway, right on the corner of 13th and Pennsylvania [Street], what is now a big office building, but it was the Manor Apartments [ph.].  My father had got a job there, that way he had, we had an apartment, didn't cost anything and so my mother and I came and that's where we lived.  And to this day, every time I take a shower, I think of the one thing that meant so much to me, for the first time in my life, we had a full bathroom, that meant more to me than anything I could think of.  I walked in and here was a bathroom with a tub, a wash basin, a toilet and we had, eventually in our place in, in Arizona, had got an indoor toilet, that was the luxury, but we were still bathing in a, the wash tub and washing in the wash bowl and here was a bathroom and I, I, sometimes I can giggle at myself when I'm taking a shower, (laughter) because I think of that.
Story_ID: 572401
Speaker 1: So you arrive in Denver [Colorado] in 1925?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What grade were you in, in school?
Speaker 2: I had been, I had spent the rest of the school year and we had been, we had gone down in either November or, or, or December, and it was February when we came here.  Well, in the meantime I had been in this country school, one, first that was a big experience too.  It was a one room country school and I, I think I knew almost as much as the teacher did, I was in fifth grade and, no sixth grade, I'd gone to sixth grade and she would let me help the fifth graders and so forth with her and I was tough on those guys, they were great big boys and there was this little one, you know.  So when I came to Denver, I was ready to go into seventh grade, yes, and I thought that I would be going to an elementary school because you know, I had been in, the--they'd had the eight four system that the elementary went to eight grade and then you went to high school, like what they're doing again now.  I was put, I went to Morey Junior High School [Morey Middle School, Denver, Colorado], there were exactly five brown faces of us at Morey at that time and I'd never heard of junior high, I had a time adjusting, to going from class to class and different teachers, I wasn't accustomed to it.  But, I, I did all right except for one class in, then we called it social science then, it's called social studies now, I ran into another prejudice teacher, same thing with her, call on me and she thought I didn't know it and if I, so I pulled the same stunt on her but I al- she also one day said, "Any of you who are having problem, if you have any questions stay after school," well there were a number of 'em and I was one of 'em.  She called on everybody that was standing there one by one, I was the last one, time was up, she was, had to leave.  And that's when I really began pulling the stunt on her because I got so, I would listen to the children or I'd stay after school and I'd listen to their answers, I'd find it in a book, then I was ready.  But that was the only one that I ran into that I pre- I also got into my physical education there, into my sports.
Speaker 1: What led you to getting into sports at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess it goes back to the fact that I was always somewhat of a tomboy anyway.  As I was growing up, my poor mother [Sarah Garret Anderson] sometimes would get a little frustrated because this little darling little girl wasn't exactly being a little girl, climbed the trees, walked the fences, played baseball with the boys and spin tops, but I liked playing with dolls and doing things with the girls too.  But I was at, so here I'd found an outlet I'd never had before, a physical outlet I'd never had before and I was accepted, for me, not because of my color or no discrimination, no anything and that got me going with sports.
Story_ID: 572402
Speaker 1: So you, you mentioned when you were at Morey Junior High School [Morey Middle School, Denver, Colorado] that there were five other brown faces?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Why do you recollect that so, so quickly?  Wh--
Speaker 2: Well, because I had, I had been told that summer before I, we even got into Morey, that Morey was a, well, our school to by and large segregated because of where you lived.  So, this being a white area, there had, really had not been any black children there but somehow, somebody had put some pressure on and so no matter where you lived you could go to that school.  And then some of the children who lived kind of on the border could transfer in, so that was the reason there were just that few because most of them were all northeast.
Speaker 1: Do you know why your parents [Sarah Garret Anderson and Joseph Anderson] chose to live in a white neighborhood (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They--
Speaker 1: --as opposed to--
Speaker 2: --didn't choose.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father found a job as a janitor in this apartment house which gave us a place to live, co- cost-free and my, he and my mother did the work, that's how we happened to be in the white neighborhood.
Speaker 1: So what, can we just step outside of like your ex- like your f- and, and I mean just, can you tell me about the broader society of Denver [Colorado] at the time, 1928, when you were at--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --Morey high school, what was happening?
Speaker 2: As far as activities were concerned, we had to come over to the black area, the black churches, the, the parties, the social affairs, everything the Y [Young Men's Christian Association], that we had our own YMCA, there was our own YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association], and I mean they were completely black.  But, over, that was, that was, and I think everybody, just about everybody--black person in Denver knew everybody else because there weren't but about maybe twenty-five hundred of us, if that many.
Story_ID: 572403
Speaker 1: So continuing and we are starting to talk about the black community that existed in Denver [Colorado] in 1928.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were gonna start by telling me the main street that was the, well, first you said that there were twenty-five, about twenty-five hundred black people in Denver at the time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, maybe, I'm not sure.  There may not have been that many.  I know there weren't but just so many but they had their whole community out in the northeast part here and Welton Street, there's a section of Welton Street which is was one of the, the business streets to go through, they called it Five Points [Denver, Colorado] because there happened to be a s- there is a spot where five, there's a, an intersection of five different streets Welton goes through and that makes two, you know, and then 27th Street comes in there and then 26th Avenue [sic. 26th Street] comes in there and then I think it's Washington Street that comes in, but they're five and so, it's still called Five Points.  Yeah, I have a book over here with pictures and what not on that.
Speaker 1: And was Five Points considered the, the hub of the black community?
Speaker 2: And that was the center of the black business and they had everything.  We had drugstores with pharmacist and theater and the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] that I went to starting as a girl reserve and went on through until, well, I was at the YWCA for so long until after I married and it was there, the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] and YMCA had a real pool and it was kind of a center for all kinds of activities and it really was the center of--.  And then there were the black churches, Zion Baptist Church [Denver, Colorado] is, I think the very oldest, it's certainly the oldest Baptist church and my church, Shorter A.M.E. [Shorter Community A.M.E. Church, Denver, Colorado] was, well we're about to celebrate our 138th year and, then there were, there was a Presbyterian church, People's Presbyterian [People's Presbyterian Church, Denver, Colorado], and there were several Baptist churches and there were, we had I think, there were only two Methodist churches at that time, there are quite a number now.  And, those were the centers of activity and people's homes because now, the black people, some of them had some mighty nice homes, not elaborate like they are today because you know the economy wasn't such, but nice homes and, and they were so family oriented.  Families, I mean they, they, they'd really gotten stuck together and I know that all my social activities of course were over there even though I didn't live on that side of town.
Story_ID: 572404
Speaker 1: What did you do for social activities when you were a juni- when junior high [Morey Junior High School; Morey Middle School, Denver, Colorado] of 1928?
Speaker 2: Well, most of the time it were church activities, I belonged to a young people, the YPD [Young People's Division], you know and I made many friends there and we had a little girls organization called the, not the cheerleaders, oh Lord, but anyway, we would get together and our sponsor would take us to various places to, like going out to Fitzsimmons Hospital [Fitzsimons Army Hospital, Aurora, Colorado] to deal with the, the veterans, you know.  And, my, my activities were, my activities really were centered church and Y [Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA)], because I became a girl reserve and then me and my outdoor and, and physical activity, I loved camping and I became a camper, I continued as a camper, became a junior counselor, became a counselor, in one year I was even camp director and then I would have, we'd have parties you know at the YWCA and invite the boys to our parties and we would have activities at church, the YPD would and we would go to each other's homes for parties, we did a lot of things at ho- in homes you know, just going to each other's homes.
Story_ID: 572405
Speaker 1: So, do you remember going to the movie theaters ever?
Speaker 2: Oh boy.  How can I ever forget that?  There were only a few movies, movie theaters downtown that would permit us to start with and those that would permit had a little section of, not the whole balcony, a little section in the balcony where you could sit.  And I know that, I hadn't noticed this for some time until somebody told me that just to listen, you'll hear a little whistle, sure enough, we went to Denver Theatre [Denver, Colorado] and I, the, the, the Denver theater was one of the big theaters and we got our tickets just like everybody else and the minute we walked in the door, a little whistle blew way in the background and an usher was right there and made sure, escorted us upstairs and into one corner of the balcony and that's the way it was in every show that we, that we could enter.  Otherwi- I know I have been a few times when the smaller theaters, they would not permit me, my father [Joseph Anderson] could go in, and you know why?  You ever see his picture and with his accent, they didn't know who he was (laughter), he was brown but, but he could go in, but I couldn't.  And I will remember one incident, my best friend and I, Eleanor [Eleanor Hawkins Daniels], we di- did everything together just about, we went down to the Denver theater to a show, went to a matinee and there weren't very many people there, of course we were escorted up in the balc- there wasn't a soul up there but the two of us and we had to sit in that corner.  Well, the movie got started and I said to Eleanor, I said, "Heck there's nobody else up here, why don't we just move down there," and she said, "I don't know," you know.  But me and my nerve of a brass monkey, I said, "Come on," we went down and we'd just moved down in the front part, right in the center where we could see, no body up there but the two of us, and we'd been there about a half an hour, the usher came back up and let me tell you he told us we had to get back up.  And I said, "Why?"  I said, "There's nobody else up here but me."  "That's all right, you have to sit over there," and got right in front of us too and I, those were the days too, when I was still learning to control my temper and I, something said, Marie [HistoryMaker Marie Louise Greenwood] this isn't the time for it, nobody up here but, anything could happen and not a soul, so we moved up, I didn't enjoy the rest of the movie, I fussed and I steamed, poor Eleanor, she was so patient with me (laughter).  But, that was an experience I'll never forget.
Story_ID: 572406
Speaker 1: Until the Cosmopolitan Club [Cosmopolitan Club of Denver, Denver, Colorado] which I w- of which I was a member and I did go around with them several, a number of times breaking discrimination in the theaters and the restaurants.
Speaker 2: And what year was that?
Speaker 1: It was in the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 2: So very early (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was over a period, period of time.
Speaker 2: --but even before the major movement in the '60s [1960s], you were--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.  That's how we got, how we broke down the discrimination in restaurants, you could not, you could not go into, not even enter a restaurant downtown and you go into Woolworth [F.W. Woolworth Company], don't think you're gonna have anything at the counter, no way.  But, this, Cosmopolitan group was an interracial group, it was started by a black dentist that we had here, Dr. Clarence Holmes [Clarence Holmes, Jr.].  And this interracial group, there were about as many white people as there were black people in it, somehow, unearthed a long buried law that said, in Colorado, there was to be no, it didn't say black or anything, it just said no discrimination in public places.  They unearthed that law and then they began going around to the restaurants, they would be refused, the white people, if they were, they would say the white people can do, the black people that were in the group couldn't so, everybody'd go.  And they began using this law against these restaurants and the Restaurant Association [Colorado Restaurant Association, Denver, Colorado] had to, to abide by it and they had to pay so many fines that finally the Restaurant Association themselves said, you cannot belong to the association unless you cease to discriminate.  Of course, they found lots of different ways of doing it but then they that opened up our restaurants.  They did the same thing with the theaters and finally that was broken down.
Story_ID: 572407
Speaker 1: So, moving back to your personal journey, in 1930 or in, in, I'll just say '31 [1931], is when you actually graduate West Denver [West High School, Denver, Colorado]--
Speaker 2: High school.
Speaker 1: --High school.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: At this point, I mean I know there's a story and we'll get to the story about the advisor who'd given you the advice about what you could, could not become.  Had there, had there been anyone else inspiring you to become more than, than and, you know, to inspire you to become more than, than what you thought you could?
Speaker 2: My mother [Sarah Garret Anderson] and father [Joseph Anderson].  I mean, my father was bound and determined that I should know that there was absolutely nothing I could not achieve somehow and that he always made it very clear, I was as good as everybody else, regardless.  So, it just was a part of me, and my mother, the way my mother reacted, emphasized it, so between the two of them, I just grew up even in spite of discrimination and knowing I was being discriminated against and would be discriminated against, I never felt that I was inferior to anybody and I, as I grew older, into my teens, I made up my mind that if you can do it, I can do it and I can do it better.
Story_ID: 572408
Speaker 1: How did you come to teaching, to wanting to be a teacher? And this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When I was in, when I was in--
Speaker 1: --was before graduation (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --high school [West High School, Denver, Colorado], I was a senior in high school I guess I was a junior, when I started taking the, what was it?  The teacher training class at church [Shorter Community A.M.E. Church, Denver, Colorado], I wanted to, I, I just, I wanted to do that.  Well, when I finished the course, and when, then those of us, and the few that hung in long enough could go ahead and, and teach in Sunday school.  Well, they had, I wanted, for some children--some reason I just kind of wanted to deal with younger children, I hadn't made up my mind definitely, but I was placed in the nursery.  Now, at our church then, and, and back in those days, you know since we only had our black churches, you didn't belong to any white churches like they do now, our church was the, I guess the biggest, strongest church in Denver [Colorado] and our Sunday school had a nursery and there were about, there must have been eight or ten little kids that were under three years old, well under primary age, primary is five so they ran up to four, I guess, or take 'em two and a half to four.  And that was where I was assigned to teach.  I love those little children, I just loved them and I made up my mind then, that's what I wanted to do.  I wanted to teach little children, I wanted kindergarten and that's what headed me that way.  Now, my father [Joseph Anderson] wanted me to be a pharmacist, the reason for that was, he had a niece that had become a very successful pharmacist in Baton Rouge [Louisiana], and it she, he was her, her godfather and of course he saw this success as a pharmacist, now he didn't know his daughter had absolutely no interest whatsoever of going into business, or being in a, that kind of situation.  I wanted to be a teacher and that's what I stuck to, I clung to that.
Speaker 1: So you--
Speaker 2: But that's how I started.
Story_ID: 572409
Speaker 1: It's in your mind that you wanted to become a teacher, but then you decide, you speak with a school advisor, a girls advisor at the school about what's to become of you after high school?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  My first year in high school as a sophomore, I was at East Denver High School [East High School, Denver, Colorado].  In those days East Denver was lily-white, there again there were, I think there were five girls and two boys of us.  I was the only soph- brown sophomore in the whole big class, East Denver was the school of the wealthy, I mean they were the millionaire kids, they were the wealthy and any of us who happened to be there, just happened to be there to get an education; that was just much as we could do.  Well now, when I left Morey [Morey Junior High School; Morey Middle School, Denver, Colorado], when I finished Morey, I had, was bound and determined I was gonna be the best, 'cause they didn't even, would not even let me swim in the swimming pool when the girls asked for me that I was, they, the girls that I was doing sports with liked me so well and I was so good, wanted me to swim with them, no way.  But, that was another thing that made me say, okay, I'm gonna be the best.  So, when I went to, to East High School, I was in the upper 10 percent of the sophomore class, at study hall one day, I was told that the girls advisor wanted to see me and, of course the first thing I thought was, what the heck have I done now?  I walked in and she was busy and didn't look up at first and then she looked up and saw me and said, "Well what can I do for you?"  And I said, "Well, I was told you wanted to see me?"  She said, "What's your name?"  And I said, "I'm Marie Louise Anderson [HistoryMaker Marie Louise Greenwood]," and she said, "Oh yeah, we were calling in the sophomores from the upper 10 percent of the class to see what they were planning to do, we wanted to be sure they were taking courses for college," and I said, and she said, and I said, "Yeah, well I am going to college," and she said, "Why?"  I said "Because my father [Joseph Anderson] and my mother [Sarah Garret Anderson] have told me, I'm going to have an education, I'm not, they do not want me having to work the way they have to work," and I told her I wanted to be a teacher.  And she said, "Well, you're, there's no point in your going to college.  You'll just be wasting your father's money because all you'll be able to do is to work in somebody's hou- clean somebody's house or work in somebody's kitchen."  And in ninth grade, I had, had a class where we were told to list our, our first ten weaknesses, temper was my first one and I was just learning to c- and I could feel it coming up and something said, uh oh Marie, this is not the time to explode.  So, I just said, "I am going to college," and I walked out of the office.  And that's when I went to the girls room and pounded the walls and I cried and I, nobody was in there, thank goodness, 'cause I was, out loud, I am going to show 'em, I'm as good, no, I'm going to show 'em I'm even better.  And then I wiped and washed my face and went on back to, to study hall.  But you know?  As I look back at, as an adult, that was another one of the things that spurred me to excel and be the best.

Speaker 1: That was the thing that made me bound and determined I was going to find some way my folks [Sarah Garret Anderson and Joseph Anderson] had nothing, they couldn't afford to send me to college, I was determined I was going to have, I was going to find some kind of help.  And in those days they gave, we only had five high schools then and in those days they gave the first five seniors, the first five graduates in every school a state scholarship.  That scholarship--you can go to any state college or university on that scholar- and I would, that, I was determined I was going to get one but I had to be one of the first five to graduate.
Speaker 2: Did you get one?
Speaker 1: If I'd had stayed at East [East High School, Denver, Colorado], I would not have nothing, I could have nothing, but you know?  The Lord sets things up, for some unknown reason, for the first time, my dad [Joseph Anderson] felt he could afford to move into a house, we--we'd even move to another apartment where we'd been to several but, apartments where there were janitors.  And he had a friend who had a house for rent out on the west side a half a block from West High School [Denver, Colorado] and we moved into it and I moved into a school that was a 180 from East High School, the principal [Harry V. Kepner] made it very clear the first day in assembly, no discrimination.  He let everybody know they were there to get an education and he let every teacher know, they were there to see that we got an education and that it had absolutely nothing to do with your eth- with your ethnics, whether you were, whatever color you were, whatever religion you were, had nothing to do with it.  And then, I knew it took me, it took me a long time to go to the girls advisor though, there at West, I was afraid I'd be turned back again, but I was so determined to make it that I took the time and went in one day and she was the most pleasant person, she was--she wanted to know what she could do for me and I, I told her what I want, told her my name and what I wanted and she pulled out, she had, you, you know, she had the whole record of everybody and she pulled out the record and I wanted to know where did I stand and I was number seventeen, I think or something, it was fifteen or seventeen or something like that and she said now don't, this was my junior year and she said, "Don't worry, if it changes, it changes," and I went from there and that's how I happened to graduate number three and get a scholarship.
Story_ID: 572411
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nineteen thirty-one, 1931, you graduate West Denver--
Speaker 2: The West--West Denver High School [West High School, Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 1: --High School, third in your class?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, number three in a class of 257.
Speaker 1: And you at this, I--you, you receive a scholarship and you're armed to go to college?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You received--
Speaker 2: And it was--
Speaker 1: --a scholarship from them?
Speaker 2: --so strange because just a, not more than two weeks before I'd been to check and I had moved up to number seven and I was kin- I, I really felt bad, it was per- senior year, spring of senior year, you know?  And I had, was seven but I was two short of being able to--and this, the advisor still said, "Don't worry because there'd be some fallout or dropout, other grades may change."  But the thing of it is, about two weeks later, I did not, we didn't know this was going to, I didn't know it was happening.  There was a special assembly and it was an honors assembly and I was in National Honors [National Honor Society] so of course, the National Honors seniors were up on the stage and when they got to the part of the program where they were giving out the scholarships, number one was Nora Bates [ph.], I remember she was president of the class and number two was the vice president of the class, Serian Saint John [ph.] and I just, I remember hearing that and then nothing, I just was devastated 'cause all I could think of was, I'm number seven, that's all I could remember, and the girl next me went, "Marie [HistoryMaker Marie Louise Greenwood], Marie, they're calling your name," I hadn't heard a thing, I, I'd even closed my eyes, I just didn't hear, "They're calling your name," and I, and I heard Marie Louise Anderson, number three, and they went on with you know, my credentials and so forth.  I just couldn't believe it.
Speaker 1: Well, what happened when you got home with that news to (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ooohh, my goodness.  Well, I actually cried when I got it and when I got home and told my folks [Sarah Garret Anderson and Joseph Anderson] they were, well my, the--didn't, they just could hardly believe it, they were just proud, you know, they were thrilled to death.  But they weren't nearly as thrilled as I was, because the first thing I th- that went through my mind was I'm going to college, that was it.  And so then they began figuring how they could, what they could do to help and they decided well, they're gonna have to, we're gonna have to, know they had, they had thought of this even before, they had moved out of the house, that's right.  At the end of my junior year, it was the first part of my senior year when we were, I didn't even know that I was gonna make it.  But they were determined I was gonna get to college somehow, they went back into janitors in an apartment so that they could have enough money to at least help me in college and when I told them, they were thrilled.  But, it still was gonna cost because that scholarship covered only a tuition and do you know what tuition was then?  Fifteen dollars a quarter, it's on the quarter system.  But you see that was the middle of the Depression [Great Depression], it could have been fifteen hundred dollars in today's, but that fifteen dollars was the biggest help you could ever think of.
Story_ID: 572412
Speaker 1: But they had to get the money for my room and board, I could not live on campus, no way, oh no, no brown faces in the dorms.  But the girls, there were a number of girls going to, up there in Greeley [Colorado], and they had a big house and they paid a room mother and I think it, I think it cost us fifty dollars a month, at fifty dollars, my folks [Sarah Garret Anderson and Joseph Anderson] could have been five hundred dollars a month, but they managed to come up with it.  And we ran the house, well we, it was a number of blocks from school, but that's where we lived because we could not live on campus.  You could not join any organization, all you could do was go to school and get an education.  You did get a good education, and of course when I entered as a freshman, we had a freshman exam, it was a three day exam, boy I mean they checked you on everything in the, under the sun.  And I came up in the first quart- the first, the, the top third of the, of my test so, I didn't have to take a lot of things and I was put in a number of advanced courses, but that was the way I, I got, got going and lived in this hou- well th- living in this house with these young women though, was wonderful for me because being an only child, the only time I had actually lived with others was the summer when I'd be at camp, you know?  But that wasn't exactly the same as, actually living day by day and helping the plan and helping to do things, and I will always say, I learned more from those girls then I could ever have learned out of books, learned how to live with people and how to deal with people and boy, I'm telling you, it was, it, it was an education right there.  So, it really did me a lot of good, fortunately my room, my best friend was also there.  See we, well we did so many things, we had met in junior high [Morey Junior High School; Morey Middle School, Denver, Colorado], we were friends for sixty-seven years before she died.
Speaker 2: So, I, I'll, we had two minutes left on this tape, but I'll ask you.  At that time, when you were, once you get into college, and you, you can't stay on campus or, you know, in the dorms, are you thinking to yourself, when will this end?  Or, I should do something to change this?  What are your, what is your attitude towards what the university's attitude is towards its brown skinned students?
Speaker 1: Well, the first thing, I discovered that Mr. Kepner [Harry V. Kepner] who was the principal of my West High School [Denver, Colorado].  We always knew him as Mr. Kepner, he was Dr. Kepner and he was president of the board of directors (laughter) at Colorado Teachers College [Colorado State Teachers College; University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, Colorado], that's what it was called then, yeah.  And I thought and thought to myself, it's too bad the college couldn't be run the way he was running West High School.  That was one thing, the other thing was, I did not, it never dawned on me to try to change things, I was just too busy making it myself and I was determined I was going to get everything I could education wise and that I was going to be me and I was going to prove that I, as, an American Negro, could do what everybody else did.
Story_ID: 572413
Speaker 1: Okay so continuing.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were determined not to have the university [Colorado State Teachers College; University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, Colorado] prevent you from becoming what you were, were setting out to become.  What I'm also interested in is how is AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] the sorority allowed to exist on campus when you, or how were you allowed to participate in that when there, you were, you know, know other organizations or there was nothing else on campus for you?  How did AKA exist at the university in college (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) AKA did not exist on campus as such.  For some reason they were not recognized particularly and, but it was not actually a sorority there; it was a Denver [Colorado] sorority.  You see, there were so few of us in Colorado that no matter what school you went to, you could belong to AKA.  It was a Denver, it was, it was actually organized with a group of women out there in Greeley [Colorado], but it was a Denver, the, a sorority and it was known as a city sorority, so that we could get people.  It just happened that the majority of the, of the girls being in one place was up there because so many were up there for teacher training.
Speaker 1: It's 1932, what makes you decide to become, to pledge AKA?
Speaker 2: Oh, my, my best friend [Eleanor Hawkins Daniels] had become an AKA the year before, the year before I got there, she was two years ahead of me you see.  And so, of course she submitted my name.  To tell the truth, it was the only sorority I knew anything about, in fact, I didn't know anything about sororities.  But, knowing the, the young women and I did know some of them that had graduated that had been, that had organized the group, they were older and gone on, but I did know them or knew of them and then I also knew there were still a few of them who were still in school there and we were all in the same house.
Story_ID: 572414
Speaker 1: To tie something in, you were an early, an ear- in your early childhood, you were a tomboy--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and early teen years you were very athletic, by the time you get to the university [Colorado State Teachers College; University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, Colorado] or to college, where, how does sports fit into your life?
Speaker 2: I've, I was determined to find them.  So I went on into the phys ed [physical education] department, because to tell the truth, that was where I really wanted to major but, if I majored phys ed, I'd have to teach older children and I wasn't about to do that.  So therefore, I made physical education my, just my outlet, let's say, but I not only took the, the, the, the sports classes, I took the theory classes too.  I just was interested and loved it and then I de- that was how I discovered that the sports that they had, the extracurricular sports and I got to know and going to these classes, I got to know some of the girls and I began asking them and they sa- they got to know me through the phys ed classes, so they got me started in the, the extracurricular sports and I was thrilled to death.  I practically lived in the phys ed department when I wasn't taking other classes (laughter).  And I, I got so entrenched in the sports that, and this was one place this wasn't a bit at Morey [Morey Junior High School; Morey Middle School, Denver, Colorado] and at West [West High School, Denver, Colorado], I was accepted, I was accepted as a person, I was not accepted for any color, anything, I was accepted for what I could do and it, it gave me a, I learned how it would feel to be equal right there.  I'd leave that phys ed department and get a rest of the campus and I was the brown face but there, I was just me.
Story_ID: 572415
Speaker 1: Were you thinking about your life beyond college at this time?  Were you thinking about where you were going to teach?  Were you going to have to leave Colorado to teach?  Were you going to teach black students or white students?
Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't start worrying about that until I was a senior (laughter), up until that point, it was just get all the education I could get and you see, I really over extended, but I kept my average up.  I ga- I'd wound up with a GPA [grade point average] of, it must have been a B plus, I don't think it was A minus but a B plus.  And I had taken all along, until my senior year [at Colorado State Teachers College; University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, Colorado], I had taken anywhere from seventeen to twenty hours a quarter, I only took twenty hours one quarter though, that one nearly killed me, and I still came out with an A minus.  But most of my, most of my quarters were either seventeen, eighteen, or nineteen quarter hours because I was determined I was gonna learn everything I could, not only the requirements for my kindergarten and primary major and my, but I wound up with the forty-two hour m- minor in phys ed [physical education], a twenty hour minor in art, which I loved, a sixteen hour minor in science and then I took some little extras like storytelling and music appreciation and I, I just w- I'd, I'd felt this was my opportunity to learn everything I could because I may not get back to it again.  Never di- and it never crossed my mind until my senior year to begin to worry about where, (laughter) what I might do about a job.
Story_ID: 572416
Speaker 1: Well, when you come to graduate [from Colorado State Teachers College; University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, Colorado] in the spring of '35, [1935], who was the minister that encouraged you to take the teachers exam?
Speaker 2: Reverend Russell S. Brown [Russell S. Brown, Sr.] was the minister at that time and he and his daughter, I'd, his daughter and I and, well we were all kind of together there in church and then there was another, Mr. William Parks, who was quite a community leader and he was qu- he was a, one of the pillars of Shorter [Shorter Community A.M.E. Church, Denver, Colorado] and they knew my record from my high school [West High School, Denver, Colorado] and they knew that I really, I must have carried, been carrying on right on through at college.  So, that, that was who encouraged me.  Mr. Parks got a, talked to first, called me there my senior year and asked me, told me that they finally, that Lila O'Boyle [Lila M. O'Boyle] finally had said, "I will take a colored teacher."  See, the community for years had been trying to get the school board to hire because they had these girls, these women were graduating all the time, usually from Greeley [Colorado] as teacher for--and, and really had Greeley's school of education was rated number three in the country, the one in Chicago [Illinois], was first, one in California was second and Greeley was third and that's why students came from everywhere.  Many of the girls in our house came from Kansas and I had to think about it, it was a tough decision to make.  Now this was in 1934, the middle of the Depression [Great Depression], my folks [Sarah Garret Anderson and Joseph Anderson] were working like everything, my mother's health was going down because of that hard work because all day she, all day until the weekend she had to do all the work at that apartment because my dad was also working, they were doing all this to ke- help to keep me in college.  My dad was also what they ha- called the janitors, they called them custodians down at the, the exclusive Daniels Fisher Store [Daniels and Fisher Company, Denver, Colorado].  So he was gone all day and so he was only there for night and weekend and I had to make this decision, whether I could go ahead and take the test, I had one more year to get my degree.  Now at that time, two years in an accredited teachers college, you had a, you, you earned a certificate to teach in Colorado for life, that was kind of a throwback to the old days with two years in a normal school, you know?  But, I already had that, I already had, had earned that, but I wanted my degree, so I said no, and it would, you don't know, and it was tough.  Well, they did hire, and I have a picture of the two of us, they did hire another teacher.  Now this teacher had graduated, I don't know how old she was, she'd been out a long time, had been teaching in Texas and Oklahoma and everywhere, but her mother and dad were getting old and they needed her to come back to help and she wanted to get back so they hired her and, but I discovered later that she was not put on contract, she was hired on, on a permanent substitute.
Story_ID: 572417
Speaker 1: You left off with, they had hired one other teacher because you decided that you really wanted to get your degree.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And they did hire this other teacher and I thought she was hired at contract but, she was hired as a par- permanent substitute, she was given her contract a few months later, I think, three or four months later, but in spring of 1935, when I was let's see near enrolling in, to get my degree, Mr. Parks [William Parks] and Reverend Brown [Russell S. Brown, Sr.] got on me again, "Go down and take the test."  Well, I figured I don't have anything to lose and Lord knows I, I had no way of sending for any application.  We had no money, nothing, I was just lucky I was getting my degree, and so, I figured, okay, I'll go down and take it.  Now in those days the test, the testing took all day, you took, half of the day was oral, oral written, the other, there'd be, and they split them in half, half of tho- those can, th- those who were applying would take the written in the morning and interviews in the afternoon and then we'd switch, well I was on the written one in the morning, well, that was no problem, and the afternoon, I had an interview with one of the board members, Mr. Palmer, and I was glad I got Mr. Palmer and not Mr. Puffer [Rodney A. Puffer], Mr. Puffer was a, but Mr. Palmer was kind of jolly little old red faced bald headed man and he was a, we, we just hit it off real well but he challenged me of course, and he sa- one of the challenges was, "Why wouldn't you, wouldn't you like to teach in junior or senior high schools, secondary?"  There were do--there were, they're double salaries in those days, secondary teachers got more pay, more pay than the elementary school and I told him no and the thing of it is you get, you ask me a question and get me started, you gonna get an answer and you're gonna get the answer that, that's me.  And for, cou- never, just, I just forgot I was talking to a board member, I said, no.  Now first place he knew I couldn't anyway, there wasn't but one place I could teach, Whittier School [Whittier Elementary School; Whittier ECE-8 School, Denver, Colorado], and he knew that cause that's the only school with, would open and w- had, had hired this one black teacher in, in, in '34 [1934], all right.  But, I said, no.  I said that I, I'd definitely only wanted to teach small children and he wanted to know why, and he said, "You know, you'll get much better pay."  And I said, "But I wanna teach small children," I said now that's where you lay the foundation, it's like building a house, if you don't build a good sound foundation, you build a house on it, it isn't gonna hold up.  I said, first grade, not first grade, primary, 'cause I hadn't been assigned either, mine was kindergarten, first or second grade.  Primary grades is where the foundation is laid, I said now, if down in the elementary school, we don't lay that foundation, and those teachers up in secondary haven't anything to build on.  And then it dawned on me, oh Lord today.  (Laughter) Because I'd got off just like that, you know?  'Cause he didn't say anything and I thought, oh I blew that one.  And he broke into a grin, he said, "You know I am with you," and it was th- it made me feel good, but I still didn't think I was gonna get anything because they had hired one teacher and I thought that was it.
Story_ID: 572418
Speaker 1: That was the way I got started and when I graduated [from Colorado State Teachers College; University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, Colorado], naturally I graduated in the upper part of the class, and I was, this was the, oh I'd only grad- been graduated about a week and I was devastated, I couldn't send, I didn't have enough money to buy stationery, stamps were three cents and I didn't have enough money to buy three cent stamp to try to send out for the, the, the possibility of teaching somewhere and I had just given up on, on Denver [Colorado] because I was sure that that one, that one had, when I turned it down in '34 [1934], that was the end of my chances.  And do you know, it, I was sitting--it'd only been a week or so, that the mail came and I would just, I didn't know what I was gonna do, and here was a letter from Denver Public Schools and you know?  I was scared to open it.  I was almost sure it would say, you know, the rejection.  And finally, I sat and I waited and I waited, then I decided I'd better open it and it was just what you saw in my, there, that letter telling me that the Board of Education [Denver Board of Education] had, was offering me the job in 1935, as a teacher in the Denver Public Schools and I had my little pink card that was my contract to--it was actually making me, it wasn't a permanent substitute, actually making me, giving me a contract to be a probationary teacher in the Denver Public Schools with the fabulous salary of twelve hundred dollars a year.  I just, well, I let out a yell, I started to cry, my poor mother [Sarah Garret Anderson] came rushing through the kitchen to see what was going on and all I could tell her, I am going to be a teacher in the Denver Public Schools.  And now, I had vowed, when I got a job, didn't know where I was gonna get it, but no matter what, my folks were gonna be taken out of that little old basement, my mother was not gonna work again unless she just wanted to work.  I immediately, I hadn't, didn't even have the job yet, I immediately started hunting for a house to rent, I found a house to rent, we moved into it, my dad [Joseph Anderson] and, well continued as the janitor down at the Daniels and Fisher [Daniels and Fisher Company, Denver, Colorado], and we sha- I said we would share expenses and I got my folks out and into a house and my mother didn't have to do anything unless she wanted too.  Of course, my mother did find odd jobs that she liked to do but that was up to her and I was assigned, of course to Whittier School [Whittier Elementary School; Whittier ECE-8 School, Denver, Colorado], a first grade.  I wanted kindergarten at first, but you know, I'm awful glad I was put in the first grade.  I got into that first grade and it became mine for fi- thirty years, I wasn't always at Whittier, I was on, I only actually taught in two, two schools, that was, and but I also made up my mind that I had to keep my job in the middle of the Depression [Great Depression], a one hundred dollars a month, that was a lot of money, you just don't know how, how things were like back there in that big depression.  A hundred dollars a month was just like manna from heaven.
Story_ID: 572419
Speaker 1: And the other thing was I had to keep that door open, this other teacher did not make it.
Speaker 2: Oh she didn't?
Speaker 1: (Shakes head) She was still there [Whittier Elementary School; Whittier ECE-8 School, Denver, Colorado], and she was supposed to go off of, go under tenure, and, and off of probation a year before me, because she was ahead of me, but then that had pushed her up further since she didn't get her contract until months later and she was such a haughty soul, and she was so taken, I don't know if she'd never done anything, you know, with white people I guess, because our teaching had been in the southern states, and she was back and she was just, look who I am.  Now the principal Lila O'Boyle [Lila M. O'Boyle] purposefully put me, my room down next to hers, I'm sure she felt that Dorothy [ph.] was gonna help me, 'cause here I was green, there's another part of my story, I had an A in student teaching, I had never taught a class at all, because of my color, I was not permitted to teach those white kids and, and that's all there were in the training school.  I dro- I wrote lesson plans and my lesson plans were top and I'd watched somebody else teach them.  Now here, and, and, and I was, I was observing in a kindergarten in the training school and they were nearly all professors' children no and they would not accept a child with an I.Q. under 100, every I.Q. was a 100 and above.  It was limited at twenty-five, and they were taught, you know, this soft voice and this, that's all I knew.  Public school, come on?  I had thirty kids, I.Q. from 67 to 110, in a room, a little room the s- the desk were all scr- old fashioned desk screwed to the floor?  And I thought I could teach with that soft voice, oh brother unh-uh.
Speaker 2: What type of a teacher were you?
Speaker 1: The first few, I'd say, the first couple weeks or so, I thought that I was the most failure in the world, I could not get those kids quiet, I would try to teach and there was bedlam, and one day the principal walked into the room and the noise almost blew her right back out the door.  I didn't know what to do with them because I, all I'd been taught, this is the way you teach, with the soft voice and the, and I never, she looked at me and the kids were so, oh, they were just raising sand and she said, "Miss Anderson [HistoryMaker Marie Louise Greenwood], I wanna see you before you leave."  And the first thing I thought, oh, oh, there goes my job, and when I walked into the office after school, she said, "Miss Anderson, you've got to get control," she said, "you get control, then you can teach them."  And then I explained to her, what my experience had been, and she looked at me and said, "Just forget the theory, get control, then you can teach.  Do whatever it takes, you get control," and I looked, I said, "Whatever it takes?"  She said, "Yes, whatever it takes."  That was on a Friday, I'll rem- I remember this, I went home, had the weekend to think about it and, I really had reached the stage where I felt for the first time in my life, I was a failure.  I was just devastated and I hated to go to school it was so bad.  So that, I, I kept go- going through my mind, she said, whatever it takes.  Well, I can remember, this will (unclear), my mother [Sarah Garret Anderson] used on me, and since she said whatever it takes, I figured, uh-hm, that's it, come Monday, let me tell you, I did what she said, don't worry about teaching.  I lit into those kids and I made it very clear, that it was gonna be quiet, they were gonna listen, they were gonna get the work done and if they didn't there was going to be trouble.  I don't think I taught very much that day, but by the second day, I had a nice calm class and I began to teach and from then on.

Speaker 1: Were you allowed to teach white students?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) If there'd been any in the school.  There were a, a sprinkling here and there, you'd see a white child in a class but it was all over in the, the black neighborhood.  And that's why they had been trying to get the board [Denver Board of Education] to get black teachers in there because, but they had, they just wouldn't and all the teachers in the school were white but me.
Speaker 1: So you were the only black teacher, plus the black students, and then all of the other teachers were white?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well me and, and Dorothy [ph.]--
Speaker 1: And Dorothy.
Speaker 2: --until Dorothy didn't make it, then I was, I was left to keep that door open for others to come in because, there after she was eliminated, I was the only one.
Speaker 1: How did the, how did the black parents feel about having a black teacher (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now that was the--
Speaker 1: --for the first time?
Speaker 2: It was interesting.  The black parents seemed (unclear), thrilled to death, they were really happy to have, but they weren't too sure they wanted their children to be taught by a black teacher.  They were glad to see a black teacher at the school, but at least this was, this was what I got, I don't know what happened to Dorothy ahead of me.  But they weren't th- at least the upper class, you know?  We colored people had a class, had classes and the upper class were the so called, society light skinned and they weren't too sure they wanted their children taught with a black teacher, well the rest of them the kids were there.  But you know, it wasn't, I would say it wasn't six months before I had those same people asking to have their children put in my class.  Because the word was getting out as to what I was doing with those first graders at Whittier [Whittier Elementary School; Whittier ECE-8 School, Denver, Colorado] that had never been done before.  Those kids were learning and were happy and I was happy (laughter).
Speaker 1: So what was happening with your, in your, your personal life at the time?  You were at the school, you'd been given, you'd been put on probation for three years I'm told?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's a th- there's a three year probationary period for beginning teachers and then you, and then if you make it through, that means each year, your contract has to be renewed for three years, and at the end of that three years, you are given a permanent contract.
Speaker 1: But they wouldn't hire another black teacher until you completed your three years (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Shakes head) 'Til they made sure that I made tenure.
Story_ID: 572421
Speaker 1: What was happening in your personal life at the time?  Had you met your husband?
Speaker 2: I was having a great time.  No, the story about me and my husband is a whole another story that nobody's ever experienced.  I was having a great time, I was going to Boules [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity], and I was going to concerts and I was going to parties and I was, I was just having a good time and traveling all over everywhere.  Yeah, I was footloose and fancy free.
Speaker 1: But you met your husband in 19-?  What is it, 1943, '50 [1950]?
Speaker 2: That's when we married.
Speaker 1: That's when you married.  Well, when did you meet him?
Speaker 2: It wasn't a case of my meeting my husband, I knew my husband when he was a little boy, and we knew the family, his family and my folks [Sarah Garret Anderson and Joseph Anderson] knew each other, you know?  And he was about fifth grade and I was in high school [West High School, Denver, Colorado] and the year that he finished sixth grade, I went to junior high school--I graduated from high school and went to college [Colorado State Teachers College; University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, Colorado].  Bill [Bill Greenwood, Sr.] was the last person in all this wide world and I, he was just a little kid that I used to tease and he'd pass the house sometimes, I'd say, "Hi Billy, how ya doing," and he'd have his little dog with him you know, and I was high school and here he was in, in grade school and he, he would usually say, "Fine," he would never stop, and I'd say, "How are your mother and your grandma?"  And by that time he'd be way down the street you know?  And I'd tease him whenever I'd see him, but he was just a kid and, and then when I graduated from college and was teaching, I'd been teaching two years when he graduated from high school, and his mother called me and said that, wanted me to, they wanted to bring him over he'd, because he was graduating from high school and he wanted to go to Colorado university [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado], but he didn't know what he wanted and wanted some advice and wondered if maybe I could help Billy.  Now, I had only seen the boy once and he'd grown up, he was in high school and I'd just saw him at church one day, he was over at our church [Shorter Community A.M.E. Church, Denver, Colorado], they were going to our church at that time and I had no idea what he was like, even what he was interested in, so they brought him over, I said all right, and they brought him over and, and I talked with him and he'd said well, he'd like to go into pharmacy because he had, he was working as a, he was working at a drugstore. I think he was a delivery boy or something and when he--
Story_ID: 572422
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, you, you meet and you were telling me the story he--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --comes over--
Speaker 2: Um-hm and he came over.  So, he did enroll at CU [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado] and he re- decided he wanted to go into pharmacy or so and he was, I, I was a good friend of, oh one of the fellows that was up there and his girlfriend and I were at, and of course, being a teacher, and I had a car and for football games of course, I'd take her up to see him and he had got the, they were working, I remember the, the black boys were working in the Chi Psi [Chi Psi Fraternity] house, a white fraternity and he got a place for Bill [Bill Greenwood, Sr.].  So, and when he wanted me to come out, I'd say, ah but I'm all by myself and my boyfriend was a student at Greeley [Colorado State Teachers College; University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, Colorado] and so, Gilbert [ph.] said, "Ah that's all right we got, I, I'll get Billy," and I laughed, I said, "Billy's just a kid," he said, "That's all right he's harmless."  So, I, I found out I had more fun with that kid at football games and that was as far as I was concerned, you know?  But, as time went on, I got so, I was, well as time went on, my peers, men, were married, 'cause I had turned down three proposals, you know, I was gonna get my education and do my teaching so that took care of that which meant I didn't have too many to date from but I could always call on Billy, you know?  We could go and have fun, boy could he dance, I just loved it and then, I broke up with my boyfriend in 1940, and his brother happened to ask me, I don't know how this happened, asked me if I'd like to go to California with him, she and her mother, Bill's grandmother and Bill, Bill had just turned twenty-one then and I had been teaching for, what?  Five years, I was about twenty-eight, almost twenty-nine, at twenty-eight, I was almost twenty-eight, yeah.  And so, I said, I felt ah, it'll be a good way for me to get out of town, you know?  So, we got on the road, went back to, that was quite an experience, we went back there but the thing I learned was that Billy and I could have some fun.  As far as I was concerned, he was like my, he was a good friend, just like my friend Eleanor [Eleanor Hawkins Daniels] was, you know?  That we could do things together, just have fun and so, on this trip we just had a great time and after we came back, that was in 1940, I would, if I didn't have a date for something, I would call Billy, he'd be ready to go, you know.
Story_ID: 572423
Speaker 1: And as time went on we got thrown together for so many things, and his mother had told me, that even as a little boy, he'd watched for me to go by, I had to pass her house going to, during my junior and senior year in high school [West High School, Denver, Colorado] and here he was in grade school, said he would watch for me to go by and he'd would tell his mother, "That's my girl."  She told me that, and I began to think after a while, here I was only going on thirty years old, and I wanted a family and I, there're no prospects, and I got to thinking now, Bill [Bill Greenwood, Sr.] and I sure, oh and he would call me all the time, he had a problem, he'd call me and we'd work it out you know?  And he was making his way up, of course, I, I can't get into that 'cause that's another story about how he started at the bottom and worked himself all the way to the top at that Lowry [Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado].  But anyway, he would call me anytime he had a problem or just would call me for the f- heck of it, he couldn't really talk with his mother and grandmother.  So, I began to think now, look time is moving on, and to tell the truth, I didn't love the boy, but I sure did like him 'cause he was, we were just good fr- such good friends.  And so, one night, you know, we had been out to s- oh we'd go to all kinds of parties together and one night we were coming from a show or something and he was very quiet, in which he seldom was, 'cause we gabbed all the time and I said, "What's on your mind?"  And he said, "Well I was just thinking, wondering what you'd say if I asked you to marry me?"  And I said, "Well if you'd ask me, I'd say yes."  And he, he really went dead silent then, and I thought well, you blew that one, we became engaged and do you know, 'til this day, I'll always, and we had forty years of the greatest marriage and these four kids that we, anybody could ever have had.  And he just kept moving up and he would, he kept telling people, I'd found out they'd tell me that he kept telling 'em, they'd ask him, they would ask him how he got up to where he was?  And he'd say, "Oh I use, I use Marie's [HistoryMaker Marie Louise Greenwood] method, just because of my wife."  (Laughter) And so that episode, I have always said, as I look back, if you ever had a marriage that was made in heaven, ours was planned.  Because, why in the world would I get put with this young kid, he was twenty-three when we married and I was thirty.  When he was killed, he was sixty-three and I was seventy, and that was twenty-three years ago so.
Speaker 2: That's a wonderful story.
Story_ID: 572424
Speaker 1: At the point that you actually marry and you decide to leave school [Whittier Elementary School; Whittier ECE-8 School, Denver, Colorado] for a while to start your family, you do that.  But you come back to the school in 1953--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --as a substitute teacher, but you're at a new school and what's significant is that you segregate, you help to segregate this or desegregate the school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We had built our home in Oakfield [ph.], out on West 6th Avenue, and two blocks over the way, Newlon School [Jesse H. Newlon Elementary School, Denver, Colorado] was being built and I decided to go back and substitute, I didn't want to go, pick and go on contract, because my children were little and I wanted to be free, my mother [Sarah Garret Anderson] would just love coming up to be with her only grandchildren, but, you know if they were sick or they needed me, I wanted to be free to do.  All right, my daughter [Louise Greenwood] had entered Newlon as a first grader and when they first opened I had, asked a tea- the principal who remembered me from my early days of teaching and she would just welcome me you know?  And, and I asked her if there was going to be a preschool because my son Richard [Richard Greenwood] was three years old and I wanted him to have preschool and she said well, she hadn't thought about preschool unless, unless, because it was such a new school but, it was growing up so out there and most of the families were, had young children, so she said she would check and find out.  And there were enough, that would be happy to have a pre-school and she said now, "Miss Ande- Mrs. Greenwood [HistoryMaker Marie Louise Greenwood], if you, if you want to, if you will be in charge, I'll be happy to have you."  The only brown face in the whole community out there, me and my little kids, the only brown faces in the school, everybody else white.  All right, we had the preschool.  I would take these parents and she got her, professional teacher, you know, to teach the kids and I, the, those mothers and I bounded like you wouldn't believe and I of course was the oldest and the more experienced, I would take them out the auditorium and talk and we would have all kinds of discussions about kids and what not.  All right, I--and then I, then I organized and was, was elected president of the PTA [Parent Teacher Association], all-white and I still was being called to the Northeast Denver to teach.  But, as soon new, as Miss Biddick [Mildred Biddick], the principal found out I was teaching, I was substituting?  She called for me, there had never been a black teacher out, sent outside of Northeast Denver, not even to substitute, they were all there.  The administration said we wouldn't adjust in the white school, the teachers would not accept us and the parents would object.  Now here I have a principal, asking for me to come to substitute?  On double session yet, which meant I had to teach part of my time with another teacher.
Story_ID: 572425
Speaker 1: The teachers [at Jesse H. Newlon Elementary School, Denver, Colorado] accepted me as a, just another substitute and after I had been out so often, the teachers began to ask for me.  Now they had said teachers wouldn't accept us, they began to ask for me because that class, when they came back, that class was just like they left it, it was controlled.  I had a kindergartener for so long once, that it was just mine and guess what?  One day the principal said she wanted me to come to faculty meetings (laughter) and I said, "But I'm just a substitute teacher," she said, "That's all right, you are one of our regular teachers, you were here for so long."  And then in 1955, I walked in there to substitute and the principal met me, and she said, "Mrs. Greenwood [HistoryMaker Marie Louise Greenwood], the PTA [Parent Teacher Association] mothers have been asking me, why you don't teach here all the time?  They, they love the way you teach your children."  I said, "The mothers asked for me?"  Yes, she had an opening coming up that fall in second grade and I said, ah, I don't know, I hadn't planned to go back regularly, but I'd see what my mother [Sarah Garret Anderson] have to say and I'd said, "I'm not sure I want a second grade regular anyway, I'd rather have first."  She said, "But I have a first grade coming up too and I, I've already talked to the, the teacher's double session," and she said, "She'll be glad to share the room with you because she knows you."  And I went, I was hired, back into contract, I was almost forty years old, was gonna turn forty in but, November, and I said, I wasn't sure they'd put me back on contract, I'd been out ten years.  Well, that interview was a really interesting one, because I had, Miss Biddick [Mildred Biddick] had, had it all setup and let me tell you, I was hired back on contract yet.  In 1955, the only, the first black teacher to be placed in a school anywhere outside of Northeast Denver, Mr. Bennett [ph.] the superintendent in charge of elementary schools would call every week about Friday, "How's Mrs. Greenwood getting on?"  Well, after a few times, Miss Biddick told me and we had a running joke, and she'd say, "Mr. Bennett called today and I, he wanted to know how you, how Mrs. Greenwood was doing, and I'd say, 'Mrs. Greenwood's just fine, she's one of my best teachers.'"  By spring he quit calling.  But, what I did, I proved that a dedicated teacher comes in all colors.  The next year, what did they do?  Took two of our best teachers, put them out in two of the big white schools and they were, they were complimented for their teaching and from then on and so, I did, that was my second thing that I did and that was to prove, to get the school integrated, but they tried to get me into administration then, coordinator?  No way, first black principal?  Forget it.  And I let everybody know I love my first grade, I don't wanna do any or have anything to do with anyone over eight years old and I stayed there.  Now that's why I am so flabbergasted at having a school [Marie L. Greenwood Academy, Denver, Colorado] named for me, schools are named for administrators, but it's my pioneering that did it.
Story_ID: 572426
Speaker 1: So, you're one of the first teachers also, to have a school named for her.
Speaker 2: I'm the second, Jessie Maxwell [Jessie Whaley Maxwell], whom I'd told you I had helped to get going?
Speaker 1: But she was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She--
Speaker 1: --principal?
Speaker 2: --became the first black principal.  I was thrilled, I was substituting at that time and I was thrilled to death.  She was just, oh, she was a great principal.
Speaker 1: Well, when did they dedicate the school [Marie L. Greenwood Academy, Denver, Colorado] to you?  What year and how did it come about?
Speaker 2: Two thousand one [2001].
Speaker 1: Two thousand one [2001].  You retired in?
Speaker 2: I retired in--
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy [1970]?
Speaker 2: Seventy-four [1974].
Speaker 1: Seventy-four [1974]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But then you decided to go back to school and you implemented a reading program?  And now briefly, tell me about just going to school to read?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I, for twelve years I did a reading, through the Read Aloud Program at the Denver Public Library, and I would go to, I was the only one in the program that read to six classes a week, six groups a week.  Most of there were one or two, but I did six, on Tuesday, I would go to Head Start and then I'd go across the street, I would do a head cr- then I'd go across the street, my church [Shorter Community A.M.E. Church, Denver, Colorado] is right across the street and they had, had a nur- a school, a preschool there, well it was a, it was a daycare center really, but they really were doing some of this and that's where that book I told you about that came from.  But, I'd go across there and at that time, they had so many children that they were divided into two groupings, at least I had them divided into two groups, 'cause I didn't, they had two and a half year up to five, I had them divide, but I'd go over and read to the two groups there, that was three young, three groups on Tuesday, Thursdays I would go to Park Hill Elementary School [Denver, Colorado], I would read to ECE [early childhood education] and then I'd read to each of the two kindergartens and I did that for, until, well I did that until, it just got to be a little too much and then I began cutting back and I, I finally dropped the school, Park Hill, and I was just going to my church for, I left, I kept that going until the very end and then, they, they, they had to close out the school and I quit reading there.  But, you see in the meantime, I got the, my school, so now, I go every two months and spend all day long reading to kids.
Story_ID: 572427
Speaker 1: Just tell me how it came about?  How did the, how did you get the word that they were planning on naming a school [Marie L. Greenwood Academy, Denver, Colorado] after you?  The dedication itself, what did happen?
Speaker 2: Well, we have a man named John Smith [ph.] here, that he was the one who got Jessie Maxwell's school [Jessie Whaley Maxwell Elementary School, Denver, Colorado] going, he is big, he was a teacher in the public schools until he retired and he is still going like wild fire on education.  After the, in 1995, after they interviewed me reading to the ECE [early childhood education], and did this great big spread that, then things began to move and he began checking into what I had done and came up with everything that I told you about, what I had done as, as a trailblazer.  Oh yeah, and the University of Northern Colorado [Greeley, Colorado], which at the time that I was there it was the teachers college [Colorado State Teachers College] and then Colorado State College of Education and then became Colorado State [Colorado State College] and now it's University of Northern Colorado.  In '97 [1997], they with, they, they honored me with the Trailblazer Award for what I had done here and that's up there on the wall too.  And, that's how, then John just started going through that and he was, they were going to open this new school in Montbello [Denver, Colorado] and there were about twenty names submitted and he submitted mine and mine came down to the final three and I was the top, and I said, it's still, it still amazes me because I just didn't, I, I had never felt that I did that much, but then I'd had, I'd seen, you know those kids move and I've had, well at Newlon School [Jesse H. Newlon Elementary School, Denver, Colorado], it got to the point that they told, were telling me, some of the kids told me and the parents told me that those mothers would come at the office and fight with each other, they were white now, to get their kids into my first grade, so.
Speaker 1: So, when you look back over all you've been able to do, you know, sti- even the Depression [Great Depression] era when you had nothing, what you, and now you look back and you have a, an entire school named after you based on the dedication you've given to teaching and what you've wanted to do.  How does it, when you look back, what stands out most for you?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Let's see, I guess just the determination and the struggle that I went through and the determination to get an education.
Story_ID: 572428
Speaker 1: What do you tell children now about the importance of an education?
Speaker 2: I tell, I will tell kids any, at any time to learn all they possibly can, and to get the, get to, to make them the very best, you've got to have an education.  Now you may not go to college, but you can go to trade school, because we need tradesmen too you know.  But whatever you do, the one thing I always say, whatever you do, you make yourself the best.  Now my kids can remember hearing, even if you're digging a ditch, you dig the best ditch, no matter what you do, you make yourself the very best and don't fall back on this bit of saying, I didn't get it because I'm black.  Now you know you're black, you know there's discrimination, so you've got to make yourself the best and if you're the best, you're gonna be accepted.
Story_ID: 572429
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Why, I really hadn't thought about it, just remember me as, as a, remember me as a good mother, a good, a loving grandmother, and most of all an educator.
Speaker 1: Well thank you for being part of The HistoryMakers and sharing your story today.  Is there any last thoughts you wanna, did you come up with that saying?  Anything you wanna--?
Speaker 2: The only thing is and I have not said this to anyone, there are only about three other people who know it at this moment and my son Jim [James Greenwood] will hear it for the first time.  I just finished writing a small book called, 'Every Child Can Learn' [Marie Louise Greenwood].  And it's based on my teaching experiences from the beginning to the end with special children, not ni- and special children are not necessarily those who are academically in need, but you have special children that are way up there on the scales, but there's something that they can learn that will help them in life.  And I just finished reading it and turned it over to, let's see, to Bill [Bill Greenwood, Jr.], it's my number two son, and told him, in fact, it's because he has just encouraged me so, but he's not the only one.  I've had friends and associates that have told me over and over, I should write a book, I di- that I should definitely write about my life when they hear about the things that I did.  But since teaching has meant so much to me and I have said so many times, every child can learn something and now, I have written it.  I hope that it will be published and it just, I just finished it up last week.
Speaker 1: Well thank you for sharing that.

Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Go ahead, tell us about this photograph please.
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Go.  Tell us who's in it and what it's about.
Speaker 2: Oh.  Oh gosh, it hit me kind of (unclear).  I don't know what else you want me, but you want me to show it--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: If it isn't on the back, I don't, I'm not sure the date--
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty [1960]?
Speaker 2: --of that?  1960.
Speaker 1: And it is the Newton School [Jesse H. Newlon Elementary School, Denver, Colorado] Facu--
Speaker 2: No, Newlon in 1960, yeah.  I had been teaching--
Speaker 1: Wait 'til after--
Speaker 2: --after five years.
Speaker 1: Are you still rolling?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Now this, in this faculty picture, I'd been teaching for five years at Newlon School and as you can see, the fa- I was the only integrating force in the faculty and many of those teachers there of course, were teachers of my children too.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next one.
Speaker 2: What's that, '61 [1961]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):   We're rolling.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now this was my first grade class in 1961, and that was the principal, Mildred Biddick, over on the right there.  She's the one who actually gave me my, the opportunity to teach at Newlon School and I, this was my first grade there that I'd been teaching, I guess that was my sixth year there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Oh no, I was just, I was just thinking--
Speaker 2: Okay, ma'am, could you tell us about this photograph?
Speaker 1: Yes, this was, this was taken of course in Los Angeles [California] and my mot- I was about six months old and my mother [Sarah Garret Anderson] said that they had a terrific time getting me to stop crying.  But once I did stop, you can see me with the big eyes and I had a friend who saw that, and so a friend who saw my baby picture and the first thing she said were, "Your eyes were born and you grew up around them."
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And I do not have large eyes now.
Speaker 2: Okay, let's just go with the next photograph.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, that was the, that was taken at a Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] and I don't know where it was, it could have been in my Kansas City Boule, where this picture was taken, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority.  And I am on the front row, the third from the left, seated.
Speaker 1: Right there?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm gonna go with the next photograph Matt [Matthew Hickey].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, go ahead
Speaker 1: Is there a glare, too much on that one?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah, there we go.
Speaker 1: Okay, you ready?
Speaker 2: Yes.  This was in the 1950s when Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] was president and I, I belonged to the women's, Black Women's Republican Club and the lady sitting, standing next to Mamie Eisenhower was Lucy Harris [ph.], she was the one who had organized the class and she just was always getting people together.  We were having a tea and there I am serving tea to Mamie Eisenhower and the, the man on the left there is, he was Lieutenant Colonel Mann [Hiram Mann], he was proud of his, his rank because he had been a lieutenant in, a lieutenant colonel in World War I [WWI].  That was quite a thing and the other woman next to him is the wife [Ann Daniels Love] of the governor, Governor Love [John A. Love].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Nice.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's the year after my husband's [Bill Greenwood, Sr.] death and that double headed ea- the Double Headed Eagle was the first awards that they, the Supreme Council of the Masons was giving out and I'm receiving the one for my husband.  Right over there on the table is the real, right there is the real--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --eagle.  They do not present those anymore, so that's very special.  That was a sovereign grand commander by the way that was presenting it to me.
Speaker 2: Oh this one was back when my daughter was about two years old, must have been about 1947, or '48 [1948], and I was a teacher, I was, I was teaching the nursery school at church [Shorter Community A.M.E. Church, Denver, Colorado] and this was taken at my church one Sunday school all of the faculty, the teachers in the sun, in the s--in the school and over on the right, there I am and my daughter Louise [Louise Greenwood] is the only child that came up from down below and followed me up there and refused to leave.  So, this is quite a (laughter) special one.
Speaker 1: Oh, this is my sorority, Epsilon, Epsilon Nu Omega, Alpha Kappa Alpha, and I was one of the, one, one of the founders, not founders but, I have a picture up there of the whole group, right in this gold frame right there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
