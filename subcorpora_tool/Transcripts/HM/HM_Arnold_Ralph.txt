Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: They only take a short period of time.  They only require a short answer.  The first question is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Really?  Fried chicken, I guess, that's one of them and I like, well, let's say, I like chicken in most forms and I like Italian food, pasta and things of that sort, and, unfortunately, I like too many fried foods, like fried potatoes and, you know, sweets, ice cream, most cakes, pies, cobblers, you know, all the stuff that's bad for you, I like that.

Story_ID: 196966
Speaker 1: Well, I need to ask you about your family history and I want to start with your mother's side and then go to your father's [Clarence Moffitt] side, but, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My real mother?
Speaker 1: Well, if you know it, then we'll, you know.
Speaker 2: Her, her maiden name would have been Mary Harris and then she married Clarence Moffitt.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I believe her place of birth was Selma, Alabama but I don't know the dates.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you guesstimate sort of?  What do you think?
Speaker 2: Let me see, she would, I, when I was born, she would have had to have been, well now let's see, my brother was ten years old when I was, when I was born, my sister was eight so she would have had to have been somewhere in her thirties, I guess, when I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she was probably born in the 1890s, I guess?
Speaker 2: I guess so, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what do you know about her side of the family?  I realize that she didn't raise you, but, what do you know about her side of the family?
Speaker 2: I know that she had two brothers and about four sisters and that is about all I know about her.
Speaker 1: Do you have any information about the ancestors on that side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side?  Can you, you know, grandparents or great grandparents?
Speaker 2: I can trace it back to her father and he had three or four wives and there are some children from each one of those.  Now I don't know where she fit in among the four, five other children.  I think she was older and that's all I can remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's see.  Now do you have any information about your mother's personality or how she grew up or any of that?
Speaker 2: Oh, all I remember was she had, that I have heard that she had extremely long hair. She could sit on her hair, and if I can find a picture of her around here, she had a big bun, she wore her--a big bun in her hair and that's about all I know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know she, she too, was a housewife and that's all I know.
Speaker 1: Do you know if she had a chance to go to school or pursue a higher education or anything?
Speaker 2: I think she may have graduated from high school, or at least she went to high school, that as much I know because all of my aunts and uncles went to high school and or college.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have any knowledge of when your mother came to Chicago [Illinois]?  Was she raised here [Chicago, Illinois] or in Selma?
Speaker 2: No, she was raised here, no, she was raised in, in Selma and, I guess, its environs.  I really don't know, but she was, she was raised there and then she went, because of lack of educational facilities, she was sent to a religious affiliated school, I think in Nashville, Tennessee and was there long enough, I think, to get a teaching certificate, you know, so she, when she came home, back to Selma, she could go and teach in environing areas, first, second, third grade, that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well that's quite a bit actually, in some ways.
Story_ID: 196967
Speaker 1: Can you give us your birth father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His full name was Clarence Moffitt.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  As a matter of fact, his name was very seldom brought up in the family because his mother was a very difficult woman and she, it sounds like she was a witch.  I mean, when I was born, the, I had two brothers and sisters and we were divided up among the sisters and brothers, sisters, but my father decided that he didn't want his older kids separated from him, so he brought them back to Alabama and they stayed with him and his mother and sister, and the story goes, whenever she felt like it, she'd beat him with a curtain rod.  You know, "Why you looking at me that way?", whoop, you know, and that sort of thing.  So, he, he was, supposedly, was an alcoholic.  He did end up, as far as I know, in some sort of facility where he died.  So that's my knowledge of, of him.
Speaker 1: Did you know if he had a chance to go to school or anything or?
Speaker 2: I don't think he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think his mother would let him.  She wanted him to get a job and support her, you know, any kind of job.
Speaker 1: Well, okay, did you ever meet that grandmother?
Speaker 2: I met her once, and I don't have good memories of her.  I vaguely remember what she looked like.  She was fair-skinned, but my real father had a sister who supposedly was very nice because she tried to keep her mother, she tried it, she tried to keep her mother from beating up the little kids, you know, so, that's all I know about her.  I know that about ten years ago I got a phone call from somebody in Birmingham, Alabama telling me that my aunt, whatever her name was, was wasting away in a nursing home and could I come and get her and my thoughts at the time was, no I can't.  Well, I couldn't afford it in the first place and I never heard from this woman, you know.  I felt, I had empathy for her but I felt, as long as she'd been the state's responsibility up until that time, I couldn't, I couldn't deal with it.  So, I never heard from any of them again.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there a story that you know of about, or do you know how your parents met?
Speaker 2: My real parents, no.  All I know is that, all I heard, that the siblings did not want my sister--my mother to marry Clarence because at that time he was supposedly no good, he was a drunk, and I think they may have ran away and gotten married because nobody liked him--
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: --you know.
Story_ID: 196968
Speaker 1: Now, if you could explain the situation to us as to what happened and left you without parents.  I mean, what happened and--
Speaker 2: My mother [Mary Harris Moffitt] died in childbirth.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and your father [Clarence Moffitt] wasn't really able to--
Speaker 2: He was present but he wasn't able to do anything.
Speaker 1: Okay, so who, who took responsibility for you?
Speaker 2: Well, Roy Arnold and Bertha Arnold who was the--Bertha was the sister of Mary.
Speaker 1: So, okay.  So your aunt, Bertha Arnold, so it'd be Bertha Harris Arnold, I guess?
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: She took responsibility for raising you?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Along with her husband, Roy?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, now what, give us some idea of their background.  What were they [Arnold's adoptive parents, Roy Arnold and Bertha Harris Arnold] like, you know?  I guess, the sister [aunt and adoptive mother, Bertha Arnold] shares the same background as your mother [biological mother, Mary Harris Moffitt], I guess, but does she do anything differently?
Speaker 2: Well, my [adoptive] mother, my, you know as I know her, she taught school.  She said, well they did in, somewhere in southern Illinois she came up and she taught school and she was living and I don't quite know how, in Chicago [Illinois], when she met my father, Roy Arnold, and he has a very colorful history in that you don't know which is fact and which is fiction because as somebody pointed out to me recently and made me angry, chronologically it didn't hang true, which may or may not be true, as far as I'm concerned.  When you're a little kid, the stories are so colorful you want to believe them and--
Speaker 1: Well, what's the story?  What's the story?
Speaker 2: One of the stories was that when he was courting my mother in, I guess it was in southern Illinois, he had a little black bag and he had a skull in that black bag, he'd go--oh, yeah, I was, it was in Nashville [Tennessee] because he said he was going to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] and was going to be a doctor.  Now there is a strange connection.  In Knoxville, Tennessee, there was a Dr. Presnall [ph.], and they were classmates.  Now how, I have no idea, but he was our family doctor and he had a daughter my age and we were just friends.  Now, and they supposedly met when, when they were in college, when my, I know my father never went to college.  I even doubt if he went to high school.  I, you know, he never wrote me a letter.  He could sign his name, I know that, but I'm not sure he could read but he would, you know, he would fake looking at the paper like so many people of his generation.  He never read the paper upside down but he supposedly read the paper and he never read a book, he read the Bible.  Now, a lot of black people read the Bible.  Now, where did they read it as a way in education, an educated person would read it or as much as they can, you know.  So he, among the stories that he told before he met my mother was that Booker T. Washington came to the house to take him back to Tuskegee Institute [later Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] when he was a youngster.
Speaker 1: So he had, the story implies he ran away from Tuskegee Institute?
Speaker 2: He ran away from home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Booker T. Washington came to take him to Tuskegee and while they were having dinner, he threw his clothes in a little package, out the window and ran away, and joined a minstrel company.
Story_ID: 196969
Speaker 1: Did he [Arnold's adoptive father, Roy Arnold] name the company?
Speaker 2: It was something called K.G. Barkoot's Amusement Company [K.G. Barkoot Amusement Company].  Barkoot's should be in caps 'cause I'm not sure of that, but I do know, I have seen a poster, an antique poster of that minstrel company.  My dad's name wasn't listed on it but it was a big colorful poster and it was called that--
Speaker 1: And it's called J.G., what?
Speaker 2: K.G.
Speaker 1: K.G., K.G.--
Speaker 2: Barkoot or Bartlett's Amusement Company and he stayed there for a while, and then he formed his own amusement company and it was Arnold's, whatever.  Now when I was a kid, and I will tell you about that, when we were living in this white community, we had a, part of the, the perks was a, because he was janitor he had a shop, had all kinds of tools and stuff and I've always been around tools and the walls were covered with shades and old amusement posters and one of the posters was his, Roy Arnold's, Arnold's Amusement Company and it was, it wasn't a big one but it was a colorful poster and he stayed with the amusement company until World--it was some sort of entertainment and you can't tell fact from fiction when you get--he claims that he was rejected from the [U.S.] Army in World War I [WWI] but when Armistice--he, he traveled with the amusement companies all over the world, now that much I believe, and he contracted something like polio when he was in London [England] and they had to ship him back to the United States and he came home to his parents in that apartment building where his parents, his parents were, were husband and wife in a, he was a janitor and she cleaned up, you know, that, and did laundry and stuff like that and cooked for some people, they would hire her.  So he came back to that apartment and stayed there until he, he came to Chicago [Illinois] and when he came to Chicago with, by then, he and my [adoptive] mother [Bertha Harris Arnold] had married and when he came to Chicago, shortly after they moved to Chicago, my, his father died and he moved south, took us south, the three of us, and worked and stayed--he took his father's job.  So he essentially was janitor of this building and as I said, it was a building where there were no blacks.  The closest black family was about a block away but they were--it was a situation just like we had.  They lived--part of the salary was you got an apartment.  So, during the [Great] Depression, we had a good life.  We had a really nice place to live and, you know, my father--the income was my father's, which was low, but it was good for us, you know, and it was just the three of us, anyway.  So that brings, I know it's confusing.  Did that--
Speaker 1: No, I--it did make sense.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right--
Story_ID: 196970
Speaker 1: So, you wind up in Chicago [Illinois].  What is your--did you have any brothers and sisters in your family that you grew up with or any cousins that you grew up with?
Speaker 2: I didn't have any that I grew up with [in adoptive family].  I had a brother and sister, originally, I mean a real brother and sister but they remained in the South and I came here with Roy [Arnold] and Bertha [Arnold, adoptive parents] and went wherever Roy and Bertha went.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did see them.  I did know them.  They lived--they eventually came to Chicago, and my sister had gotten married in Alabama, and she had gone one year to college, and then dropped out because she didn't have enough money. Some school in Alabama, she went to.  My brother dropped out of high school because he couldn't keep up, financially or any other way, and he came--he just took odd jobs, at a time when he was about 17 or 18 years old.  He just took odd jobs and my sister got married, didn't have any children, but she married a man who was a musician. So, they moved to Chicago, and they moved in public housing, some place around 35th Street, and they got a divorce, and she was working in a Hart Schaffner and Marx-type place [sic, Hart Schaffner Marx], and they broke up, and she married another man who had six kids, the oldest of which was as old as my sister, which was bad news, and so here was my sister trying to be mother to all these teenage kids, and she was hardly older than a teenager herself, and it got to her, and she became an alcoholic, and I don't know if she ever did drugs, but she did walk into the lake [Lake Michigan] at the planetarium [Adler Planetarium, Chicago, Illinois], and that took care of--that took care of her.
Speaker 1: So she didn't, she died?
Speaker 2: She died. Yeah, she drowned.
Speaker 1: She just walked into the lake?
Speaker 2: Just walked into the lake one day.  She'd been in and out of facilities, and she tried to commit suicide a couple of times after she found her marriage wasn't--didn't work.  She took--she's one of those deals where she took a bottle of aspirin, and then she called everybody and told them what she did, you know, so, we all went racing down there and giving her--gave her hot coffee and you know, stuff to, but--
Speaker 1: Now, that's quite a backdrop now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 196971
Speaker 1: What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory?  I remember when we came here [Chicago, Illinois], to the World's Fair, that was 1933 [The Chicago World's Fair, A Century of Progress].  I remember that.  I remember going to Knoxville [Tennessee] and going to school in Knoxville.  Now, because we lived in this white neighborhood, I had to go way the hell and gone, to the black school, and I, consequently, I had very few black friends.  The little white friends that I had in the building--they were nice kids, but their parents didn't want them to play with me, and the memory that I have, and it really hurt, was I was out playing in front of the building and the mother and father had gone to church down the street.  It's a huge Baptist church, Greek Revival building, and all that sort of thing, and they were coming from church and the little kid saw me and come running up, "[HistoryMaker] Ralph [Arnold], Ralph," and the mother ran up and grabbed me, says, "I told you not to play with him!"  What was that all about, you know?
Story_ID: 197005
Speaker 1: We were talking about your earliest childhood memories and we were talking about the World Fair in 1933 [The Chicago World's Fair, A Century of Progress], the Century of Progress right here in Chicago [Illinois] near the Lake [Michigan], near Roosevelt Road, I guess. In those days, it would have been right there where the Museum of Science and Industry [Hyde Park, Chicago, Illinois] is now, but what do you remember about the fair from--
Speaker 2: About the fair? I remember the administration building and I remember the 20th Century Limited which was the--they had a sleek--well, it was one of the first modern trains, and you could go through it, and I remember the lights, it was very pretty, you know, with all the neon lights. This was sort of a--I guess it was a display of the age, going into the modern world, so to speak. And I remember that--being fascinated by that, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, I heard they had a prototype of a television on display there. I don't know if you saw that, but--
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember that, I remember that, and it just seemed impossible. How could those little people get in those wires, so, that was--
Speaker 1: Okay, so five years old.
Story_ID: 197006
Speaker 1: What did your neighborhood look like and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up and, you grew up in, not in Chicago [Illinois] but in--
Speaker 2: Knoxville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Knoxville, Tennessee.
Speaker 2: Well, growing up is not quite the word. My formative years, I suppose, was in Knoxville, Tennessee and living in this apartment building with the white kids, was also--early on my [adoptive paternal] grandmother, my, Roy Arnold's mother, so there were the two families [biological and adoptive]. Now, Roy Arnold's mother and [adoptive mother and biological aunt] Bertha Harris Arnold did not get along at all. Initially, I guess they did and, you know, they'd cook meals together and stuff like that and eat together but for some reason she didn't like her and--but she loved me, and she was always doing nice things for me, like bringing me candy and buying me toys and things of that sort. At what point they split, I don't know but she [Arnold's adoptive paternal grandmother] lived in one part--it was a basement apartment-and she lived in one part of it and we lived in the other and I think one of the things that separated us, she got a boyfriend, a minister, and my [adoptive] father didn't like that. So she was working with, working for, one of the tenants in the building who was the mistress of the man that owned the building. Follow all that?
Speaker 1: Okay, now your, your grandmother was working for one of the tenants of the building who was the mistress of the guy who ran, owned the building.
Speaker 2: Owned, owned the property.
Speaker 1: Okay, and he was a white--these are white people?
Speaker 2: These are white people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a doctor, and he had several bits of property, but she also was responsible for paying everybody, this woman, you know. So when my grandmother, and my grandmother cooked and did odd jobs for her, ironed and stuff like that, so she moved to a new, what we would call a subdivision, a brand new house, and my grandmother went with her and cooked for her and cleaned and did all the other stuff, but she still kept her apartment. So she would come back on weekends and, you know, they just didn't get along, they didn't like that, so. I remember, Mammie [adoptive paternal grandmother] took me to the zoo--I mean to Ringling Bros. Barnum & Bailey Circus. First time I'd ever been to a circus, and I had to get permission to get out of school to go to the circus, just like you would today, and it was a matinee, and when those clowns came through, I didn't want any part of that, I'm out of there. I screamed and yelled, the security came, and they thought my grandmother was beating me up and all kinds of stuff, and that was--I remember they got me out of it--out of that. Those were one of the fond memories. My grandmother was a good cook. She could cook sweet potato pies forever, they're great, and I would go and spend the weekend with her. They would take me out to where this Margaret, whatever her name was lived, and I would spend the weekend with her and she would do all the things that I liked. She fried--she'd make pancakes and waffles and fried chicken, and it was just a great weekend. So, I didn't understand why anybody was angry with anybody, because she was really sweet to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, the thing about clowns being scary and I just wonder why more children aren't afraid of them, I guess. Maybe they see so many things these days but in those days if you didn't, you couldn't, you know--
Speaker 2: I had never seen a clown before. It was all made up and, you know, and all that kind of stuff. Scared me to death.
Story_ID: 197007
Speaker 1: Okay, well, now where did you go to school first? Did you start going to school in Nashville [Tennessee], I mean in Knoxville [Tennessee] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Knoxville. I first went to school in Knoxville, yes. I went to kindergarten first, Seventh-Day Adventist kindergarten [University Seventh-Day Adventist School].
Speaker 1: And what was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: It's one of those deals that if you had asked me five minutes ago, I just could have rolled it off. Oh--
Speaker 1: So, we'll get back to it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So Seventh-Day Adventist school in Knoxville?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's--you started in kindergarten?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, now, was the school all white except for you or what?
Speaker 2: No, this was--
Speaker 1: This is a black school?
Speaker 2: --by this time, we had moved out of that building for the first time and moved into a black neighborhood. And so, it was an all-black school, all-black kids, and then the second--the first grade was in a school called Mechanicsville School. It was a--I think that, it was in a little--it was in a community called Mechanicsville [Knoxville, Tennessee], and it was an all-black community, and I remember getting--going to school there, and what was interesting about that school was some of the teachers were the teachers who had taught my [adoptive] father, Roy Arnold, and by this time they were all--all girls, you know, there were, so I could do no wrong. I could do no right, rather. "If you--if you don't sit down, I'm going to tell your grandmother on you," you know, it's, so. They sort of, well, I guess that was the way it was in those days, especially--it was a tightknit community, most of the time, and all the people went to the same schools, so everybody knew everybody else. So it wasn't--that wasn't a very large community, but then when, at some point, we went back, dad went back to, we went back to living--I guess financial circumstances--we went back to living in the big apartment, and that created a real problem, because this was a white community. I had to, in order to go to school, I had, they had to take me back to Mechanicsville every day, in the car. That didn't work out too well, so they transferred me to the next closest black school, which was still--it was in Knoxville, but a different location, and it was an all-black school called Green School [later, Green Magnet Math and Science Academy].
Speaker 1: Now is that for grade school, still in grade school?
Speaker 2: Still in grade school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, right. So by then I was about fourth or fifth grade, somewhere in there, and then my folks got the bright idea that I would, it would be better off coming to school in Chicago [Illinois]--coming to supposedly a good school up north. So, they, I went to live with my uncle on the South Side and his wife and stayed there until I decided he was mean, and I wrote a letter to my parents [Arnold's adoptive parents, Roy Arnold and Bertha Harris Arnold] in Knoxville saying come and get me because Uncle John was just too mean. My mother contacted him and his wife and said, "What are you doing to my son?" and "I'm coming and getting him." So she got on a train and came up here to take me back and did, after he had kicked us out on the street. Well, that's another story.
Speaker 1: Now who kicked you out on the street? Now, who--
Speaker 2: Who? My mother's brother [John Harris]. I was staying with them, you know, and, I mean, she was nice, but he was a bastard, so--came up here, and then we went back to live in the house in Knoxville--the apartment, and then I went to Austin High School [later, Austin-East Performing Arts and Sciences Magnet High School] in Knoxville, and by then I was in the ninth grade.
Story_ID: 197008
Speaker 1: Okay, now, well go back to school a little bit, were there any teachers that stand out in school or mentors when you were in grade school and grade school age (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, right. They tried to make a musician out of me, and I remember that one of the teachers was a Mr. Cobbs [ph.], or Professor Cobbs, as they called him, and then there was a Mrs. Wallace, Arnetta Wallace, who was, she made a very good impression on me because she was a real lady. She was a very nice person and a good teacher, and I think that was the first--one of the first times that I had a lady who was a good teacher, and this was a music teacher. I did have a Mrs. Anderson [ph.] who was my art teacher who told me, I would never be an artist, because I mix purple and orange together, and then there were some disciplinary issues. There was a principal named Mr. Hogue [ph.] who paddled me, and I went home and Roy Arnold [Arnold's adoptive father] came up to the school and said, "If you ever lay hands on my son again, I'll kill you," you know. So he never did. And I had, I had some teachers, I--generally I would say the teachers that I had in the South were generally much better than the ones I had here [Chicago, Illinois]. The subjects were thorough. I mean we had English, art and music, mathematics, science, they were all--and history--they were all good, solid teachers, and I don't have any bad memories about any of them except, well there's--teachers, I had no bad memories about any of 'em.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I thought they were--they knew their craft and they did it, you know. Some of them were no-nonsense. Some of them were fun, like all teachers.
Story_ID: 197009
Speaker 1: Now were you involved in activities in grade school and high school? Did you, you know--
Speaker 2: Just the band in high school [Austin High School, later, Austin-East Performing Arts and Sciences Magnet High School, Knoxville, Tennessee]. Yeah. That was it. I didn't do--it wasn't until we came here [Chicago, Illinois] that I became--went crazy and joined everything.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now when did you come to Chicago? When was it?
Speaker 2: I came here when I was in the ninth--I got--skipped a grade. So I was in the ninth grade when I came here. So I was thirteen years old when I became a freshman in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we were--then we moved to--we had moved to Robbins [Illinois] from Chicago.
Speaker 1: So, in Chicago, what high school were you at?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What high school were you at in Chicago?
Speaker 2: I wasn't in any high school.
Speaker 1: Oh, you weren't in high school--
Speaker 2: From Knoxville--
Speaker 1: Oh, you went from, to Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yeah. My mother [Bertha Harris Arnold, adoptive mother and biological aunt] came here and found a place in Robbins because she had a very close friend--they'd grown up together--that lived in Robbins. So she found this house, and we drove here from Knoxville to Robbins, and I remember my father [Roy Arnold, adoptive father] turning to my mother and said, "Babe, where have you brought me?" because Robbins was a mess. The house was a mess. There was no indoor plumbing. You know, it was all this stuff, whic, she was--she was impressed with the house, I guess. It was all we could afford, really, because we bought the house. And then, shortly thereafter, my mother's friend died, the one she moved here to be with, she died. So that took care of that. But, no, I was--and actually, I badmouthed Robbins but I did have some good childhood memories of Robbins, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, like what, what?
Speaker 2: Well, I joined--I created and joined something called the Robbins Library Association, and I had a group of friends and we--it was a little club thing for us.
Speaker 1: And you're about, what, at this age? How old were you?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was about fifteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, we had a tag day, and I took print shop, and I printed the tags and then we sold, you know, the tags in Robbins at the bus stop and, you know, peddling them in the street and got some very bad reactions from the black people because Robbins--I guess some of the people felt before we get a library, we ought to get a place to stay, you know. And I remember one of the, one of the girls, when she got back, she says, "Tag day for Robbins library," she said, "Library," and this woman just broke out laughing. She just started--it was the funniest thing in the world for Robbins to have a library.

Speaker 1: I went to Blue Island High School and--then--it's called [Dwight D.] Eisenhower [High School, Blue Island, Illinois] now, it was Blue Island then, and it had about fifteen black kids, and those black kids came from the grammar school in Robbins. I had gone to high school primarily, or grammar school in Knoxville [Tennessee] so by the time I got to high school, I had--I didn't know any of those black kids. You know, they grew up together, they knew who they were, and that sort of thing and I had--I made friends but it was not like, you know, growing up together and playing basketball with your buddies and stuff like that.
Speaker 2: So did you feel like an outsider sort of?
Speaker 1: For a long time and I was caught between two points, the white kids on one side and the black kids, I didn't know about the other and they didn't know me. You know, kids are strange. They, they gotta--we got to test each other before we--so I had a couple of interesting things. I think the incident that drove me to, perhaps to being who I am now, was when it came to--well, I'm jumping ahead--is the senior play, and they had listed try-outs for the senior play. Well, dumb me, I went to try out for the senior play and the drama coach says, "I'm sorry Mr. Arnold, we don't have any, any parts for a negro." What I did, I think, during my senior and junior year, was to do two things. I tried to convince the black kids that it was all right, and if it wasn't all right, they should try it anyway. So I joined all these things, the photography club, the all-guard club, the, you know, printmaking club, arts club and in every instance, I was the only black kid in that--in those clubs, and they would--black kids would say to me they didn't feel comfortable joining those all-white clubs, and they didn't think they could get in a lot of times because they were supposed to--they were supposed to have a grade level to get in some of those things, and I did. And I don't know how many different things I joined. My mother [adoptive mother, Bertha Harris Arnold] wouldn't let me go out for sports so I never got a letter. I got a letter for being the--for running the motion picture machine, but I didn't get a letter for track or football or any of those other things. Of course, I guess I wasn't the biggest of kids to--but football, I wanted football, but my mother wouldn't let me even try football.
Story_ID: 197011
Speaker 1: Well, I guess the obvious question here is like, how did you do in art when you were in high school [Blue Island High School, later Dwight D. Eisenhower High School, Blue Island, Illinois]? Were you--did you live like a prospective artist, you know, at that point?
Speaker 2: I didn't. I guess I was considered artistic, you know, arranging things and stuff like that, but we didn't have, and in high school, we didn't have a formal art class. So I took printmaking. I took printing, setting type and stuff like that, so all my creative energies went into that. And it, to this day, stood me in good stay, good--
Speaker 1: Well, were there any teachers there that were mentors or took an interest?
Speaker 2: One of the people who took an interest in me was a Mr. Ledford [ph.] who was, he taught speech and I was on the debating team which was another odd thing--no black kids had ever been on the debating team. And I did public speaking and took part in contests throughout the state, doing public speaking things, and, you know, was pretty good at it, and I won a lot of ribbons and stuff like that. And so, and Mr. Ledford was my coach. The other one who was a significant other in my life was a man named Mr. Shanoff [ph.] who taught printing, and I became the shop foreman which was an honor, you know, to supervise all the other kids. The librarian was a Mrs. Hilliard [ph.] who thought I was the greatest thing since George Washington Carver. You know, she was a white lady and a very sweet woman, never married and one of my first shows, first one-man shows on Oak Street, she walked in the door. Just blew me away. I had a couple of good English teachers. The thing that I felt I missed in high school was--by the time I got to college and took college courses, a lot of the kids, at the University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign], they had read 'Hamlet' [William Shakespeare]. They had read, you know, Achilles [Homer, 'The Illiad']. They had read all these, and I didn't know what the fuck they were talking about, you know. I felt like an outsider then but anyway. It was, those were the, there were incidents that let you know, as a black kid, that you were in a prejudiced atmosphere in Blue Island [Illinois]. At the time of the, at the time of the prom, every division had a principal. At the time of the senior prom, I got this date, a very pretty little girl, and she worked in the cleaners and saved and got money for her dress and, and we were, the prom was at the old Del Prado Hotel [Hyde Park, Chicago, Illinois] and during the prom the senior principal stepped on the tail of her dress and tore that much into it. So I went up to him and I--in a very nice way, I said, "Mr. Ames [ph.], you have--you inadvertently," I said, "stepped on my date's dress and tore it." And he said, "So?" and I said, "I think it would be nice, you know, if you apologized." He said, "I don't know nothing about it," and walked away. When I was in the, while I was in service [U.S. Army], they told me they found his head on the Rock Island tracks [Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, CRI&P RR]. The train does not sever a head, it mashes it. So, somehow or another they found two parts of Mr. Ames up on the Rock Island tracks because a lot of the black kids didn't like him and a lot of the white kids. It wasn't--he was just a mean man, you know, that's what he was all about and not very forgiving in any way. If you made--if you did something that wasn't your fault, and you got caught doing whatever it was, he assumed that it was your fault and penalized you for it. Like Robbins [Illinois] kids were bused in from Blue--from Robbins to Blue Island and to get from Robbins to Blue Island, you had to go across, I don't know how many railroad tracks, and every once a month there would be dozens of trains, railroad cars, freight cars, you know, switching and going on, and I remember one morning, we were late, and there were other buses, white buses late and the black kids went into his office and asked for an excuse, a slip to get into class, and he wouldn't give it to them. He said it was our fault.
Story_ID: 197012
Speaker 1: Okay. So we were talking about Blue Island High School [later, Dwight D. Eisenhower High School, Blue Island, Illinois] had a branch of the University of Illinois going on in the evening?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, in the high school.
Speaker 2: And you could take a couple of courses there.  So I started out there taking a couple of courses for two semesters so I had four classes.  The problem with that is they had high school teachers teaching college classes.  Sometimes it didn't work.
Speaker 1: Well did it work in your case?  I mean, when you were in--
Speaker 2: I mean I finished there, I mean, went to Champaign [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, Illinois], you know, so I was ahead a little bit but I didn't, I knew the teachers weren't good.  Then when you were given an exam in a class of twenty people and two of them pass and the rest of them flunked, it's not the kids' fault, so, anyway.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were there for how many years?
Speaker 2: I was, I was--at Blue Islandfor two semesters.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So then you went--
Speaker 2: Then I went to, you know I was trying to think the other night, did I go to Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois] or did I go to, I think I went to Champaign then.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what year did you graduate from high school?  In what--
Speaker 2: Forty-six [1946].
Speaker 1: Forty-six [1946], okay, and you went to Champaign, I guess, in '47 [1947], then right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it would have been forty, '47 [1947]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the first time.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, well how did you like the University of Illinois?
Speaker 2: The University of Illinois was fine but it was in a time when it was right after World War Two [WWII] and there were lots and lots of people there and they had housing problems.  You could stay in the dormitory or you could stay in organized homes, you know, the, and I stayed in the international students co-op, which was unique and we had twenty-four nationalities and we cooked our own meals, cleaned the house, did everything, and I made some lasting friends.  I mean that was really good.  I didn't take any art courses there because I wasn't there long enough.  I had to fulfill the academics and all that stuff that I should have done, and I went in the [U.S.] Army.  And see, I went in the Army in '50 [1950] [sic. 1949], I think it was.
Story_ID: 197013
Speaker 1: Were you drafted?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, I'd had like [Richard Bruce Cheney, 'Dick'] Cheney, I'd had lots of deferments because I was in college and so I went to, went in the [U.S.] Army in '50 [1950], it had to be, late, oh, it was '49 [1949] 'cause it was Halloween night, Halloween, I went up, Fort Sheridan [Illinois], and I went from Fort Sheridan to Fort Knox [Kentucky], from Fort Knox to, I took leadership training school at Fort Knox and then went to Fort Lawton [Seattle, Washington] and then to Korea [for the Korean War].
Speaker 1: Okay, so Fort Lawton, is that in Oklahoma or--
Speaker 2: No, Fort Lawton, Washington.
Speaker 1: Washington, okay.
Speaker 2: Was then, probably you remember it was the big thing in Seattle with the Indians wanted their reservation back, that was Fort Lawton.  They got it back too. Then I was in Korea, I think two years.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there anything, this is the first time you've been out of the country, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the first time I've been out of the country.
Speaker 1: And so, and so and you go to Korea and from what I understand, the U.S. military had just desegregated?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean, at least in name and it took, they said it took a while for it to reach down the ranks.
Speaker 2: It did, it did.  I did not have any problems.  Now here again, I was thrown into a situation just like I was in Knoxville [Tennessee] and all of us were.  I mean, there were platoons and most of the platoons had one black person in them.  You know, so all your buddies were white, you know.  So, I did have a sergeant who had never seen a black person until he got in the Army which I found hard to believe but he was from Oklahoma or Nebraska or some place.
Speaker 1: Probably in Nebraska.  I think there's a lot of black folks in Oklahoma.
Speaker 2: I guess so, yeah, right, and he couldn't figure me out and I sure in hell couldn't figure him out.  First of all, I was a college kid and that does make a difference and he didn't know, I don't think he graduated from high school so, he couldn't give me a rough time because there's nothing for him to give me a rough time over.
Story_ID: 197014
Speaker 1: I did have a significant other in Korea [Korean War] and that was a black sergeant who had, who was in World War II [WWII] and had been all over and he was, the time he got to our outfit, he was a staff sergeant and a big guy.  Cut.  When we went on line the first time, scared shitless, and we were in a bunker and there were two things that happened in this bunker.  When the rounds would start coming in from the Chinese and the North Koreans, we'd hide and I would get in our bunker and he would lay there in his bunk bed counting the times the Chinese had missed and how soon it would be before they hit us.  You know, bring it down two notches, bring it up one, whatever, and that was weird.  The other thing was, he called me, I was standing in the door watching the rounds fall and he called me and shrap [shrapnel] metal went right where my head was when I turned to see, "What?" and that really shook me up, you know, I mean.  The other thing was when I went to Japan, no, when we went on line, he would question me about his--I was supposed to be the telephone man--whether or not I had all my tools.  "[HistoryMaker Ralph] Arnold, you got your screwdriver, you got your pliers, you got--", you know, and all this sort of business and the first time I went--they had done away with the buddy system where you went on guard duty with a buddy, at least he decided, or somebody decided, they didn't need it that you'd go on individually.  Well, that scared me to death.  So I got up out of, I got up--to go on duty and he said, "Arnold," and he held out a bottle of scotch and said, "It's get cold out there," which was beautiful.  I mean, he showed no affection, no emotion to anybody, he was cold as ice but every once in a while there was that little bit of human compassion that came through, you know.  I heard that he got in a card game while I was on R&R [rest and recuperation] in Japan and caught somebody stealing, you know, cheating at cards, and he pulled out a gun and inadvertently shot himself in the foot.  So I never did see him anymore.  That was pretty sad, you know, because he was a lifer. He'd spent his time in the [U.S.] Army.
Story_ID: 197015
Speaker 1: So how long were you in Korea [Korean War]?  I mean, did you interact with the Koreans at all?  I mean, what was the interaction like with the Koreans?
Speaker 2: Well, the setup was we had, every American outfit had a few Korean soldiers attached to them and they were supposed to be treated like other soldiers but being Americans, they had them shining shoes and washing dishes and stuff like that.  Those were the South Koreans.  The North Koreans, I believe, I had contact with a North Korean lieutenant.  I was on duty, up on a little hill, and all of a sudden coming up on the other side of the hill was this man, well, God I was scared to death and another man, I couldn't tell the uniform of one of them but he was neat, clean, well-groomed and the other one looked sort of scruffy like a regular G.I. and one of the things that this guy asked me how I was and how, he asked me how was the white soldiers treating me which I thought was a strange thing for an officer to say.  And before I could decide what to do, they were gone.  I didn't know what to do.  I never saw them afterwards.  I'd never seen them before.  I have no idea what they were doing out there, how they got up there because in front of us was no-man's land.  So it meant that he, they had to come through the North Korean and Chinese lines to get where we were.  So it was kind of spooky.
Speaker 1: Did you report that?
Speaker 2: I told my sergeant and I told my lieutenant and that was all, that was, that's all they could do.  It was too late then--
Story_ID: 197016
Speaker 1: Let's see, what else happened in Korea [during the Korean War]?  I kept running into people from Champaign [Illinois].  There, the day I left, the North Koreans bombed our area.  They fired at it and my replacement, they blew out my line, my telephone line, and I was still, you know, had men so I had to go and repair it and I brought him with me.  Oh, he didn't want to go.  Well I know, I knew I wasn't going out there alone and I knew he was supposed to go out there so he'd know where the line was so if it happened again, I would be halfway home and he wouldn't be able to do anything.  So, I finally convinced him and we came out and fixed the line.  There was one curious thing that happened, freaky.  The night I was promoted from Private First Class [PFC] to Corporal, I had been with some of my buddies to put a line from where we were to the front and this took all afternoon.  We got back home at about seven o'clock when the mail came, I had gotten promoted to Corporal.  Well, it was time to celebrate.  Then our phone line rings from headquarters saying, our line had gotten blown out, the one that I had put in earlier in the day.  So, good old Sergeant Bearden [ph.] said, "Okay, you and you and you, get in the jeep and go fix the line."  Well, we did.  We got up there and here were two or three other outfits, guys, looking to put their lines, fix their lines, and my guy went over on one side of the road and picked up some wire, I went on the other side, picked up some wire, a piece of wire, we put them together and that was our line.  I mean, it was like going through a pot of spaghetti and picking out two things and put them together.  Just couldn't figure that out, you know, and the kid said, "Don't go there, I'm not going there," you know.  It was really weird.
Speaker 2: It was too easy?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: It was too easy to do almost?
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh, it was impossible.  Coming home on the ship I heard other guys tell of similar kinds of stories like I heard one guy went in a bunker and all of his buddies, his, like they were, it was like lunchtime or dinnertime or something, and all of his buddies that were sitting around eating and this North Korean came in and shot them all and got to him and grinned and turned around and walked out.  Messed him up.  I had a guy in training at Fort Knox [Kentucky] who was a tank person, I've forgotten what my terminology now, and around his tank, while it was going somewhere, spun around inside the tank, 'cause what happened, that's what it does, it got to him and stopped.  All of his buddies were killed and he was not a happy camper I tell you.  He was bitter, he was--well I don't blame him, you know, he, was strange to begin with.  So, my Korean stories.
Story_ID: 197017
Speaker 1: So you were on the front lines most of the [Korean] War.
Speaker 2: Not most of the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, but a lot of the time, enough to get in--
Speaker 2: I was a lot--I was on the front line enough to get combat pay several times, several months and because I was in an anti-aircraft outfit, we weren't, we were in support of infantry so we weren't exactly infantry.  I would, I had a buddy whom we were very close, a black guy, and he would have to take the food up to the troops in the evening.  So he would leave about four o'clock and I volunteered to ride shotgun with him.  So about three or four times a week, I would ride with him.  Now this was stupid on my part.  I mean, the rounds flying all around us and we're on the side of a hill taking the, you know, the stew and the stuff to our troops and it was fun.  It was fine.  I mean, we told, told each other lies and stories about what home life was like and, you know, as they say, a guy thing, and he left Korea about six months after I did.  So he didn't get hurt or anything but, in fact, there were only two guys in our outfit that got killed.  One was a white guy who just had arrived in Korea and was there about three or four weeks and he got killed.  And the other was a little Korean boy and I don't know where or when, I don't know exactly what happened to him but I knew he got killed.  I think he got killed on the same time, same bombing, he was killed by a bomb.
Story_ID: 197018
Speaker 1: So when did you come back from Korea [Korean War]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen--
Speaker 1: So you went in '49 [1949], right, and--
Speaker 2: I arrived in Korea on a Fourth of July, 1950.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Left Korea on the Fourth of July, 1952.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Day to day which is most unusual.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you get back, did you, did you go back to the University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, Illinois] to pursue your degree?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Now I've had my, up until the time I went to the University of Illinois because of, my name was never legally changed to [adoptive family name] Arnold from [biological family name] Moffitt so when I came back from Korea, the dean was going to give me some grief because the name on the, when I went in the [U.S.] Army, I dropped the Moffitt in the middle name, no I added Moffitt, dropped, it was Ralph Moffitt Arnold, it was Ralph Theodore Arnold.  I dropped the Theodore and put in Moffitt.  So the Dean was going to give me trouble but I did that, my folks did it because the name on the birth certificate, because Moffitt was on the birth certificate, Theodore Moffitt was on the birth certificate.  So, anyway, we settled that.  I mean, I wasn't going to take any grief from the dumb dean after being in Korea two years.  So, he says, well we'll have to, I says, no you don't.  I says, I am going to enroll in this school.  So I did and I was there, unfortunately, not long enough or, well, I was to graduate in '53 [1953], I guess it was, sometime like that, and the dean called me in and he said, oh at some point, I had gone to Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois] in the summers, and taken some upper graduate, upper level courses.  And so when I enrolled again, my final year, I enrolled, you know, in some classes thinking I was doing fine.  The dean called me in, and he was one of those whose heads should have been found on the tracks, he had his foot on his desk, smoking a cigar and said to me, "You don't think you're going to graduate are you?"  And I says, "Yeah."  He says, "Well I've got news for you."  Seems that in those funny classes that I took at Blue Island [High School, later, Dwight D. Eisenhower High School, Blue Island, Illinois], in chemistry, I got a D and I later took a French course and didn't drop it, I thought I, I did, I had dropped it, I know I dropped it, but they didn't have a record of me dropping so they gave me an F.  So that lowered my business.  So he said, "You, I'll give you two options.  You can drop whatever classes you're taking now and take, and sign up for," I don't know, it was like chemistry and science and some weird things and he said, and "You have to, let's make it fun.  You have to get all Bs."  Well, I got all, I got a B and a couple of Cs.  So I didn't graduate from the University of Illinois and I, he says, he told me I, if I didn't I could, I would just drop out and I went to Roosevelt, they accepted my credentials and I graduated from Roosevelt and no problem, you know, so--
Speaker 1: Okay, so, that dean was trying to block you from graduating?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he was, and I am told that I'm, I wasn't the only one, you know.  I had, I had a couple of friends that the dean did not like and I saw him looking at me once.  One was a black guy who was going with a white girl and one was a white guy.  We were both theatre majors at the time and he didn't like that.  So, but anyway, it hurt at first but I got over it.
Story_ID: 197019
Speaker 1: Okay, now speaking of theatre, now did you, well, let's go to job first.  Now what, did you start teaching in the schools or in the--
Speaker 2: I started teaching at Rockford College [later, Rockford University, Rockford, Illinois] in 1970.  It's in the resume.
Speaker 1: Okay, but from, you, but when did you finish at Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois]?  When--
Speaker 2: I finished at Roosevelt in 1956, I think it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, no wait--
Speaker 2: It's in the resume.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you have to say it, though, anyway because we're, this is the interview, so you have to say it anyway, you know, tell us on the interview--
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, right, okay.
Speaker 1: --so we'll have like double, you know, source to compare, you know what I mean, that's all (laughter).  So we couldn't just read the resume.  We're not going to do that.  Can't tell us.
Speaker 2: No, no I know.  I mean, I, you want to correct my timing here.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you graduated from Roosevelt in '56 [1956].  Now, you said you were involved in theatre and you told me during the break that you involved with Skyloft Players--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at one time, which is one of the early--
Speaker 2: Between, between going to the University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, Illinois] and the [U.S.] Army, I was part of Skyloft.
Speaker 1: Okay, now tell us about Skyloft Players.  What was Skyloft Players and it's historic so let's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, at that time, there were a lot of what we call little theater companies in Chicago and what they, what happened with them was they would, the bigger theatres, and there were, there were large theatre companies like Skylight and, you know, out in the suburbs, Pheasant Run and all those sort of things, and they would call for actors to play bit parts, you know, and the Lyric [Opera of Chicago, Illinois] would call for, it's called Chicago Opera Company, would call for extras.
Speaker 1: And plays like that, now that's something that I've heard before where people, black folks are called to be extras in 'Aida' [Giuseppe Verdi]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, of course, I was going to say that, you know.  They gave you this little costumes, what am I supposed to do with that?  You're one of the slaves, you know.
Speaker 1: So then you stand there and hold a--
Speaker 2: Hold a spear--
Speaker 1: --spear or--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --or carry somebody on stage or something.
Speaker 2: And for that you got carfare I think it was and lunch or dinner, whatever, well anyway.  Anyway, it was fun because it was fun for a simple reason, I had never been inside, ever seen an opera before. I heard of them and heard them but I'd never seen one so to see this 'Carmen' [Georges Bizet] was spectacular, and when the men came out to do the triumphal march, or whatever it was, he was all covered in silver and did his little ballet number, was breathtaking.  I never forgot it.
Story_ID: 197020
Speaker 1: --We were talking about your activities on stage and taking roles in the opera, you know, bit roles in opera as part of the extras and that sort of thing and--
Speaker 2: And I carried that through to the University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, Illinois] and I was in two plays.  I was in a Greek tragedy and then I played George [Gibbs] in 'Our Town' [Thornton Wilder] and that was my big--
Speaker 1: Oh, go ahead.
Speaker 2: --that was my big to do in 'Our Town', you know.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay, Thornton Wilder is 'Our Town'--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: It's big in the '50s [1950s].  A lot of companies did that play, right, in the '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: The interesting thing there is at the end, or toward the end, there's a wedding and I was George.  This was very avant-garde, a black guy--
Speaker 1: Well maybe we should hold for a second.  Did he pause it?  Scott--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you put it on pause?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, because there was some--did you turn that down?  Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And the girl who played Emily is white and there's a wedding and the director didn't know what to do when it came time to kiss the bride, you know, and finally he just put on, he says, either you kiss her or you don't and, you know, I thought that was pretty good 'cause Champaign [Illinois] was not the most avant-garde place in the, upon the planet but anyway we resolved it.  I think I ended up just embracing her, you know, I decided with that.
Speaker 1: À la Sidney Poitier or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right (laughter).  Yeah, so, that was that.
Story_ID: 197021
Speaker 1: Now in Chicago [Illinois] was Skyloft [Players].  Now, where was Skyloft at, located?
Speaker 2: 51st [Street] and, 51st and South Parkway.  It was in the top floor of the community center [Parkway Community House] there on the corner. I've forgotten what it's called.  Hot.  Of course this was days before air conditioning and, of course, we were most active in the summer, I guess it was.
Speaker 1: So I bet that was hot.
Speaker 2: It was really hot.  There were--
Speaker 1: Now some of the people involved are people now who are pretty well-known in Chicago theatre history now.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you name some of them for us?
Speaker 2: I think [HistoryMaker] Oscar Brown, Jr.  I've forgotten at what point I'm, Oscar Brown and I were at the University, Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois] at the same time.
Speaker 1: I think off-camera you said Joan Brown was--
Speaker 2: Oh, Joan Brown, of course, Joan Brown.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Abena Joan [P.] Brown now.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker Okoro] Harold Johnson, I think was part of that.  At one point was he there when you were there?
Speaker 2: Cordell, Cordell Brown [ph.]?
Speaker 1: No, Okoro Harold Johnson.
Speaker 2: Harold John-Yeah, I think so and Cordell Williams [sic, HistoryMaker Lucky Cordell], the radio (unclear) announcer from Gary [Indiana], he and his wife.
Speaker 1: Was Clarence Taylor involved?
Speaker 2: Yes, but I, I don't get an image of Clarence.  The name, you know.
Speaker 1: A thin guy, he's the man that founded X-Bag Theater at Parkway Community House.
Speaker 2: Probably.
Speaker 1: A tall, thin kind of fellow.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right, yes, Parkway, okay.  A couple of women and you can't quote me on this but I believed the woman who played in 'Movin' On Up' ['The Jeffersons'] with--
Speaker 1: Oh, Isabel Sanford?
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --the woman who was married to the white guy that lived upstairs?
Speaker 1: Oh, Roxie Roker?
Speaker 2: Roxie Roker, right, right.  I think she was in Skyloft.  Lorraine Hansberry and that's all I can remember right now.
Speaker 1: That's quite a few people that, now were the, now this is in the '50s [1950s], right?
Speaker 2: Right, Hilda Simms. That was another biggie.
Speaker 1: Hilda Simms, all right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, she was Anna Lucasta in Broadway production of 'Anna Lucasta' [Philip Yordan] or Chicago production of 'Anna Lucasta.'
Story_ID: 197022
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember the Richard B. Harrison Players [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I remember them. That was another one of those little theatre groups, right. And people floated from one, whatever play, you know, you could get a role in.
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember Alice Browning, a writer?  She, she wrote plays and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, I know, let's see, is that the one that--
Speaker 1: She used to have something called the International Black Artist Conference [sic. International Black Writers' Conference], she would hold every year--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --and, it wasn't being held then, I don't think, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, no, no.
Speaker 1: --but she was a writer from a long time back, you know.  I just wonder.  Was Gwendolyn Brooks involved at all in any--
Speaker 2: No, she wasn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was around Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois] when I was there but, I mean, I saw her, I knew who she was but I never was in any class with her and never had any contact with her.
Speaker 1: Now when you, were you at Roosevelt after Harold Washington was there and [HistoryMaker] Gus Savage and that group or is that--
Speaker 2: No, I was there during--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I said to Harold once at a reception, I said, we went to school together.  He said, where?  And he rattled off, you know, "Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire]," or wherever, you know, wherever else, I said, "No, Roosevelt."  He said, "Oh!"  No, Gus Savage wasn't, he was there.  He was bopping around there.  He was+ an activist in those days, you know.  He was on the young, whatever, Republicans or Democrats or progressive party or whatever, you know, he was floating around there.  Very popular man, you know, 'cause he was so active.
Speaker 1: He's quite a public speaker, you would think.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  No, so was Harold.  Harold was such an imposing looking guy.  He and [HistoryMaker] Oscar Brown, Jr., too, and it was before Oscar had his beard and all that other stuff.
Speaker 1: Yeah, these are some strong personalities we're talking about, here.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, right.
Speaker 1: Harold Washington, Oscar Brown, Jr.--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --Gus Savage, yeah.
Speaker 2: Very strong personalities.

Speaker 1: I never did join any clubs of any kind at Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois] because I had to beat it to 63rd [Street] and Halsted [Street] to get the bus to Robbins [Illinois] and the last bus usually.  If I stayed over or studied late, if I didn't get a ride from somebody, I'd have to get to Robbins. That wasn't easy.
Speaker 2: Now, if you missed the bus, then, you had to stay in Chicago [Illinois] for a while?
Speaker 1: That's right.  Or if I missed, if I could get a bus to Blue Island [Illinois] and then I, if I got to Blue Island, I had to walk to Robbins, that's about three miles, you know, and I did that many times too, you know.  My [adoptive] father [Roy Arnold] worked at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and he got off about the time the bus would arrive in Blue Island, and about fifteen minutes later, my father would come through Blue Island.  Well, he wouldn't stop for anything.  One night I was out, I saw the car, and I was out there waving, "Dad, Dad!" and he just went right around me.  He, well, he didn't know, carjacking or any of that crazy stuff, so--
Speaker 2: So, now did your, did your father's activities, in show business, we talked about when he was in the, in, influence you at all to be involved in the arts or did you, did he give you any advice about theater or--
Speaker 1: Not really.  He was afraid that I was going to get involved with a bunch of druggies, you know.  I mean, he couldn't, they couldn't watch over me from Robbins to Chicago, you know, so, but anyway, I mean.
Speaker 2: So the arts were kind of stigmatized, I guess.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes.  He was a pretty stern person who said, you know, if I were out late at night, "I know, I know what you doing, I was young once," and that hurt me because whatever he did, I sure in hell wasn't doing, you know.
Speaker 2: Make you wonder about what he was doing.
Speaker 1: Right, exactly.
Story_ID: 197024
Speaker 1: You're involved in theatre and, I guess, you're doing artwork too, right?  You're doing some artwork?  Oh, what kind of art did you, I mean, do you do?  I mean, what were you doing then?
Speaker 2: I really didn't start--I started really learning about art when I was at Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois].  I was close to the Art Institute [of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] so I would go to the Art Institute and study things and look at things and, you know, maybe make some sketches but that was it.  I didn't really get involved in art until 1955, after I graduated from Roosevelt.  I got a job at the Cook County Department of Public Aid [Chicago, Illinois] in the daytime, and in the afternoon and evening, I enrolled in the evening school [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  I took first one class and then took another class the following semester and then the rest is history, I guess, because I was there until I graduated in 1975 and then I stopped going part-time and went the last two years, I think, full-time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, what, did you earn a M.F.A.?
Speaker 2: Yes, I got an M.F.A.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I got a B.A. from, Bachelor of Arts, from Roosevelt, speech theatre, and then got the rest from the Art Institute.
Story_ID: 197025
Speaker 1: Okay, so you came out of Art Institute [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] in '75 [1975], but you started teaching at Loyola [University Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] in 1970?  Was it '70 [1970]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was teaching, I started at Rockford College [later, Rockford University, Rockford, Illinois] and then I went to Barat [College, later Barat College of DePaul University] in Lake Forest [Illinois] and left Lake Forest and came to Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois], I mean to Loyola and I was, I was going to school, I think, when I started teaching at Loyola.  I think, it seems to me I was.  Yes, I know I was, I was, because graduation was, you know, in whatever time of year graduation occurs and I remember that I had to teach at Loyola at some point between all the festivities or whatever, and I was hired at, an interesting story, I was hired at Loyola because the chairman got a grant from the, one of the big foundations.  It wasn't Ford Foundation but it was one of the others, with the stipulation that 35 or 75 percent of the grant money went for full-time teaching to a minority. Ta da! and so she knew me and recommended me and I got in but it was not easy getting in because, oh, when she, when she retired and recommended me as chairman, two or three years, two years later, and the committee on faculty departments had never heard of me because I was an artist.  You know, if I had been a scientist or, or writer who, who was prolific or [HistoryMaker] Richard Hunt, that was it, you know, so they turned me down and said, I didn't have enough experience.  Well at that time, the Dean of Arts and Sciences [sic, Associate Dean of the College of Architecture and Art] was a black man, at the University, at the University of Illinois at Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Who was that now?
Speaker 2: Keith Morrison [Keith Anthony Morrison], and Don Baum was [art department] chairman at Roosevelt, and then I had another person.  They told me to scare up some letters of recommendation.  So I did that and they didn't vote again, the letters were so strong.  Don Baum, Keith Morrison said, "As far as I'm concerned, Ralph's overqualified."  Don Baum said something to the same effect, so, I was in and the rest was, the rest went on fine.
Story_ID: 197026
Speaker 1: I didn't have any problems as a black chairman [of the Department of Fine and Performing Arts] at Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois]--at Loyola [University Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  I was the first black administrator, academic administrator, and I could, you can tell there were vibrations for, when you walked into a meeting, you know, I mean, words didn't stop and I was, basically I was treated all right except for a few instances but Loyola, I think, what I mean--bitter stupidity was I didn't get a Ph.D. while I was at Loyola because I could have gotten a Ph.D. in English and I wouldn't have had to pay a penny for it and I didn't do it, but anyway, I said, well, here we are.  I tried to initiate a lot of things and bring about a lot of things simply because I was black.  You know, inaugurate new courses, hire new people.  I went so far as to get, try and get a black guy.  He came down, he was moving artwork and he says I'm looking for a job.  I said, what do you do?  He says, he's a sculptor.  I says, you're for me.  You're just the guy I want.  Well he started badmouthing [HistoryMaker] Richard Hunt and I thought you don't want a job but I tried many times but here again, it was like they had never heard of any black teachers at Loyola.  A lot of people that I asked, and they said, "Well, do they have blacks at Loyola?"  And I said, "Well, they've got black students."  And I asked students who said to me, one student said, when he saw me in the classroom, he thought I was a janitor, sweeping up the classroom and then when I, he found out I was a teacher, "I was just blown away," you know, well, which is, it's interesting because there were a lot, there were a lot of black kids who went to Loyola but they didn't feel at home.  There was no--there was attempts to have a black student union and all that sort of thing and we had one militant head of black studies, but I don't know, he couldn't get it together.  I don't know what happened to him but anyway.
Speaker 2: Who was that?
Speaker 1: I've forgotten his name.  He was a militant and that, that turned off, he couldn't get a full load of students in his class because you had to have some blacks and, some blacks and whites to have a class and a lot of white kids didn't like him and I don't think too many of the black kids liked him.  I mean, he was way out there.  He wasn't as bad as one guy that I hired who almost asked the black students to get up and get out of the room because they, their ancestors did their number with slaves and he was weird but, so, generally, even my white faculty--I had one black member of the faculty that I grew up with here in Chicago. He was a ceramics teacher and then I had--all the other teachers were black.  I had one other, one other white, one other black girl who taught a history class but, in art appreciation, but I didn't know her too well, you know, but, because our paths didn't meet.  She taught at one campus and I taught at the other, so.  Teaching was sort of a smooth sailing except my hands were tired and--tied in doing some of the things that I wanted to do and some of the teachers didn't understand why I wanted Loyola, the art department, to be a part of certain national organizations so that the school could get on the map as being a bona fide art school, you know, and give them a little presence in the, in the country, like all the other departments in the school but, anyway, and a lot of, a lot of those organizations cost a fee and the university didn't want to pay the fees to do certain things, so.

Speaker 1: So, in terms of your artwork itself, what is your, can you describe your work and what you attempt to do?
Speaker 2: Okay, it's mainstream.  It's, has always been, experimental and mainstream.  I do pretty much what I feel like doing and any themes that I want to do, like that big piece is a collage of mine.  I started out doing collages because of Romare Bearden and my collages sometimes look like his, other times, they're so far remote from his and as they get more figurative.  I had, I've done some figurative things and I find them quite satisfying but I get a lot of excitement out of working primarily with my hands rather than the paint brush.  You know, I did a lot of constructions, building things.  I was in, and I couldn't find, the Whitney Museum of Art [Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, New York] did a show entitled, 'Black American Artist' or something, 'American Black Art' and it was a national show and the curator went around the United States picking out people to be in the show and I was in the show with a lot of well-known black artists, Romare Bearden, [HistoryMaker] Richard Hunt, many others, and it was at a time when art was becoming polarized, you know.  You did so-called black art which I found offensive because it's really African art, it's not black art.  I mean, it's, it's an ethnic kind of art and it's pure and it's beautiful and then there are, no matter where you come from, the same kind of art that you would find in a Polish museum, Polish American artists that were influenced by their homeland but they were more American than they were Polish, you know, and if they went over Polish, it was watered down, it wasn't, it wasn't really honest as far as I was concerned.  So, I think, what I tried to do was be as honest as far as I was concerned--
Story_ID: 197028
Speaker 1: My training that I had at the Art Institute [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] had nothing to do with anything, really.  First of all, I was more interested in printmaking which was, again, the mechanical, the mechanics of doing things, and as far as the things were concerned, whatever fit best into whatever my hands would tell me to do was what I did and I found it quite satisfying.  I had a printmaking studio in the back, at one time, but as I got sick, I couldn't operate the presses and do all that other stuff but, if I, like one time I was given a commission to do a piece for Valparaiso University [Valparaiso, Indiana] which was an illustration of 'The Prodigal Son' and I asked the guy who was in charge of the commission if I could use black people in it.  He said, do anything you want.  So I did, you know.  It was the prodigal son, the father was white and, you know, and he had black and cream-colored siblings.  That was great fun.  It went over quite well, as a matter of fact.  I thought surely somebody was going to question but they didn't.  Two of the major pieces that I did was a piece called 'Soul Box' which was a construction and it was an old slave looking sort of out of a window and an American flag was across the way.  So there was this, and then there was a sheet music, rolled up piece of sheet music, 'Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,' was right in the middle.  It was quite effective, it was very nice and then I did a game like tic-tac-toe only it was huge and it was about twenty-eight pieces of different faces of black people that I had done by collage and photography, you know by Photoshop and doing that sort of bit.  Unfortunately the same person that bought the 'Soul Box' bought the game piece and she had loaned out the 'Soul Box' to the Art Institute for a show.  They did a show on diversity of some kind, I don't know what, and she bought it and then my other piece was in the Arts Club Show and she bought, she bought it out of the Arts Club [of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  They were both very expensive and I didn't think, I didn't think a black person would buy them.  I know they would want to but I didn't think, I think they would buy somebody else's before they would buy my piece.  They would buy a Romare Bearden before they would buy me, you know, so, but anyway they did.  Some collectors have bought my work and they've given it to their children as they got older.  So I don't know where half the stuff is.  I know that the 'Soul Box' went to their granddaughter, or daughter or something or other, you know, but what can I do?  It's theirs.  I was in a show recently where they said you could borrow--oh, it was a show in northern Illinois and they wanted pieces that were owned by somebody else.  Well, I don't know who's bought half the stuff over the years.  I mean, how long have I been working?  So I just thought, I'd get a piece of my own and show it, which I did.  Got pieces wrapped up down there.
Story_ID: 196996
Speaker 1: Now, you were talking about your professor at the University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, Illinois] that inspired you to create this 'Napoleon in Hawaii' series.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was in, he interested me in Napoleon [Bonaparte] so that the first time I went to Paris [France], when I walked on the Place Vendome, I knew exactly where I was, I knew what had happened, you know, and it just seemed so right and that was, I don't know how many years ago and ever since then I've either read things or sort of enhanced my knowledge of Napoleon or bought things.  I belonged to the Napoleonic Society of North America [Napoleonic Historical Society] and I've been to a couple of conferences so I guess I'm sort of hooked now.  I mean, I got all this crap around here and some, some nice stuff, but, right, so.  It's part of the stuff I collect, you know.
Speaker 1: It's an eclectic collection of--
Speaker 2: It is very eclectic--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --from the boxes to the Mickey Mouse to the--
Speaker 1: You've got African art, beautiful pieces of African art--
Speaker 2: And Africans, right, right.
Speaker 1: --blue bottles--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and movie posters and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --like, you know, different figures.  There's a pig standing and playing the accordion.  I mean, a lot of different things here just a--
Speaker 2: And some fine arts, too, fine art pieces.
Speaker 1: Well, who's to say which is, you know, I guess you are, but tell us about this Napoleon series, Napoleon--
Speaker 2: Well, there is a black artist who has, his name is Colescott--
Speaker 1: Robert Colescott.
Speaker 2: Right, and he's done things like George Washington Carver crossing the Delaware [River] and, you know, things like that and that's where I got the idea to do 'Napoleon in Hawaii.'  So instead of a black dude, I just made it Napoleon and elaborated on it.  So I got all these things and I did, I got a lot of collage material from friends of mine in Hawaii, you know, that's why I got, in other museums, in other places where I go or some people, if you collect something and your friends know about it, you're gonna get it.  It's gonna come to you in one way or another.  I mean, the Mickey Mouse stuff.  I mean, I bought half of that, the other half people have given me.  The bottles and the wine glasses, well, I have expensive taste.  Those are all, some of those are Baccarat, some of them are Cartier and, you know, you know how you do.  I mean, I've been a good boy this year, I think I'll buy myself some, some Cartier Cobalt, you know, so.  And then the little pieces, people have given me.  And in the boxes, they're kind of eclectic too.  I mean, people have given me boxes from, sent me boxes from practically all over the world and I can't display them all and, you know, they were once displayed very tastefully and isolated and, you know, now it's in there.  You know, this would be, if this was smaller, this would be a box, a box collection.  It's a Japanese samurai sword box.  It opens up and you can slip your sword in there.
Speaker 1: Do you have the sword in there now?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: You know, I bought that piece by looking at a photograph and I thought it was about this high.  So, when the box came, and this thing, oh, came from Australia.
Story_ID: 196997
Speaker 1: Do you have a philosophy of art?
Speaker 2: Well, I buy what I like and if something speaks to me in the way that I feel it's original--when I was teaching art, I tried to tell my students that the hardest thing in the world is to try and do something that nobody else has done.  So when I set out to do a piece, the image may be original, the technique may be borrowed but the image is practically something nobody else has done, but if you really think about it, nothing is ever original.  Somebody else has either thought about it or did it or whatever but that still does not prevent you from trying to be original.  When I was doing printmaking, I tried to do original techniques.  Thematically, if you do something well enough and technically, the message is going to come across.  As [Pablo] Picasso says, if you are--despejarse, whatever, says, if you mean it, when you're doing it, the viewer, the message will come across.  So, my message, as in most of my art, has been twofold that you ask yourself, how original is this piece?  Have I seen any piece that looks like it and how different is it from the piece that I have seen?  I learned from every piece that I make, even the big piece over the mantel, that's not, it took me years to have it framed.  Number one, I knew where I wanted to put it, and it's too heavy for me to lift at this point, but it's not totally original.  The composition is not original but it's an interesting composition and then as other friends of mine and people who weren't friends begin to see it and like it, I thought, well maybe I better have it framed before I damage it.  My Napoleon pieces are original and some of them are technically good, some of them are not.  There is a, I used to, because I'm interested in material things, papers and any kind of thing that you can do art with, I used to react according to whatever papers I was using, whether I was a handmade paper or whether it was a paper that I bought or whether it was some newsprint that I saw in a magazine or newspaper and build my image around that, and I still do.
Story_ID: 196998
Speaker 1: I haven't done anything now in a year or two.  I don't have the energy that I had.  I've, a couple of Christmases ago, I used to do boxes at Christmas, nice little handmade, hand-covered original paper, really neat little things, and a lot of my friends began to look forward to them and two years ago I made the boxes and I got bored with them.  I just didn't have the energy to finish it.  Like that one, for instance, see that?  Give it to me.
Speaker 2: Oh, watch out now.  Here we go.
Speaker 1: Hold it.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Hold it up closer to your face.
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you could take the whole thing, probably and--
Speaker 2: The humidity has--it's acrylic paint.  Here we go.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you send them readily, I mean, already assembled, or do they--
Speaker 2: Well, it depends on the friends.  I have one friend that said, "Don't send me anymore of those, I still haven't figured out how to put it together," you know, but, and some people like it.  They like the challenge and I like to challenge, I made, I made another kind one Christmas that had drawers in it that, this won't open, and I like figuring it out mechanically.  It's a challenge to figure out how to do it and I like that.  I'll just set this back because I have to have it on a flat surface.

Speaker 1: What did your [adoptive] parents [Roy Arnold and Bertha Harris Arnold] think of your career?  You know, what did they think?
Speaker 2: We were, I was showing at the Hyde Park Art Fair [Hyde Park, Chicago, Illinois] and a friend of mine next to me, a girl, did beautiful pen and ink drawings, and my father said, "Now that's what I want you to--wish you would do," and I said, "but that's what's paying your mortgage (laughter).  So, they didn't know what they were looking at.  It was pretty art.  You know, it wasn't pretty, so.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: You've been looking at the [2004 Summer] Olympics [Athens, Greece]?  Who impresses you the most?  That girl [Joanna Hayes] who last night ran across, she, because the other girl [Perdita Felicien] tripped and fell and she won? She was gorgeous.  She spoke beautifully.  She spoke in a very educated way.  She had her hair in little things but they weren't offensive.  She looked like a Hollywood model.  She's just gorgeous.  That black guy that won, I think the 500 millimeter or something or other, he's light, again, he spoke like he was part of this country.  I guess, I'm really an American and I don't like Eminem [Marshall Bruce Mathers III] because he's trying to be what he's not.  I respect a lot of the black people who are, who have gone totally ethnic because they don't know any other way to go and I think that, I've tried to carry myself all my life in a way that I hope I set an example for some kids.  You know, this business about "You think you're white," you know, I never thought.  All I had, as I told, I always look in the mirror, I know I'm not white, you know, but I try to speak so I can communicate with other people because life is totally about communication, so that's, that's what I'm all about.  So if it's, I think if I'm multi-cultural, that's great, you know.  If I'm an American, that's great.  Whatever I am, I am who I am because of what I am.  I happen to be a black African American who has had all these different kinds of experiences and they've all rubbed off on me in some form or other and that's who I am.
Story_ID: 197001
Speaker 1: When you look back on your life's works up to this point, anyway, what would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I hope my legacy has been to increase curiosity in people, black kids especially.  I mean, so it's "How you do that?  How'd you do that Mr. Arnold?"  You know, I did a workshop in bookbinding at the Art Institute [of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] for Family Day and most of the little kids were black.  The kids that I--I looked at my work the most were the things that required the most time.  I mean, you've got to sew the books, you've got to fold the paper, you've got to do all this kind of stuff.  It's not an instant art because that doesn't, you know, just because you can throw paint at a wall, hey, how about that?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  You're not supposed to see that.  You're supposed to keep talking (laughter).
Speaker 2: Just because you can throw paint at a wall, does not mean that you're an artist, you know.  It's like, I've seen a lot of so-called white people create things by throwing paint and swirling it around, they think they're copying Jackson Pollock but that ain't the case.  Jackson Pollock knew exactly how to control his wrist, he knew how to flick those things and in a sense he was drawing as he made those swirls and he knew what he was--he knew what he was about and you don't get that way without playing, studying, and thinking, you know, I mean that's--and I used to pride myself in, into thinking I can glue anything, and I could.  I could glue anything, and this was before super glue.  I knew how to mix the glue, I knew how, which glue accepted what and I didn't get that from anybody except, a lot of it I got from Mrs. Aiko [Nakane], who had the Japanese paper store [Aiko's Art Materials] who died recently.  I can call her, I can ask her how to do anything with wallpaper paste, with flour and water, with anything and it would stick and stay, hide glue, whatever.  How to cook stuff.  So, I like to think I'm a resource sometimes too, you know, for anything.  I've taught art history for so many years and I know a lot about art history.  So, you know.  I wish that I knew, well I do, I know a lot about African art but not as much as I should know, I don't, I think.  I mean, the pure African stuff that you like, the stuff that you were talking about that you encountered in West Africa.  Did you see my West African cane back there?
Speaker 1: I think so.
Speaker 2: It's on the, on the buffet.  Now those, the reason we like a lot of those things is because of the craftsmanship.  I don't know how they glued those beads on there but they didn't have super glue and they did, you know, but they're on there and they stay.  Not one of them have fallen off since I've had it.  So, you know, I guess it's like, if you're gonna make a cake, know how to make one.

Speaker 1: Now is there anything, any major thing that you would do differently if you had it to do it again?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, I'd get a Ph.D.  I've given a lot of lectures and a lot of talks and juried a lot of things, you know, in my career.  I think I would be a little more aggressive in meeting some people, especially black artists.  I'd be a little more aggressive.  I, not just to be friends with them but as somebody said, to pick their brains, you know.  I mean, you know, would like to know what a lot of them are thinking because a lot of times you can't tell from the work but just to have a conversation.  Like when I went to see Romare Bearden.  It was just like this, you know, and then he gave me a little piece.  We just sat down, had a conversation and I asked him dumb questions and he answered them, so, we had a good time.

Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered, of course, as an artist.  I'd like to be remembered as an educator and that's, in all the sense of the word, you know, I've taught many different kinds of things and I feel the richer for it so I'd like to really be remembered as an artist and educator, you know.  A lot of, with someone with a lot of savvy, a lot of pride.  I believe in myself because I think I'm a reasonably good person.  I make mistakes but I think, you know, if I'm your friend, I'm your friend, you know, it's just, so, that's what I'd like to be remembered as.
