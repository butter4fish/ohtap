Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer for The HistoryMakers today.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you s- please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Anthony, A-N-T-H-O-N-Y, Preston, P-R-E-S-T-O-N, Burroughs, B-U-R-R-O-U-G-H-S [HistoryMaker Anthony "Tony" Preston Burroughs].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Although I'm known by Tony (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born on November 23, 1948 in Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a genealogist.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is July 19, 2005, I believe.
Speaker 1: Right.  And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) We're in HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] studio at 1900 South Michigan [Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  Is this checking on my mental competency?
Speaker 1: And how many fingers am I holding?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 1: No, that's the way we do it so the person is actually giving us the date, you know--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --it's authenticated.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's how I was trained.
Story_ID: 611714
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth--
Speaker 2: Sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) there are five lightweight, People magazine-ish type questions--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --that management compels me to ask everyone.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  Well, I'm a vegetarian, in New York they call me a fish-itarian [pescatarian], so fish, seafood is, is my favorite food, actually.  If you wanna pick one particular seafood, it's probably salmon.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Probably royal blue, I guess I have to put blue on now (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.  Now do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year.  Well I don't like winter, fall is pretty cool but, I guess, probably summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Vacation destination.  Not really, I don't know if I really take vacations, you know, I kind of mix vacations with, with work.  And I don't know if I've ever just--well, it's been a long time since I've just taken off just to relax somewhere.  So I would probably have to say no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Not that I'm aware of, I might but not that I'm thinking about.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Most people have one when they hit their thumb with a hammer or something (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Ouch.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: S-H-I-T, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Sometimes, yeah.
Story_ID: 611715
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And I know this could take a while--
Speaker 2: That's all right, we've got time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) interviewing a genealogist.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: 'Cause most black people don't know.
Speaker 2: Right, absolutely.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and then your father's [Elmer Burroughs] side--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --of the family, and we'll do it like that.
Speaker 2: That's fine.
Speaker 1: So can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure.  My mother's name is Mary Ellen Gertrude Burroughs [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs], although she never liked to use Gertrude.  I'm sorry, her, her maiden name was Brooks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her married name is Burroughs, her maiden name is Brooks.
Speaker 1: Brooks Burroughs, okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born on June 21, 1926.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Okay, Pittsburgh.  Okay.  Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace 'em?  Well, this (unclear) we have very little tape.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well I can trace my mother's side of the family back to my seventh generation ancestors born in 1781 in Fayette County, Pennsylvania which is, I don't know, thirty, forty miles south of, of Pittsburgh.  It's right bordering on, on what is now West Virginia; used to be, you know, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's, it's actually, yeah.  Okay.  And what were your ancestors doing back in 1781?
Speaker 2: They were slaves, they were actually slaves in Pennsylvania.  They had migrated into the state in 1773 with a slave owner by the name of Margaret Hutton [Margaret Goe Hutton].  And they lived in Prince George's County, Maryland.  They left Prince George's County in, in 1773 with about twenty-five slaves and all their relatives.  They went into Fayette County, Pennsylvania, thinking it was Virginia.  There was actually a border dispute between Pennsylvania and Virginia, which is why we have the Mason-Dixon Line which, you know, is the lower part of, of Pennsylvania.  After they settled the border dispute then that area that they were in which originally was like Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, it was legally determined that that was actually Pennsylvania.  So they were farmers, my ancestors worked on (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In those days though it wasn't really like that that was like the Wild West territory, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: The West.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  In fact, it was the colonial period because, you know, the country didn't start until 1776, they came here in 1773.  So it was before, you know, the Revolutionary War.  So Pennsylvania was actually a, a colony at that time.  I can't recall when all the Indians [Native American] had left out of that area, there were still a few left but most of them, you know, like had, had been put out at that time.  But as you say it was very virgin territory.  The slave owners were the first ones to patent land there which means it was originally land that was transferred from the federal government to private individuals.  And I don't have copies of, of their land patents but I do have a, a patent map which shows where the land was and who their neighbors were and what the, the warrants and, and the patent numbers were.  But they settled on, on a piece of land along the Monongahela River.  Monongahela River leads into Pittsburgh which joins the Allegheny River which starts the Ohio River and then flows down south into the Mississippi [Mississippi River].  But they were farmers and my ancestors were slaves that worked on that particular farm.
Story_ID: 611716
Speaker 1: The Goes, well the slave owner's name was actually Margaret Hutton [Margaret Goe Hutton], her maiden name was Goe.  So the Goes came in [to Fayette County, Pennsylvania], the Huttons came in, and there were several other families that came in from Prince George's County [Maryland].
Speaker 2: How do you spell Goes?
Speaker 1: G-O-E.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: G-O-E.  I was able to find now a will written in 1795 that the slave owner had written when she was elderly and in poor health, which listed my ancestors there and actually made provisions for freeing them.  She died two years later in 1797.  My seventh generation ancestor, David Truman, they made provisions in the will for him to be freed when he was twenty-five years old.  With a law, Pennsylvania was the first state to pass a gradual abolition, well they passed an abolition act, it happened to be a gradual abolition act [An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery of 1780] so that the slaves were not freed immediately but when they became twenty-eight years old. But my ancestor was, excuse me, freed when he was twenty-five, which was 1806.  He first shows up on the census records in 1810.  Now some of the other slaves there were freed at various times depending on what the provisions were in the will.  The land was to be sold and the proceeds divided up and shared amongst some of the slaves.  So there was provisions for each and every one and for also some groups.  What I'm in the process of doing is analyzing all of those twenty-five to twenty-eight different slaves that were mentioned in that will to see which ones, if any, were related to my ancestors.  Oftentimes we assume that all of these people were related but they weren't necessarily related.  Now I do know some of 'em related because it says so and so wife and children and whatever.  So sometimes it'll state that explicitly, sometimes it's implied because people are listed, you know, with a woman and children so it's almost implied that those are her children.  However, oftentimes a person would develop a relationship with a woman on a neighboring farm, so it's very well that some of my ancestors could have been on neighboring farms, you know, not all from that one particular farm that this lady had, had owned.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.  So, so she freed hers, that wouldn't, that wouldn't necessarily mean that their wives and children would be freed on other farms.
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  And see hers were freed by will, which means once she died they were free.  And again, they weren't freed immediately.  My, my ancestor was stipulated in the will that he should be hired out until he became twenty-five.  So one of her relatives or one of her friends actually hired him on their farm until he became twenty--twenty-five.  I do not know which farm that he went to after he left, you know, the original owner, Margaret Hutton, so that's another piece I'm trying to do some research on and, and understand.
Story_ID: 611717
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know there are quite a few stories in the late 1700s, early 1800s of people in the northern states and even some in Virginia freeing their slaves and is it--. And how long did this, I know slavery was, was finally I mean the, the trade was outlawed in, in slavery--
Speaker 2: Eighteen--the prairie trade was outlawed in 1808.  The transatlantic slave trade--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in 1808.
Speaker 1: And most of the northern states, you know, had abolished slavery, at least to some extent by, by that time, right?
Speaker 2: You know, I've been, I've been looking at that lately. Each state was somewhat different.  What happened was the Revolutionary War from 1776, there was this whole thing about freeing them, you know, all men were created equal and they were freeing themselves from, from Great Britain and the whole system set up of kings and queens passing down, you know, control of, of the government into representative government style.  Well from the Revolutionary War, ironically, a lot of people believed that all people were created equal.  Now everybody didn't believe that but some of 'em did.  So with that, they started freeing some of their slaves.  The Quakers were some of the first ones and they mandated that, you know, they should free their slaves but some of them didn't believe that so they gave up the Quaker religion.  Others moved, you know, to other parts of the country.  So with the Revolutionary War and with Pennsylvania, you know, each individual state in the North started, you know, either passing an act for total abolition or gradual abolition and then they just started kind of like falling by dominos, you know, all the states in the North.  Obviously the states in the South kept on with slavery.  However, particularly Virginia and Maryland had very large numbers of free blacks in those two particular states.  Particularly up until the time of, you know, 1860 prior to the Civil War breaking out.  We know from census records that there were over two hundred thousand, I think, over 220- thirty thousand [230,000] free blacks in the North prior to the Civil War.  What a lot of people don't realize is that in the South, there were more free blacks in the South than there were in the North.  I think there were something like 270,000 free in the South, particularly in Maryland and Virginia.  There was a, a decent free population in South Carolina particularly in the Charleston [South Carolina] area.  There were a lot of free blacks in Louisiana, particularly in, in New Orleans [Louisiana] area.  So oftentimes we don't, we don't really think about that, you know.  We don't think about free blacks in the South, and we don't think about slavery in the North, you know.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Those are weird concepts, you know.
Speaker 1: I think, now that I think about it, I think slavery lasted in New York State a lot longer than--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --than 1808.  I think it had, it was actually--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well actually, even though the, the law in Pennsylvania was passed in, in 1780 [An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery of 1780], there were actually slaves in Pennsylvania as late as the 1840, so--because it was a, you know, like a gradual act, you know.
Story_ID: 611718
Speaker 1: There are stories, here in, I know here in Illinois that--you've heard of the Old Slave House [Crenshaw House] on Route 1 [Illinois Route 1] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, I've been there, yeah.
Speaker 1: And they had slaves--
Speaker 2: Gallatin, Illinois [Gallatin County, Illinois], right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: When they had slavery going on in 1860--well right up to the Civil War.
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, sure, sure.  Yeah well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Some kind of special contract with the government to, to salt and to mine the salt--
Speaker 2: Right, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: Deposits.
Speaker 2: See there was, there was slavery in Illinois, there was slavery in Indiana.  I know particularly in Indiana there were a lot of Kentucky farmers that wanted some of the land in Indiana.  They freed their slaves in Kentucky, moved across the river into Indiana but they immediately took their former slaves and entered them into indentures for like twenty, thirty, forty years and whatever.  So it was essentially legalized slavery, you know.  So you look at these folks and, and the records state that they're free but in actuality they really aren't, you know.
Speaker 1: It, it makes for a different landscape of America when you think about it (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: When you go up here they're free but then--. In Ohio, I know stories from Ohio too, John Patterson [John Henry Patterson] in Dayton [Ohio] who was the grandfather [sic.] of the founder of the NCR [National Cash Register Company, Dayton, Ohio] had--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --his slaves from Kentucky picking fruit in, in--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Dayton, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: He was brought up on charge, charges over and over again.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: But he would always slip through. He'd say, "Hey I'm gonna move 'em back," you know, "when we get finished doing this work."
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: So it wasn't illegal to transfer your slave as such to a free state--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and have 'em work.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, exactly.  That's, that's what that whole Dred Scott case [Dred Scott v. Sandford, 1857] was about--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know. And it was, you know, slave--you know, the French brought slaves, you know, into Illinois and they were there for years.  And there's a, a lot of slavery court cases, you know, in Illinois.  There's a whole book on, on slavery in Illinois, you know.  So, you know, unless you really start doing some research and get into some nuts and bolts, you know, you, you just operate on these, you know, just generalities and myths, you know.  But, you know, plus on the, on the same hand there were a lot of Union strongholds in the South and a lot of liberals in the South too, you know.  So it's much more complicated than, you know, what we're led to believe.
Speaker 1: Right, so that, that really, I guess, emphasizes why research, research is so important.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Any individual case can be so unique as far as--
Speaker 2: Right, right, yeah, yeah, very much so, yeah.
Speaker 1: And the, the laws of that locale or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that, you know, or whoever decides--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to free 'em what they're thinking about.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: The religious group around there or--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --could be it.
Speaker 2: I had a particular challenge in a case with, with my ancestors, the ones that were slaves in, in Pennsylvania because a lot of people were skirting around the law and they didn't want their--see if their slaves were born in Pennsylvania after 1780, they were only slaves, you know, up until twenty-eight.  So what they did was they took the, the slave women that were pregnant and they took 'em across the border to Virginia to be born and then brought 'em back to Pennsylvania, skirted around the law.  So then they had to do another law in 1788, you know, to make provisions for that so it would close that particular loophole, you know.  But with that, slave owners had to bring their slaves into the courthouse and they had to register them.  So there's registers of, of those slaves in 1780, 1788, you know, and other time periods.  So what I'd had to do is look at those registrations, you know, to find my ancestors on there and I've had a difficult time because there were--he [David Truman] was born in 1781 which is the year after they passed the law [An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery of 1780] but I never found his name on the registration.  And so analyzing, you know, the entire registration and looking at the numbers, 'cause once they registered they had a little number on there and the numbers, you know, were not in order. Well I had to enter all that data into my computer, you know, and then sort it out according to the numbers and then I found out that all the registrations weren't there.  And I contacted the State of Pennsylvania and they realized they hadn't filmed everything so they went back and re-filmed the stuff and they found some other stuff that, that hadn't been filmed.  They still didn't find, you know, my ancestor listed on there but it just goes to show you, you know, you gotta be like very, very thorough, you know, and, and there's a lot of--well, we've lost so many records, you know, throughout the course of, of, of this country, it's just incredible.  Although it's amazing how much stuff does exist, you know.
Story_ID: 611719
Speaker 1: So your ancestors on your mother's [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs] side did they stay around Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] or around that area?
Speaker 2: Well they stayed in Fayette County [Pennsylvania] up until around 1918, up until the 20th century.  They were all along Monongahela River.  They were in Newell [Pennsylvania], which is where the original slaves were.  They were in Monongahela City [Pennsylvania].  They were in Fayette City [Pennsylvania].  They were in Charleroi [Pennsylvania]; Brownsville [Pennsylvania]; Little Washington, PA, which is in Washington County [Pennsylvania], you know, the next county over.  Some of 'em moved into Wheeling, West Virginia.  So they're all up and down this river.  And then they came into Pittsburgh around 1918.  Some of them went north of Pittsburgh, a place called West Middlesex [Pennsylvania]; Sharon [Pennsylvania]; and Farrell [Pennsylvania], which is close to Youngstown, Ohio.  And they came there up around 19--I think it was 1908, I think I first saw them up there working in the steel, the steel mills, the steel plants.  Some of them were coal miners, some of them worked in the steel plants, some of them were farmers.  You know, kind of traditional Pennsylvania, you know, like occupations, you know.  So yeah, they, they stayed near. I, I still have relatives, you know, in Pennsylvania now.  I knew none of that before I started researching my family history.  You know, I knew my mom was from Pittsburgh and she was one of the first ones, you know, to, to migrate from Pittsburgh to Chicago [Illinois].  So when we were little kids we would take trips to Pittsburgh to see my grandparents [Lydia Terrell Brooks and Preston C. Brooks], you know, and my cousins and, and aunts and uncles and whatever.  But even then I had no idea that they had been in Pennsylvania so long, had no idea they had been slaves in Pennsylvania.  When I talked to relatives no one had ever, you know, heard of any slaves.  Once I started doing my family history, everyone started telling me about this ancestor named Old Uncle Davey [David Truman], you know.  And everybody remembered a story about Old Uncle Davey and the fact that he had lived to be a hundred years old or really over a hundred years old.  Some said 120, some said 110, a 115, I got all these particular, you know, estimates on, on what his age was.  And everybody said he walked, you know, everywhere he went.  You know, at that time people were riding horses, you know.  The trains, you know, came through town, you know, and people rode trains a lot.  But with Old Uncle Davey everyone said that he walked everywhere, you know.  So everyone that told me some little story about he was walking here and walking there, you know.  And finally one day one of the relatives had a, had a photograph of him which really blew me away and he looked very, very, old, very dark skin, very old and wrinkled, he was leaning up against a wall with a cane, had a old, real woolen vest on, you know, a shirt which now looks modern because it was one of these collarless shirts, you know, with, with stripes in it, you know.  So you look at that and you say well, you know, I can buy that in the store today, (laughter) you know.  But it just goes to show you how, you know, some fashion folks have gone back and taken some ideas from the past, you know.  But when I researched him I found out he was never born a slave, he was free but he was the son of, of a slave, you know.  So some of my relatives were really shocked when they had found out that, you know, the ancestors were actually slaves from Pennsylvania but, you know, they had been there for, for many, many, many years.  And later on I, I did some research and found an article that said that more people had ancestors born in, more people that lived in Pennsylvania had ancestors that lived in Pennsylvania than any other state.  So it was the fact that for some reason people in Pennsylvania kind of like stayed put, you know.  I don't know if they figured out why but it was just, you know, like doing some surveys, you know.  So I was kind of surprised that that pertained to my ancestors also, you know.
Story_ID: 611720
Speaker 1: Are there any stories that are passed down other than the story about Old, Old Uncle Davey [David Truman]?  Any, any other good stories that come down from that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well see my family is kind of an aberration.  It's not--well I wouldn't say it's a aberration, I say it's the norm.  There's a myth out there that black families have strong oral history.  My family did not really any strong oral history.  These stories I got from Uncle Davey, I had to go out and, and interview relatives really, those that I had never even met, talk to them, and they had told me some of these stories, you know.  There was a particularly very interesting story, I guess, where when I interviewed my mom [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs] about the family history. And I figured that my mom had known about her grandmother [Mary Terrell] and when I asked my mom to tell me some stories about my grandmother [sic. great-grandmother], I kind of got a real strange reaction.  She said that she hated her grandmother.  And I said well, you know, why did you hate your grandmother?  And she told me that it was because her mother--her grandmother didn't raise my mother's mother [Lydia Terrell Brooks], that she gave her away to a foster family and because of that she hated her for doing that.  Then I asked her why did, you know, she give her daughter away because I couldn't conceive of a mother giving her daughter away, and she said because she was out partying and gallivanting and having a good time, she didn't have time to raise children.  And I thought that was, you know, like kind of strange, you know, as well as someone hating their grandmother because on my father's [Elmer Burroughs] side I had a very loving relationship with my grandmother [Alma Rice Burroughs], you know, so someone hating their grandmother to me was very bizarre, you know.  So I started doing some research on it and my mother's sister was kind of like the griot of the family, my Aunt Doris [Doris Brooks], she was one of my mother's older sisters, my mother had two older sisters and an older brother [Preston S. Brooks]. My mother, you know, was the baby of the family.  So this older sister, my Aunt Doris, had lived with a lot of the older relatives.  So she knew them and she was the kind of person that liked to listen to old stories, she liked to talk about the relatives, and she was really into the older people.  You know, like some people, you know, they ain't into old folks, (laughter) you know.  They're living for today, you know, and they might deal with young folks but they don't like to deal with older ones but fortunately my mother's older sister, you know, liked to deal with them.  So she had known a lot about my, my grandparents.  She had lived, she had lived with my mother's grandparents, her grandparents for a while, so she got to know them.  She also knew some of the older aunts and uncles.  She also told me about some other relatives that lived in Pitt- Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Story_ID: 611721
Speaker 1: One of my mother's [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs] cousins by the name of Jim Truman [ph.] who I'd interviewed, was about like seventy-four years old, he also lived with his grandparents which were like my great-grandparents and my great-great-grandparents, so he had known them and had told me some stories about them.  My mother's grandparents were the Terrells, which were also born and raised in, in Pennsylvania but their ancestors had come from Virginia.
Speaker 2: T-E-R-R-E--.
Speaker 1: T-E-R-R-E-L-L, Terrells.  Not related to Margaret Church Terrell [Mary Church Terrell], you know, from Virginia, that I know of, you know. I've traced them back quite a ways.  In fact, I think I've traced them back up until around the 1820s, you know, and the Terrells married into the Trumans who my ancestors were as, as slaves.  But this Jim Truman who I'd interviewed and he lived on a farm out in, in southwestern Pennsylvania, and he told me a lot of stories about growing up on the farm and the jobs that he had did on the farm.  And the fact that during like planting season and harvest season, relatives would come by and work on the farm because they would work on other relatives' farms and also other people, you know, just people that they had hired had come in and worked on the farm.  And he had known my, my great-grandparents, William [William Terrell] and Mary Terrell who were older than, than he was, I think they were his, his aunt and uncle.  And he used to call him Uncle Bill Terrell.  And he said that he had remembered hearing some stories, he had got some stories from, from Uncle Bill Terrell and said he used to get in trouble and he had heard that, you know, he thought he would, he would say stuff like oh, yeah, I'd, I'd kill a guy in a second, you know (laughter).  And so I said, you know, I'd ask him, you know, did he ever really kill anybody and he said well, he doesn't know if he ever killed anybody but, you know, they used to get in trouble and ride back down to Virginia, you know, until the heat got off, you know, 'cause they was riding horses and stuff, you know.  But he had remembered that, you know, they would get in trouble all the time.  And then I had found some other relatives and they had said the Terrells, you know, you know, would get into trouble also, you know.  So once I started doing research, I found out that Bill Terrell happened to be in prison, I found him on the census records in prison in 1900.  And so I tried to track it down because when I, you know, asked my mother about it, she had never heard her grandfather was in prison.  Her sister, my Aunt Doris [Doris Brooks], never heard that, you know, her grandfather was in prison.  So I went to Pennsylvania and I found some records at the state archives were in fact, some prison records that showed he had been in prison, showed what year he was incarcerated, the fact that he was convicted of assault and attempted murder, so he actually tried to kill somebody.  It said the date he was incarcerated, I think it was 1895 or 1898.  He had a bullet wound in his chest when he was incarcerated.  So there was some truth to this guy's story.  So what I did was, I went to the local area where they lived in Brownsville [Pennsylvania] and I found some newspapers, and the newspaper talked about these guys.  It was, it was an article in the newspaper, a couple articles, that described what had happened and the fact that they were in a saloon drinking, so happened that this guy, you know, was eyeing his wife, you know (laughter), and they got into an argument about it, he pulled out his revolver and he shot the guy.
Story_ID: 611722
Speaker 1: So the man was shot and he--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They were in a saloon in, in Brownsville [Pennsylvania] and they got into an argument and my [maternal] great-grandfather, William Terrell, shoots this other guy.  Once he shoots him, he hauls out the tavern--he's, he has to go to the other side of town to go, get home.  Well when he gets home, his brothers are there and they see he's got this bullet wound so they come out, you know, and they see this mob trying to, you know, like lynch him, you know, so they pull out their guns and they say, hey no one's gonna touch this guy, you know, until the sheriff gets here.  And the sheriff is in another town, he rides in on his horse and he sees all this wild angry mob, you know, and says, hey, you know, it's the wildest scene he had ever seen in his life, you know, so he arrests him.  Oh, and the other thing that happened too was that once he--the mob chases him, a constable joins the mob, the constable shoots him, that's how he gets the bullet wound in his chest, then he turns around and he shoots the constable, so now he's then shot two guys, you know.  So he gets to the crib, his brothers, you know, boarded the crib, they hold off the mob with their guns, sheriff gets there, then they arrest him and they take him to the hospital 'cause they think he's gone die from this bullet wound in his chest.  He survives, the constable survives, and the other guy who he shot in the saloon, he survives too.  So they have a trial and then he gets sentenced to like, I think, it's five years to life in a state penitentiary.
Speaker 1: Five years to life?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's a big difference isn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Which I think, from what I heard is some kind of, just a standard, almost like, what do they have now, like mandatory sentences, you know.  I think, it was some kind of standard thing, you know.  But actually I was in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] a couple years ago and I went by the state penitentiary where he was actually incarcerated, you know.  It's right, it's in the City of Pittsburgh but at that time it was in Allegheny [Allegheny City, Pennsylvania] which was the city bordering on, on Pittsburgh, but it's right along the Allegheny River, you know, so the penitentiary is still there which kind of freaked me out.  But yeah, so what happened was, when he got convicted and sentenced to prison, his wife [Mary Terrell] has two kids, my grandmother [Lyda Terrell Brooks] and her sister, so she's gotta go out and get a job.  The only job a black woman could get in the 1890s was working as a domestic, cooking, cleaning, taking care of someone's house.  So I, when I found her on the census record in 1900, she's living with this white family.  My Aunt Doris [Doris Brooks] knew that family because they'd owned the newspaper in town, my mother [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs] didn't know anything about it but my Aunt Doris, you know, knew about 'em but she didn't know why she was living with that white family.  So when she has to go get this job, she has to take these two kids and do something with these two kids.  So one of the kids she takes to her parents, my grand- my mother's aunt, she takes her to her parents to be raised and her parents raise her.  She takes the other child, my grandmother, and she takes to her brother and her brother raised that child.  But the brother and his wife get divorced and the wife asks to keep custody of my grandmother.  So she wasn't raised by a foster family, it was really an in-law.  But what happened was the mother never told the two kids the reason they were raised in another household was because their father was in prison for shooting two guys.  So the kids never knew it and their kids never knew it and their kids never knew it, nobody knew until I tracked it down almost a hundred years later.  And then I've realized that my mother hated her grandmother for the wrong reason because she didn't know the family history, you know.  So here you have some stories that are passed down but not the whole story, you know, until I was able to combine the oral history with the research and then piece everything together, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's the value of history.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Well the value of genealogy.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, yeah, yeah, of tracking it down, you know.  And I often repeat that story and tell people this is one of the reasons we need to do genealogy because we've got skeletons in the closet because that oral history has not been passed down and when it has been passed down, you know, it changes from generation to generation so by the time you get it, it's very little like what it originally was, you know.  So we need to get the oral stories as well as we need to do the research also and then, you know, differentiate the, the, the difference between fact and what is fiction, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So I was very fortunate I was able to do that, you know.  When now my, my Aunt Doris has Alzheimer's, you know, and she did not tell me that story now, you know.  Jim Truman [ph.] who told me this story about him shooting these people, you know, he's dead and gone.  Fortunately, I have, you know, interviewed him on tape recorder and I got those stories on tape.  Other people I've interviewed, you know, in, in Pennsylvania, I've interviewed them and I have them on tape and all of them are, are deceased now, you know.  Fortunately, my great-grandmother, her sister was still living when I started doing research, my grandmother's sister was, was still living so I was able to get a lot of stories, you know, like very early on.  And but yeah, those are, you know, some of my ancestors that that lived in Pennsylvania.  William Terrell, once he got out of prison, he moved up to, to Farrell, Pennsylvania, up north of, of Pittsburgh.  He opened up a barbershop and was kind of like self-employed, well he was, in fact, self-employed.  His wife worked in, worked for the church, she was also a domestic, you know.  They were the founders of one of the--it was a, a camp, the Church of God has a campgrounds up in West Middlesex [Pennsylvania] and she was one of the ones who was one of the founders of that campground, West Middlesex.
Story_ID: 611723
Speaker 1: My grandfather, my mother's father was an engineer, what we call now a janitor more or less in the Pittsburgh Public Schools.  But his father was a Buffalo Soldier who actually was born in South Carolina; 1852, 1854, around that period, married, had two children, him and his wife split up 1880, actually 1885, went over to Cincinnati [Ohio], joined the [U.S. military] service, was in the 9th Cavalry [9th Cavalry Regiment] stationed out in--well he did his basic training in Jefferson Barracks right south of (snaps fingers) St. Louis [Jefferson Barracks Military Post, St. Louis County, Missouri].  After he did his basic training then he was shipped out to Fort Riley, Kansas.  He stayed in Fort Riley for two and a half years.  Before Oklahoma became a state, it was Indian territory where they shipped all the, the Indians or Native American people from Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Carolinas, Louisiana, up into what is now Oklahoma which they called Indian territory.  White folks wanted their land, they went down and, and tried to steal their land before the Oklahoma land rush.  They called out the cavalry, my great-grandfather, Preston Brooks, is one of the ones they had called out.  They went down, they arrested the white folks which they called the, the boomers which were, were the land boomers, arrested them, took 'em to jail, which, you know, was a, you know, a repeating process.  So then he shipped out of Fort Riley, Kansas, and went out to--'cause he joined the service in 1882, 1885 he left Fort Riley went out to Wyoming, spent another two and a half years in Wyoming, mustered out of the service in 1887.  He was in Fort McKinney, Wyoming.  He returned to Junction City, Kansas, which is adjacent to Fort Riley, Kansas, applied for a pension, never got the pension, but with his contacts in the cavalry, he was able to get a job at Fort Robinson, Nebraska, where the 9th Cavalry had left Wyoming and went into neighboring Nebraska.  He got the third highest job working on the fort.  At Fort Robinson he was a manger of the pump works and, and the, the water mill there at the fort.  And then he stayed there until he died in, in 1905.  And then he had children, all his daughters married, you know, soldiers who were in the [U.S.] military.  Some of them stayed there in, in Crawford, Nebraska which is right adjacent to Fort Robinson.  Some of 'em moved a little further east in Valentine, Nebraska where they had Fort Niobrara.  And then I still have relatives that are there in Nebraska I've never even met, you know.  Then my grandfather who was born in Fort Riley and then, you know, went up into Crawford, you know, with his father, he eventually came in to Pennsylvania where he met my, my grandmother [Lydia Terrell Brooks] who was raised in, in Elizabeth [Pennsylvania] with again, this uncle.  So they had met in, I guess, I don't know if they actually met in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] or Elizabeth, I think they must have met in, in Elizabeth.  I've had difficulty tracking down my grandfather.  The stories that were passed down from my [maternal] aunt [Doris Brooks] said that he went with Allis-Chalmers to Nagasaki [Japan] and Yokohama [Japan] out, out in Japan and the Philippines.  And then he came to Pennsylvania and met my grandmother.  Although I've been in Allis-Chalmers records up in, in Milwaukee [Wisconsin], I haven't found any reference to that.  I've been to the National Archives [National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, D.C.], looked in the passport records, didn't find any passport records for him.  So I haven't been able to verify that.  She said he went to the East Denver High School [East High School, Denver, Colorado], was the first black that went to East Denver, I went out to Denver [Colorado], couldn't find any record of him out there.  So again, there's a disconnect between that that oral history and what I've been able to find in the record.  But I did verify that he did work for the Pittsburgh school system until he died in 1954, I believe, it was.
Speaker 2: Well that's something.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: His name was Preston Brooks [Preston C. Brooks]?
Speaker 1: Preston Brooks, right.
Story_ID: 611724
Speaker 1: You know, there's a f- you've heard of the famous Preston Brooks that beat Charles Sumner down with the cane in the--
Speaker 2: You know your history (laughter).
Speaker 1: --in [U.S.] Congress.  Is, is he [Burroughs' maternal grandfather, Preston C. Brooks], somehow related to that, that Preston Brooks?
Speaker 2: I think there's a good possibility.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was thinking that, you know, the name being (unclear).
Speaker 2: I'm trying to track it down.  My, my middle name is Preston which came from my grandfather, Preston Clyde Brooks.  My uncle's name is, is Preston Simmons Brooks [Preston S. Brooks].  My grandfather, Preston Clyde Brooks, he was the son of the Preston, of the Buffalo Soldier Preston S. Brooks [Preston Brooks], who was born in Edgefield, South Carolina, the same place where the Preston Brooks who was the, in the [U.S.] House of Representatives that accosted Charles Sumner.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And when I do research in Columbia, South Carolina, at the University of South Carolina, there's a big bust of Preston Brooks, the white Preston Brooks in the House, and every time I go in and research that's what I see.
Speaker 1: Man, what a character.  I mean, I, I think he--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --he beat Sumner down with a cane on the floor of Congress.
Speaker 2: Well he was actually in his chambers [sic.].  What happened was Charles Sumner made a speech in the [U.S.] Senate castigating Pierce Butler [sic. Andrew Butler] who was Preston Brooks' uncle [sic. cousin].  So he was very incensed by that and he said he wanted to challenge him to a duel, which they did very often in, in South Carolina, particularly in, in Edgefield. Edgefield was one of the most violent counties in the United States.  He said he would not challenge Sumner to a duel because he was a northern liberal so that would be beneath him.  So what he did was he went into Charles Sumner's chambers one day and took his cane--Sumner was, was sitting at his, at his desk doing work and Preston Brooks came behind him and he took his cane and he started beating him on his shoulder.  Once he got this rap on his shoulder, he turned around and he saw this guy just, just beating him and he tried to get up.  He could not get up because his desk was bolted to the floor, so in trying to get up, he couldn't get up immediately, so that's why he kept beating him and beating him, so he had to actually push his chair away toward Preston Brooks in order to get out.  So he had got beaten, you know, like several times before he was able to get out of there and he was injured for the rest of his life.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think he, he didn't live long after that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: They said he, and he wasn't in his right, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --mind.  That was really a horrible thing, you know (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  And they said it was one of the precipitating incidents that led to the Civil War.  There was a lot of articles in the newspaper about it.  And they were talking about this is evidence of the savagery of the South.  Preston Brooks' friends honored him for defending slavery and defending the southern way of life and all of them sent him canes, some of them gold tipped canes, you know, for what he had done.
Speaker 1: Beat some more.
Speaker 2: Right, right, (laughter) right, right, right, right, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: What a country.
Speaker 2: I know, I know.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: So they have, they still have a big bust of him in, in, in Columbia, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at the University of South Carolina in the library there, there's a big bust of him.  So every time that I go down there to research, you know, that's the first thing, I see (laughter).
Speaker 1: Chances are, who knows, I mean this--we interviewed playwright [HistoryMaker] Douglas Turner Ward--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --from New York [New York] about--just about a month and a half ago, and he's related, he said I'm related to the most evil man in the--ever--most evil white man--
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: --the United States has ever produced.
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: And I said, "Well who could that be?"
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now it wasn't Preston Brooks.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But, you know, who do you think it was?
Speaker 2: Well the first thing in my mind would, would probably be Adolf Hitler but he wasn't from the United States.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But this was someone from the U.S.?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was, it was Nathan Bedford Forrest.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, for real.
Speaker 1: Founder of the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK], you know.  And--
Speaker 2: Wow, right, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --he said, he said I, when I guessed, I said, "Well the only one I can think of is Nathan Bedford Forrest."  He said--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --he said that's it.  That's the one.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --and, and--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: So their--his--one of his ancestors was a slave, was impregnated by Nathan Bedford Forrest, who actually escaped the plantation and made his [sic.] way--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --to New Orleans [Louisiana], was re-enslaved--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: --until after the war.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, right.
Speaker 1: Family tradition, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Interesting, yeah.  Well the oral history I got from, from a cousin, one of my mother's [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs] first cousins, said that Preston Brooks' father was white, said he came over on a ship from Italy, you know, but I didn't find any evidence of that.  However, Preston Brooks, I have a photograph of him, he's very, very light skinned, looks like he's white, and he's listed in the records as a mulatto.  And when I find him on the 1870 census in Edgefield, South Carolina, he's living with another white family, he's not living with any siblings or, or any parents.  So it'd be very interesting once I track down to see actually who his parents were, you know.  But it was in the same county where, you know, the white Preston Brooks was from and this guy is a mulatto so there's some kind of connection.  I don't know if it's a blood connection or some other but there's some kind of connection there.
Speaker 1: They were probably at least on that plantation, yeah, if nothing else, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well Preston Brooks didn't have a plantation, he was a, he was an attorney.  Now his family had very large plantations, you know, the Brooks family had, had very large plantations so they had very, very large numbers of slaves.  I haven't been able to determine if Preston Brooks had slaves, and if he did, how many he had, but I would not doubt if he did but it would probably be, you know, like small in number because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Household servants and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly, exactly.
Story_ID: 611725
Speaker 1: So anyway, we gotta get you, we'll get rolling into your life at some point but--
Speaker 2: Oh, that's fine, that's fine.
Speaker 1: --can you give us your--any other, other stories about your mother's [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs] side of the family that, just for the--
Speaker 2: That's probably some of the, the key points.  Let me just think for one quick second.  That's probably, you know, some of the key points.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your mother talk about growing up and going to school and, and did--she, she was raised in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was born and raised in Pittsburgh.  And one of the biggest mistakes I made in genealogy is expecting my mother to live to old age.  When we do genealogy, I always tell people to make a list of your living relatives, prioritize that list by age, and get to the older ones first and interview them, which is what I did.  You know, I found out my great-grandmother's sister was still living, I think she was about ninety-six, and I went to her and tried to interview her.  My grandmother [Lydia Terrell Brooks] had deceased on my mother's side but my grandmother's sister was still living and she was in her eighties and I went and interviewed her, and these people that were seventy years old.  So I concentrated on those older people which is exactly what you need to do.  But you, on the same hand, should not neglect your parents and your aunts and uncles and that's what I did.  And so my mother developed an ulcer and died in her early sixties.  So I never took the time to interview her about her life.  When I first went to interview her she said I'm the baby of the family, I don't know anything about the family's history, go talk to my older sister, you know, her [sic.] Aunt Doris [Doris Brooks].  So I got stories from her older sister, I got stories from her eldest sister, you know, her, her sister, Margaret Ann [Margaret Brooks], you know.  So I did get stories from them but I realize after the fact, I should have sat my mother down and got her autobiography which I never did and I feel very, very, you know, bad about that.  So I have some stories about my, my mother but nothing near, you know, like what I really should have.  My mother graduated from high school.  She went to Schenley High School in Pittsburgh, never went to college.  My mother learned how to sew, I think she was about four or five years old.  She learned how to sew and went into the closet and cut a swatch out of her mother's dress to make some clothes for her doll baby (laughter).  And naturally she got a big whooping, but I mean she liked to sew.  So she sewed all her life.  My mother had four boys and she always wanted a girl and she kept on trying until she got a girl and the fifth one was a girl.  So my baby sister is the baby of the family.  When my sister grew up, my mother made all her clothes.  She never bought any clothes for her, she made everything.  My mother taught me how to sew. I have--I own two sewing machines (laughter) and I learn, excuse me, and I learned how to sew from my mother.  I, I made a shirt, I made a pair of pants, but the main thing I did was repair my clothes, you know, when they got ripped and torn, whatever, I brought out my sewing sheen- machine, and I, you know, like repaired it.  And I made, you know, like different kinds of stuff, you know, with, with sewing machines.  But my mother's thing was sewing.  I asked my mother how come she didn't sew professionally and she said well because she loved it so much.  She said if she would use it for a profession, she wouldn't like it, so she never did.  So my mother, when we were growing up she worked in a candy store.  Then she worked for Wieboldt's [Wieboldt Stores] selling shoes in the shoe department over on, in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois], 63rd [Street] and, and Halsted [Street].  And then she worked as a crossing guard.  And she loved children, she loved children to death.  So she was a crossing guard for most of her life and she knew every kid that crossed her street.  And then she would go into the school and then she knew all the kids that that were in the school.  And then so she left the crossing guard and she got a, a job as a teacher's aide in the school because she loved kids so much and she liked working with kids.  But then they had one of these budget cut things so her job was cut loose, so then she had to go back, you know, to being a crossing guard.  But that was the main thing that she did.  She was in the PTA [Parent Teacher Association], she was very, very involved in the PTA.  She was president of the PTA on, on several occasions because she just liked to be involved with kids.  She liked to be involved in, in, in the school system.
Story_ID: 611726
Speaker 1: One of the things I vividly remember about my mom [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs], is that back in the early '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s]--I know you didn't grow up in Chicago [Illinois], but being born and raised in Chicago, Chicago was a very racist city.  There was probably just as much segregation going on in Chicago as there was going on, you know, in parts of the South.  The only difference was we didn't have the signs on the water fountain, we didn't have the signs on the bathrooms, we didn't have the signs on the stores but you couldn't go downtown in the Woolworths [F.W. Woolworth Company] and sit down at, at the lunch counter and order lunch.  One of the things that that happened to me when I was eleven years old, we used to play baseball every day.  And it was a little vacant lot a block from our house and we treated it like a schoolyard and we played baseball games over there every day.  When we couldn't go over to the vacant lot to play baseball, we played baseball in our yard 'cause we had like a double lot, we had, so we had a very large yard.  If we couldn't play baseball in the yard 'cause, you know, we had a little garden out there and sometimes they didn't want you playing in the yard, we'd go to the alley, we would play in the alley.  And we lived on 93rd [Street] and Burnside [Avenue], 9357 Burnside, a block from Chicago State University [Chicago, Illinois], right along the railroad tracks.  So we played alley, we played baseball in the alley one day and I did a head first slide back into first base and I cut my hand on a piece of glass.  And so even to this day, I have this scar on my hand where I'm, I almost lost all four of these fingers.  So my hand got cut from here all the way up to there, so it was all bent back.  My brother who used to, my older brother, Asa [Asa Burroughs], used to faint every time he saw blood.  So when I came up out of the alley and I had all this blood in my hand, he actually picked me up and carried me into the house.  That cured him from fainting from blood.  My mother was in the bathroom, she was washing up to go somewhere, she screamed, you know, when she see, you know, all this blood and the fact that I'm getting ready to lose all these four fingers.  So she got dressed, my dad [Elmer Burroughs] got dressed and we went a block and a half to 95th [Street] and Cottage Grove [Avenue], that was before Chicago State was there and Illinois Central Railroad was there and they had a rail yard there, they also had a hospital up there.  So we drove up in there into the hospital and we showed them my hand and they looked at it and said, "We don't serve niggers."  So we had to leave there, drive from 95th and Cottage Grove down 95th Street to, to Michigan [Avenue], south on Michigan to 111th [Street] to Roseland Hospital [Roseland Community Hospital, Chicago, Illinois].  We got to Roseland Hospital, which, that was a all-white community, they took some gauze and wrapped the gauze around my hand three times and said, "We don't serve niggers."  So we had to leave there, and this was like 1959, before the Dan Ryan [Expressway] was built, the Dan Ryan didn't open until I think like 1962, '63 [1963].  So we had to drive from 111th and Michigan back to 95th, from 95th back over to Cottage Grove, from Cottage Grove from 95th all the way up to 59th [Street] and Cottage to University of Chicago hospital [University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois].  We got to University of Chicago hospital, they put me on this, you know, cart and all these red lights went off and all these bells and whistles went off 'cause I had to go in emergency surgery.  I was in emergency surgery for three hours.  When I came out, the doctor had cut from here to here and from here to here and here because the tendons had crawled all the way up my arm and he had go up my arm and grab those tendons and bring 'em back and tie 'em back together.  So I almost lost, I'd either lost these fingers or I'd lost any kind of control over those fingers.  But he was a great doctor, his name was Dr. Apple [ph.], I don't know what happened to him but such an unusual name, you know, I couldn't forget his name (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There's a dentist on Cottage Grove now named Anthony Apple.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, is he black or white (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I bet he's--he's white.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Now he could be a relation.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have to go and check him out because I, I--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: --I often wanted to find out what happened to him.
Speaker 2: He's on 83rd [Street] near the Pioneer building [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'll go by there.  But when I woke up in the morning, they didn't want me to jar the stitches out of my hand, so my hand was strapped to the bed.  Also they took all this gauze, I had a cast, my cast went from my fingers all the way up here to, to mid-arm.  Then they had gauze all the way over my arm, over, over my hand so I wouldn't reinjure it, and it was actually the size of a football.  So I woke up when the anesthesia wore off and I looked down and I saw all this football over my hand and I screamed and I couldn't move my arm because it was tied (laughter) to the bed.  So it was just totally bizarre.  But it was a, a very good physician because I, I was able to get about 95, 98 percent control back over my fingers.  It was a little bit of sensitivity, not much, but with this hand I can bend these straight back but these, they kind of bend when they go back.  But I mean, you know, I still, you know, play tennis, play baseball, basketball, swim, just bowling, everything, so I've got, you know, like I said about 95, 98 percent of it.  But the thing about it is, is that, I can never forget that racism that existed right here in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Now that's, yeah, I--that's kind of surprising to me even that that it was still going on that late in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely, without a doubt.
Story_ID: 611727
Speaker 1: The other way that I bring my mother [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs] into that is that we went to elementary school at Burnside School [Burnside Elementary School; Burnside Scholastic Academy, Chicago, Illinois], Burnside actually was in the Civil War which I didn't know that back then.
Speaker 2: Ambrose Burnside.
Speaker 1: Ambrose E. Burnside, absolutely, absolutely.  It was on 91st [Street] and like St. Lawrence [Avenue].  Well during that time with the baby boomers, schools were overcrowded in Chicago [Illinois].  So, you know, they--I don't know, when did you move to Chicago?
Speaker 2: Seventy-seven [1977].
Speaker 1: Seventy-seven [1977], okay.  You never, you probably never heard of the--
Speaker 2: I, I missed the Willis Wagons.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Right.  Well that's what they say (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I know about them.
Speaker 1: The Willis Wagons, right.  The Willis Wagons were these trailers--actually that were put on school sites, you know, to have additional classroom space.  So what they did in '62 [1962], they transferred, they, they changed the school boundary line, so instead of me walking, I think, it was about five blocks to school, I was transferred to Gillespie School [Gillespie Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] which was on 93rd [Street] and, and State Street, which was seventeen blocks, plus we had to cross, you know, King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] which was a major thoroughfare.  They did that in order to keep Perry School [Oliver H. Perry Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] all white.  Perry School which was east of Cottage Grove [Avenue], about three blocks east of Cottage Grove.  On the other side, on east of Cottage was all white, there was a few blacks that lived from Cottage Grove to the viaduct which I think was a block or two blocks away, but east of that viaduct all whites lived there and they wanted to keep that school all white.

Speaker 1: But Burnside [Ambrose Burnside] is also the guy that blew up the crater, you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  You have speed.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: He's, he's the crater guy.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: So, I mean, he has a lot of--
Speaker 2: Well a lot of blacks, you know, lost their lives.
Speaker 1: In, in addition to the sideburn thing, you know, he was (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, so we were talking about the racism in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Oh, is it running now?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --we're rolling.
Speaker 2: So they wanted to keep Perry School [Oliver H. Perry Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] who is named for Oliver Hazard Perry. My ancestor, you know, served in the Battle of Lake Erie. They wanted to keep that school all white so that's when they changed the boundaries.  So what happened was our parents said, well, rather than sending us seventeen blocks to school, you need to integrate Perry and the blacks that lived east of Cottage [Cottage Grove Avenue], need to go to Perry, that would relieve the overcrowding on Burnside [Burnside Elementary School; Burnside Scholastic Academy, Chicago, Illinois] but they didn't wanna do that.  So our parents had a sit-in.  My mother [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs], Alma Cock--Alma Coggs and my mother were two of the organizers of this sit-in at Burnside School in 1962.  And they were able to get all the--a lot of the other parents whose children were transferred over to Gillespie [Gillespie Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] to join in this sit-in.  So we sat-in, in the school house and refused to accept this transfer.  So it went on, it went on, it went on, and then finally our parents got arrested, civil rights workers got involved, and this was the first demonstration against the Chicago public school system [Chicago Public Schools].  Eventually the court, you know, thing got thrown out but it was like my first involvement into civil rights.  And the thing that I remember most about it, is the fact that we had a, a press conference, like my grandfather on my father's [Elmer Burroughs] side was a very prominent attorney in Chicago, my father was a, did law clerking for his father [Asa Morris Burroughs].  So they were involved in, in the legal court case as well as they also put together a press release and we had the press come in.  And I remember sitting in on the press conference and discussing, you know, with my parents, you know, what were the issues that were involved.  And then all the TV cameras were there and so we knew we were gonna be on the nightly news.  So, you know, we went home and, you know, we're sitting down in front of the television, unfortunately we didn't, we didn't have videotape at that time, (laughter) you know.  But we were at home, you know, waiting to see ourselves on television.  And there we are on television and the story that got told on television was completely opposite of the position that we were holding.  So what they did was they excerpted some small parts of our position, they were taken out of context to change our position from what we actually stood for.  And I thought it was extremely sinister of the press to take what, just a small snippet of what we're saying, and pull it out of context.  And I never forgot that, I've always been leery of the press ever since then.  Eventually after that the court case got thrown out but we eventually had to go to Gillespie.  But what it did was it inspired other parents and other people that had beefs with the Chicago school system, because the school board was all white, Ben Willis [Benjamin Willis], you know, as, you know, was, was head of the school board.  And that in, that was like the, the straw that led to a, a citywide boycott of the Chicago public school system, it was later on.  But it was interesting the fact that, that it started from, from my mother and some of her friends and some of the parents of, of, of my classmates, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's one of the historic struggles of the black community in Chicago, the Willis Wagon thing (unclear).
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  It was a grassroots struggle, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But it started by parents, it started by people in the neighborhood, and the people from the Civil Rights Movement, the so called quote, quote leaders, got in later, you know, they were pulled in to it.  But it was, it was strictly grassroots effort, you know.  But those things help remind me about the racism exi- that existed, you know, into Chicago.
Story_ID: 611729
Speaker 1: Perry School [Oliver H. Perry Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], I went by Perry School because knowing the history of all that and, and our involvement going back to '62 [1962], I had never been by that school up until like, I don't know, maybe about five years ago.  I was driving around the area and I said let me go and look at that Perry School.  And I went there and it is no longer named Oliver Hazard Perry School, it's now named for Harold Washington.  And I said that is really a crime.  Because I'm sure that none of those kids that go to that school or none of those teachers that go to that school and pride themselves attending and teaching at Harold Washington Elementary School [Chicago, Illinois], have any idea of the racist history of that particular school and, and the connection with, with Ben Willis [Benjamin Willis] and the racism of, of the Chicago public school system [Chicago Public Schools].  But it's also--
Speaker 2: People will forget about it, they won't know what the--
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 2: --the average, you know--lots of schools I go to I'd ask, "Well who is this named after?"
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Nobody would know.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And see I think that with every school system, there should be a written history of that school and every student and every parent should be given that history, instructed in that history, and tested on the history.  Because it's a shame that that happens, that people attend that school, work in that school, and know nothing about that person that school is named after.  We had a historic bike ride two weeks ago through the Bronzeville [Chicago, Illinois] community and we went through the, the Overton Hygienic Building on 36th [Street] and State Street that Anthony Overton started back in, it was either the '20s [1920s] or the '30s [1930s].
Speaker 2: Black businessman, right.
Speaker 1: Right, exactly.  He had a cosmetic manufacture and as well as he had a newspaper, an office building, just tremendous development.  Fortunately, you know, that building still exists on State Street.  Well as we were riding back, we passed by Overton School [Overton Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] and I wondered if those students and those teachers knew anything about Anthony Overton and, and who he was and why that school was named for them, you know.
Story_ID: 611730
Speaker 1: But back to Oliver Hazard Perry, the other thing that that I didn't know on my mother's [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs] side is the fact that I had an ancestor that served with Oliver Hazard Perry in the Battle of Lake Erie during the War of 1812.  And Charles Smothers who actually served in that battle, I went to the National Archives [National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, D.C.], I was able to get his records from the War of 1812.  I got his bounty land application, I got his, his discharge certificate, and I got his application for bounty land, all there at the National Archives.  He was so proud of his service he named his son Oliver Perry Smothers [Oliver Hazard Perry Smothers] for Oliver Hazard Perry, that that served, you know, in the battle.  And his son served in the Civil War.  And, and I had other relatives that served in the Civil War.  None of that did I know when I was coming up because that oral history was not passed down from generation to generation.  Oh--
Speaker 2: Now just to, just to reflect on this--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --the message that we got in school was that you don't have any history.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You didn't do anything.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: And all these--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: The Civil War, all these other great dramas and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and, you know, we were sitting there watching or, or eating a watermelon or something.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I say and, and so it makes a difference when--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --you think about it.
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 2: People actually, actually active in, in, in making--
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: --you know, changes--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --and doing things.
Speaker 1: Who knew when we were coming up that almost two hundred thousand blacks served in the Civil War?  You know, it was never, it was never talked about.  Never even mentioned.  Let alone, those are our ancestors, direct ancestors, you know.  I had an ancestor that fought in the Battle of Honey Hill when they were preparing for Sherman's march down to the sea, you know.  My ancestors were in the Massachusetts 50--55th Infantry [55th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment], you know, that served alongside of, of the Massachusetts 54th [54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment], you know, the first black regiment that was authorized by [U.S.] Congress, not the first regiment, but the first one that was authorized by Congress.  When that got filled up, they started the 55th, you know.  My ancestors, you know, were not from Massachusetts they were from Pennsylvania but they joined in the, the 55th.  I was going to Hilton Head, South Carolina [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], to give a genealogy talk.  Started doing some research on Hilton Head, and realized my ancestors were in Hilton Head during the Civil War in the Massachusetts 55th.  And I would have been so upset having gone to Hilton Head, spoken about black genealogy, played tennis at the tennis resort, and not realize that my ancestors were there during the Civil War.  I mean, which, which again shows us why, you know, we need to know our family history and why we need to know our black history, you know.  Because, you know, how many blacks go to Hilton Head, you know, go there for the golf resorts and the tennis resorts and never even think about the fact that they might have had some ancestors that were there.
Speaker 2: Not to mention the black folks that worked there as servants in the various (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 2: --service occupations and--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --and they don't know any of it.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Story_ID: 611731
Speaker 1: I was helping--I was able to meet some of the older people that had been on the island for a long time.  In fact, when I went down there one of the first things I learned was--and you're talking about the favorite phrase, (laughter) one of the older guys in my workshop was saying, "Well, you know, some of us live here and some of us, some of us is from here."  So he was making a clear distinction, you know, about people that had roots from South Carolina, from Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], versus those that came after the bridge was built to the mainland, I think it was, like in 1950.  But they decided to write a history of Hilton Head Island.  And they were going back to, you know, like the civil rights period and, and back until, you know, the 1880s but we're not covering, you know, the Civil War period nor the period before the Civil War because their big thing is, is, is when the, the bridge was built because before the bridge was built, Hilton Head was 80 percent black and 20 percent white.  After the bridge and now it's much over 80 percent white and 20 percent or less of black.  So it's important for them what happened before the bridge was built.  But Martin Delany was in Hilton Head, you know.  There were many slaves in Hilton Head.  In fact, Hilton Head is very, very important because it was one of the, the, the Sea Islands which were isolated from the mainland which were some of the areas where they preserve their Africanisms from Africa because they didn't have as much contact with whites because they were isolated being on an island.  And a lot of the whites were absentee plantation owners and they would live in places in the North, running plantations in the South and they didn't wanna be in, in the hot areas, you know, of, of the Carolinas, you know, during, you know, the summer and whatever.  But knowing the history of that and knowing my ancestors were a part of that history too, you know, is just, just, totally mind boggling.
Story_ID: 611732
Speaker 1: I think, in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], Pittsburgh family of the Vashons.  John B. Vashon--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the barber who was another--I think, he fought with Perry [Oliver Hazard Perry] in, in the War of 1812.
Speaker 2: Might have had.  The, the, the interesting thing, and I've done research on it, they've estimated that the blacks that fought with--in the Battle of Lake Erie was approximately a hundred to a hundred and twenty blacks.  They've been only able to identify about ten or eleven of 'em and my ancestor, Charles Smothers, was not one of 'em.  He did not serve in the [U.S.] Navy, he served in the [U.S.] Army, and those guys hardly ever get mentioned.  But they didn't have enough guys in the Navy so they went to the Army and looked for quote, quote volunteers to serve with them.  Because the original Navy records did not indicate race, they've had a difficult time identifying all those blacks that served with them.  But that name Vashon is, is very, very familiar to me so I think you're absolutely, right.
Speaker 1: Well one of the puzzles I have, I have a, and, and I know it can be solved, and you probably know how to solve it, is that the, the principal black high school in St. Louis [Missouri] for many years was Vashon High School, named after his son, George Vashon [George B. Vashon], but I don't understand, you know, what the connection is to St. Louis, you know, but, but John B. Vashon and, was a mentor of Martin Delany's and they, they had a strong black, you know, organization in the, in the early part of the 19th century all the way through the Civil War--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in Pittsburgh with Pecks, the Vashons, (unclear), of course, Delany himself and there's a, there's a, the Woodson, Lewis Woodson who's one of the descendants of Thomas Jefferson.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Though he never mentioned that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.  He, he stayed in Pittsburgh too?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was the--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He was a partner with Vashon, you know, they had a--they were both barbers.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: They started the, the, the school out of the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church that taught Delany when he was a teenager.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Lewis Woodson, I mean, he was like, some refer to him as the father of black nationalism 'cause he wrote under the name of Augustine in the Freedom Journal [sic. The Colored American]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and all that.  But this is a--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --lot of rich history, I mean, in--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --Pittsburgh.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it goes way back.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  They had a lot of connections to Canada too, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Very much so, very much so, yeah.
Speaker 1: At one time blacks could vote in Pennsylvania but they rescinded it at a certain point and so they were involved in the struggle, you know--
Speaker 2: That's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to get it back.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a lot, it's a, it's a deep history in that part of the country.
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely, absolutely, very much so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Story_ID: 611733
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your father's side of the family (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We're just getting, we're just getting--we--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --we'll get to you at some point.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: But no doubt it'll take a couple of sessions to do.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's all right.  That's all right.
Speaker 1: We're not going to get it all today.
Speaker 2: That's fine, that's fine.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: That's fine.
Speaker 1: --can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, my father's name is Elmer Burroughs, no middle name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is October, October 5th (unclear) (laughter) yeah, October 5th, I believe, it is 1919.
Speaker 1: Okay, 19--
Speaker 2: He was born in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  He was born the year of the riot.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right after the riot, I guess.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And so well, the question is, well what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, right.  Well my father was born in Chicago, his father was born in Chicago, and his mother was born in Chicago.  His father was Asa Morris Burroughs, born January 29th, I believe it was, 1893 in Chicago.  His wife, my grandmother, was Alma Irene and her maiden name was Rice [Alma Rice Burroughs].  She was born May 16, 1895 here in Chicago.  My grandfather was a very prominent attorney here in Chicago.  He was president of the Cook County Bar Association in 1928.  He ran for state rep, he ran for judge, he also had fundraisers for Oscar De Priest [Oscar Stanton De Priest] when he was elected to [U.S.] Congress, and was very involved in the community.  He lived all--they actually lived on the West Side, and then when my great-grandmother [Mary Williams Burroughs] died they moved to the South Side and lived all throughout Bronzeville [Chicago, Illinois] and was very active, you know, in the community.
Speaker 1: Now, now, now where did he go to law school?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) His bar review said he went to Kent College of Law [Chicago-Kent College of Law, Chicago, Illinois].  I went to Kent College and verified that he did go to Kent College of Law.  He dropped out after his first year.  He actually read for the bar.  He worked for very prominent white law firms and at that time, you could read for the bar, which meant if you worked for, for a law firm and you knew the law from a practical level, then you could actually read for the bar and pass the bar exam without actually going to law school.  Since he had worked for these very prominent white attorneys, as, as a law clerk for a long period of time, I think when he went to law school he was probably just bored to death and he said get me out of here, you know.  And I think he knew enough about the law that he just sat and, and read for the bar, you know.
Speaker 1: Now that's something that you, I guess, you can't do that anymore, right?  Read for the bar?
Speaker 2: I don't think so but I'm not really sure.  I think it would probably be highly unusual, you know.  I don't know if they outlawed that or what.  Plus now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I've heard of another, a couple of other cases like that where people read for the bar.  They just buckled down and studied.
Speaker 2: It was very common back then.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: It was very common back then.
Speaker 1: --read enough to pass the bar.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, right, exactly, exactly.  I really don't know when it stopped or when it stopped being, being popular, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's how Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln] became a lawyer back in the--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Back when.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it makes sense, it makes sense.
Speaker 1: Now remember, remember the old cavalry show 'Sugarfoot'?  He was, he was--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: He had the law books in his saddle bags, so he (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh, wow, wow, oh, yeah.  I'd like to go back and revisit some of those Westerns, you know.  Yeah, yeah, there was a lot of stuff in there, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, absolutely, yeah.  Well I think, I, if I remember right, I think my grandfather passed the bar in 1922.  He actually set up the Cook County Law Library, was the first one that set that up.  I think he was secretary to Cook County Bar Association before he became president of the bar association.  He was a member of the Appomattox Club.  He was a Mason.  He was on a board of the Wabash Y camp [Wabash Avenue YMCA, Chicago, Illinois].  They had a, a, a camp that he was on the board of.  And he was responsible for getting the swimming pool over in Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois] right at 55th [Street] and--which was South Park [South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] at that time.  And his daughter, my Aunt Irene gave a diving demonstration, and she went to Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Which is how my, my father met his wife [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs] because--
Speaker 1: Now, Irene what would be her last name, would it be Burroughs?
Speaker 2: It was Burroughs, Irene Burroughs, right, um-hm.  But my mother's sister, Margaret Ann Brooks [Margaret Brooks] went to Wilberforce.  And my father's sister, Irene Burroughs, went to Wilberforce.  And they were friends and when Irene came to Chicago, she brought her girlfriend, Margaret Ann, and somehow she said, "Well, you know, you--," and, and so met my father and said, "well, you know, you might, you know, like my younger sister," (laughter) you know.  So they kind of hooked up, you know.
Story_ID: 611734
Speaker 1: My grandmother [Alma Rice Burroughs] worked as a--I never know how to pronounce the name, but it was a millinery or whatever, she worked at a hat shop.
Speaker 2: A millinery shop, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Millinery, right, worked in a millinery shop, worked with hats.  She actually got a scholarship to go to school in Nashville [Tennessee] and right at the time when she was getting ready to go away to school, she met my grandfather [Asa Morris Burroughs] and never went.  But my grandmother told me the story and she said, how she was given a red ribbon, she was supposed to put it on her, on her blouse, and take the train down to Nashville, when she got off the train the lady was gonna pick her up, knew who she was by this red ribbon on the blouse.  Well after my grandmother died and I went through the house, I found this letter with the red ribbon attached to the letter.  You know, it just blew me away, you know, so it verified, you know, what my grandmother had told me.  But after she got married, my grandmother, again my grandfather was a very prominent attorney, so my grandmother never worked a day in her life after she got married in 1915.  She liked to cook so she, you know, cooked all day long, you know.  And my mother [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs] when she moved to Chicago [Illinois] and married my, my father [Elmer Burroughs], we all lived in the same house.  I was born and raised at 505 East, East 60th Street which is right across the street from Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois].  My grandfather owned a two flat greystone.  My grandparents lived on the first floor and we lived on, on the second floor.  And sometimes my, my mom would go downstairs to eat and my mom would hate to go downstairs to eat, not because my grandmother wasn't a great cook, but my grandmother liked to cook so much that when people came down to eat, she asked what they wanted to eat and she took orders like in a restaurant and everybody had something different.  And my mom said when you come into my house everybody eating the same thing, (laughter) you know.  So she hated to go down there and eat.  But that's just how much my grandmother liked to cook.  My grandfather, my, my grandmother's parents, William Rice was from either Cape Girardeau [Missouri] or St. Louis, Missouri.  I found records, both records of him being from St. Louis and Cape Girardeau.  I did find him on the census register in 1870 in Cape Girardeau.  So I don't know if he left Cape Girardeau and went to St. Louis or he was from St. Louis and then went to Cape Girardeau, I really don't know.  His--and he worked as a waiter downtown in the hotels and then he used to bring food home, you know, to my grandmother and her sister, you know, when they were young.  My grandmother's mother, Minnie Ophelia Barker [Minnie Barker Rice] was from Memphis, Tennessee.  And so they lived in Tennessee, migrated to Chicago.  Well actually they stopped off in, in Cairo [Illinois], and lived in Cairo for a while in 1880.  And then I think what they did was got on the Illinois Central train [Illinois Central Railroad] and then came up to Chi- Chicago not long after that.  My grandmother's grandmother, Minnie Walker [sic. Fannie Walker], was from Virginia.  She was born in Virginia in the 1850s and then moved to Tennessee, had my great-grandmother born in Memphis, then she had another daughter born in, in Jackson, Tennessee.  And then I think what they did was jumped on a steamer up the Mississippi River and came up to Cairo and stayed there for a while.
Story_ID: 611735
Speaker 1: My father's grandfather, Morris Burroughs, was from Spartanburg, South Carolina.  He was the first one to migrate to Chicago [Illinois] in 1887.  So it was long before the great migration.  So I'm actually a third generation Chicagoan.  He married Mary Lily Jane Williams [Mary Williams Burroughs] from Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1888, in Chattanooga.  He left Spartanburg, moved to Chattanooga, worked in Chattanooga for a while at the Read House Hotel which is across the street from the Union Station, we call it Union Depot, there in Chattanooga.  And I think what happened was he met some Pullman porters there, he either met them going across the street or they came across the street to the hotel and he met 'em there, but one of the ways he met them and I think they told him, you know, you can get a better job working for Pullman [Pullman Palace Car Company] than you can, you know, in this hotel.  So he left there, moved to Chicago in 1887 and started working as a Pullman porter in Chicago and then he doubled as, as a waiter periodically.  When he came to Chicago, he helped organize Pullman porters here in Chicago at the turn of the century in 1901, twenty-four years before A. Philip Randolph organized the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.  He had an organization called the Colored Men's Railway Mercantile League.  And again when my grandmother [sic. great-grandmother] died, I was able to find the incorporation papers where they were incorporated in the State of Illinois.  Just so happened that he developed tuberculosis and died two years later in 1903.  So he wasn't able to, he was able to start the organization, they had hmm, I think, it was somewhere around like twenty-five members, mainly from Chicago but he did have some from the West Coast also.  And I think because of his ill health, that the organization didn't flourish but they had a lot of goals, they had a lot of dreams, things they wanted to do.  They wanted to set up a library, they wanted to educate other porters on current events as well as black history and have--provide a place for them to stay when they came to Chicago when they were on, on runs and stuff, you know.  His ancestors were from Spartanburg, South Carolina.  Morris actually was born in 1864 in Spartanburg.  And I have some individuals that I believe are his parents but I've been having a difficult time trying to prove, you know, the people that are indicated on the census records and are supposed to be his parents because of the fact they're living with one family in 1880 and living with a different family in 1870.  The 1880 records state that those are his parents.  In 1870, it's a different family and unfortunately on the census records in 1870 it doesn't indicate relationship to the head of the household.  So I'm not sure if those are his parents or aunts, you know, or, or whatever, I'm not totally sure.  Tracing his ancestors back, I found out that some of them were free in South Carolina.  So I, I am not sure if his direct ancestors were slave or free.  So I'm checking, I'm checking both.  I did find a slave owner by the name of Burroughs in Spartanburg, South Carolina that did own five slaves.  Originally I thought that those were my ancestors but once I started doing research I started picking up these other names because there were some stories that my ancestors had received land from a slave owner, when I got copies of those land deeds the slave owner that transferred their property was named Twitty [Lafayette Twitty], it wasn't named Burroughs.  Then when I traced these free people that my, my, my great-grandfather Morris Burroughs, was actually listed as Morris Norton on 1870 census.  And when I look at the Nortons, the Nortons were actually freed before the Civil War.  So I don't know if they were directly--if his ancestors were directly freed before the Civil War or if the slave owners, were named Burroughs or Twitty or Norton, or whatever, it's a very complicated situation.  So I'm still doing research looking at a lot of different primary records, deeds, wills, inventories, probates, census records, registrations of freed people, colored manumissions, all those kinds of things to try piece that story together.  Eventually, you know, I'll be able to, you know, like track it down.  So essentially, you know, the bottom line is our ancestors came here long before the Great Migration, 1887.  My grandfather's brother was born here in 1888, I mean, 1889.  And my grandfather [Asa Morris Burroughs] was born here in 1893.  They attended St. Stephen's Church [St. Stephen's African Methodist Episcopal Church] on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois].  And St. Stephen's Church was very instrumental in getting Provident Hospital [Provident Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois] started.  My great-grandmother, Mary Jane Lily Williams who is from Chattanooga, actually attended Spelman College [Spelman Seminary; Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], 1885, when Spelman was only four years old.  She majored in nursing back then.  And Provident Hospital was actually started because a woman could not get, a black woman could not get admitted into nursing school, into the white nursing schools, so she tapped Daniel Hale Williams to start a nursing school for black women, as well as a hospital.  So because it started from a nursing school and it started, you know, from members of St. Stephen's Church, and my great-grandmother attended St. Stephen's, I'm pretty confident she had something to do with the founding of Provident Hospital, but I have not been able to get into the original records of Provident and see all the people that had started Provident and what their involvement was.
Story_ID: 611736
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: Oh, we were talking about Provident Hospital [Provident Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois], right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, right, right, right, yeah. So I want a--I know they, they started a Provident historical society, I think, you know, and I know a lady who is involved with all--
Speaker 1: Yes, right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But I've never actually been able to get into the records myself, you know.  So I do hope to do that at some point in time.  I also, you know, I've been down to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] several times and I was able to find mentions of my [paternal] great-grandmother [Mary Williams Burroughs] in the records of Spelman.  I found her in the student bulletin which showed, you know, where she was from, when she got--what year she was in school, what she was majoring in.  And I found her in the, the newspaper where she had to do a demonstration, you know, on the stage, you know, with her nursing stuff.  I was down there a few years ago and I was able to find another mention where she mentioned her guardian which was a uncle, S.P. Johnson [ph.] and so I think that's gonna help me continue to track her family.  But the registrar told me they had some records and I haven't been able to get all the registrar's records, you know.  But in the process of doing that and looking at the history of Spelman, I realize there is no history of the black women that went to Spelman, which totally floored me.
Speaker 1: Not at, even at Spelman?
Speaker 2: Not even at Spelman.  There's a history of Spelman--
Speaker 1: But not the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) but the history of Spelman deals with the white women that started Spelman, it does not deal with the black women that attended Spelman, you know, who they were, how they got in school, how their tuition was paid for, what they majored in, who supported them, what they had to do to get in the school, and what they did after school.  Nothing about those black women, all it is is about the white women that started Spelman.
Speaker 1: Rockefeller's wife [Laura Spelman Rockefeller] and her sister [Lucy Spelman].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.  So I plan to write the current president [HistoryMaker Beverly Daniel Tatum] and let her know that because, you know, you've got all these educated alumni, someone could--between the students and the alumni someone could sit down and, and start working on the history of, of, of those black women because that's a, that's a crime.  I have no idea how it is at, at the other schools.
Speaker 1: I think they have some record at Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I don't know how they compiled it.  I saw a list on the web but--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I don't know how they came up with it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, um-hm.  Well, you know, what I just mentioned to you, most people don't even know.  If you say there's a history of Spelman, yeah, they'll give you the title, the author, you know, pick up the book for you, but if you look at it and read it and see what's actually in it, it's not about black women (laughter).  It's not about those black students, you know.  So I think, it's one of those oversights for some reason, you know, nobody's thought about, I guess, since I did (laughter).  So I'm gonna write her, see if they can get that together, you know.
Story_ID: 611737
Speaker 1: There's a story I read about in the, in the materials that that you provided for us that your father's [Elmer Burroughs]--I mean, your, your grandfather's brother on your father's side was a bank robber.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And he almost looked just like your, your--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  What happened was my grandfather [Asa Burroughs] died in 1971.
Speaker 1: Now that's the lawyer, right?
Speaker 2: Right, he was a lawyer.
Speaker 1: Asa--
Speaker 2: Right, Asa Morris Burroughs.  They called him Attorney A.M. Burroughs.  I was not living in Chicago [Illinois] when he died.  I think I was, I think I was living in North Carolina then.  So I didn't attend the funeral.  It wasn't until after he died that I found out my grandfather had a brother.  And I was totally shocked the fact that my grandfather had a brother and then I realized that that he lived around the corner.  I asked my father how come he never told me about it.  My father said he only saw him one time.  And I asked him why and my father said well it was because his father prohibited him from seeing his uncle.  And I asked him why and he said 'cause he had a, a lot of fancy cars and, you know, and a lot of women, you know.  I said, "Hm, okay."  Well one day when I was tracing the family history, my grandmother [Alma Rice Burroughs] said that he has a trunk.  And, I guess, when my grandfather died he picked up all his brother's things, he put it in the trunk, and he put the trunk down in the basement, it sat in the basement for almost twenty years and nobody touched it.  So when I asked my grandmother about it, you know, and she asked me did I wanna go see it, I said yeah, absolutely.  So we went down and, and literally spent the day in the basement going through his trunk.  He had old clothes there, he had like pens, eyeglasses, little badges of places he had worked, there were like pay stubs, and little letters, photographs, and just all kinds of stuff.  One thing was in there was a newspaper clipping that said he had robbed Illinois Tool Works [Illinois Tool Works, Inc.], which is right around the corner from here, I think it was at 18th and, 18th [Street] and Indiana [Avenue] or something, I know it wasn't far from here.  But he was a chauffeur, you know.  And he drove the getaway car, you know, when they went and, and, and robbed the bank.  One of the, one of the guys who was with him worked there so it was kind of like an inside job, you know, they knew what the heck, you know, was going on, you know.  But he got sentenced to the Joliet state penitentiary [Joliet Correctional Center, Joliet, Illinois], so I have the records from the state penitentiary, got a couple articles about when he was, you know, incarcerated there.  And so his brother, my grandfather, Asa Burroughs, by being such a prominent attorney, he didn't want people to know that his brother, you know, had had robbed, you know, this Illinois Tool Works and had spent some time in, in the state pen.  So he kind of divorced himself from him.  They grew up on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] where my great-grandfather [Morris Burroughs] originally moved to, they lived around United Center [Chicago, Illinois], where the Bulls [Chicago Bulls] play.  They lived on Madison [Street], Fulton [Street], couple of other streets over there.  But then their father died, you know, when they were quite young.  So I guess when their father died, you know, they kind of like, you know, it was--their mother [Mary Williams Burroughs] was still there but their mother, you know, she got sick the last part of her life too, you know.  So it appears that Robert [Robert Burroughs], my grandfather's brother, got, you know, fooling around with the wrong folk, they went out West, I think they had stolen a car or something, you know, came back and then they got involved, you know, with this, making this heist on, on this place, you know.  So at that point after he got, got out of prison, he was an ex-con, he's a black, like, you know, eighth grade education, you know.  So he really, you know, had a triple strike against him, you know.  So he could never really get, you know, any kind of decent job, you know.  So he worked out at the Hawthorne stables, he worked out at Arlington [Illinois], you know, at, basically as a groom, worked as a chauffeur for a while, he did odd jobs, he, he worked for Pullman Company [Pullman Palace Car Company] as an electrician for a short period of time.  Just, you know--I found he was on welfare at one period of time too.  So just anywhere where he can get a hustle, you know, he got a job.  He was married to a lady and she went to the mental health institution, you know.  So that marriage busted up, you know.  So it was just a, just nothing really worked for him at all.  So the two brothers, you know, were like completely, completely different, you know.
Speaker 1: How many siblings did they have?
Speaker 2: It was just two of 'em.
Speaker 1: Just two of 'em?
Speaker 2: It was just two of 'em.
Speaker 1: And one went one way and one--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --went the other.
Speaker 2: Right, one went one way and the other went, you know, 180 degrees in the other direction, you know, yeah.  But I mean that, you know, that happens in, in families, you know.
Story_ID: 611738
Speaker 1: Your father [Elmer Burroughs] now, now his father [Asa Morris Burroughs] was a lawyer and stuff and he, he grew up around all this, all--legal and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --political activity.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Well did he talk about growing up and--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  In fact, my father actually had went to law school.  And he went to Roosevelt [Roosevelt College; Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois].  He got drafted, went into the [U.S. military] service, and he wanted to be a lawyer, you know, from his dad.  In fact, he actually went to law school and I think he dropped out of law school when he got married, you know, when my mother [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs] came on the scene.  So he never went back, never finished, you know, never finished anything after high school.  But he worked as a clerk for his father, as a law clerk.  His brother was insurance and the three of them had an office, 188, 188 West Randolph [Street], and also at 54 West Washington [Washington Street, Chicago, Illinois], you know, downtown.  So my grandfather let them have, you know, like a desk and a phone, you know, and did work and whatever.  And then I actually learned my way around the courthouse by going with my dad.  So my dad, you know, went in to, to file briefs, to get land deeds and stuff like that.  I would oftentimes go with him so it's like, you know, I thought about being a lawyer also.  In fact, that was, it wasn't the first profession I wanted, you know I grew up, I played baseball and so I wanted to be, you know, a professional baseball player.  But I always toyed with the idea of being a lawyer, you know, 'cause I like to debate, I like to research, I was proud of my grandfather being a lawyer.  My grandfather would bring clients, you know, to the house as well as downtown.  We would go downtown to my grandfather's office, as well as seeing him have clients come to the house.  So my grandfather was kind of like one of my early mentors, you know.  So I wanted, you know, like to be a lawyer.  And I probably would have gone to law school if it wasn't for racism and me thinking that, you know, I would have hated to do all the research on a case and actually win the case but the judge ruled against me because of racism.  And because of that fact, you know, I didn't go to law school and, and become a lawyer.  But I was able to, you know, learn my way around the courthouse by going, you know, with my dad and stuff, you know.  My dad eventually after doing law clerking, he managed real estate on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], he had some properties that he managed.  He also drove a cab for a while and then he got into claims adjusting, he was a claims adjuster for, for the taxi cab company, he was also a dispatcher.  And then he also worked for another company doing insurance claims, adjusting, you know.  And that's kind of like how he ended up in, basically in, in insurance, you know.
Story_ID: 611739
Speaker 1: Now how did he [Burroughs' father, Elmer Burroughs] and your mother [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs] meet?  Is there a story?
Speaker 2: Well what happened was my, my mother's sister [Margaret Brooks], I think I was telling you earlier went to Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And my father's sister [Irene Burroughs] went to Wilberforce.  So one year when my mother's sister came to Chicago [Illinois], my mother came with her.  And she liked Chicago plus we had cousins, some of my mother's cousins lived in Chicago.  So my mother got out of high school not long after that, she actually moved to Chicago and stayed with these cousins.  So she stayed with these cousins and then through her sister, she met my father because my father's sister and my mother's sister both went to, to Wilberforce together, you know.  And looking at some pictures of my mom, you know, when she was in high school, she was so fine (laughter).  I know he just fell in love with her, you know, soon as he saw her, you know, yeah.
Story_ID: 611740
Speaker 1: Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I have several or a couple, I guess.  One of my earliest childhood memories was actually going to see Bushman in, in the zoo.  And, I guess, Bushman was the main attraction in the zoo.  And I remember my mom taking us to the zoo and my, my older brother.  My brother, Asa [Asa Burroughs] was named after my grandfather [Asa Morris Burroughs] and he's like ten months older than I am so we kind of grew up almost as, as twins, you know, but we were very close when we were coming up.  So my parents [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs and Elmer Burroughs] always took us together or my aunt she would come take us somewhere.  So I remember going to the zoo, you know, to see Bushman and I remember--
Speaker 1: Now tell, tell everybody who, I know who Bushman is.
Speaker 2: Oh, Bushman was a, was, was a gorilla.  That was a big, huge, king gorilla and was a very old gorilla and was just the main attraction at the zoo.  But--I think it was Brookfield Zoo [Brookfield, Illinois] because we didn't really go to Lincoln Park Zoo [Chicago, Illinois] that much, so I'm pretty much sure it was probably Brookfield Zoo.
Speaker 1: And I thought it was Lincoln Park.
Speaker 2: It might have been Lincoln Park.  It might have been Lincoln Park, I'd have to go check.  I do have an article that I clipped from the newspaper when Bushman died.  And he's actually in the Field Museum of Natural History [Chicago, Illinois] 'cause I remember going over there one time and I, I saw him encased over there, you know, and I was telling a friend that this is one of my very first memories, you know.  And I think Bushman died at the zoo like '50 [1950], around '51 [1951] and I was like three years old, you know.  So that was one of my first memories.  My other memory was going to a funeral in, in Pennsylvania in, in Elizabeth, Pennsylvania.  And like I said my mother was born in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and we had other relatives that lived there.  My grandmother [Lydia Terrell Brooks] was raised in, in Elizabeth, Pennsylvania.  She was born actually in Fayette City [Pennsylvania] which is along that Monongahela River but she was raised later on in, in Elizabeth.  So when we were young, we would go to Pittsburgh and Elizabeth, you know, to see relatives.  And going to Pittsburgh, you know, my grandmother lived in the city. Elizabeth was like out in the country and like they had a outhouse and they had a lot of, of lawn, whatever, so it was really like out, out in the country.  So I remembered it being out in the country 'cause it was so different than growing up in the city, you know, and they had a wood frame house and whatever. And you had to go to a outhouse and this and that and the other.  And the people that we used to play with, the older people, I know one guy his name was Barney [ph.], and then his sister was, was May, May, May Simmons [ph.], and, and their mother, Ella [ph.].  And when Ella died, we went back for the funeral and I think we went on the train, 'cause sometimes we'd take the train, sometimes we would drive.  I remember my dad's car would break down all the time, you know.  And that was before they had the toll road, it was built, and before the interstate was built, you know, in the late '40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s].  So I remember going to this funeral and it was the first funeral I'd ever been to so it was the first time I had really saw a dead person.  So I think it really struck on my mind.  And we were there in the house, and the funeral was actually in the house, it was what you call a home funeral.  So she was laid out in the living room on the living room couch.  And I remember going up seeing her and I was like really, really short so I mean it wasn't, you know, I didn't have to really bend over to see her laid out, you know.  So I remember and she looked real strange 'cause we used to play with her all the time, you know, and here she was very stoic, very laid out, you know, and everybody was crying and this and that and the other, you know.  So it was something that really, you know, kind of, you know, like played on me.  Oh, I wouldn't say played on me, it just stuck in my mind that I had never forgot.  And she died, I think it was in '52 [1952] when I was about three and a half years old, you know.  And that was, those are really my two earliest memories.
Story_ID: 611741
Speaker 1: You mentioned two places that you lived in.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Where were you first?  You were in the 60s first, or was it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The first, when I was born, we lived in a, a greystone two flat at 505 East, 505 East 60th Street, which was between Eberhart [Avenue] and Rhodes [Avenue] and right across the, the street from, from Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois].  And at that time when we lived there, the park was very different because there were bushes that ringed all the way around the park, now they took all those bushes down.  We used to go to Easter egg hunts that was--they used to hide Easter eggs in the bushes and stuff, you know.  My dad [Elmer Burroughs] taught me how to ride a bike over in Washington Park along the sidewalk there.  Taught me how to play baseball in the park over there.  So we went to the park all the time.  I mean it--literally every day, it was only across the street, you know.  They had a lagoon there, we never went fishing but we did go in the park to play.  They also had a stable, there was a horse stable on 61st [Street] about a block from Cottage Grove [Avenue] where there's a post office there now.  So you can go over there and rent horses and you can ride horses around the park.  The horse trail is still there now they jog around that horse trail but if you ever go in the park you see that black cinder along there that was the, the horse path.  They still have horses that come through there periodically but it's not like back when we were growing up, you can actually go to the stable and rent a horse, go there and ride, you know, any time that you wanted.  So we stayed there until I was eight years old, in third grade.  I went to A.O. Sexton School [Austin O. Sexton Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] that was right down the street on, on 60th.  And then we moved in 1956 when I was in third grade, to 9357 South Burnside [Avenue] which was between Langley [Avenue] and Champlain [Avenue], I think, it was.  What had happened was we were living on 60th in my grandfather's [Preston C. Brooks] house.  My grandfather died in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] in '54 [1954].  After he died, a couple years after he died, my grandmother [Lydia Terrell Brooks] decided to move to Chicago because her other kids had moved to Chicago.  So my one remaining aunt that was living in, in Pittsburgh and my grandmother and my cousins, Lydia [ph.], you know, they decided to pack up and move from Pittsburgh to Chicago.  So they bought a two story house on Burnside.  So my mother [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs] said well I've been living with your mother [Alma Rice Burroughs] all this time, now I gotta go live with my mother.  So then we moved to Burnside and lived on the first floor and my grandmother and my two aunts and uncle and my cousins lived on the second floor.  When we moved there in '56 [1956], it was a large yard there.  In the yard we had two apple trees in the front yard.  We had a cherry tree in the middle of the yard, and the, the house next to us had a peach tree, and in the alley there was a cherry tree in the alley.  So it was all these fruit trees around us, you know, it was real incredible.  So, I mean, we made apple pie, and apple juice, and apple jelly, and cherry jelly, and cherry pie and all of that.  And then we learned how to can it, and we canned it, you know, for the winter so we always had a full stock during the winter and had that stocked up down in the basement.  And the weeds were like about five feet high when we went over there in the back of the yard.  So we chopped down all the weeds and found about twelve garter snakes all throughout the yard.  So after we chopped down the reed--weeds, then we planted corn, radishes, tomatoes, lettuce, cabbage, rhubarb.  We planted mint, we had mint leaves all along the side of the house.  So we really literally had a little farm out there, you know.  My Aunt Doris [Doris Brooks], my mother's older sister, she had grown up with the older relatives in Pennsylvania so they always grew something in the yards, so she kind of brought that here to Chicago.  So, you know, we literally had a little farm there, you know.  So we'd pick weeds, we dug up the ground, you know, and pulled out stuff, and you know, cleaned it, and canned it, and, and everything, you know.  So we stayed there until I went to college [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois], 1966.
Story_ID: 611742
Speaker 1: Just reflect on some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Mm, um-hm.  Well I remember when we were on 60th [Street], other than the park [Washington Park, Chicago, Illinois], there was always the Bud Billiken Parade [Bud Billiken Parade and Picnic].  And so we'd always go to Bud Billiken Parade and that would end at the park.  So we'd always go see the, the parade, you know, and that was always a real big thing.  In fact, the parade was one of our highlights of the year, you know, and not only the Bud Billiken Parade but we would go to the Christmas parade downtown.  And there was another parade we went to, but those two that stick out in my mind, the Bud Billiken and also the Christmas parade.  And I think it was another parade we used to go to.
Speaker 1: St. Patrick's Day or--
Speaker 2: No.  I don't think it was St. Patrick's Day parade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there a Memorial Day parade in those days?
Speaker 2: It might have been a Memorial Day parade or something (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause sometimes, I know when I was a kid, they used to have a lot of those.
Speaker 2: Yeah, maybe it was Memorial Day.
Speaker 1: With the [U.S.] Army bands and all of that?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, um-hm, yeah, yeah, maybe, maybe it was Memorial Day or Veterans Day or something, you know.  I remember there was a hotel down the street on 60th and Vernon [Avenue], it was a pink hotel, I mean, it looked it was something from Miami [Florida], (laughter) you know.  So I remember it was a hotel there.  I remember there was a kid, a friend of mine lived down the street on 60th and I had this little red wagon, like everybody I guess had a little red wagon.  And I remember we used to store the wagon down in the basement and I remember this kid, his name was Chico [ph.], Byron Jones [ph.].  And he would take the wagon and he would pick it up and carry it down in the basement for us when we played together.  And I thought he was the biggest, strongest kid in the world 'cause I could not pick up the wagon, I'd have to drag it down the stairs and clankety clank, you know, and when he just picked it up, I just thought he was just the strongest guy in the world, you know.  I remember we had a, it was an outside balcony on the second floor where we lived so we could walk outside and look outside in the park and see people playing in the park.  We had neighbors next door and they would come out on their porch.  I remember it was, Burt [ph.] and Nick [ph.].  You know, and Nick was a cook on the railroad.  I forget what Burt did but we became good friends, we would talk to them, you know, across the, the porch way.  I remembered on our steps there was a--I don't know how you, how you call it but instead of going from the side, there was no--there--we, we did have a very small lawn on 50th Street but next to the lawn was, was concrete and it was like, almost like a little patio before you got to the steps.  And on our side it was red, and right up the middle of the steps it was red.  So when I got older I would have to go out and paint that.  So I'd paint the big red square and paint the red that went up, you know, the steps, you know.  So I remember, you know, and I don't know what you call it, it was just a little platform up there.  I remember a guy that lived down the street would always bring us Christmas gifts at Christmastime.  And I remember one year--and again we were all into Westerns 'cause Westerns were the big shows back then, and we wanted these, these guns for Christmas and my dad [Elmer Burroughs], I say my dad but Santa Claus, you know, would bring us, you know, a pistol every now and then for Christmas.  But this guy he brought us two six shooters with the holster and I, Santa Claus would just bring us one little toy gun, he brought us two guns, with the caps, and the holster, and the whole nine yards, you know.  So we really was like on cloud nine with those.  And we would go out, one year we went out to see my, my mother's sister [Doris Brooks] and she lived on 90--91st [Street], I guess, and, and, and South Park [South Parkway], you know, like King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive].  So it was in the winter, you know, for Christmas, we went out there and had on our long coats and we had these guns on under it, we took those coats off, my dad saw those guns--he got so--what'd you bring those guns out here for, you know, he got so mad.  'Cause, you know, we'd fill 'em up with caps and they were like so loud when you shoot 'em.  So this guy would bring us, you know, Christmas presents all the time.  My uncle, my father's brother, who was a carpenter, he would do work for the guy and there was word going around that he was, you know, like part of the mafia and whatever and I think he was a policy guy, you know.  So he lived, he lived to be over ninety something years old, you know.  And I, I wanted to go see him, my uncle kept in contact with him, I wanted to go see him and talk to him and get some stories about how when we were coming up, you know, but I never unfortunately took the, the time to go out and, and, and see him.
Story_ID: 611743
Speaker 1: I remember going to Sexton School [Austin O. Sexton Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  Like I said we only went there up until the third grade.  But I remember kindergarten.  We had, we used to have to sit on this circle and play these little circle games and stuff.  I remember this cute girl that was there I used to like and I was always, you know, running around sitting next to her.  Then she would like run away from me, you know, and I'd follow her after school and I told her mom I said, you know, your daughter won't sit next to me, you know.  Little did I know she had told her mom about me, (laughter) you know.  And her mom said that she told her daughter to sit next to all the, the kids, you know, so she shouldn't sit next to the same kid every time, you know.  So I was upset she wouldn't sit next to me every day, (laughter) you know.  So it kind of a--oh, also I went to church over there, we went to church at St. Edmund's Episcopal Church [Chicago, Illinois] which was on 61st [Street] and, and Michigan [Avenue].  And I remember Father Martin [Samuel Joseph Martin] was, was the priest over there.  And we'd go to church, I guess, we would go every Sunday, I don't know if we went every Sunday or not but I know we went very regularly.  And I remember one day, my parents [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs and Elmer Burroughs] weren't going and I still wanted to go to church.  So my mom let me go by myself so it was the first time I took the bus by myself.  So I don't know how old I was but I know it was eight years or, or less.  And she told me how much money I had to pay to go to church, told me walk up to 61st Street, which is only one block away, and they, the bus stopped right at the corner and then just get on and, you know, get off right at, you know, at Michigan, you know, so it was no big deal.  So I was able to get to church very easily but I could not get home, (laughter) you know.  So I stood on the corner and waited and waited and waited and was never able to get home 'cause there was never a bus going, taking me back the other direction.  Finally someone was walking down the street and saw that I was standing on the bus going in the opposite direction and he told me I had to cross the street and catch the bus on the other side of the street to come back the other way, which I really didn't know, you know (laughter).  So finally I did that and I was able to get back home.  My mother was trying to figure out why it took me so long, you know, to come home, you know.  I remember my mom taking me to the library.  We had a library on 61st and Eberhart [Avenue].  I forget the name of the library but I remember her taking me there and I would get books and read books and, and bring 'em back, you know.  And I remember back in--'cause around 1992, that library closed down and they built this Bessie Coleman Library [Bessie Coleman Branch Library, Chicago, Illinois] on 63rd right off of, it's either off of King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] or Cottage [Cottage Grove Avenue], I can't remember, but they were closing that library down and I was--somehow I heard about it and I drove by the library 'cause I remember going there as a kid and I remember they didn't have regular desks they had a long slanted thing where you put the books on the slant and had all the desks that went up on this little slanted board, I can't remember what it, what they called it, but I remember when I went there when they were closing down they still had the thing there and it brought back memories, I used to go there as a kid, you know.

Speaker 1: St. Edmund's Church [St. Edmund's Episcopal Church, Chicago, Illinois] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So I, I went to St., St. Edmund's and later on after we moved, we transferred to St. George's Church [St. George's Episcopal Church, Chicago, Illinois].  Little did I know that my ancestors also, my [paternal] grandparents [Alma Rice Burroughs and Asa Morris Burroughs] they went to St. Thomas Episcopal Church which is the first black Episcopal church in Chicago [Illinois] and they actually transferred from St. Thomas to St. Edmund's.
Speaker 1: That's over on Wabash [Avenue] right?
Speaker 2: Right, right, exactly, yeah.  And then when I transferred from St. Edmund's we went to St. George's on 76th [Street] and Maryland [Avenue].  Then I became an altar boy and then wanted to be a priest at one time, (laughter) you know.  So that was one of my early aspirations, you know.
Story_ID: 611745
Speaker 1: Now was music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Not really.  My, my mom [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs] and dad [Elmer Burroughs], I mean, I don't have any real memories of, I mean, they weren't really big jazz fans or blues fans or anything like that.
Speaker 1: They played the radio a lot or--
Speaker 2: Pardon me?
Speaker 1: Did they play the radio a lot or--
Speaker 2: Not that I, you know, remember, you know.  There's no albums, you know, that were passed down.  Now my grandmother had some albums but to be perfectly honest, I don't know what kind of music my grandmother listened to, what kind of albums that she had.  She had a, oh, you know, like 78 [78 rpm record] kind of things with the Victrola.  In fact, I have her Victrola, you know, after she died.  But I don't have any of the, the records that she played.  I know well, she always got ticked off with my cousin out in California because he peed on 'em and ruined some of the records, (laughter) you know.
Speaker 1: He peed?
Speaker 2: Well he was a little kid, you know, I don't know how he, how that happened.  I forgot to ask my cousin how that happened, you know (laughter).  But I, you know, it's just one of those stories that stuck in your mind, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, now what about television and movies?
Speaker 2: Well I remember we used to watch Westerns; Westerns were the big thing.  I remember there was a theater on 61st Street called the Amo Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] and we would go there periodically, not often but we would go there periodically.  I remember my uncle was there the night that the theater closed down.  Someone took a knife and slashed it up, I don't know if he was drunk, crazy, or whatever but--
Speaker 1: Slashed the screen up?
Speaker 2: Slashed, slashed the screen up, yeah, yeah, it was real crazy.
Story_ID: 611746
Speaker 1: I do remember the Parkway Community House was on 51st [Street] and, and South Park [South Parkway], King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive], and that's, started through the WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration].  Well really the Parkway Community House started from, from Good Shepherd Church [Church of the Good Shepherd; Church of the Good Shepherd Congregational United Church of Christ, Chicago, Illinois] on 57th [Street] and, and Prairie [Avenue] but they bought it over from the Chicago Orphan Asylum [Chicago, Illinois] which, I think built it back around 1899 but Good Shepherd took it over in the 1930s as part of the WPA project.  And that's actually where Horace Cayton [Horace R. Cayton, Jr.] worked, wrote 'Black Metropolis' ['Black Metropolis: A Study of Negro Life in a Northern City'] with St. Clair Drake.  And so a lot of the, the prominent writers during the '30s [1930s] would come over there and they would recite poetry and give readings and do research and--
Speaker 2: You're talking about people like Margaret Walker (unclear).
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, absolutely, Margaret Walker.
Speaker 2: Richard Wright.
Speaker 1: Langston Hughes.
Speaker 2: That whole, that whole group (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, all of them, right, absolutely.  Yeah, that, that was the center of cultural activity back then.  I understand John Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] brought out the first issue of Ebony right there, you know, had a, had an office in the building.  But when we were coming up my brother [Asa Burroughs] and I used to go there for, for dance lessons and so, we would take dance lessons, I think we took some singing lessons there too.  We were members of a drama club and our drama instructor was named Dew Drop Wamsley [ph.].  So I mean it was such an unusual name I never forgot it, you know.
Speaker 2: Dew, Dew Drop, is it--?
Speaker 1: Dew Drop.
Speaker 2: D-E-W?
Speaker 1: D-E-W, Drop, D-R-O-P, Dew Drop.  And someone asked me was that her given name or was it a stage name and I really don't know.  I'd like to do some research to find out if that was her, her given name or her stage name, you know.  But she liked the theater and whatever and she set up a, a drama club, for, you know, people in the community.  And so we, we took lessons over there and we were actually in an operetta, my brother and I.  In fact, I, I just found out that my baby brother was in there also and we performed at the Regal [Regal Theater, Chicago, Illinois] back in the early '50s [1950s], you know.  So we trained there at Parkway Community House but then the performance was, was put on over at the Regal.
Speaker 2: That's before Parkway moved to 500 East 67th Street?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, exactly.
Speaker 2: Most people when they hear about it--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --it's in that location--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --but that's way before.
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly, yep, they moved there.  And they moved there actually in the mid-'50s [1950s] I think, around '57 [1957] or '58 [1958], and the, the Baptist took over that building and then they moved over there, you know, on 67th Street, yeah.  But it was kind of a, a center of, of cultural activity.
Speaker 2: And it was on the parkway then.
Speaker 1: Exactly, that's where the name came from.  It was the Parkway Community House because it was on South Parkway.  And that's where the Parkway Ballroom [Chicago, Illinois] got its name from too, 'cause it was on South Parkway.  You know, we kind of called it South Park but the legal name was South Parkway, you know.  So several establishments, you know, took the name of, of, of the street, you know.
Story_ID: 611747
Speaker 1: I know everybody wants me to ask you this, probably who is watch--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --watching this, but are you related to [HistoryMaker] Margaret Burroughs in any way (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I get that question almost every week.  We're not related.  When I came, when I first started doing genealogy, I thought we might have been related.  I talked with her and she introduced me to her husband, Charlie Burroughs [Charles Burroughs], and I interviewed him and he can go back as far as his grandparents that were from Texas.  My ancestors were from South Carolina.  Growing up there were only about five Burroughs in the telephone book, Margaret and Charlie Burroughs were one, and our family was one, my uncle, Leonard Burroughs, my uncle, Morris Burroughs, there was a, a Leonard Burroughs who I think was a dentist here.  There was a Bishop Burroughs [ph.], and there might have been one other, but that's all the Burroughs that were in the telephone book.  So Burroughs is not a common name in Chicago [Illinois] and it's not a common name in Illinois.  When I got to do my research in South Carolina, I started writing down all the Burroughs, and I mean it became so voluminous I realized it wasn't an uncommon name in South Carolina, very common in South Carolina.  Very common in Virginia, very common name in Massachusetts, all up and down the eastern seaboard, Burroughs is a very, very common name.  That's where they have Burroughs computers [Burroughs Corporation] also.  And Edgar Rice Burroughs, you know.  But no, we haven't found any connection with Margaret's husband Charlie Burroughs.  But I get that question every month.  I even did a, a genealogy presentation in, in Springfield [Illinois] and when I arrived the lady said, "Oh, we got everything set up, we even have, you know, your mother's art work set up in the lobby," (laughter) you know, assuming, you know, she was my mother.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the son of Margaret Burroughs.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, right, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: But now that makes sense to most people 'cause most people tend to think--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that that genetics play a huge role and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and because if your father was great you're gonna be great--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and, and so forth and so on.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.  And we're kind of in related fields, you know, yeah, yeah.  And both--you know, here in Chicago and name is bandied about the press a lot, so a lot of people really assume that, you know.
Story_ID: 611748
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a little kid growing up?  I mean, what were, what were, what was your personality like, what did you like to do and what were your concerns?
Speaker 2: I would say I was a person that that joked a lot, played a lot, and was an athlete.  Again, you know, we grew up playing baseball and played every day and seven days a week, you know.  I never, I never saw a basketball until I was in eighth grade.  You know, I never even knew what basketball was like.  And I don't think I touched a football until eighth grade or, or in high school, you know.  So at that time, baseball was it.  And I played on the Little League.  I played on Pony League, you know.  When I went to high school, I was really upset because we didn't have a baseball team because it was a, a relatively new high school, Harlan High School [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], and ended up running track, you know.  But again track was a, another sport 'cause I liked to run.  So I guess growing up we had a relatively big family, I had four siblings.  Then I had Lydia [ph.] and her brother, Smitty [ph.], and my cousin, Kenton [ph.], so I had three cousins that also lived in the same house.  Plus we had, you know, kids along the block.  So, you know, we had enough where we could play with just ourselves or we could play, you know, kids in, in the community too.  Plus my other cousins lived not too far away and we would get together periodically.  So I guess, growing up I just remember, you know, being an athlete and, you know, joking around and playing and having fun and having a, a very enjoyable, you know, childhood.
Story_ID: 611749
Speaker 1: Did you like school?
Speaker 2: I liked school.  You know, I had no problems with school.  In fact, I loved school, you know.  I liked to read.  You know, I had a lot of friends in school.  So I liked my friends.  Teachers, I have basically fond memories of, of, of teachers.  Don't remember a lot about any teachers at Sexton [Austin O. Sexton Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  Burnside [Burnside Elementary School; Burnside Scholastic Academy, Chicago, Illinois], I remember a couple of teachers at, at, at Burnside.
Speaker 1: Did you have black teach, teachers at any of these schools?
Speaker 2: We had a couple black teachers at Gillespie [Gillespie Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], primarily white teach--I mean at Burnside.  We had a, a couple of black teachers but primarily white teachers.  So we had both but it was only like one or two, I think, really black teachers.  Gillespie, we had more black teachers at Gillespie.  I remember the shop teacher was black, the, phys ed [physical education] instructor was black.  My homeroom teacher was black.  So it was more black ones in Gillespie for some reason, you know.  High school was, was mixed, we had, had both, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now did, did you like history in school?
Speaker 2: I did but it wasn't anything that like really stuck out, you know.  It, it, it wasn't anything where I said, where I really like history and it wasn't anything where I really hated history.  To me it was just, you know, like kind of neutral.  You know, I guess, my favorite class was like physical education.  I liked biology, you know.  I liked chemistry.  I was in the drama club in, in high school and I really liked acting.  You know, I was in two plays.  I was, I was a star of a, of a one act play and I played a bit role in, in a three act play.  So I enjoyed being in the drama club.  In fact, I always say that a lot of my speaking skills goes back to my drama instructor when I was in high school, you know, because he taught us how to enunciate, how to talk, how to project, you know, stage presence.  As well as, you know, when I was a kid, you know, at, at Parkway Community House [Chicago, Illinois] being in, in the theater there, you know.  I can't think of--in high school I was in the band, you know, I played the trumpet in high school.  Can't really think of any classes that I like really hated or any classes that, you know, I really, you know, like fell in love with, you know.  But I enjoyed the school experience.
Speaker 1: Now you were at John Marshall Harlan--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --High School [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Harlan High School from what I've been told by all the Harlanites, it was a golden age for Harlan (laughter) when you were there.  I have, I have never met people that talk so much about their school--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: I mean, outside of, you know, the, the old--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --time, timers that went to Phillips [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois] when it--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --first, you know.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: That group, but Harlan--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --for some reason people they, they talk about it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --like it was paradise--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when you go there.
Speaker 2: I believe Harlan was a special school probably 'cause it was one of the newer schools in the system.  It got started in the '50s [1950s], let's see, I started there in '63 [1963], I think Harlan opened in '57 [1957], I think.  So it wasn't that old, what's that six years old when I started there?
Speaker 1: Yeah, about.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, yeah in '63 [1963], and, and '57 [1957].  So it was only about six years old.  So the, the, the physical plant was literally new.  A lot of the teachers wanted to teach there because it was new.  It was located pretty much on the outskirts of the city.  It was in the City of Chicago [Illinois] but by being on, on 97th [Street], I think the only, the only two schools that were south of that were like Morgan Park [Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois] and Fenger [Fenger High School; Christian Fenger Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] which were both very old schools, you know.  A lot of the community around there was still white.  So when I started there it was an integrated school, you know, in terms of the students.  When I left there it was predominantly black.  But when I started there was a very, very good number of white kids that that were still going to school there.
Story_ID: 611750
Speaker 1: So the, the community around there, blacks were just moving into the community around there.  In fact, I remember when a lot of those homes were built, you know, in Chatham and West Chesterfield [Chicago, Illinois], you know, et cetera.  Now in West Chesterfield which is like 90 [90th Street], 91st [Street], well maybe West Chesterfield starts at 87th [Street], maybe it goes from 87th to 95th, King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] to, to the Dan Ryan [Expressway], maybe that's the whole area of West Chesterfield.  But the area around 91st to 93rd [Street] from King Drive over to Indiana [Avenue], a lot of those were government homes that were built right after World War II [WWII] so a lot of veterans took those homes.  But a lot of the other homes were built during my lifetime when I was growing up around there 'cause we used to, when we were kids, when we first moved over there, we would go over there in the foundations when they would build 'em, and the cops would be around there and we would run from the cops, we wouldn't even do anything wrong, we would just run from the cops 'cause they knew they would chase us, you know, so we were just having fun.  And I, I also remember one foundation was abandoned and some of my friends--this was, this was around 90th, around north of Tuley Park [Chicago, Illinois], so it was either maybe 89th [Street], around 89th and, and St. Lawrence [Avenue], it was a vacant lot where they were building a home and the home was, was abandoned and they only had the foundation there.  Well so my friend, friends had built a clubhouse under there where you can go over there and go underground and you had all these little components there underground.  What I know is, they had taken the foundation, putting plywood across the top and put dirt across the top so you didn't even know anything was there.  And there was a little door or some entrance where you can go in and they had little, you know, cubby holes along in there.  So we used to go in there and play a lot of times, you know, during, during lunchtime.  In fact, that's where I smoked my first cigarette at six years old, (laughter) you know.
Speaker 2: Six years old?
Speaker 1: Six, I'm sorry, not six years old, sixth grade.
Speaker 2: Sixth--
Speaker 1: Sixth grade.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So I guess I was like about eleven, you know.  I never smoked after that but it was just, you know, someone had some and we like tried it, you know, in this little clubhouse.  I don't know what they called it, you know.  But so, I got lost where we were coming into that but--
Speaker 2: We were talking about--
Speaker 1: --you--
Speaker 2: --Harlan [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Oh, Harlan, Harlan, right, right.
Speaker 2: School.
Speaker 1: So what happened was a lot of people wanted to go to the school that didn't live in the community because it was a newer school and because the people that were moving out south and building new homes out there, those were middle class people and people that were upgraded from moving from the 40s and the 50s and the 60s, moving out south into the 80s and the 90s.  So some people moved out there because of the school.  Some people didn't live out there but they wanted to be out there because of the school, so they found a relative or a friend or something and they used their address to try to, you know, move out there.  So, so, you know, the school kind of developed a reputation for being a quote, quote better kind of school or whatever.  I guess some of the better teachers, you know, wanted to go out there so they went out there.
Story_ID: 611751
Speaker 1: I was upset initially because they didn't have a baseball team and, you know, I wanted to, you know, play professional baseball.  So I was mentally and psychologically just really crushed, you know, 'cause again, I had played baseball all my life.  I ended up joining the track team, little did I know that the track coach there [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], Gerald Richard, was one of the best track coaches in the country.  He actually coached, I think during the Pan American Games, and I think he actually did some coaching during the Olympics too.
Speaker 2: And he ran like one of the--was one of the key organizing places for the Chicago Mayor Daley track club [Mayor Daley Youth Foundation] right there.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, absolutely, absolutely, right, right, right. Yeah, yeah.  'Cause during the--
Speaker 2: (Unclear), I think.
Speaker 1: Pardon me?  Yeah, right, right.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.  'Cause we ran in Mayor Daley's [Richard J. Daley], you know, track meets in University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  The track coach would take us all over, you know, to run track.  We went out to Oak Park relays, we went out to Mooseheart [Illinois] out in the western suburbs.  During the summer we ran with the track club at, at Stagg Field [Amos Alonzo Stagg Field, Chicago, Illinois].  We ran--at that time they had indoor relays, Daily News newspaper [Chicago Daily News] in Chicago [Illinois] had the Daily News relays.  I think, it was at the Chicago, old Chicago Stadium [Chicago, Illinois], you know, when they ran on boards in there, you know.  So they had a youth division, you know, so we, we ran in that.  We used to go out to Drake Relays, you know, 'cause they had a high school division out, out at Drake Relays.  So I really got into track, you know.  And I was a little fast but I remember the first day I came out for the track team.  And, in fact, the coach, Gerald Richard, actually built that track behind the school, it's a cinder track.  But when I came out, for some reason I tried out for the team, we were running in Abbott Park [Chicago, Illinois] and I don't remember if the track had not been built then or it was cross country season or preseason or whatever, I can't remember, but I remember running in Abbott Park and I remember I told the coach I wanted to run and he said okay jump in there and I went out there and I beat almost every kid out there.  So he said fine, son, now do it again.  I said do it again, I'm tired now, (laughter) you know.  So when I ran the second time I think I was like dead last, you know, and everyone just blew past me, you know.  So I had some speed but I wasn't that in shape, you know.  And I didn't understand conditioning, I didn't understand getting in shape.  So he was able to--in fact, he looked at me and could tell I wasn't in shape.  And I didn't realize it but I, I learned from him and, and also majored in physical education when I went to, to SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois], is that when you're not in shape, your, your thighs are like flabby but once you get in shape, all your muscles are defined and each muscle is defined in your leg and you see all the different muscles in your leg.  And again, a good coach can just look at a, at a person and tell without him even running if he's in shape or not, you know.  So, so I went out for the team, my best friend, Freddy Barn [ph.] who lived on 93rd [Street] and, and Prairie [Avenue], he joined the team with me, you know.  And he used to play baseball, you know, we used to play baseball together also.  So we joined the track team. And it was really--turned out to be one of the high points of my life.
Story_ID: 611752
Speaker 1: I had no knowledge of track, although I had, I had run before then with, with the day camp.  We went to day camp at, at Tuley Park [Chicago, Illinois].  'Cause that's, in fact, once I got older we played Little League at Tuley Park but also I was in the day camp at Tuley and they had a track there at Tuley Park and we ran in meets there at Tuley.  And then we had a meet, we had one meet up at Palmer Park [Chicago, Illinois] which was a 111th [Street] and, and South Park [South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive].  And I hadn't asked--I didn't know we were having a meet that day or if they told me I didn't, forgot about it or whatever.  So I told the coach [Gerald Richard], I had to ask permission from my mom [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs], so I had to walk all the way home, get permission, my mom said I can go, by the time I came back the team had already left, so then I had to walk from Tuley Park at 91st [Street] and South Park all the way up to 111th, by the time I got there, it was time for me to jump down there and run, you know, and I was so out, so wore out from walking all that distance that, you know, I didn't do anything in the meet but I did run a little bit of track when I was in grammar school before I actually, you know, like went to high school [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: What was your event?
Speaker 1: I ran sprints.  I ran the hundred, hundred, hundred yard dash at that time, now they run meters but it was a hundred yard dash, 220 yard dash.  I ran the half mile relay where everybody runs 220.  And I did a little bit of long jumping.  I also ran sprint medley relay, where sprint medley, first guy runs, I think, first, first guys runs a half mile, second two legs run a 220, and the last guy runs a quarter mile.  So I ran one of the, the 220 legs.  And actually on that sprint medley relay, we got a, we got a city record there at one of the meets, you know.  So I ran pretty good.  I ran for a couple of years and ended up getting a job after school, you know, and I stopped running, you know.  But it was a tremendous experience because the coach was one of the best coaches in the city.  And during the winter we still had to run.  So when we came out for preseason, it might have been snowing on the ground, it might have been raining, we still had to go out, no matter what the weather was.  And naturally, you know, if it's rain outside you don't wanna go out and run or if it's snow on the ground.  And what he did was, he had this analgesic balm, where you rub the balm on your legs and your arms and you put your sweatpants over it and it'll retain the heat in.  So if it was, you know, freezing outside, twenty degrees, you were still warm because this balm would retain your natural heat and, you know, your body's what 98.6 degrees.  So, you know, you would stay warm.  So I did and, you know, we had track cleats on, so we were able to run no matter what the weather was.  So that experience to me was, was really a life changing event because what it taught me was, no matter what the weather, it doesn't stop you from doing anything.  And, and it taught me a lot about hard work, about conditioning, about, about mental strength and, and our coach used to have sayings like a quitter never wins and a winner never quits.  And that was something, you know, that played on your mind and he would drill it in and drill it in and drill it in, you know.  And the fact that you didn't finish when you came to the tape you ran through, you know, the tape, and a lot of other sayings that he used to give us, you know.  Again, not only working on our physical skills but also working on our, our mental skills and our mental conditioning, you know.  So I really learned a lot from that experience which really carried over, you know, like later on in life, you know.  And I didn't wanna run cross country and he told us that we had to run cross country in the winter and the only way--cross country was like two miles then, and I didn't even like to run a quarter mile let alone two miles, you know, 'cause I always liked, you know, the sprint events.  So he said the only way to get out of cross country was to play football.

Speaker 1: So then I joined the football team and played football a couple of years or one year, is it, I can't remember if it was one year or two years but our football coach, Sherman Howard played with the New York Giants, you know.
Speaker 2: So, so what did you play in football?
Speaker 1: Halfback.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Halfback, yeah.  But the problem was I missed spring training because I was running track.  So spring training I found out was very, very valuable because you not only learn the plays but you also in the gym, walk through the plays.  So you knew, you know, when the guard was pulling, and who you were supposed to follow and where the hole was.  By the time I got out in the fall, I mean, they had pads on, they already knew everything, so I was like way, way behind the eight ball, you know.  So I was never able to really develop, you know, my potential as I, I, I really could have, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now were you in clubs in high school [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and that sort of thing or--?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Well in addition to the track and football, I was in the drama club, so again I played in two plays.  I played in 'Three's a Crowd,' and so I was one of the stars in 'Three's a Crowd.'  Howard Toles [ph.] played opposite me.  And 'Three's a Crowd' was a, was a, a nice little play where a guy took another guy's lady, (laughter) you know, so it was three of us, me, him, and this one lady, you know, so we were fighting over his lady, you know.  And the other three act play was 'Death Takes a Holiday' [Alberto Casella].  And I didn't have a major, I really had a, a minor role in that but I learned, you know, what plays were, how to memorize lines, you know, how to move on, on the stage and how to project, spent a lot of time with the backstage with the--I forget what they call it but, but the people who set up the lights.
Speaker 2: The tech people.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: The tech crew.
Speaker 1: The tech crew, yeah, yeah.  And I forgot what they call 'em but they were actually a club in and of itself and they dealt with the sound, the lighting, the props, and all of that, you know.  But I got a chance to meet them, see what they do, and all--
Speaker 2: Audiovisual club or something or--
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't AV.  What did they name that club?  I really can't remember.
Speaker 2: Stagehands union local number.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) No, not the local union, you know, fortunately, you know.  So that was, that was cool.  What other group was I a member of?
Speaker 2: Did you run for office or anything or--
Speaker 1: I ran for pop--prom king, and came in second to my best friend, (laughter) Freddy Barn [ph.], Freddy Barn, well I don't know how I came in second but anyway.  So I had to, I had to give a speech, you know, for that.  You know, I guess, we had to garner up votes, politic, you know, and they had, had to give a speech.  I think everybody gave a speech for us to do some kind of acting or maybe, maybe we had do something different, I guess mine was, was doing a speech, you know.  I think, I know I was in student government in college [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] but I don't think I was in student government, I wasn't in student government in high school.
Story_ID: 611754
Speaker 1: Did you know you were going to college when you were in high school?  Did you, did you have a pretty good idea (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I always wanted to go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I always wanted to go to college.  When I was running track, I wanted to go to, to San Jose State [San Jose State College; San Jose State University, San Jose, California] 'cause they had a great track team.  Then I wanted to go to Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] 'cause I knew they had a, had a great track team, you know.  So those were my two aspirations, you know, for going to college.
Speaker 1: San Jose State had [HistoryMaker] John Carlos, I think.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.  Boy, you're tough, (laughter) you're tough, oh, yeah, yeah.  And then I would always watch the Olympics, you know.  We had a, a lady who went to Harlan [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], Norma Harris, who ran in the Pan American Games, went to Tennessee State.  So I was good friends with, I wasn't really good friends, she was a little older than I was but I, I knew Norma.  So she was, you know, an inspiration also.
Speaker 1: There are quite a few of 'em that some, some, some we've interviewed even went to Pomona [California] for the Olympic tryouts.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, wow.
Speaker 1: And Pat Hill [HistoryMaker Patricia Hill], Barbara Pillows [sic. Barbara Ferrell-Edmonson].  They didn't make the team but they were--
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.  Well a guy, you probably haven't interviewed, but I don't know if you know the name Ronald Draper.
Speaker 1: I've heard of him.
Speaker 2: He's a, he's an attorney here in Chicago [Illinois].  He ran track at Harlan.  And after I left, I graduated in '66 [1966], in '67 [1967], they actually won the state title.  We had won the city title a couple of times but in '67 [1967] they won the state title.  Draper was on that team as a hurdler.  And then I think he tried out for the Olympic team and I can't remember, I can't remember if he ran in the Olympics or, or he got injured or something (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think he did, I think he did.  But--
Story_ID: 611755
Speaker 1: I was in the band so I learned how to play the trumpet.  You know, I was in the--the junior concert band.  And I played pretty good but I, I never reached my full potential because I never owned a horn.  My parents [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs and Elmer Burroughs] never bought me one.  They had trumpets there at the school and we were able to borrow them but then by us being the younger kids, the older kids had first dibs, you know, on borrowing.  So I wasn't able to really practice as much as, you know, I really would have liked to have practiced, you know.  And yet in spite of that I still became, you know, like pretty good, you know, and I could play a lot of, you know, different songs, whatever.  We all did like classical kind of music, you know, which was good 'cause that gives you like a good foundation, you know.  And I really, really liked playing, you know.  So if I wasn't doing track, football, theater, or music, you know, then I probably would have been in some other--you know, like clubs or something but those were, you know, the activities that I got involved in until I started working after school, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 611756
Speaker 1: Now, what did you do after school?
Speaker 2: My job after school was working at Presbyterian St. Luke's Hospital [Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois].  My aunt, my Aunt Doris [Doris Brooks], Lydia's [ph.] mother, was an administrator over there.  So I needed, you know, some spending money, you know, so we got a job over there working as what they called an attendant.  So we worked on the pre-op floor where patients that were doing surgery, they would come in, they would stay on a particular floor, they would put their things in a locker, they would have their surgery, and then they would move to a post-op floor, you know.  And our primary responsibility was to take their personal belongings from the pre-op floor to the post-op floor.  But as long as we were there, they had us doing a lot of miscellaneous stuff too, so we learned how to chart temperatures, you know, and chart stuff in the, in the patients' books.  We would go down and, and pick up stuff, you know, meds or--I can't remember what we picked up but, you know, they'd have us run errands picking up stuff.  Every now and then we'd have to take a body down to the morgue.  It wasn't often but every now and then--it wasn't our primary job.  And I remember one time, we worked in a newer wing of the hospital--well it's not new now but at that time it was new, but the old wing was connected on to the new wing and the morgue was in the old wing.  And I never will forget I had to go pick up a body and it was on this gurney and this woman must have weighed about three hundred pounds, man.  And I remember pushing this body and I got to the old wing and the floor was not smooth, they had some dips in it, when I went on to one of them dips and that body started shaking, I got scared (laughter) to death, thinking she was still alive, knowing she wasn't, you know, but that was just kind of scary, you know.  And, you know, I was, you know, like high school, you know, a junior and senior in high school [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], you know.  But we didn't, you know, have that to do often, you know.  But it was a good job, you know, it paid good money and when you're in high school, you know, every little bit, you know, like helps out quite a bit, you know.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 611757
Speaker 1: How did you decide on going to SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, my dad [Elmer Burroughs] wanted me to go to school in Chicago [Illinois] because he didn't have enough money to send me away to school.  When I was on the track team, our team--I didn't go to run down state but we had some members of our team that were in the state meet, so I went down--at that time, the state meet was in Champaign-Urbana [Illinois].  So I went down to Champaign [Illinois] for the state meet which was probably in June, I think, around the first week of June or something, and it was the first time I had been on a college campus and it was like being in heaven.  I mean, first of all, there were no adults, there was just tons and tons of young kids and all the women were wearing shorts or like miniskirts and whatever and I said hey this is like the land of bees and honey.  So I said I'm going away to college, you know.  So again, I wanted to go to San Jose State [San Jose State College; San Jose State University, San Jose, California] and I also wanted to go to Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].  So I sent for some information to Tennessee State.  When it came back it was all confusing because all the photographs were of white kids and I knew that Tennessee State was a black school [HBCU].  I had realized instead of sending it to Tennessee A and I State University, I sent it to Middle Tennessee State University [Murfreesboro, Tennessee] (laughter) so it was a completely different school, you know.  So I was way off track there.  And then some of my friends were going to SIU, so then I said well, let me check out SIU and I found out that I could pay in state tuition and I could get a Illinois state scholarship grant.  Tuition was like $80.50, and I can get a Illinois guaranteed loan and that would pay for, for my school.  So by being able to pay in state tuition and not paying what I would have had to pay going out to San Jose State or Tennessee State and then getting Illinois state, you know, guaranteed loan and then by me working, I could--able to afford, you know, like to go to school.  And then I had some friends at SIU so that's how I decided, you know, to go there.  Wasn't anything very scientific, wasn't any--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, wasn't because of their academic curriculum or anything like that.
Story_ID: 611758
Speaker 1: So this is 1966 that you graduate from high school [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and then you go (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: You go on to Tennessee--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I mean to SIU [Southern Illinois University]?
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: All right.  That's down in--
Speaker 2: Carbondale [Illinois].
Speaker 1: --what they call Little Egypt and stuff like that.
Speaker 2: Right, right, they call the area Little Egypt, absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: I didn't have any idea their paper was called The Egyptian [The Daily Egyptian] until--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --I saw it, I just saw it.
Speaker 2: In The Daily Egyptian.
Speaker 1: I, I know the team was the Salukis.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The Egyptian dog (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right, yeah, yeah, yeah, the whole--.  And, you know, they got Cairo [Illinois], you know, from, you know, Cairo, Egypt.  Cairo is in Alexander County [Illinois], from Alexandria [Egypt], you know.  So everything around there is related in some kind of way to Egypt, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the area that Huckleberry Finn was in, in the, his book ['The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,' Mark Twain], I mean, he (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: He had Jim end up on a raft--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --sailing around in Little Egypt.
Speaker 2: Right, right, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: So, so how did, how, how, how did you like SIU?
Speaker 2: I loved it.  I loved everything about it.  When I first--my best friend at the time Freddy Barn [ph.] and I and our parents, our two fathers, drove down there together to register during the summer, excuse me.  What I didn't realize was, excuse me, I was supposed to pay my tuition at that time.  I knew I was getting this loan but I wasn't picking up the money for the loan until I got down to school in September.  So once I actually arrived on campus my registration was canceled 'cause I hadn't paid my tuition.  So I had to reregister all over again.  So whereas everybody else had preregistered, picked everything off all fine, and so I had go through everything again.  In a way it was kind of a blessing in disguise, because whereas my father [Elmer Burroughs] was with me when I registered the first time, now I had to do that all over again on my own.  So I had to find out where these buildings were, and how to do this and how to do that.  So it really kind of helped mature me very, very quickly, you know.  So I was able to learn a lot of the campus where other people didn't know, you know, other parts of the campus.
Story_ID: 611759
Speaker 1: One of my other very good friends I went to high school with was pledging a fraternity, he was pledging Kappa Alpha Psi [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity].  I didn't know anything about fraternities when I got there [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois].  I had a white roommate and I think he was from the suburbs somewhere, but we got along very well.  And that was good too because there were white kids when I went to high school [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] even though as--by the time I graduated it was predominantly black, but it helped me because I was able to develop a closer relationship with white people.  The other thing was in the dorm I stayed in, there were one, two, three--there was three or five blacks on our whole floor, so the majority of our, where we stayed the dorm was only like three stories.  So in our unit, there were only a few blacks, predominantly white.  But again that helped me, you know, interact with them and, and, you know, understand how to deal, you know, with people from a different culture.  My friend who was pledging a fraternity, when they went on ship during hell week, he wanted to use my house as their dog--what they called their doghouse.  That's where they hid out from the fraternity brothers while they were on, you know, like hell week.  I had no knowledge of what any of that was about but I just knew he needed a crib to get away from everybody so I said fine you can use, you know, my dorm room, you know.  So from that, I learned a little bit about fraternities, you know, and what fraternities were about.  So I, I saw that this thing was very, very challenging and I wanted to know did I have the mental fortitude to go through it myself.  So then I decided to pledge a fraternity.  So then the following quarter, then I pledged a fraternity.
Speaker 2: That was what Kappa Alpha Psi?
Speaker 1: Right, right, right, exactly.  And being away from home, now when I was younger, we went away to camp up in Muskegon, Michigan, it was a church camp aligned with the Episcopal church called Camp (Unclear).  And so that was being away from home at camp, I think, for maybe two weeks.  But being away to college was my real first time.  We only got, I guess, my second time being away on my own, you know.  So it was, you know, a learning process, a maturing process.  I went to the library every day, you know, to study.  During high school, I really didn't study that much.  I basically kind of got a C average.  My parents [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs and Elmer Burroughs], you know, looked at my report card, made sure I had good grades but they weren't the kind of parents that said, "What's your homework for today." "You gotta study today." "You gotta put in three hours," you know, like every night, you know.  They were out working and, you know, came home and we never had that rigid discipline of studying.  But for some reason I learned that when I got to college, I was gonna have to study every day.  And I don't know how I picked it up but I went to the library every day and I studied.  And it was, it was challenging, you know, it was very challenging.  I had classes where it was like two hundred people in the auditorium and I was like the only black, you know, in the whole auditorium, you know.  Some classes were smaller than that but I knew that some of the things they were talking about, you know, I had no knowledge of, and I knew I was gonna have to read the book and I was gonna have to get up to speed and understand what the heck was going on.  So fortunately something inside of me gave me the independence and, and, and fortitude that I was gonna have to sit down and study.  So I was able to, you know, get through the first quarter.  When I joined the fraternity we had all these extracurricular activities to do pledging, and so I couldn't study as much as I did, you know, the first quarter, and I pulled, you know, basically some bad grades.  But I was able to get through the fraternity and I was able to, you know--I actually, when I started pledging, I was actually president of our pledge club called the Scrollers.  Then we went on hell week then another guy was actually in charge of the line, you know, when we went on hell week.  But I pulled bad grades.  And then the third quarter then what I did was I repeated some of the courses where I had bad grades in, you know, and I was able to get, you know, like Bs and a couple of A's, you know, from those ones that I repeated because I just didn't want those bad grades, you know, to be on my record, you know.  So actually my first quarter was my worst quarter, my first two, or my first 'cause the first one I was struggling, second quarter I was pledging, then the third quarter I started getting good grades and then after that, you know, I got, you know, very good grades.  You know, I, I was never an A student but I got a lot of Cs and a lot of Bs, you know.  I tried to play the trumpet the first year and I had some private lessons but for some reason I just didn't stick with it.  I tried to run track, but the caliber there was much, much higher and I didn't stick with that because really when I was in high school I didn't run my last two years 'cause I was working. So missing out on that there was a big gap between, at the collegiate level.  In fact, one of my fraternity brothers was Ivory Crockett who had the world record in the hundred, hundred yard dash at the time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ivory Crockett, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm, right.  So it was a good quality track team that that we had there.  And we had another guy that ran in, in the Olympics too.
Story_ID: 611760
Speaker 1: Well you also had that basketball team when you were--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --a freshman won the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Walt Frazier, right.
Speaker 1: Won the NIT [National Invitation Tournament], right.
Speaker 2: We won the NIT, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And through high school [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and through college I went to every basketball game, you know.  I never, never missed a, a home game, you know.  So our college basketball team was--well the high school basketball team, I mean, we won city title, you know.  So we had a great, great high school basketball team and a fantastic college basketball team.  And a lot of the college players stayed in our dorm in college, the basketball team and the football team, so I got a chance to know a lot of the players, Walt, and a lot of the guys.  One guy, Dick Garrett played with Los Angeles Lakers for a long time and then played with the Milwaukee Bucks.  Willie Griffin played at SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] and he got cut from the Bulls [Chicago Bulls] and went to Europe and played in, in Europe on the Italian team for over a decade, and he was the star of the team and all the posters, you know, had his, his photograph on there, you know.  So I knew a lot of the athletes, I knew a lot of the, the football players also.
Speaker 1: Did they call him Griff?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they called him Griff, yeah.  Did you know him?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, I know Griff.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right, yeah.  He was just down at the reunion this past weekend down at Carbondale [Illinois], you know.  So that was, was, was really good.
Story_ID: 611761
Speaker 1: From the fraternity [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] I got involved more heavily into the fraternity and I became dean of pledges.  I became, I think, I was--after I was dean of pledges, I think I was, I think strategist--I forget the name, I was like the sergeant at arms or whatever.  And then I became vice polemarch which is like the vice president of the fraternity.  I would have became president, I was in line to be president or what we call polemarch, the following year but that's when I kind of dropped out of the fraternity.  But early on I saw that the fraternity was, it was a fun organization because we had a lot of parties, but it was also an organization where you had to learn Robert's Rules of Order.  You had to learn what committees were.  And, you know, growing up, my mom [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs] and family, we had like a little home family club where we learned Robert's Rules of Order and we paid dues to our self to start savings clubs or whatever.  So I knew a bit of what organizations were about but the fraternity kind of strengthened that, you know, and gave me a little more of it.  From there I branched out and started to join other campus organizations [at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois].  I joined the new student week leader where these were a group of students that helped orientate new students that came to campus.  So the week before everybody else came, when the new students came, we had, you know, older students that would help show them around and answer questions, help them to go to register and this and that and the other.  So I really enjoyed that because I, I got a chance to meet a lot of people.  I was able to work with older students and work with staff people.  I joined student government and worked with student government.  I joined the inter-fraternity council which were fraternity members who had worked with other fraternities and, and how to regulate and deal with issues that involved all Greek organizations.  And then eventually became president of that Midwest organization of all inter-fraternity councils throughout the Midwest.  We worked with, with homecoming.  Our fraternity [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] sponsored our sweetheart for homecoming and we won, she won the homecoming queen contest, it was the first time a black had won homecoming queen, you know.  And then we followed up that with another black, you know, following after that, you know.  It was the, the second black homecoming queen.  Being in the fraternity we built floats to be in the homecoming parade.  So then I, I worked on the homecoming student committee.  And then the following year I was cochairman of homecoming with another homecoming co-chair, so the two of us ran the whole operation of, of, of homecoming.  And that was a, a tremendous experience because it gave me a higher level of dealing with the staff at the university; also with, with vendors, with people that had businesses, you know, in the city and all of the other machinations that help put on a particular homecoming and everything that's in- in- involved with that.  I was also--we had a, our fraternity, our biggest social event was called Kappa Karnival which was a, a big social event during the year where fraternity brothers came from all around the United States and we had a carnival where we had games of chance where people would play and win prizes.  And we would also have a big dance, we had a series of dances, you know.  The main day we would have a big dance and we'd have a theme every year, we would always dress up for those particular kinds of themes.  'Cause one year it was like Kappas in the coliseum and we had like robes on, you know, like Rome- Roman gladiators and whatever.  And each year it was, you know, like a different theme.  So we had a basketball tournament and different chapters throughout, you know, Illinois and from Chicago [Illinois] and from neighboring states would bring their team in and play a big basketball tournament.
Story_ID: 611762
Speaker 1: So I worked on the committee as I, I was in the fraternity [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity].  And then in, I believe, it was '68 [1968], either '68 [1968] or '69 [1969], then I was chairman, you know, of that Kappa Karnival committee.  And one of the things I wanted to do was expand it larger than, than what it was.  So we had started out in the student union, then we got bigger and we moved from the union over to the armory.  So then I thought it could be bigger, so then I took it to the school arena.  And so what I said was, one of the things we need to do to expand it better, and one of the reasons we wanted to expand it is because the fraternity was in debt.  We had a fraternity house and we had, I can't remember how many guys, had, had, had rooms there, but we also had a kitchen there and we had to, we had to pay rent for every room if someone occupied that room or not, we had to pay rent to the university [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois].  We had a food contract and we had to pay for that food whether people ate it or not.  So we had some tremendous bills where some of the guys before us had absconded with the money.  So one of the things that we wanted to do was expand Kappa Karnival to be bigger so we can make more money to pay off our debt.  So I decided what we would have to do is instead of planning a couple of months in advance, why don't we plan a year in advance and that would give us more lead time.  And I expanded the committees where we had, I think we had about four or five different committees, you know, when I came on board and I expanded to about ten or eleven different committees.  So it was really managing a business, you know, making sure there was a chairman of that committee, making sure there were members operating on that committee, made sure that they had reports, overseeing the reports, overseeing what they're doing, make sure that they reported regularly.  And then what we did was we brought [HistoryMaker] Herb Kent down to be the deejay because not only did a lot of--were a lot of people from Chicago that knew about Herb Kent, but a lot of people from Chicago that went to schools in like T State [Tennessee] or Indiana State or other places, they knew about Herb Kent from being in Chicago.  Plus Herb Kent broadcasted on the radio before he came down so he brought a lot of people with him.  And the other thing we did was we brought The Temptations down.  And The Temptations was one of the biggest acts.
Speaker 2: And that's a big deal for those days, right?
Speaker 1: It was huge, man, it was huge, it was huge.  And almost everything worked out perfectly.  One of the things--and I can't remember what it was that didn't work out perfectly, but I remember I got tied up working with people on the door that were handling money.  And what my goal was, was to make sure that I managed those committees.  'Cause, you know, we had, you know, one group that was in charge on, on buying the gifts for all the prizes.  And, you know, one committee that was in charge on, you know, taking care of the basketball tournament.  And, you know, one committee that was in charge of, in charge of setting up all the games, you know, and making sure the games, you know, had worked out all right.  And one committee was working on the after set, you know.  So we had a lot of different operations going on, some of them like simultaneously.  I knew that if I got bogged down in one, something was gonna slip down.  So I tried to not be a member of a committee but try to oversee each committee.  And I was able, able to do that very successfully too.  We had some kind of problem on the door, and I got hung up on the door because, you know, that's where the money was flowing through and then something else fell apart because of that.  But essentially it was all very successful, we negotiated with the mayor, we got all this hotel rooms and whatever, and we were able to clear ten thousand, over ten thousand dollars profit back in--
Speaker 2: Profit?
Speaker 1: --like 1968 or '69 [1969], you know.
Speaker 2: Now that's something.
Speaker 1: And that was after paying off all our debts, all our bills, and everything, you know.  So that really was a tremendous, tremendous experience, you know.
Story_ID: 611763
Speaker 1: Now what did you major in, in [at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois]--?
Speaker 2: I started off majoring in physical education because after I realized I wasn't gonna be a professional baseball player since my baseball career had got cut short from having to run track, then the next thing I wanted to do, do was I wanted to be a coach.  So I wanted to coach either track or baseball or basketball or something.  You know, I had got into basketball.  But I basically wanted to be a college coach, either college, college coach was my first aspiration and if not a college coach then, you know, being a high school coach.  That went along so I majored in phys ed until, again about '68 [1968] or '69 [1969] when we got a black studies program.  Once we got a--and I worked with the Black Student Union.  In fact, that's when a riff came between me and the fraternity [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity].  I got involved with the Black Student Union and stopped working with the fraternity and started working with the Black Student Union.  And I started reading more about black history, working with the Black Student Union and then I ended up changing my major from physical education to African American studies.

Speaker 1: Can you remember what you were doing in 1968 when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed?
Speaker 2: Interestingly, I don't.  A lot of my fraternity brothers were talking about, they was fearful we were gonna stop Kappa Karnival, you know, because, you know, King had got assassinated and they were saying no we can't stop the carnival and this and that and the other.
Speaker 1: So the carnival was that same weekend of April 4th?
Speaker 2: I think it was, I think it was.  He got killed in April?
Speaker 1: April the 4th--
Speaker 2: April the 4th.
Speaker 1: --nineteen sixty-eight [1968].
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, so I'm pretty much sure that our carnival was that same--I think it was that same week, that same week.  And if I had a been in Chicago [Illinois], I think it would have made more of a impact, but by me being in Carbon- like we didn't have any riots in Carbondale [Illinois] for, for King being assassinated.  And I was heavily involved with the fraternity [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity].  So we knew about King being assassinated and other than not canceling, you know, the, you know, the carnival, those are about all my recollections of it, you know.
Speaker 1: And so there was no crisis on campus [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] and no--
Speaker 2: Not that I recall.
Speaker 1: --no tension on the campus or anything?
Speaker 2: Not that I recall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'd have to, you know, talk to some, some other people.  But to be perfectly honest, part of the reason is, it was around the time that I started to become politicized, you know.  Because see when I went to school I was not political, I was like very middle class.  You know, I didn't know anything about black history, I wasn't involved in politics.  But starting around '68 [1968] is when I started to become involved in politics and civil rights and stuff like that.  So if my politicization would have started say a year earlier, then I probably would have had more vivid memories and would have been involved in it, you know, a lot more, you know.  But I think that's probably one of, one of the reasons, you know.  And also if I would have lived in Chicago because it was so traumatic in Chicago and because of the demonstrations and the riots and stuff, I would have known exactly, you know, like what was going down, you know.
Story_ID: 611765
Speaker 1: So who were some of your instructors [at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois]?  You must have had some magnetic instructors in African American studies for you to change your major and to get involved with--but who were some of the people?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well what happened was, reflecting back on it earlier, there were some things that happened in my life that I thought were just incidents but little did I know they were kind of like stepping stones and building blocks.  One was my mother's [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs] involvement from that sit-in.  I thought it was just an event, you know, but I learned a little bit about the Civil Rights Movement at that time.  I learned a little bit about the fact of, of, of--about racism and the fact that black folks could do something about racism.  That if they wanna change their environment, change their circumstance, it is incumbent upon them to do something about it.  Like I'm sure as you well know about Frederick Douglass' famous speech about how people will only accept those, those conditions that are reaped upon them but if you don't want the, the plowing of the fields you can't reap the harvest, and if you don't want the thunder, you can't en- en- enjoy the rain, you know.  So it's incumbent upon people that if you wanna get out of your condition, it's based upon what you do to get out of your condition.  So I kind of learned that very subtly from my mom being one of the organizers of the sit-in.  In addition to that when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came to Chicago [Illinois], my mom took me down to see Martin Luther King.  He spoke at a place called Cole Park [Nat King Cole Park] which is on 84th [sic.] and, and, and King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive].  And I never will forget going down there and so many people went down there, a lot of people were double parked.  After Dr. King finished speaking, everybody got a ticket.  But SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] or whatever organization was that that brought him down, they picked up everybody's ticket and paid everybody's ticket.  And I thought that was very, very, very profound.  So, you know, I went to see King live, I was there.  I, I did the thing, you know, with, with, with the sit-in.  And then in '68 [1968], I was working a summer job, I worked every summer, I was working at Johnson Products [Johnson Products Company] where they made Ultra Sheen and Afro Sheen and whatever.  And that was the summer where they had the Democratic Convention in Chicago [1968 Democratic National Convention, Chicago, Illinois].  And when they had the convention, one of the guys, I was a shipping clerk where we would get orders, Johnson Products would sell all these hair care products to beauty supply houses.  So the beauty supply house would send in an order, we would get the order, we would look through the order and we would go throughout the plant and fill the order and we, if they want two cases of this or six cases of that or whatever, and then we would put it on the skid and then load it on to a truck and then it would go out, you know, somewhere around the country.  One of the guys that worked with us, he was very politicized and every day he would go down to Grant Park [Chicago, Illinois] as part of the Democratic National Convention when they were demonstrating out in the park.  So he would come to Johnson Products and he would tell us everything that was going on every day that wasn't on the nightly news 'cause, you know, there was a news blackout, you know, and they weren't talking about people demonstrating in the streets.

Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Today we're continuing an interview we started about a month ago.  And could, sir, could you please state your name for us?
Speaker 2: Tony Burroughs [HistoryMaker Anthony "Tony" Preston Burroughs].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  And where--and today's date is?
Speaker 2: Today is August 11th, I believe, right, 2005.
Speaker 1: All right.  And where are we today?
Speaker 2: We're at The HistoryMakers' studios at 1900 South Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois, in the USA.
Speaker 1: You're very generous, sir.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 611767
Speaker 1: We were, when we left off we were discussing the aftermath of the death of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and you were in college [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] and you were talking about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: --an incident, while you, when, that occurred when you worked for Johnson Products [Johnson Products Company] I think.
Speaker 2: Right, right, exactly.  And the reason I was explaining this was the fact of, I think you asked me about my reaction at Martin Luther King dying, and I was trying to explain when I became politicized and the events that politicized me.  And I had mentioned about the, the sit-in that I was involved in with, with my mom [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs] at the school in 1962.  And talking about going to see Martin Luther King when he came to Chicago [Illinois].  And then I was talking about the Democratic National Convention was in Chicago in 1968, (clears throats) excuse me, and the fact that I worked with Johnson Products as a, as a shipping clerk, and one of the employees that also worked in shipping would go downtown to the Democratic National Convention and hang out in the park [Grant Park, Chicago, Illinois] where all the demonstrations and all the hot spots was going on.  It wasn't on television because there was a, there was a blackout of what was going on outside and Mayor Daley [Richard J. Daley] only wanted the convention to be covered.  So every day when I would come to work at, at Johnson Products that summer, the guy that had gone down there would come back and tell us what was going on down in the streets, you know.  So it was very eye opening, especially, you know, when you go back home you see none of that on, on television.  So that was another event that kind of politicized me, that let me know what was going on in politics, how politics and, and the press were kind of like in collusion with each other and just kind of caused you to really think about what the world was really about and what was really going on.  And a couple of other events, I think that happened that same summer also helped to, to politicize me.
Story_ID: 611768
Speaker 1: There was a, a place, I believe it was on 75th [Street], 75th must have been around St. Lawrence [Avenue] or something called the topographical center [Black Peoples Topographical Research Center, Chicago, Illinois] you probably (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Topographical research center.
Speaker 1: Topographical research center--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know you remem- (laughter).  And I, one of the brothers I remember that used to be in there, I see him around, well I used to see him around, I haven't seen him in years, there were several guys that worked there.
Speaker 2: Was it Olafemy [ph.]?  Olaminji [ph.]?
Speaker 1: See you have a much better memory--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: --than I do.
Speaker 2: No, I just know--I knew 'em, you know, I mean, I didn't know him at the time--
Speaker 1: Oh, you knew one of the guys personally?
Speaker 2: I visited--yeah, I know two of 'em personally that used to be in there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --maybe, I could even know more I'm just trying to think there are some--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --there's quite a few of 'em.  But I was there in 1970.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And had the tour when I didn't live in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: It was like a--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So I didn't remember who--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know.  It wasn't until seven years later I met people that used to be in it.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Found out, you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --more about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But it's an interesting place.  Do you have any--I think you're the first person that mentioned it on--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --in an interview.  Can you maybe kind of describe what it was?
Speaker 1: From what I remember, it was kind of like a thing that was passed by word of mouth 'cause someone had told me about it, they said, "You need to go down there and check this out," and I can't remember who had told me.  And I went down there and I think the first time I went down there, I didn't have enough time to complete the whole tour and I went down there again.  But I remember--it was like a storefront and I remember, you know, brothers would greet you when you came in.  And the one thing that, that sticks out in my mind was that they had a map of the U.S. and it had the Interstate Highway System [National System of Interstate and Defense Highways].  And they were saying that the Interstate Highway System was a [U.S.] military road.  And they had proved that because somehow I think it was on the map or they had some explanations or something that did say it was a military highway which really freaked us out, you know, 'cause we, we thought just a, you know, it was just a highway, you know.  But there are some provisions that in, I guess, times of national emergency or whatever, that the interstate system is restricted to military.  And just recently, just this year, I know there were some plans in relationship to the Homeland Security [U.S. Department of Homeland Security] and terrorism, whatever, where they talked about, I think, setting up some barriers to prevent civilians from getting on the interstate.  I don't know if you, if you saw that or read about that, but it's been kind of controversial, it just came up, you know, just within the last few months.  And that goes back to the fact that that is essentially a military highway, although, we know that the primary usage now is for transportation and, and transporting goods and--goods, you know, from one part of the country to another efficiently, you know.  But they did have that there and that was something that nobody knew about so that caused you to open your mind, try to figure out what was going on.  Then another map they had was from, I believe, the 1960 census.  And in the 1960 census, someone did a map where they outlined each county within the United States and it was color coded according to, to racial population.  So a, a county that had a very high percentage of African Americans would be like black, and then as the percentage went down, it gradually went to white, so if you had a county that was a hundred percent white, that county would be color coded all white.  And so then you had all these gradations, you know, like in between that.  So you could vividly see, that in the South there was a extremely high concentration of blacks.  And then you saw in the major population centers, like Chicago, and New York [New York], L.A [Los Angeles, California], or whatever, there was high percentages.  And then out west, you know, there was very, very small percentages.  Now I don't know if they equated--oh, one of the reasons for doing that if I remember correctly, I think they were advocating a black nation in the South where all, where, where it was a high concentration of black people which essentially was what the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] were talking about, what the Nation of Islam was talking about, and I know what this other organization, what--
Speaker 2: Republic of New Africa.
Speaker 1: Republic of New Africa, boy, you're sharp, you're really sharp.  Right, Republic of New Africa.  And the Republic of New Africa I think was really in the forefront of trying to make that a reality.
Story_ID: 611769
Speaker 1: Now I don't know if the Republic of New Africa had anything to, did they have anything to do with the topographical center [Black Peoples Topographical Research Center, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Some of the, the members knew each other (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now the topographical research--just for the sake of anybody watching this--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, it's my belief that it was started by a Vietnam vet [veteran], so, I'm sure it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Vietnam vets who were--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --exposed to a lot of military strategy in--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They wanted to share the knowledge, some of them actually worked in the, in the field of the topographical maps and--
Speaker 1: Oh, interesting, okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, population and, and, and strategy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so there, there were several of them around the country.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And the vets here in Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Topographical research centers?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And the--
Speaker 1: Okay.  I didn't know that.  I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: --the vets here in Chicago they were very, I guess, they were very--they wanted to warn the black community of the possible military uses of, of the Interstate Highway System [National System of Interstate and Defense Highways] and other public access things that--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in places we did not associate with--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --we didn't associate 'em with the containment of the black population--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --especially after the riots and so on.  But, but they were just telling people say, hey, look, they're ready.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know, the U.S. military is ready for you.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: White America is ready for you.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: If you mess up, you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --I mean they--I mean, and even if you don't mess up, you may have messed up enough already--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --to have, where you're--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --unpopular enough as a people right now in white America where they, they could move on you without any public outcry.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, sure.  Sure.
Speaker 2: And they'll put you in concentration camps as--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --part of the McCarran Internal Security Act [Internal Security Act of 1950], you know--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --of, which was fictionalized as the King Alfred Plan in--
Speaker 1: Oh, right.
Speaker 2: --what's his name's book.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I guess.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Can't recall his name, what's his name?  But I can't think what his name was (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  No, I remember that.  I remember that.  Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  'The Man Who Cried I Am'--
Speaker 1: Right.  John Williams [John A. Williams] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) John, John Williams.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Exactly (unclear).
Speaker 2: So that was the main--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That was their--
Speaker 1: Right.  'Cause see I don't know if I, I don't recall if I completed the whole tour 'cause I remember it was pretty long, a couple of hours or something, you know.  So was the main objective just to educate people?
Speaker 2: The main objective as stated at the end of the tour I had in 1970 was to get you to join into a, at some point, you know, think about, you know, revolution.
Speaker 1: Mm, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Which didn't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --seem like a good solution to--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --after they described the power of the U.S. military.
Speaker 1: Right (laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, so I, I mean it's a good education in terms of--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --what they gave you but--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --the solution--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --the conclusion--
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: --didn't seem to match up with the--
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: Right, right, exactly, yeah, yeah.  See I, and, and that's what I recall that I never finished the whole tour because it was so long, you know.  So I, it opened my mind to a lot of things I had never thought about but I didn't know what their final objective was, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, these were good guys but they--their solution didn't seem to be--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the match (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it didn't, it wasn't really realistic.
Speaker 2: --content.  Yeah.  Right.
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly, yeah.  But that's fascinating that you went there too and you knew about that, you know, yeah.  'Cause I think a lot of people probably forgotten about that place, you know.  But it was a, a significant place.  And, I mean, again, I went there as I recall in '68 [1968], you went there in '70 [1970] so it was open at least for two years and I think it might even have been open longer than that 'cause I know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it had been open sometime before I had got there but I can't remember if it was the year before or what.
Speaker 2: I think its demise was in the early '70s [1970s], it kind of faded well, it kind of fade out you know, as the members got married, and had to get jobs and do other things, you know.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: After they came back from the war [Vietnam War], they, you know, eventually--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --they just couldn't, they couldn't sustain it and--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because I think they were just really operating from like donations or something, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were all--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --basically their own donations.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And the people would co- I think a tour--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --would cost you maybe a couple dollars or something.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yeah.  'Cause I don't recall any significant financial support that they had, you know.
Speaker 2: No, they didn't--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --independent--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --organization.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: A lot of 'em now are doing good things for, for kids and doing--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you know, now they're really--
Speaker 1: Oh, that's good, that's good, yeah.  Something needs to be written up about that.  That was a very interesting place, you know.  Again, it really contributed, you know, to my politicization, you know, and, and understanding, oh, I guess, thinking out of the box, you know, and not eating up all the propaganda, you know, that was coming through the press (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now had you ever thought before about where black people come from in the South, you know, like the ones that are in Chicago?  I, I think that was part of their discussion, if I remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, the, you're talking about the migration--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to Chicago?
Speaker 2: You know, how many people from Mississippi are in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: They used to talk about that--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and then other, you know.
Speaker 1: That would, that would make sense, you know, that that would be a part of it, that would make sense, yeah.  I've, I've thought about it subsequently after that.  In fact, I actually went and got a copy of that map, the one that had the, the color coded, you know, 'cause I, I can't remember if the, it was either the bureau of the census [U.S. Census Bureau] or the U.S. Geological Survey, you know, had published that map, and I, I still have that map, you know, and I've told people about it, you know.  It's just, it's very huge, you know.  So but again it was, it was very, very fascinating.
Story_ID: 611770
Speaker 1: I guess, the, the other thing that happened was that summer for some reason, I bought a pair of blue jeans for the first time.  (Laughter) And it was truly amazing.  When I put on those blue jeans, for some reason, I just started thinking very differently, you know.  And at the time I didn't know why, but looking back on it historically after, you know, like thinking about my life and analyzing some other things, I've been able to figure out what it meant.  It was like when I came up I was in the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America], I was in the Cub Scouts, and one of the things in the Cub Scouts and the Boy Scouts is they teach you not only the skills of like camping and reading and arts and crafts and mechanics and stuff like that, but they played very heavily on protocol, on ceremony, and on dress.  And at every meeting you have a, an inspection where they check your shoe to see if your shoes are shined, they check your pants to see if they're creased, they check your shirt, you know.  And, and you had like a little neckerchief and everything and they gave a prize to the best dressed scout at every meeting.  So I was a part of that and I remember that I, I always wanted to win that contest, you know.  And I could never win 'cause this one guy would win every time, you know.  This was when I was in, in the Cub Scouts.  And for a while, my dad [Elmer Burroughs] was the scoutmaster.  And I used to watch this guy, you know, that win every time and I said well I need to do what he's doing, you know.  So I, I realized that what we would do is we would dress up, shine our shoes and everything, and then in the wintertime we'd put our coats on and the coat would wrinkle our neckerchief.  This guy, he would iron his neckerchief, and he would roll it up in newspaper and he would carry it so when he got to the meeting he would take his coat off and he'd unfurl this necker- he'd put it on and I mean it would be no wrinkles, no creases, no-- and he would win each and every time.  So I saw that he was doing that so then I did that one time.  So I got up there and so I just knew I was gonna win that day.  And whoever--they picked one of the parents and the parents would go down and do the inspection and would look and look and look.  And he was having a hard time that day figuring out, you know, who was best.  So I looked down I saw this one guy's sh- (laughter), I saw this one guy's shoes weren't shined, so I, I looked, I said, "Look his shoes ain't shined!"  (Laughter) And my dad said, "All right, you're out of the lineup, you weren't supposed to say that."  (Laughter) Put me--I felt so bad.  My dad told me that, he said, "You were the best dressed, but you should have kept your darn mouth shut," you know (laughter), "'cause you were not the judge," you know.  And I felt so bad.
Story_ID: 611771
Speaker 1: But anyway, so I grew up learning how to be neat and clean, shine your shoes, and whatever.  And, and, and the other thing was that my, my dad [Elmer Burroughs] would always have his shoes shined.  My grandfather [Asa Morris Burroughs] who was a very prominent attorney, I mean, he had his, some of the best suits you'd ever seen, and his shoes would always be shined.  So it was like, kind of like, in my culture, you know, to always go out neat, clean, shined shoes, you know, ironed shirt, et cetera, et cetera.  And in thinking back on that, I think it went all the way back to my great-grandfather [Morris Burroughs] being a Pullman porter.  And, and he had to do this, he had to not only be very sharp for his job, but he had to shine the shoes for the passengers, you know, and brush off their clothes and keep them all neat and clean.  And I think that actually passed down, you know, through several generations.  But the other thing that happened was when I was in school, in high school [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], and I was working part time, I would have this extra money and I, we would go down to Brooks Brothers and buy all these Brooks Brothers shirts which were the most expensive shirts, you know, that you could ever buy.  So all throughout high school, I mean, you know, we were always neat, clean, wore all these expensive clothes that, you know, our parents could not afford for us but since we were working and we just spent all our money on clothes, you know.  So I went to college [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois], that kind of like carried over, you know.  So this one time I wore these blue jeans it was like, (makes sound), it was like this big transformation came over, 'cause I would never wear blue jeans in high school.  I never wore blue jeans in college, you know, until this one time, for some reason I put on these blue jeans, and I guess what it did was psychologically or philosophically or whatever, it caused me to identify with poor, struggling people versus the upper class people that were always dressed and always wore the finest clothes and this and that and the other.  So it, it caused me to start thinking a little differently.  And, and who are the oppressors and what are they doing, and who are the oppressed, you know, and what are they doing.
Speaker 2: And this kind of coincides with the Poor People's Campaign.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: And the--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --where you saw like Reverend Abernathy [Ralph Abernathy]--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson], everybody else in blue jeans.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Story_ID: 611772
Speaker 1: And, in fact, we went to the Poor People's Campaign.  I pledged Kappa Alpha Psi [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] in the, at college at SIU, Southern Illinois University [Carbondale, Illinois], and our line, the head of our line, he wasn't the head of our line, but one of the guys on line, Jimmy Pillars [ph.], he had a car.  And we drove down to D.C. one year, in fact, that was the year that, that was '68 [1968] also, when King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had gotten killed and they had the Poor People's Campaign in Washington [D.C.].  So we drove down there and we were actually going to visit Washington, and we were going to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], see some of our fraternity brothers, see what's going on there, some of us knew some folks that went to Howard, but the Poor People's Campaign was going on and it was on the Mall [National Mall, Washington, D.C.].  So we went to the campaign and they had all these tents set up and all these poor people had come from the South, they were living in these tents, and we were, you know, met a lot of people.  In fact, one of my fraternity brothers just gave me some pictures that she, this year that I didn't realize he had of us in D.C. at the Poor People's Campaign.  We're with Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] and, and Hosea Williams and, and, and Ralph Abernathy and whatever, we have some photographs with them.  And the one thing I remember was it rained, and when it rained, this was like mud city and people were still living in these tents and it was mud all around them, and a lot of people were saying this was better conditions than they were living in, in the South, you know.  And it was just really, really mind boggling, you know, especially to talk to some of the people and some of the conditions that they were in.  And this was, this had to have been right after King had, had died because I remember King was assassinated in Memphis [Tennessee], the Poor People's Campaign was going on in D.C., and he left there to go to Memphis, and then after he was assassinated, then Abernathy and them tried to keep that thing going, but they lost out on that and that was like folded up, you know.  And I forget what they were protesting but they were protesting to the government to try to get something but I can't remember what the issues were and I need to go back and, and revisit that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it was poverty that--
Speaker 1: Poverty.
Speaker 2: --you know a lot of people are--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, need government assistance would need--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --needed jobs and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know for people and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so many people, and they, you know, it was black and white, you know--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --are without--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --any kind of, any employment.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.  Well did, do you know if they were trying to get some kind of a, a bill passed through [U.S.] Congress or just protesting, you know, poverty and jobs?
Speaker 2: Well they were trying to get whatever they could get.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I don't think they, I don't think much came out of it.  You know, Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] had--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --his War on Poverty.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He declared war on poverty, but it was--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --didn't seem like it was, it was enough, you know, to--
Speaker 1: Right, right, exactly.  You don't recall when that that tent city closed down do you?
Speaker 2: No, I think it was closed before the end of '69 [1969], I believe.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, exactly.
Speaker 2: 'Cause it rained, as you said, it rained the whole time and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --for some reason it rained more that spring than it ever had in D.C. it just--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --it literally washed it away, I mean.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, it was--ooh.  Man, that was, that was a heck of a feeling.
Story_ID: 611773
Speaker 1: So all those things helped to contribute really kind of like a transformation for me philosophically, so I started to think more about the condition of black people and, and, and why we were in our condition.  And, and then I started to, to, to read a lot more because I started getting more interested so I started reading 'Before the Mayflower' ['Before the Mayflower: A History of Black America'] by [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett; and 'From Slavery to, to Freedom' ['From Slavery to Freedom: A History of African Americans'] by [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin; 'Soul On Ice,' you know, Eldridge Cleaver; and a lot of other--'Autobiography of Malcolm X' ['The Autobiography of Malcolm X,' Malcolm X and Alex Haley]; and a lot of the other books that were very popular during that time.  So this also added, you know, to my knowledge, and, and my understanding and politicization and all that.  And I think that's probably around the time when I changed my major from, from African American studi- I mean, from, from physical education into African American studies.  So this is a long way to explain why when King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] got killed, why I don't remember exactly what happened, you know, when I was in school [at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois], but all of these things had gradually started happening and coming to focus around that time.  But they came into focus actually after he got assassinated instead of actually before he got assassinated.
Speaker 2: So just, just a change in your political outlook and, and, and a lot of people's, I guess (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, yeah, no doubt about it.  And, and the thing I think that was fortunate for me and other people that came around in the '60s [1960s], was that the '60s [1960s] was a period of act- of activism where people actually did stuff, I mean, there wasn't a lot of apathy, you know.  So people marched, they demonstrated, they wrote, they lectured, they picketed, they boycotted, you know.  They realized again back from, from, Frederick Douglass, is that the oppressed, once they stop accepting what's happening to the oppressor, they take control over their situation and they do something about it.  So apathy stops and, and activism takes over.  And I think that if, if you reflect back, what forty years, you know, or so since the '60s [1960s], you see a lot of people that grew up during that period are probably still very active today doing a lot of things because, you know, it was like we were, we kind of learned firsthand that we should do something and we can do something about our condition, you know.  You don't have to look down and say, oh, wow we can't do anything about that, or, wow, you know, and all that's been happening, you know, all the time.  It's that we feel that we can do something about it and then we try to analyze the situation and, and mobilize people and organize people and do something to improve our condition.
Story_ID: 611774
Speaker 1: Do you remember or was there anybody, I think I asked you this before, but I can't--I think we got sidelined and we never got to--to the answer to this but, but who was in the black studies department at SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] and, and, you know, why was it that attractive to you, you know, I mean, I mean, well, you've, I gue- I guess you'd explained why, but there, there has to be, I would think some people there that really were doing something.
Speaker 2: Right.  After that summer of '68 [1968], I joined the, the Black Student Union in Carbondale [Illinois] at SIU.  And I had known a couple of people that were in the Black Student Union, but by joining, I, I met all these other people.  A lot of folks from New York [New York], Frank Spradley, Sinclair Brown, Eric Frazier, some other folks from New York.  A guy from North Carolina, George Lowery [ph.].  Hank Wilson who was from New York.  So a lot of these folks were very active in the, in the Black Student Union.  A couple of them I had met previously, many of them I didn't, but I got to know them a lot better.  And what happened was we did not have a black studies program at SIU.  So the Black Student Union was petitioning the university to start a Black Student Union--I mean, to start a African American studies program.  So we had some petitions, some demonstrations and, and all of this to try to force the university or pressure the university to start a program and we were actually successful in doing that.  James Rosser [James M. Rosser] was the first head of the African American studies program who went out to, after he left SIU, he went out to, I think, it was Cal State, L.A. [California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], or Cal State, Fullerton, one of the schools out in Southern California.  And I think he, I'm pretty much sure he heads up that program out there now.
Speaker 1: James Rosser?
Speaker 2: James Rosser.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  R-O-S-S-E-R?
Speaker 2: R-O-S-S-E-R, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, exactly.  So I remember the building that we had was a former Baptist center or something so it was a huge building.  So in addition to getting the African American studies program, again with the, with the Black Student Union, we did a lot of other things also.  Eventually, I became a, a teaching assistant in the Black American Studies Program where we had a, a class where we would have a lecturer give a talk on something and then we would have a discussion group where we would discuss, you know, what happened with that particular lecture.  Well I was one of the discussion leaders and there must have been, hm, a dozen or two of us that were all discussion leaders that were like upperclassmen.  And we had a retreat where we learned how to deal with discussion groups.  We learned about how to deal with people's emotions.  We, we learned about how to deal with interracial relationships because, you know, there were blacks and whites that were like taking these courses, and people were coming from different backgrounds, different experiences, and a lot of these issues were very emotional.
Story_ID: 611775
Speaker 1: You were discussing a black studies--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --program [Black American Studies Program].  You all call it the African American studies department?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was the, let me see, yeah, I think it was, I think it was African American studies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I could--don't, don't quote me on that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause it might have been slightly different.
Speaker 1: So who did you bring to campus [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] in, during those days?
Speaker 2: Well we brought in quite a few folk.  There was one guy who was up in Milwaukee [Wisconsin], Howard Fuller.  And Howard Fuller, Howard had changed his name, what was his name?
Speaker 1: Owusu Sadauki.
Speaker 2: Right, Owusu Sadauki, yeah, yeah.  (Laughter) Boy you get everything I--(laughter).  And at the time, he was in Durham, North Carolina, and he had started what you call Malcolm X Liberation University.  So he was talking about that black folks should do a lot of studying, a lot of reading, but we should be instrumental in helping to liberate Africa.  And so him setting up this Malcolm X Liberation University was to educate black folks, you know, do a lot of reading, understand what was going on not only in America, in black America, but what was going on in Africa.  And he was also talking about that black folks need to develop skills, skills in terms of electricians, in terms of mechanics, in terms of scientists, agronomists, and all these other things, and use our skills in Africa to help liberate Africa.  And he was very adamant about that.  He was a very, very eloquent speaker.  And he had a lot of sayings.  He was the first one that I, I heard that quote from, from Frederick Douglass, you know, about those who want the rain but not the thunder and the lightning and want the crops without the plowing of the fields and all that, which he always used at the end of, of, of his talk.  So I remember we, we brought him to campus.  We brought Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] in, who, Stokely naturally was the head of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] at one time and had coined the phrase black power and done a lot of, of work in, in the South organizing folks.  So I remember we brought Stokely to campus and I remember seeing him.  We brought LeRoi Jones/Amiri Baraka, in who helped start, you know, the black culture movement in, in, in Jersey [New Jersey], and also was, was in New York [New York] and whatever.  We brought a lot of other folks in, which again, every time we, we brought some of these, these leaders in, in, in the black activist movement, I would always learn something and we would also have discussions afterward, you know, well, remember what he said about this and like what about that, you know.  So a lot of the after discussion was just as important as, as hearing, you know, what the speakers had to say.
Story_ID: 611776
Speaker 1: But the one that probably had the most influence, I didn't realize at the time, was we brought Alex Haley in.  And this was in February of '69 [1969].  At that time--we would bring in, as part of the Black Student Union [at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois], we would bring in speakers all throughout the year but February was probably the most important because contrary to, to now we didn't have Black History Month, we only had that Negro History Week, so it was only those five days.  And so we had a important keynote speaker each and every day but at the end of the week, we had Alex Haley come down.  Now I've mentioned to a lot of people that I first heard Alex Haley in '69 [1969] and they think that it had to do with 'Roots,' but it had nothing to do with, with 'Roots.'  Alex Haley was a bestselling author of 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' [Malcolm X and Alex Haley].  We had all read 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X.'  We were like quoting chapter and chapter and verse, verse and everything that Malcolm did in the different phases of his life, you know.  So we wanted to bring Alex down because we couldn't bring Malcolm down because Malcolm was assassinated, so we figured that bringing Alex down would be the next best thing.  So Alex could talk to us about what was left out of the book, you know, on the editing floor all the time and, you know, how it would be to, to work with Malcolm, to travel with Malcolm, and all the personal insights, you know.  As well as questioning him about different things in the book, which, you know, we were, almost experts on.  So Alex Haley came down that day and spoke for, I don't know, hour, an hour and a half or something.  (Laughter) Didn't mention Malcolm X's name one time.  And like, we were like really ticked off, you know, and what's this guy talking about.  And he's talking about Kunta Kinte and Chicken George and Kizzy and all these folks.  And see in '69 [1969], we had never heard about genealogy.  We never heard the word genealogy.  We never knew that genealogy was even possible because we knew that we didn't have our African names, we didn't know what tribe we were from, we didn't know where our ancestors were from in Africa.  We thought all that stuff was, was almost lost, you know.  We had no concept of someone going from them self and knowing who their great-great-grandparents were and their great-great-great-grandparents and going, you know, generation by generation backward.  It was a totally foreign concept not only to blacks but it was a foreign concept to whites.  I've done some research on that subsequently and back in the '60s [1960s]--again 'Roots' ['Roots: The Saga of An American Family,' Alex Haley] was published in 1976, the miniseries ['Roots'] didn't come out until 1977.  In the 1960s, common people were not doing genealogy, black or white.  The only people that were doing genealogy were wealthy people that were trying to tie in to royalty, you know, in England, people that, that heard through their family history they were descended from the Mayflower.  A, again, very highbrow, you know, well to do established people, and people that were trying to get in the DAR, the Daughters of the American Revolution.  But the common people were not doing genealogy.
Story_ID: 611777
Speaker 1: I think the, the common screenplay for situation comedies and there would be one of these shows in every situation comedy that--Lucy or, or, or Donald Duck or somebody would get a letter saying that he inherited a castle--
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) from somebody, you know, and, you know--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: --what I'm talking about.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: You know, somebody died or something like that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and they'd go to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Scotland or some place and--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, yeah, yeah, yeah.  'Cause there, there was a lot of scam artists, you know, that, that would create these phony family crests, you know, and tell pe- you know, and take their name out of the telephone directory, you know, and say, you know--
Speaker 1: My mother--
Speaker 2: --hey you're related to this person.
Speaker 1: My mother sent away.
Speaker 2: She bought under that?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: In 1960, she sent away for--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --a crest for a Crowe, C-R-O-W-E.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Well she didn't think about, now this is important for this interview I think--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --to mention--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --just because it's--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --it just kind of shows you where things were.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: My, our family name is C-R-O-W-E.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: My grandfather added the E, but she didn't know that.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: So she's already in the--
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Speaker 1: As my father had said she had the wrong misunderstanding already.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, right.
Speaker 1: And so when Crowe comes back, you know, and it says this is from the name Mackincrowe [ph.] which is--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Scotch Irish and--but anyway--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --we have a crest with a guy with a visor in her--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And we knew, we looked around and said now we're Negroes and--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --and they--and I raised it in the family, and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but my mother said, "Well," she said, "well isn't this something?  It means that we come from--."  I said, I said, "I don't think so."
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Speaker 1: But it was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it was an interesting discussion--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --'cause we had never really--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --this was the first time--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --we really thought about where did we come from?
Speaker 2: Oh, (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Where did we--
Speaker 2: Right, sure, sure, sure, sure, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, what's our family, or who are we (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And even, even today, and I'm glad you brought that up, even today black people think about their name as if there's some significance in their name and--which, which goes back to England in most cases and what English, you know, people were doing then which in 99 percent of the case has nothing to do with African Americans, absolutely nothing, you know.  And it's just almost a coincidence the European names that we have today, but it has very little to do, you know, with our history, and who we really are.  And I think it's magnified by those kind of people that scam people and, and give you the history of the origin of your name, or this crest that has nothing to do with your family, or with your ancestors, you know.  And by you, or by people not understanding what genealogy is about, and not understanding what heraldry is about, then they fall prey to some of these things because with a ounce of, of information, it kind of sounds interesting, you know.  So you kind of get attached to it not understanding how to analyze that properly, you know.  And unfortunately a lot of people, you know, fall prey to those things, you know.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about this before and then we can get back to the story but--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --have you ever seen J.A. Rogers' book, 'Nature Knows No Color Line' ['Nature Knows No Color Line: Research into the Negro Ancestry in the White Race,' Joel Augustus Rogers]?
Speaker 2: No, I haven't seen that one.
Speaker 1: Well there's a, there are all these family crests, drawings of these family crests--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --with derivatives of the name Moor and they are all from--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --some heraldry--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --center in England or something.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: But they have like a, if your name was Moore, Mooreland [ph.]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Blackmore--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Swarthmore [ph.] I mean, all the, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, sure, sure.
Speaker 1: And there's a little black head on the crest.
Speaker 2: Oh, interesting.
Speaker 1: And he, you know, he maintains that every, the Moor, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It indicates--
Speaker 2: Oh, for the Morrison, yeah.
Speaker 1: --some kind of black ancestry through the Moors.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, interesting.
Speaker 1: That was the term in Latin for somebody who was black: a moor.
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.  Sure, absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Morris, Maurice--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know all of this, these kind of names.  There's a whole bunch of 'em there and I was wondering if you ever--
Speaker 2: No, I never ran across that but I'm glad you mentioned it.  I'm, I'll check that out.  That's very interesting, very interesting.
Speaker 1: Mooreland, all this and all these names.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 611778
Speaker 1: Alex Haley talked about this and, and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So that had big, a big impact on you, huh?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's like, again it was a foreign concept.  It was a very fascinating talk.  Alex Haley was a very folksy kind of person.  He was born in Ithaca, New York, but he grew up in, in Henning, Tennessee.  And even though he was educated, he just had this very, very calm, very easy, folksy way of talking.  And, and I find out later that he only gave one talk, and it was the same every time.  Like when I go out and speak I've got about seventy different talks that I've given, you know, you gotta know the details on each and every one of them, but him, he had run this story so many times, which I didn't realize 'cause I hadn't seen him speak before, that he like had it down pat, he had memorized the whole story and it very easily flowed from, from one to the other.  So you sat there listening and, and you just immediately became captivated in the story.  So it was his presentation, it was his style, plus the content of the information, and then just the mind boggling thing that someone could actually trace their bloodline, you know, back several hundred years to someone in Africa and know who that person was.  So we were like completely blown away.  I kind of remember after that talk I said, wow that's very fascinating, I'd like to do that one day before I die.  I knew I wasn't gonna go out and do it the next day or the next week or the next month 'cause I'm in college [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois], you know, I know I gotta pass some finals, you know, take some classes and whatever.  But it just really played on my mind that it was like really very, very, very interesting, you know.  Little did I know that years later will it consume my life, you know.  But it just really stuck out on me and he made, you know, like a great impression on me then.  So that was kind of like the most important speaker, although many of 'em all played a role and contributed a lot to my--I guess to like who I am and, and how I develop, you know, my philosophies and stuff, you know.
Story_ID: 611779
Speaker 1: So your major was changed to African American studies--
Speaker 2: Right, changed to African American studies (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) from phys ed?
Speaker 2: Right, from physical education, right.
Speaker 1: And then did you--now what did you do after school, I mean what did you pursue?
Speaker 2: Well, well what happened was--
Speaker 1: 'Cause, you know, what one of the major criticisms was of anybody who majored in African American studies--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --they'd say, well what kind of job are you going to get?
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, right, right.
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: --I know somebody said, "Well, what kind of job are you gonna get with that kind of degree?"
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Well the interesting thing, Larry [Larry Crowe], was that when I changed my major, I don't recall I thought about what I was gonna do with that later.  I mean, many people go to college, particularly today, but many people go to college, you know, with a financial end game, that they wanna major in something where they're gone make some money or they want a certain kind of profession that they wanna develop.  I didn't have those kinds of, of goals and direction when I went to college.  You know, when I went through college I wanted to learn.  And, I guess, I, for some reason, I had a, a strong curiosity of learning new things, wanting to develop and become more intelligent, more well rounded, you know, individual but not necessarily this is the particular job that I want.  Now when I started majoring in phys ed then I thought about being a, a coach, either in college or, or in high school.  When I changed to African American studies, I don't know if I ever thought about what I was gonna do with that later.  Naturally, I could, I could teach history.  I don't know if I actually thought about that.  I remember when I changed my major what I had, I did have to do is, I know I had to do student teaching.  So somehow it must have been tied into education.  We had demonstrations in, at SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] in relationship to the Vietnam War 'cause there was a large peace movement going on also.  And, and I, not only being involved with the Black Student Union but we were also involved with the peace movement and we wanted to, to stop the war in Vietnam.  So there was a lot of demonstrations going on in relationship to Vietnam.  And as, you know, they had the students that were killed by the Guard at, at Kent State [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio].  What a lot of people forget or didn't know that there were black students that were killed at Jackson State in Mississippi [Jackson State College; Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi] that were demonstrating against the Vietnam War.  And there's a memorial to them down there and they got killed before the ones at Kent State.  And unfortunately, you never hear about those students that demonstrated at Jackson State, but you always hear about the ones that died at Kent State because those were white students and the ones at Jackson State were black students.  But both of those happened in, in 1970.  And then also there were demonstrations at, at SIU that got to be so strong the National Guard was brought out at SIU and it literally closed the school down.  Well by me changing my major, I had to take a few additional courses 'cause I didn't major in African American studies from the beginning.  I also had to do student teaching which I hadn't done.  So that meant that instead of graduating in June of '70 [1970] because I started in September of '66 [1966], it meant that I would have to, you know, continue on later.  But after they sclo- closed the school down early, I just kind of got disinterested in school.  In fact, I, I never even finished and went back and graduated from SIU.
Story_ID: 611780
Speaker 1: After they closed down, I went to, I went to Washington, D.C.  When I went to Washington, one of the guys that was very instrumental in the Black Student Union, in fact I think he might have headed up the Black Student Union, was Sinclair Brown who changed his name to Omar, Omar Malik [ph.], and he was moving to Washington, D.C.  And Howard Fuller [Owusu Sadauki] who had set up Malcolm X Liberation University in, in Durham, North Carolina, he had a sister school in Washington called the Insti- it wasn't the Institute of Positive Education [Chicago, Illinois] that was Haki's [HistoryMaker Haki Madhubuti] school, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Gosh, the center, maybe it was called the Center for Black Education.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I think it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you familiar with that?
Speaker 2: The Center for Black Education and they were associated with Queen Mother Moore on some level weren't they?  Wasn't she a part of that or?
Speaker 1: I don't--
Speaker 2: Center for Black Education in Washington, D.C. that's, that's where, that's it.  That's it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that was--.  And I'm trying to remember--
Speaker 2: Center for Black Education.
Speaker 1: --the guy who headed it up was, his name was Jimmy, real small, slight build guy named--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I know him.
Speaker 1: --Jimmy but I can't remember his last name.
Speaker 2: Jimmy Garrett [James Garrett].
Speaker 1: Was it Jimmy Garrett?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Might have been.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] before.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: He was in SNCC.
Speaker 1: That makes sense.  That makes sense.
Speaker 2: Wrote a couple of plays actually too.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Jimmy Garrett.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So they were a sister school to the one in Durham.  So I actually joined that school and I was there with, with Sinclair Brown.  And, and it was down, around the corner from 14th [Street] and U Street.  And they were saying 14th and U was the roughest street in D.C. and they were talking about all the gangbangers and the pimps and prostitutes and all that, you know.  And they were set up, I think it was one block from 14th and U, but I can't remember the street they were on.  So I actually lived with Sinclair, in fact, Sinclair was, was a vegetarian, him and his family were vegetarian.  And that was my first introduction to being a vegetarian.  I wasn't a vegetarian, but I remember that we stayed there and they didn't eat any meat which I thought was very foreign, you know (laughter).  And we thought that the school really didn't have their act together, you know.  They weren't as progressive as, as what we thought, they should be.  Because every day Sinclair and I we would sit down and we would analyze what happened during that day and how they were running the school and we were very, very disappointed.  And I think Jimmy Garrett had come to SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois], and I think he was one of the persons that that gave a speaking engagement there too and then tied that into the Malcolm X Liberation University (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know he was on tour '70 [1970], '71 [1971], he was the first speaker at Bolinga--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Black Cultural Resources Center [Bolinga Black Cultural Resources Center] in Dayton [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: When we open, when we opened our center he was the first--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --guest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Jimmy Garret.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Right.  Well then we, we definitely brought him to SIU too 'cause I know I knew him before we went down there, you know.  But every day coming back, analyze what was going on, we'd say, hey, you know, they ain't got it together, you know.  So both Sinclair and I dropped out of there.
Story_ID: 611781
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the major criticism with what they were doing [at the Center for Black Education, Washington, D.C.]?  What were they, what did you--?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't remember specifics but it was like they didn't seem to have the quality of, you know, what they were doing.  There seemed to be a lot of contradictions.  And I really need to Sin- call Sinclair [Sinclair Brown] who is still in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and see what his recollections were.  But by, by being so active at SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois], not only involved in the Black Student Union but also being heavily involved in, in a fraternity [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], but also being heavily involved in, in campus activities because I was, you know, co-chairman of homecoming one year and, you know, I was in the student sit-in, and, I mean, I was in the new student week, you know, and all those different organizations, you learn how organizations worked and you learned how to plan, you knew how to organize, you knew who was shucking and jiving and, you know, who was really sharp and was taking care of business and, and knew what was going on, you know.  So I really had a lot of experience in organizations before then.  And so when we got to D.C. they had none of that.  You know, the level of organization really was very poor.  The quality of teaching, you know, 'cause we were taking classes, the quality of teaching, you know, like was very poor.  So we weren't really impressed with anything that they were doing, you know.
Speaker 1: Now this is a group too, I think they sent quite a few people to Tanzania or at least (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.  Exactly, exactly, exactly.  'Cause, in fact, there were a couple brothers from Tanzania that went to SIU, because I got to know a couple of brothers from, from Tanzania who had worked for the government in Tanzania, who were very progressive people from Tanzania.  'Cause at one time I wanted to go to Tanzania and I think they were having a Pan-African Congress in Africa that I think might have been in Tan- it was either in Tanzania or Ghana, one of those.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was in '74 [1974] or--
Speaker 2: Seventy-four [1974], right.
Speaker 1: I think so, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, right, '74 [1974].  Now--
Speaker 1: It was the Six- the Sixth Pan-African Congress.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In Arusha [sic. Dar es Salaam, Tanzania], yeah.
Speaker 2: And was that in Tanzania?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, okay, yeah.  'Cause I was planning on going to go that, you're right.  I was saving up some money and whatever.  And, and because I had met a couple of people from Tanzania at SIU, I had that connection with them as well as, you know, the whole political thing and, and reading about Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] and, and the organiza- the, the origins of the Pan-African Congress and all that.
Speaker 1: Did you attend the Congress of Afrikan People in--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: The one in Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was in Atlanta in '70 [1970].
Speaker 2: Atlanta?  No, I didn't.
Speaker 1: Spring of '70 [1970].
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  No, I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't.  I didn't.  I knew about it but I, I didn't go.  I really wanted to.  So we decided to drop out--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of that.
Story_ID: 611782
Speaker 1: Sinclair [Sinclair Brown] said he was gonna go get a job.  And he went and got a job.  In fact, he was the, it was interesting because he had two wives, he had, was a converted Muslim.  And again that was a very foreign concept, but I mean, they got along better because I lived with all three of 'em, and they got along better than folks that I knew only had one wife (laughter) you know, which I thought was interesting.  But, I mean, you know, polygamy was popular in certain parts of Africa, you know, and so some people were like kind of into that, you know.
Speaker 2: Well one thing that concerned me about that in those days was the treatment of the women in those situations.
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 2: And the, the concept of, I think, you know, the, a lot of brothers became Muslims, some became Yorubas, and other things.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But how were the women being treated?  Are they given more respect or less respect or what, you know, were they, you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --how did--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --how did--what did it seem to you like--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --in those days?
Speaker 1: Sinclair's family was the only one I knew from a personal basis because I knew both of his wives, all three--both of his wives and him went to SIU and so I knew all three of them at SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois].  I didn't know they were all like married at SIU but I knew that they were hanging together all the time, you know.  But by living with them, then I got a chance to know them on another level, and I had the utmost respect because from all things that I saw, he respected both of them from the highest degree and seemed to treat both of them equally.  And both of them were highly intelligent, and I had a lot of respect for all three of them.  And all three of us would all get into political discussions as well as socializing this, that, and the other.  So, I mean, I was very, very impressed, you know, with, with how they worked together, interrelated together.  And I never saw one ounce of exploitation, or, or mistreatment of, of anyone in the family, you know.  So I just came away, you know, being extremely impressed and having a new appreciation for--and I don't even know if they called it polygamy, I mean technically it's polygamy, but I don't know if they called it polygamy, you know.
Story_ID: 611783
Speaker 1: What did you do when you left the--
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Center for Black Education?
Speaker 2: I went, I actually came back to Chicago [Illinois].  I talked back to my good friend, George Lowery [ph.] who had worked in the Black Student Union and worked, as well as the African American studies program [Black American Studies Program, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois].  He relocated to, to Milwaukee [Wisconsin], was working at, at Marquette University [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  And they had started a independent school up in Milwaukee.  So I spent the rest of the summer in Milwaukee working at, I think, it was called Our House Community School [ph.].  And it wasn't as progressive as Malcolm X Liberation University [Durham, North Carolina] or the Center for Black Education in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], but what they were doing it was like a summer program, I don't know if it went all year long or not, but I know when I was there it was the summer of, of, of 1970.  And they were working with, with small kids.  When I say small kids, I would say elementary school kids that essentially were from the ghetto in Milwaukee and trying to teach 'em reading, math, but also teaching them about Africa and about the history of black people and politicizing them and whatever.  Which I thought was a very constructive program.  They were also doing some other things in the community.  There was a very progressive brother there that had gotten, I think, fired by the board of education for, you know, being an activist and whatever.  So we were trying to get his job back and so we were doing some demonstrating and some petitioning and whatever to try to get him his job back, as well as, you know, we were doing other work, you know, in the community.  So I felt real good about, about that situation.  I got a chance to learn what was going in the black community in, in Milwaukee, who some of the progressive people were, and working with the kids was a very fulfilling, you know, experience.  I remember one of the things we did was we took the kids camping up in, I think it was Stevens Point, Wisconsin.  None of these kids had ever been camping before.  So we had bought these pup tents and showed the kids how to set up these tents which I had a little bit of experience from the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America] and Cub Scouts and whatever.  And I remember one of the kids, we had set up his tent and it was getting ready to rain so, you know, we had to like dig trenches around the tents so that would drain off the water so, you know, it wouldn't run into their tents, and everybody was down digging their trenches except this one kid, you know.  And, you know, I said, "Johnny, you know, what's wrong, how come you're not digging your trench?"  "Well, my mommy told me, you know, not to get dirty, you know."  I said, "Oh, she did?"  I said, "That's okay, Johnny."  I picked up a little bit of dirt and I rubbed it on his pants, I said, "It's okay, you know, you'll live, you know, it's all right, you can, you can dig a trench like everybody."  He said, "Oh, okay."  (Laughter) So he got down and started digging his trench.  But I said, what kind of mom is this, you know, tells a kid, you know, he can't get dirty going camping.
Story_ID: 611784
Speaker 1: So you're in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] for a summer program [through the Our House Community School (ph.)] and then--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --what would you do next?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And oh, so I, the other thing I, I remember is we, out camping with these kids, we took 'em fishing and none of 'em had ever been fishing before which was interesting, or very few of them.  And so we broke branches and tied lines on, on, on branches, you know, and had 'em put worms on, and every kid caught a fish, you know.  And to see them light up catching these fish which was, you know, very, heartwarming.  And I guess the last thing is that we were, we were doing fundraising for this guy who had, who had lost his job and we had to go get some chairs, we were gonna show a movie, you know, as a fundraiser we had to go get some chairs from the Black Panther [Black Panther Party] headquarters, I think it was on 3rd Street in, in Milwaukee and they had like a storefront.  And for some reason we had to wait, you know, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah and time was going on and on.  And I'm sitting there in, in the, in the storefront, and I start thinking about the Black Panthers and remembering their headquarters that had gotten shot up by the police and I'm saying, I don't wanna be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  And I remember telling 'em, hey, look you can meet me out on the street, you know.  (Laughter) 'Cause I, I was getting extremely paranoid, you know, because I, I think in New York [New York], L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and a couple of other places they had shot up Panther headquarters.  In addition, to doing that in Carbondale [Illinois].  Because there were Black Panthers in Carbondale and some of my friends had gotten shot, you know, from a police shoot out at their headquarters in, in Carbondale.  So I said, you know, I don't wanna any of this, you know, so I kind of stepped out.  Fortunately nothing happened, you know.  But anyway that was my whole summer there.
Story_ID: 611785
Speaker 1: So then I came back to Chicago [Illinois] and I say, I gotta get a job, you know.  So I ended up working at the post office [U.S. Postal Service] 'cause I had worked at the post office when I was at SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] during every Christmas, so every December, you know, we'd always go down and get a job at the post office, it was a very high paying job, you know.
Speaker 2: So do they like keep you on a roll, as like, I mean as, as--not on the roll, but do they give you priority if you've already worked for them?
Speaker 1: I think was, I think it was, yeah.  Because you, you know, you had some experience, you were on a, wherever records, you know, they had kept and whatever, so it wasn't hard getting a job back there.  I was working the evening shift, I think it was like six to two A.M. or something like that.
Speaker 2: Now let me say this then.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: I have a list here that you've compiled from jobs--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --jobs of Tony Burroughs [HistoryMaker Anthony "Tony" Preston Burroughs].  Man, I have never seen so many jobs.  I mean, post office, State of Illinois, General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company], Hunt Wesson Foods [Hunt Wesson Foods, Inc.], I mean, you can go down this, it's sort of a, two of 'em are in the same year, I mean a lot of different jobs.
Speaker 1: Well, you know--
Speaker 2: From somebody who is, has a lot of capacity and tenacity and, you know, you would think, you know, there's a lot of jobs.  You know, until you really started becoming a genealogist full time--
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: --you know, but so, so what's the story of all, you know--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --of all the different jobs?  I mean, if you get a job like the post office--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and say the, I, I would think the Department of Personnel [Illinois Department of Personnel] with the state--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --is, those are similar jobs in terms of what you make and what you might be, you know.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: I know, so I mean, so why are you going from, why are there so many jobs?  You don't seem to have a personality that would--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --lend yourself to--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you, you don't explode on the job or anything.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right, right.  Well one, I guess, I've, I've, I've always been somewhat independent, meaning that I wanted to work, wanted to make, you know, money, 'cause I never--my, my parents [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs and Elmer Burroughs] weren't wealthy, so they didn't, you know, they took care of my, my food and my shelter and whatever but I had to go out and make my own spending money.  So I was never afraid to work.  So I always worked since I, you know, when I was a little kid shoveling snow and had a paper route and whatever.  So, and it was like during high school [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], you know, I, I got off the track team so I could get a job, you know.  And every summer I always worked when I was in school and every Christmas break so I just--.  Well not only did I work to, you know, make extra money but back in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s], there were jobs in Chicago.  I mean there was, it wasn't hard to get a job, if you wanted to work, you could get a job.  And, and, and sometimes I'd get a--I remember once I got a job, didn't even know how much it was paying.  I worked on the job, I, I think it was down at, around the corner from here at R.R. Donnelley and Sons [R.R. Donnelley and Sons Company, Chicago, Illinois].  And I was working and I think, we had telephone books and we were cleaning the sides of the telephone books, you know, kind of shaving 'em with some sand paper before they went out and I think it was the final step, whatever.  And I think I was working on the job about a hour, hour and a half, didn't even know how much, you know, I was making but I heard about the job and went down and got hired right away.  I asked the guy how much we was making and when he told me how much we was making I said, "I ain't working for that."  I left the job went out that afternoon and got another job that afternoon, you know (laughter).  But I mean you could just get jobs, you know.  So when I got out of school in 1970, I didn't have a degree.  So it was difficult to get a job with four years of education but without having a degree because everybody would think you were going back to school.  So you've overqualified for some, you know, underqualified for others, you know, but by going to the post office since I had worked there every year during school it was not hard to get there and the post office was paying good money.  I got a job in the evening, on the evening shift so I could look for a better job during the day.  I was living with my girlfriend from college [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois], you know.  So we were dating and living together and she was supposed to go out to look for a job but unfortunately she never went to look for a job.  When I would come home at two o'clock in the morning, she wanted to go out with me and party you know (laughter).  And so we were on the same schedule instead of her looking for a job during the day and me looking for a job during the day, we ended up sleeping all during the day 'cause we had been out partying at night, you know.
Story_ID: 611786
Speaker 1: But then eventually, one of my college friends--I was like vice president of the fraternity [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] when I was in college [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] and the guy who was president had moved to Springfield, Illinois, gotten a very good job and then he said, "Hey I can get you a good job here in Springfield."  So I said great.  And it was a job where everybody else had a college degree but me.  So it was a, you know, entry level college degree type of job working with the Department of Personnel [Illinois Department of Personnel].  So I said, "Well let me get out of the post office [U.S. Postal Service]," 'cause the post office is just, it was a labor intensive job for people that didn't have degrees, you know, paid good money but it wasn't, you know, an office job.  So I relocated to Springfield and I worked with, you know, my--well Lamar, Lamar Gentry was, was my roommate there.  He wasn't, I forget which department he was working in but mine was in the Department of Personnel.  And I was working one of these programs like the Model Cities program.  And it was a government program, federally funded, where it was designed to get blacks and minorities entry level jobs and taking those that had gotten into dead end positions and giving them skills and, and, and, and more training so they could upgrade and move up to higher positions.  My job with the state was to monitor this program.  And so I would travel around, I had a company car, a government car, whatever, where I would travel around to different state agencies all throughout the State of Illinois and see where we had these programs instituted and I would monitor the programs based on the federal guidelines.  So I never will forget, I went to my boss and I wrote up this report where I explained what the federal guidelines were and what we were doing in each one of our different facilities and how that matched with where we were supposed to be at that particular point in the, the program.  And basically my report said that we were falling behind federal guidelines, you know, that we needed to step up what we were doing.  So I had a meeting with my boss who was the head of the personnel department, State of Illinois, I can't remember his name.  And he said, "Well Tony [HistoryMaker Anthony "Tony" Preston Burroughs] you did a excellent report, you know, you did a good analysis," blah, blah this and blah, blah that, "however, can you edit it, edit your report and make it appear as if we're on target?"  And I said, whoa (laughter).  I was literally astounded that he would actually ask me to falsify the report to show that we were on target when we were way off target.  And I think that's when I left that job, you know.  Because I guess I was very idealistic and, and I, I was an honest person and I, I was just astounded that someone would ask me to do that.  And I said if he wants me to do that, you know, he doesn't have the integrity that I can work with and I just didn't wanna do that.  I didn't even think about the fact what could happen to me if I falsified a report, a federal report, you know, and, and what the implications of that were 'cause I wasn't even really thinking of myself, I was just thinking of the circumstance of who my boss was and how he thought and what that meant for the whole program.  So I left out of there.
Story_ID: 611787
Speaker 1: At that time, I think it was that year that I actually got back in contact with Howard Fuller/Owusu Sadauki, who had left Durham [North Carolina] and went to Greensboro [North Carolina].  Because I guess before then, and it must have been the time when I left out of D.C. [Washington, D.C.], I'd actually traveled to Durham and I had talked to Howard and I looked at Malcolm X Liberation University because I was thinking about attending there.  And I wasn't impressed with what was going on in Durham, but I can't remember if that was before I went to D.C. with Sinclair [Sinclair Brown] or after then but at some point in time I had went to Durham and I wasn't impressed with them.  Well I hooked back up with, with Fuller and he said they closed down the operation in Durham and relocated to Greensboro.  And said they had corrected some of the problems, you know, that were going on in Durham.  So I actually packed a bag and I drove down to Greensboro and so I attended Malcolm X Liberation University in Greensboro.  And so I took classes there and I got into the, the, the part of the program that had to do with, I guess, electrical engineering because I was always interested in, in electronics and stuff.  I had built some shortwave radios and, and repaired lamps and done a lot of stuff with, that had to do with electricity so I was interested in that particular area.  And I remember, excuse me, they had a, a program that had to deal with agronomy, soil science and this, that and the other.  One of the brothers that, that was also heading up one of the areas there and I was looking at his name--Eric [Eric Evans] was his name, and I know, you know, exactly who I'm talking about, he was at Cornell University [Ithaca, New York].  And when Cornell University took over the university, and the big heavyset brother that had the bandolier across his, his chest and had the shotguns, and they took over Cornell University and took over one of the, one of the buildings there and had a demonstration against the school, and it was all headlines in the paper.  And they just had an anniversary of that take over, it was either this year or last year.  And I went and did some research on that to find out that brother's name 'cause I had forgotten his name, but name, his first name was Eric and I can't remember his last name but, you know, exactly who I'm talking about don't you?  Do you remember that, that--
Speaker 2: I, I, not this time, I think--
Speaker 1: You don't (laughter)--
Speaker 2: I'm stumped.
Speaker 1: Ah!  I can't believe I got you on one.
Speaker 2: I remember the picture but--
Speaker 1: Right, you remember the picture.  Yeah, yeah, 'cause the big heavyset brother had this big Afro and he had this big shotgun, I think both of the brothers had shotguns, and he had this, these bandoliers about his chest, you know.  But they had researched the laws just like Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton]--was it Huey?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Huey--
Speaker 1: I think it was Huey.
Speaker 2: --Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but I, but, but I think Huey was the one that had went to law school [San Francisco Law School, San Francisco, California] and had researched the, the laws in the State of California that said that you could, could carry weapons if they weren't concealed.  And so that was a big tenet of the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] there that, you know, they had guns out but they were legal.  And--because I, you know, I had, I had, I forget which book it was but there was a book out on the Black Panthers back in the '60s [1960s] and I can't remember the title now, but they talked about the development between Huey Newton and Bobby Seale.  And, and I remember Huey Newton was the one that was really strong psychologically, and he had the real guts of the Black Panthers, but Bobby Seale had the real brains, you know, of the Black Panthers, you know.  But I can't remember which one had done the research to find out that you could carry weapons legally, you know, in California.  One of these brothers, either Eric or the other brother had done the same, same or similar kind of research in New York [New York] to find out the same thing that you could carry guns as long as they weren't concealed, you know.  I can't remember if they were loaded this, that, and the other.  But anyway that brother was down at Malcolm X Liberation University in Greensboro, North Carolina.
Story_ID: 611788
Speaker 1: This is 1972, or '70 [1970], '71 [1971], '71 [1971] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was either '70 [1970], I think it was '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it was '71 [1971].  'Cause my, I know I had left Springfield [Illinois], my [paternal] grandfather [Asa Morris Burroughs] died in '71 [1971] and I didn't attend his funeral because I was, I wasn't living in Illinois and I know my family was trying to get in contact with me, they didn't know where I was 'cause, you know, when I left, I just, (makes sound), I just left and went and, and, you know, attended the school there [Malcolm X Liberation University, Greensboro, North Carolina] and so I'm pretty much sure it was probably '71 [1971].  That went on I think for maybe about six months or so.  Ran into similar problems that I did in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] with the Center for Black Education.  The problem there was that Howard Fuller [Owusu Sadauki] was basically kind of autocratic, that he had a good vision, he had developed some good programs, but he did not listen to like the students there, some of which were, you know, had pretty much read, you know, what he had read, had had a lot of experience, involvement, so they had some good input that would help correct some of the problems, you know, and, and, you know, get the, the, the institution where it really should be.  But, you know, he kind of like said, hey, this is my program, I'm a run it the way I wanna run it, you know.  So when I saw that he wasn't, you know, open to really change and really develop from the grassroots level, I kind of got disenchanted, you know, from that.  But they were in the process I think at that time talking about the Sixth Pan-African Congress [Dar es Salaam, Tanzania], which, you know, was coming up in a couple of years, you know, so they were doing, you know, some planning for that.  As well as trying to relocate people into Africa which I think they had actually sent some people over there.  One of the sad things about the school was that we had, we had a farm component where we had guys and ladies that actually bought some baby chicks and raised these chicks from baby chicks up until mature chickens, and we bought this huge freezer and, you know, we slaughtered these chickens, it was the first I like wrung their necks, you know, and we dipped 'em in hot water and feathered the chickens and whatever.  And we put 'em into the freezer and later on that night, I mean, this, this thing just stunk up the whole building, you know.
Speaker 1: Did the electricity went off or something?
Speaker 2: No.  What happened was the freezer was brand new and it was not pre-chilled so the heat from the bodies of the chickens overwhelmed the cooling capacity of the freezer because it was not pre-chilled (laughter).  And all those chickens rotted in the freezer.  Oh, it was, it was, it was so sad because they had spent, I don't know, how many months raising and nurturing these little baby chicks, you know, and, and everybody from the school helped slaughter them and feather them, you know, because there were so many of 'em and they needed the extra work.  So all of us even though we weren't in that farm-agriculture component, we all played a role in that, you know (simultaneous).

Speaker 1: Malcolm X Liberation University has always intrigued me in terms of--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I mean what, I mean what--can you just--I mean how many buildings did it occupy, or did it have, well how many people were in, were involved?
Speaker 2: We had a dormitory, and then I think we had a separate building, it was just really, it was either one or two buildings, I think we had the one dormitory which was kind of like apartment building, and then we had one building where, you know, we attended classes, and then there was some land, you know, where they, you know, like, you know, raised crops and grew these chickens and I can't remember where the land was in relationship to, you know, the other buildings.  But it wasn't, it was a small operation.  In terms of the--
Speaker 1: Was it in town or outside?
Speaker 2: It was, it was in town, in the City of, of Greensboro [North Carolina].  We were not far from, from Bennett College [Greensboro, North Carolina], you know, the, I think, Bennett was all, all girls.  AT&T--not AT&T, what is it?  A and T College [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], it was a all-black school [HBCU], agricultural and technology school was there because we met folks that went to A and T and from Bennett and it wasn't far from there.  In terms of the, the students my recollection was there might have been like fifty or less, it wasn't a whole lot.  So the classes we did have were kind of small, me being in, in the electronics or electrical engineering whatever component, I don't think we had more than ten in our particular component, you know.  So it was a small like teacher to student ratio.  I remember after, you know, I got out I worked at this radio station there and was studying to get my radio license, you know.
Speaker 1: First class license?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right, right, right, exactly.  So it really wasn't that large.  And I guess it really couldn't be that large for the kinds of things they were doing and to try to develop, you know, some kind of level of expertise because they were trying to get instructors that not, not only had technical expertise but also had a political persuasion that they were interested in the survival of African people and developing Africa, you know, and things like that.  So trying to find people with those, you know, the intellectual experience as well as the technical experience, you know, was kind of challenging, you know.  As well as finding students who were willing to commit their lives literally for the freedom, the liberation, and the struggle of, of black people because a lot of people weren't there intellectually, you know.  So you, you had to really do a lot of soul searching, you know, to get that point, to that point and I was willing to, to devote the rest of my life, you know, to, to go to Africa and help develop it, you know, and help, you know, like what we call, quote quote, liberate black people, you know.  So it wasn't a very large operation and--
Speaker 1: So, well, but after the, after the chicken--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --problem what happened?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: I mean--
Speaker 2: I remember having some discussions, you know, with Fuller [Howard Fuller; Owusu Sadauki] about what I considered were some of the shortcomings of, of the school, you know, that I thought needed to be corrected, you know.  And he acknowledged some of them, you know, and said, you know, he was working on this and that and the other, and, you know, other people had mentioned some things, and, you know, he was, you know, he was gonna address those, you know, but, you know, in his time, you know, and he was, you know, working on this and that and the other.  So after a period of time when I didn't, you know, really see, you know, some improvements I just, you know, kind of got disillusioned again, you know, and eventually said, you know, hey, I'm outta here, you know.  So after, I think it was about six months or so, you know, I just kind of packed up bags and, and, and came back, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: But I mean it was, it was a very good experience.  I mean I learned a lot, you know, I met a lot of very interesting, you know, very progressive people, you know.  But again, you know, I said I need to do something else, you know.
Story_ID: 611790
Speaker 1: What did you determine to do when you got back then?
Speaker 2: When I came back--
Speaker 1: We know you got a job 'cause there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right, right, right.
Speaker 1: --there were a lot more of those.
Speaker 2: I think that's when I came back and I found a job in, in Lansing, Michigan, with, with Oldsmobile.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now that's, now that's interesting.  General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company], Oldsmobile division.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Management training.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: In Lansing, so.
Speaker 2: I had had a, you know, when I was in SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois], I had developed this huge Afro, you know.  And I guess that happened around '68 [1968] too, you know, when all this transformation was going on and my hair was always kind of short like it is now, you know, people, and it was always kind of curly, people say, "You can't grow an Afro."  And I remember I worked on it real hard and all of a sudden I had this Afro like about this big.  Even grew a beard, I had a beard down to here, you know.  But when, you know, all that political stuff happening, I knew I had to, you know, go back and get a real job.  You know, I cut my hair down, and cut the beard off and this, that, and the other.  And started developing some resumes and what I realized was, is that I ran into the same problem again of having a, four years of college, you know, without, you know, like a degree.  And when I was in Springfield [Illinois] working with the State of Illinois [Illinois Department of Personnel], I actually reenrolled in school there and I started, you know, taking some other classes there.  So what I realize in really researching jobs and how to get a job and developing a resume that even though I technically did not have a degree, I had more hours than most people that had degrees because I went back to school in Springfield and whatever.  But I also had the same experience as those people that had degrees.  So what I had to do was when I was on a job interview, present myself as a person who had a degree even though technically I didn't.  So I was able to do that with my resume, with, you know, my interviewing skills, and, you know, just my whole experience and everything.  So the job I had at, at Oldsmobile, everybody had a degree but me.  And, in fact, I think the program was even, was even titled College Graduates in Training [ph.], you know.  So the job was at Oldsmobile's headquarters in Lansing.  I got an apartment right across the street at this funeral home across the street from Oldsmobile.  The owners of the funeral home had a, an apartment right across the, the parking lot so I was able to get a nice apartment there after staying in the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], you know, like a couple of weeks.  My boss was very nice because he said, "Look, I know you don't live here, you're from Chicago [Illinois], I know it's a lot of pressures in starting a job, why don't you just go and look for depar- an apartment and don't even start work until you find an apartment," which was really cool.  So after a few days I found an apartment, started working there.
Story_ID: 611791
Speaker 1: And what we did was we worked in each and every department of Oldsmobile: in purchasing, in sales, in shipping, every department they had we worked there for several weeks to learn how that apartment, you know, ran.  Our eventual, eventual job was to learn how to work in the, what they call a zone office.  The headquarters was in Lansing [Michigan] where they built the cars, they not only built the cars there but also all the administrative offices were there also.  A zone office was a regional office outside, throughout the United States, where dealerships would report to a zone office and they would order cars from the zone office and they would report there all their financials to the zone office.  So each zone office encompassed a region that had so many dealerships that reported to them.  What we were to do was to go out and work in a zone office and we would analyze the financial statements of all the dealers, the balance sheets, the profit/loss statements, and the, and also all the marketing materials to determine how well that dealership was doing and try to improve profits at that dealership.  So I really learned a heck of a lot about sales, about marketing, about finance, about how to analyze, you know, a business.  In retrospect, it was a crazy job because thinking about a black guy trying to tell a millionaire white businessman how to do his job (laughter), is really absurd when you really sit down and think about it.  I remember that I went into this guy's office one day, and he had what I called a composite, which was a large frame picture that had small photographs of everybody that had been in this program I guess since its inception.  And, I believe, this was '72 [1972] or '73 [1973], I think it was '72 [1972], and I don't when the program started, it must have started in the '60s [1960s], and there must have been at least fifty black folks in this program.  So it was a program just for blacks.  When I came on board I think there were like four other blacks in the program, in addition to me.  So I think there were five that came on board when I did.  I think of all those, about fifty that were in the program, I don't know if there was one or two that were still in the program.  And that kind of said to me they weren't interested in really keeping people in this program and really developing them.  I got the impression it was something to satisfy some kind of quotas.  Because you had a lot of quota programs during the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s] for hiring blacks and I don't know what incentives they got.
Speaker 2: To stay, yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 611792
Speaker 1: I got the impression they really didn't really care about blacks really working there, it was some kind of quota system, they were, they were working on.  And every time you got a promotion, you had to leave one area of the country and go to another area.  And that's just the culture of working for, for General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] is that they wanted you to work all over.  So they didn't care if you were married, you had kids in school, and where they were, you know, where your wife was working or what school your kids was at, when they said you had to move, you had to pack up and move.  And kind of like the, the horror story in there was that working in Fargo, North Dakota.  And working up in Fargo you had what they called a survival kit in your trunk because there was like nothing for miles and miles and miles.  And if, you could be going from one dealership to another and it might have been, I don't know fifty or a hundred miles, you know, a hundred, two hundred miles from one dealership to another, and you're gonna be caught in these, you know, like real serious snow storms, you know.  And if you didn't have a survival kit in your car, I mean, that could be the, the difference between, you know, like surviving and not, you know.  And the other part of the story was, if they offered you a promotion and you were sent to a place you didn't wanna go, you didn't have to go, but you weren't getting another promotion, you know (laughter).  So a lot of these little horror stories and they would tell us about what happened, you know, Joe Blow, and what happened to him, you know, how he got stuck in this place and the other.
Story_ID: 611793
Speaker 1: So I came up for promotion, I guess, after I was there six or eight months or so.  And I remember having an interview with, with the vice president of, of Oldsmobile, you know.  Which at that time they didn't have that many vice presidents.  And this guy was like number two in line, you know, and I'm saying, wow, I'm here like little low level employee, you know, I gotta talk to almost the, the head man in charge which I thought was very interesting.  And for some reason, I didn't pass that interview.  And I have no idea what it was, you know.  He didn't tell me I didn't do anything wrong, I never got any bad report, you know, as, as to I didn't function well in one of the different departments, you know.  And I had no idea like what had happened.  I know when I came back, you know, one guy was saying, you know, he got promoted and he was going to, to, to Jersey [New Jersey] or somewhere.  Oh, no, he was going, I think to Detroit [Michigan], I think he saw something where I was going to Jersey, it was a suburb of New York [New York], I forget, it wasn't Newark [New Jersey], but one of those suburbs, you know, like close to, to Detroit, to, to New York, it was kind of like a suburb of New York.  And so I guess he had seen something in someone's papers and whatever.  So he asked me about it, said, "Well, he didn't mention that in the interview," you know.  So after that, you know, several days after that, no one said anything else to me, you know.  It was like I was going back to work in this department where I was before and no one said I was gonna ship out and didn't say I was gonna get, you know, promoted, and I didn't know what was going on, I was like really clueless and it was the weirdest feeling.  And I said, hey, I don't like to be in a situation where like I don't have any kind of control and I don't know, you know, like what's going on, you know, and I heard all these horror stories and whatever.  So after a while and nothing changed, I just packed up and, and got out of there, you know.  And, and I guess the other part where you asked about all these jobs, I guess I had gotten the confidence that I didn't care about a job.  In terms of not caring about a job is that I wanted to make money, I wanted something that that, you know, I could use my intellectual capacity, but I wasn't going to feel that I was tied to a job and I had to work there and I didn't like to work there.  I always had the confidence that I can always get another job and that I needed to work at a place that I enjoyed working, that I liked the people I was working around, and that I was doing something that I thought was productive, and something where I can use my intellectual skills and capacity and try to reach my maximum worth.  So if I was at a place and, and I wasn't satisfied intellectually or philosophically or psychologically, whatever, I said, hey, I'm outta here.  You know, I can get me another job, you know.  So, you know, I had no qualms about it at all.
Story_ID: 611794
Speaker 1: So I left Oldsmobile, came back to Chicago [Illinois] and I think around that time I must have got the job with Hunt Wesson Foods [Hunt Wesson Foods, Inc.], is that what it says on there (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Hunt Wesson is next.
Speaker 1: Hunt Wesson Foods, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, as a sales rep.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was a sales rep.  And it seemed that sales jobs were, were very plentiful as well as they paid well.  And a lot of 'em had company cars.  I had friends that were, that were into sales.  So I started interviewing for a lot of sales gigs.  And I started to develop my interviewing skills and improve up on my interviewing skills as well as my, my resume skills.  Because what I, I really started to do was I started to research how to do resumes.  I started going to the library and getting tons and tons of different books on how to do resumes.  So I started to increase my ability to have, you know, a better resume.  I started researching how to do interviewing.  And, you know, I started research on, on sales and how to do good sales and whatever.  So I got it down to a real, you know, technique.  And I remember interviewing for a job at Gillette [The Gillette Company] and they had a good job.  And in the middle of the interview, I mean, I won this cat over so big, he said, "Look, I don't even wanna finish the interview, you know, 'cause I just, I just like you and I like your skills, and, and, you know, you have tremendous sales potential and you have tremendous sales skills."  So he said, "I, I wanna hire you now."  So I said, "Great."  And we talked about salary and I said, "Well, you know, you're gonna have to do better on the salary, you know, because I know I can do better than that, you know."  He says, "Well, you know, this is kind of like where we're at but, you know, let me see if I can increase it."  You know, and he went back to his boss, whatever, and they couldn't increase it, and I said, "Well, fine, I'm sorry, I really would like to work for you, but, you know, I just need to make more money."  So I left out of there and then I got the job, you know, working at Hunt Wesson and was making the kind of money, you know, that I wanted.  It was making more than Gillette and it had a company car and I worked out of my home and I was able to work with my boss, you know, I don't know every once a month, once every two or three weeks or whatever.  So it was a real ideal situation.
Story_ID: 611795
Speaker 1: So that went on for quite a while.  The unfortunate thing about it was that my boss [at Hunt Wesson Foods, Inc.] was not very skilled.  He was from Wisconsin, never lived in Chicago [Illinois] before, was fresh out of college, I had been out several years, had several jobs, so I had, you know, some job experience.  He had never worked with black people before.  And he was one of these persons that was a know it all, that he knew everything, he knew how to do stuff, and you can't tell him everything.  We would go in the stores and what we had to do was, we were representing Hunt's ketchup and Wesson oil, those were our two primary products.  We had some snack food product also but the Hunt's ketchup and Wesson oil were our primary products.  And we called on wholesalers that were selling to grocery stores and we had three or four major wholesalers, as well as we had some grocery stores too.  And what our job was, was to go into the wholesaler and try to get them to buy our product or increase the number of cases of our product they were buying, and try to sell them on new products that were coming out because there were always derivative new products that were coming out.  Also I had to go into local grocery stores and get them to carry our new products, try to increase what we called facings, where you go into a grocery store and you see a bottle of Hunt's ketchup and there might have been three bottles of Hunt's ketchup lined in a row.  Then you might have had the competitor and they may have had three or four bottles in a row.  So if we had three and they had three, our job was to try to get five rows.  So the more rows we had, then we had a better presence than a competitor so when customers came in they would see that more than the other one, and so they would have a tendency to buy that one, so that's one of the things we tried to do.  As well as we tried to set up displays like aisle displays and, and front store displays to try to bring more presence and get them to buy that.  Well, I would do that on my own after training with the company, but then my boss would come down and work with me, and so I would spend a day working with the boss.  Every time I worked with my boss and we went to a store, we literally got kicked out of the store.  I mean, the man said, "Get the hell out of here," you know (laughter).  Because he would not listen, and he had his own ideas and he would try to force things on to a manager.  And he would get so frustrated he would literally say, "Get the hell out of my store."  So then we would go to a restaurant, sit down and have an after sales meeting, and then he would try to explain to me why the store manager was wrong and what he should have done and this and the other, rather than analyze what he did wrong, so I could learn how to do it properly.  So I really didn't learn a heck of a lot from him.  Later on when I decided, hey, this ain't working out, he got fired, another guy came in which was the best salesman I had ever met in my life.  And I worked with him a few times and learned a heck of a lot.  And it was amazing how we went into a store and he talked to the manger and never talked to the manager about our product.  Talked to him about his family, talked about industry and all this stuff, and I'm saying, when are you gonna talk about the product, you know.  So after, you know, he talked with him, you know, like, I don't know, ten, fifteen, twenty minutes or so he says, "Joe [ph.], by the way you got time to go down to the, to the floor?"  He said, "Oh, yeah."  So we'd go down to the floor, he's still talking to him about the industry and this and that and the other.  So we get down to the shelf where our products are, he kneels down on the floor, pulls out his case, so he takes the competitor's product and moves two facings back, pulls our product out of his case, puts it on the shelf where the competitor's product is, never asked the manager if he wanted to buy the product.  He gets up and says, "Oh, Joe, by the way, if that stuff doesn't sell, I'll come back and take it."  He said, "Okay, no problem, John [ph.], I'll see you later."  We walk out of the store, he never asked for the sale, never asked to put the product there, and I'm like patting my hands hoping, you know, he didn't steal nothing from me.  Very, very smooth guy, you know.  And I said, wow, I wish I could have been able to work with him from the beginning, you know.  But he wasn't, he was only in our area temporarily and it wasn't decided if he was gonna work in our area permanently, and I had already made the decision, you know, like to leave the company, you know.  And I think that was the end of, end of '73 [1973] going to the beginning of, of '74 [1974], you know.  So I decided to leave them.
Story_ID: 611796
Speaker 1: Like I said there's a succession of, of jobs.  Seventy-four [1974] I think it was four of 'em in '74 [1974], four different jobs.  Up through, and it looks likes--well, did you stay any one place very long?  I mean, it looks like Hyde Park Jewish Community Center [Chicago, Illinois] you taught physical education there for a while.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well what happened was in '74 [1974], at the beginning of '74 [1974], after I had left Hunt Wesson Foods [Hunt Wesson Foods, Inc.], I had saved some money up, you know, I wanted to take some time off for a while.  And a friend of mine [Carlton Brown (ph.)] I had kind of grown up in grammar school was in town from California and he was living in, in Santa Barbara [California].  So he said, "Well why don't you come out to California with me?"  I had never been to California before, I always wanted to go, you know.  So he said, you know, "I got a place in Santa Barbara you can stay with me, you know.  So, you know, we can drive out together."  So I started thinking about it I said, well, you know, if we drive out I can save the money from the airfare and, you know, he's gonna split the gas money with me, stay at his place in Santa Barbara so I don't have to, you know, like rent a hotel room whatever.  And, you know, I had saved up this money and I wanted to take some time off before work and I said, well, hey this is a ideal situation, you know.  So I said, "Okay, cool, let's do that," you know.  Now I still had my apartment in Chicago [Illinois], so I rented that out to a bunch of my friends 'cause they kind of needed a place away from home to do whatever they were doing, you know (laughter).  So I said, "Look I'm going out to California, I'm gonna be gone, I don't know, maybe a couple of weeks, you know, maybe three to four weeks, you know, max," you know.  So they said fine, you know.  So I drove out with him, my brother was staying, my brother was, my younger brother, Mike [ph.] was going to school at Kansas State [sic. Pittsburg State University] in Pittsburg, Kansas.  So we drove out, stayed at his place, you know, in Pittsburg, and that took a whole day.  Then the next day we left Pittsburg, we went out to Albuquerque, New Mexico, we spent the night on the school there, I guess, it was University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.  So my friend and I got into an argument.  We went out to dinner that night and '74 [1974] was during the height of the gas crisis and, you know, gas was very high, stations had closed up, there were long lines, you know, to get gas.  I think, gas stations weren't open on Sunday, you know.  So it was a real horrendous situation back then.  So I had calculated, you know, we would drive like ten, twelve, fourteen hours a day, you know, 'cause it was a, a three day trip.  You could have done it in four days comfortably but we did it in like three days.  I calculated that we had to leave, I don't know, it was three or four o'clock in the morning or something in order to get in to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] before all the gas stations closed.  Well at dinner my friend said, "Well, you know, if we do that we're not gonna be able to see the Painted Desert."  I said, "What's up with the Painted Desert?"  And he said, "Well, you know, it's the most magnificent place, you know, it's one of my favorites."  I said, "That's fine, man, but, you know, we gotta get gas, you know."  So we got into this argument and he split.  So, hey, this is kind of bizarre, you know.  So we're like--
Speaker 1: So he left you in--
Speaker 2: He left me in Albuquerque.  Now this is like first week in January, not long after, after New Year's.  We had been in and out, I thought it was strange because every night he wanted to divvy up, you know, how much he owed for gas.  I said, "Oh, don't worry about it, you know, when we get to L.A. we'll figure what it is, divide it in two."  He said, "No, no, no.  I wanna make sure, you know, that every day, you know, I pay my share."  I said, "Okay, fine."  So I thought that was kind of strange, but I didn't really think, you know, what it really meant.  I thought it was strange of him getting in this argument, you know, I said, well he's probably just blowing off some steam, in the morning he's gone come back, we gone hook up, you know.  'Cause we were spending the night at the university like in one of the, you know, we just camped out on the couch, you know, in one of the dorm rooms or one of the school rooms or whatever.  So that morning, you know, I got up, he wasn't there, so I said, well, hey, (makes sound), I'm booking.
Story_ID: 611797
Speaker 1: So I booked in by myself and I said, wow, now I gotta pay for this other gas I wasn't planning on paying for.  When I got to Flagstaff, Arizona, there was a big snowstorm, which I hadn't calculated, you know.  But, you know, it was like up in the mountains.  There was like a state highway police road block, you could not get on the highway without tire chains.  So I had to drive back to the gas station and buy these tire change--chains, which was an extra expense I hadn't planned on but you couldn't get on the highway without this, these tire chains.  So it was a big long line of people buying these tire chains, put those on.  Got through there, went to Barstow, California, it was another big, huge snowstorm out there.  And I thought it was weird a snowstorm in California, you know (laughter).  Flip Wilson was up in the same gas station I was at, you know, had this Rolls Royce 'cause Flip was very popular back then, his license plates had FLIPPER [ph.] on it and that was one of the most popular shows back then.  So I finally got into L.A. [Los Angeles, California], got in there before all the gas stations had closed and got some gas.  And didn't have a place to stay because he was in Santa Barbara [California], I didn't even have his address, phone number in Santa Barbara.  Didn't know where he was there, so I had to stay in L.A.  So I had no idea where I was gonna stay.  So in Albuquerque [New Mexico] since we had spent the night at University of, of New Mexico [University of New Mexico], I said, well, I'm going down to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  So I went out to UCLA and I literally slept on the couch of one of the dorm rooms for like about two weeks out there, you know.  And saw a couple of friends I had known from Chicago [Illinois] that relocated to, to California.  And one of 'em was a good friend of this guy, Carlton Brown [ph.] who, you know, I, I was supposed to be staying in Santa Barbara with.  And I told her the whole experience, she says, "You know, he planned that from the beginning."  He had hitchhiked to Chicago--'cause he had a, he had ran into some problems when we were young, and his mother sent him to Boys Town [ph.], so he had spent some time in Boys Town, then he like hitchhiked to California, he was hitchhiking all around the country.  She said he had hitchhiked to Chicago, and he used me for a ride to get back to California, he had no place, in, in, in Santa Barbara.  She said that, you know, he was out mooching on people all in Southern California.  And I ran into another friend of mine we called Scooty [ph.], and he told me that he had mooched on him, tried to stay at his place for like weeks, wasn't paying any rent and stuff.  So he just, you know, was gonna hitchhike from Albuquerque to L.A., which was no big deal because he had hitchhiked all the way from L.A. to Chicago.  So I said, oh, now it kind of makes sense why he was trying to pay every night to make sure everything was added up.

Speaker 1: So after staying, you know, at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], you know, for two weeks, I wired some money back from my bank account in Chicago [Illinois], went to a temporary agency and got a job which turned out to be a long term job even though it was at a temporary agency where I was in charge of the Xerox machine.  It was a company that was, that was manufacturing garden catalogs, I think it was called Regenstein or something, but they were manufacturing flower seeds.  And I was in charge of just photocopying stuff while they were producing.  But in the meantime, I still wanted to go to Africa to the Sixth Pan-African Congress [Dar es Salaam, Tanzania].  So, I guess, UCLA or somewhere around there, I saw some flyers where some people were talking about the Sixth Pan-African Congress.  So they're having some meeting.  So I went to a couple of the meetings, I met some of the progressive people, and so I joined one of the committees.  And so I started working with them, told 'em, you know, I had, after I stayed in the dorms, I had rented a apartment out in Beverly Hills [California] out on San Vicente [Boulevard] and La Cienega [Boulevard], out in, close to, to UCLA.  And so I rented that apartment and I, you know, got to meet them very closely and they said, "Well hey, why don't you just come on and, and, and live at our place 'cause we have a place," you know.  So I said fine.  So, you know, I stayed in, in one of the bedrooms that they had and they were working on, on the committee, they wanted organizers for--the L.A. organization was planning for the Sixth Pan-African Congress, you know.  So I said great.  So I got a chance to meet them.  And she was originally from Oakland [California], Glennette [ph.].  I think her name was Glennette, something like that, I can't remember her last name.  The brother that she was dating, he was one of the organizers also.  I think he was an ex-Black Panther.  I can't remember if he was from L.A. or, or also from Oakland [California].  But they were very intellectual, very progressive folk, and we became very, very close.  So I worked with them for a while, but then I wasn't really making a lot of money on this, you know, this photo copying place.  So I really needed some extra, I had, 'cause I had very little money even to pay rent, you know.  So I think what happened was I didn't have enough money to actually go to Africa.  I didn't have a job making decent money like I should have been making like I was in sales.  I was out there much longer than I had planned.  I ended up staying out there like about six months.  I loved Los Angeles [California], it was so different from the Midwest, you know.  I had went up to Oakland, my first time in San Francisco [California].  I remember being out on the bay [San Francisco Bay] waiting, they were at a meeting, I was out on the bay watching this guy sail and it was so fascinating, I said, wow, I wanna learn how to sail, so I said when I go back to Chicago I'm gone learn how to sail, 'cause, you know, we got a bunch of sail boats, you know, in Chicago.  And I literally came back to Chicago and learned how to sail.  My dad [Elmer Burroughs] was sick, my, my dad had diabetes, he had a heart condition, he was overweight.  I was in contact with the family and, and my dad was in and out of the hospital.  So finally I decided I need to get back to Chicago because I need to get a, a real job, a permanent job, my dad was sick and I need to look after my dad, you know.  So I ended up coming back to Chicago and I think I came back like in June.  I went out there the first week in January.  I remember the, the hot movie was 'The Exorcist.'  And it was like, you know, about zero degrees in Chicago, when I went out to L.A. it was like, I don't know in the fifties, sixties or something.  You know, people were complaining 'cause it was raining.  I said, oh, why are you complaining about rain, we got snow and cold out there, you know.  People would line all four blocks to see 'The Exorcist' and I thought that was just extremely incredible.
Story_ID: 611799
Speaker 1: But I came back to Chicago [Illinois], started taking care of my dad [Elmer Burroughs].  And, but the other thing was I said I needed a job, in California I had done so many different new things.  I had actually taken my bicycle out there, my ten speed bike, I had picked up a book called 'Bicycle Tours of L.A.' [ph.], and I took a different tour every day, the tours were like twelve miles.  And I got so good and I got in shape, and I was taking two tours a day which is like twenty-five miles.  I then went through all, through the beach cities, I went all through, through anywhere in Southern California I was there, you know.  But the other thing it was, I said, well, I've never been out here before so I'm gonna do just anything and everything, you know.  And I remember some nights, get in my car and just following a road and going wherever the road went.  And one of these times I was driving on this road and the road started winding up in a hill and got to the end, top of a hill and I parked my car and there was a parking lot out there, and I saw all these people in this long line.  I went and got in line and I said, you know, why are we in line?  (Laughter) You know.  Happened to be Griffith Park Observatory [sic. Griffith Observatory, Los Angeles, California] and it was like the planetarium [Adler Planetarium, Chicago, Illinois] (gesture).  And there was a huge telescope there and the telescope was focused on Saturn.  And I got a chance, when I got to the front of the line to actually see Saturn through the telescope and all the rings and the moons around Saturn, and it just literally blew me away.  It was just a mind boggling experience.  'Cause, I mean, how many people have seen Saturn through a telescope, just like, it looks as close as the moon is, you know, when you get out at night, you know.  So that was, you know, real mind boggling.
Story_ID: 611800
Speaker 1: I continued to read a lot.  And one of the books I read had a real profound effect on me and it, and it gave me another life changing experience.  And this book was like, 'Think and Grow Rich' by Napoleon Hill.  And I don't know why I read the book because I'm not sure if I was interested in making money but the book had an effect on me that had nothing to do with money.  And oh, have you read 'Think and Grow Rich'?
Speaker 2: I've heard about it.
Speaker 1: You've heard about it, oh, yes, it's very, one of the most popular books other than the Bible that's ever been, been, been published.  You need to read it.  When I read it, Napoleon Hill went out and he interviewed successful people, and a lot of the successful people that existed, I think around the turn of the century.  And what he wanted to do was find out what was the common denominator of these successful people.  And his original book was actually called 'The Laws of Success' [sic. 'The Law of Success,' Napoleon Hill] because that's what he was getting at.  What is it that's with somebody that makes them successful, and what is common with these people that are in different fields but they're all successful.  So he developed 'The Laws of Success' but it was a, a huge volume and he condensed that down into 'Think and Grow Rich.'  What he realized was, was that it's how you think that makes you successful, and how you dream, and how you implement your dreams, and the fact that everything begins from a thought, and you can take that thought, and if you have the capacity to think about it, then you have the capacity to develop and realize it.  And this was the common denominator that he found amongst all these people.  Conditioned with the fact that the reason that a lot of people have those thoughts, but they don't realize their dreams, is because they have these fears.  And these fears that are common amongst everybody is what inhibits them from being successful.  So if you can control your fears and not let your fears control your life, and you can have the confidence that if you develop a thought, you have the capacity to accomplish that dream, then you're gonna be successful.  And that had a very profound effect on me.  So, and he has these exercises that you do along with the book and whatever.  So I sat down, and I can't remember if I sat down when I was in California or when I came back to Chicago [Illinois], and I said, I need to think about my life because as you say, I've had a million jobs.  So I've done a lot of stuff, nothing has been fulfilling, that have satisfied me intellectually, nor financially.  And I realized that I need to do something that I really enjoy, and that if I do something I enjoy, it will fulfill my life.
Story_ID: 611801
Speaker 1: --We talking about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, 'Think and Grow Rich'--
Speaker 1: 'Think and Grow Rich.'
Speaker 2: --by Napoleon Hill.  Now this--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: --how, now how did it turn your life around?
Speaker 1: Well what, what I did was I sat down, and it was either in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] or, or in Chicago [Illinois], I can't remember which, is that I needed to sit down and think about my life and what I've done and what is it that I really wanna do, and what is it that really brings me pleasure, and, and essentially, you know, that's it.  And how can I get a job that I can really enjoy and that's also gonna, you know, like pay me, you know, like a decent, you know, living.  So when I thought about it I said well, what do I like to do?  I like to bike ride, I like to play basketball, I like to run, maybe I should actually get a job as a phys ed instructor and a coach like I wanted to do years and years ago.  And I said I think that would be very, very fulfilling and I think I would really enjoy that and make a decent living.  So even though I didn't have a degree, I've had all these jobs, you know, where, where everybody else had a degree but me so I said, I think I can pull that off.  And reading 'Think and Grow Rich' gave me the confidence, or it helped let me know that if I think about it, then I can accomplish it.  So I put together a great resume, showed, you know, my education, my phys- my, my education that had to do with physical education, major in physical education and the courses I had taken, this and that and the other.  I think actually my first job was with the JCC [Hyde Park Jewish Community Center], is that down in 74th [sic. 1974]?  The--
Speaker 2: The Jewish Community Center?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jewish Community Center.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.  So I think I worked, yeah, I worked there first, and that's in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois].  I think they're still in operation.  And I supervised kids there that were doing, you know, physical--you know, like sports and whatever.  And I remember we had a, we had a roller rink.  I think the roller rink, I can't remember if that was in the Hyde Park YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] or in the community center, I can't remember actually where that roller rink was, but I had to supervise that roller rink.  And I had, you know, roller skated, I think in high school [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], we used to go down to St. Anselm's [St. Anselm's School] on 61st [Street] and, and Michigan [Avenue] and roller skate down there.  So I could roller skate, I always enjoyed roller skating.  And that was one of the jobs as a supervisor of the roller rink.  Never got a lot of kids in there, but I was able to roller skate every day, you know, so I really increased my roller skating skills.  But I was able to you, you know, teach the kids, you know, how to play basketball and baseball and this and that and the other, you know.  So I really enjoyed that job, it didn't pay a heck of a lot of money but then I was able to find out--the job at Francis Parker [Francis W. Parker School, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 611802
Speaker 1: Francis Parker [Francis W. Parker School, Chicago, Illinois] is a, a private school up on the North Side [Chicago, Illinois] at Webster [Avenue] and, and Clark Street.  And I had known about Francis Parker because one of my friends from high school [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], Boyce Brunson had attended Francis Parker.  So it was a private school, so I knew about it from Boyce and I think we had actually gone up to see him at Francis Parker there once or twice, you know.  So I--and [HistoryMaker] Prexy Nesbitt used to teach I think up at Francis and he might have even attended (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He still does, I think he still does.
Speaker 1: He still does, okay.  Did he actually, did he also attend Francis Parker when he was in school?
Speaker 2: I believe so, yeah.
Speaker 1: I think so, yeah.  I saw him last week and I meant to, to talk to him about that.  But so I went up there, put together a nice resume and if you looked at my resume you'd have thought I had a degree, even though it didn't say degree.  And I think in that part, I, I think I said, you know, I'm, I, I'm going to go back to school and get in whatever because I had, I had gone back to school in, in Springfield [Illinois] and I think I take some other, couldn't remember if I took some other classes in Michigan or had taken some in Chicago [Illinois] but I went twice and took some other classes.  So I had over two hundred hours, you know, of school, you know, it was just the fact that I technically didn't have that degree 'cause they wanted me to student teach, you know.  So I said well now that I'm, I, I'll get this job teaching, then that should qualify me for my student teaching.  So I got the job teaching phys ed [physical education].  Francis Parker is a private school from junior kindergarten through senior year high school.  I can't remember how many were in the school.  I think there were only like four hundred kids in the school, or four hundred elementary and three hundred in, in the high school or something.  But I know it was less than a thousand, it was less than seven hundred kids in, in the school, might, maybe it was like seven hundred and some, three hundred and four or some--three hundred, you know, for the high school, and four hundred for the elementary school or something like that.  But it was a very small school, a very progressive school.  I not only taught phys ed to like the, the younger kids and the older kids, but I coached baseball, I coached track, and I coached basketball.  My first basketball was to, I think seventh and eighth grade girls, then I did seventh and eighth grade boys, then I coached the junior varsity.  In track, I coached like the JV [junior varsity] track, we had a track there at the time, track is now taken down, unfortunately.  I think the track is down there.  But it was a great, great gig, I mean I really, really liked it.  I liked working with the kids.  I liked my boss.  My boss was actually Lil Lowry [Lillian Lowry] who you may not know Lil Lowry, but her husband was Bill Lowry [HistoryMaker William E. Lowry, Jr.].  Bill Lowry had one of the first, if not the first black television show, he hosted his own television show in Chicago ['Opportunity Line'].  Back, I think that show started in the '60s [1960s].  In fact, I know it started in the '60s [1960s] where Bill used to work, I think, for Inland Steel [Inland Steel Company].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And he had a job, it was a, some kind of employment program where he helped blacks get jobs and whatever.
Speaker 2: Is that 'Black Business Report' or something like that?  Or 'Black Business'--
Speaker 1: Something, something like that.
Speaker 2: We've interviewed him, he--
Speaker 1: You've interviewed Bill, okay, okay, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Jim Lowry [HistoryMaker James Lowry] and Bill Lowry.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right, right, exactly, they're brothers right, exactly, yeah.  So I had known about Bill from his television show and then when I met his wife who was my boss, then, you know, we did some things outside of work, so I got to know him personally, you know.  Great, great guy.  You know, both of 'em, you know, were really great.  And then later on, I don't know how this other guy came on and became the head of the department but, Igor Kazinski [ph.], this white Russian guy, but I can't remember, I can't remember if he took over from Lil or some politics or I can't remember, but Lil was my boss at a certain time and then Igor was, was my boss at another time.  I can't remember if Lil resigned or left or, or what.  But Igor was a big runner.  He jogged a lot.  So we actually ended up jogging two or three miles every day, you know, I think after school or something.  And I had started jogging at SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois], I think in the morning before class every day, we'd get up and I think we used to jog a mile or two.  And then with, with Igor, you know, we jogged two or three miles through Lincoln Park and the zoo [Lincoln Park Zoo, Chicago, Illinois] and whatever all the time.  So during lunchtime I played basketball with the kids, you know.  So we developed a real close, close relationship, you know.  One of the other track coaches, he left for Colorado one year, had tickets for DePaul basketball [DePaul Blue Demons] and left me the tickets, you know, so that's when they had like Dave Corzine and all the guys who went to all the basketball games.  So it was one of the best jobs that, you know, I've ever had.  So it was a lot of fun.  And it was around that time, it was one of my longest jobs too I guess like three years, you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 611803
Speaker 1: Yeah, now '77 [1977] seems like a pivotal kind of year in some ways because--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that's also when 'Roots' comes out.  Now this is like the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --fulfillment of--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --Alex Haley's story ['Roots: The Saga of an American Family'].
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And how did you do, do you remember your reaction to that, and how you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  In fact, it actually happened right before then.  I started teaching in '74 [1974] at Francis Parker [Francis W. Parker School, Chicago, Illinois].  The next year in '75 [1975], on Thanksgiving Day I'm at my mom's [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs] house, and, you know, she's having Thanksgiving dinner so all the, the relatives are coming by, her brothers and sisters are coming by and my grandparents are coming by and whatever.  And, you know, on Thanksgiving Day, you know, they're cooking food but you gotta wait until all the relatives get there before you can eat, you know.  And I'm like, kind of killing time waiting for the relatives to come and I'm reading the newspaper.  'Cause then, you know, I used to read the newspaper, I guess, like every day back then, you know.  So I was reading the Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times], we'd always read the Sun-Times, the Sun-Times was the liberal paper and the Tribune [Chicago Tribune] was, you know, the conservative paper.  But I was reading the Sun-Times and there's an article there about Thanksgiving and paying thanks to your ancestors and tracing your family tree.  Well this is Thanksgiving Day in 1975.  This is the first time I had heard about genealogy since '69 [1969] when Alex Haley was talking about it at SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois].  So I had this flashback, I said, gosh, I remember Alex Haley, and again I'm thinking of Alex Haley as, as the, the editor and author of 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' [Malcolm X and Alex Haley], and I'm saying, Alex had traced his family tree, and he was supposed to write a book on it, which he talked about when he spoke, but the book had never come out.  And he said, you know, he was supposed to work on a film, and the film had never come out.  So I didn't know what was up with that.  But this article talked about a book by the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America], and the article said you should interview your mom and dad or whatever.  So and the article was written by the, the president of the Chicago Genealogical Society [Chicago, Illinois], which I had never heard of them.  Virginia was her first name, I can't remember her last name--Virginia Meyer [Virginia M. Meyer], she was the president of the Chicago Genealogical Society.  So what I did was, after the holiday I went down to the Boy Scout store, which was downtown I think it was on Adam- Jackson [sic. Racine Avenue] and Adams [Street], I think it was.  Since I had been a Boy Scout, I knew where the Boy Scout store was and even after I was a Boy Scout I'd go down to Boy Scout store and buy camping equipment and stuff and buy books, the little merit badge books on all kinds of different things because when I wanted to learn something, you know, I always went back to the Boy Scouts.  So the article in the Sun-Times said the Boy Scouts had a merit badge book on gene- genealogy and they recommended getting it.  So I went down there and I got the merit badge book and it talked about starting off interviewing your relatives and it talked about going to the cemetery and it talked about looking at census records and that's about all it talked about.  So I started interviewing my mom and dad [Elmer Burroughs] and my grandparents on their family history.  And Larry [Larry Crowe], it just blew me away.  I got hooked from day one from talking to the relatives and getting these stories.
Story_ID: 611804
Speaker 1: I had, and again, this is before the book 'Roots' ['Roots: The Saga of an American Family,' Alex Haley] had come out and before the television miniseries ['Roots'], but, fortunately, I had attended Alex's lecture [at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois], so I knew about genealogy, I just didn't know exactly how to do it because Alex [Alex Haley] talked about his family, he didn't tell people how to do it and that's what I thought 'Roots' was gonna be about.  So the Boy Scout book did, so I interviewed my mom [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs], who didn't know very much about her family history because my mom was the baby of the family.  She said go talk to her older sister, my Aunt Doris [Doris Brooks].  So I talked to my Aunt Doris and she knew a lot about the family history.  She lived with a lot of the older people--my mom was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Her sisters and brother were all born in Pittsburgh.  My mom was the first one to relo- relocate to Chicago [Illinois].  So we would go back to Pittsburgh when I was little to see my grandparents [Lydia Terrell Brooks and Preston C. Brooks] that were still living in Pittsburgh and I had all these cousins there.  Well once I started doing genealogy, my Aunt Doris told me that we still had relatives that lived in Pittsburgh and I hadn't been to Pittsburgh since I was a little kid.  So she gave me some names of people that lived in a place called West Middlesex, Pennsylvania which is about thirty, forty miles northwest of Pittsburgh, near the Youngstown border--right across the border actually from Youngstown, Ohio.  Some of them I had remembered since I was a little kid, you know.  We still had relatives that lived in Pittsburgh.  We had relatives that lived in Wheeling, West Virginia.  We had relatives that lived in, in what they call Little Washington which was Washington, Pennsylvania, which was about thirty, forty miles southwest of Pittsburgh.  So I picked up all these names and all these relatives, as well as I started interviewing cousins, I mentioned we had a cousin lived on about 72nd [Street] either in--Cal- Calumet [Avenue] or Vernon [Avenue].  They were first cousins to, to my, my mother, Charlotte and--Charlotte Brugger [ph.] and Elwood Brugger [ph.].  And, you know, we had gone on picnics together and we had been by their house, they had been by my house, but I never thought about them in terms of interviewing them for the family history.  So I interviewed them, and Charlotte had told me that her grandfather was a Buffalo Soldier.  And I had heard about Buffalo Soldiers, but I didn't know exactly what they were or things about them, and she'd actually lived with them, you know, out in Nebraska and, and Wyoming, she actually grew up in Wyoming which I didn't realize.  So she told me about the relatives out there.
Speaker 2: And the name is Brugger?
Speaker 1: Brugger.
Speaker 2: B-R-U-G (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) B-R-U-G-G-E-R.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's why I'm, I'm wondering since you lived in the neighborhood if you had, had known about them because they had, we had five kids in our family, I think they had six kids in their family.  And they were all a little older than me, but, you know, a year here, two years there, four or five years there, you know.  So we weren't, you know, in large degree away from each other, but we were close enough that, you know, we could relate, you know, play sports at picnics and stuff like that, you know.  So I, I went back to Charlotte, found out information, found out that, you know, we had relatives that lived in, in Nebraska that I had never met, that we still had relatives that live in Nebraska that I had never met, you know.  My aunt gave me a lot of stories, both aunts gave me a lot of stories.  My mother's oldest sister, Margaret Ann [Margaret Brooks], gave me some stories.  Her other sister, Doris, gave me a few stories.  Her brother, I don't remember interviewing my mother's brother who shares my name, Preston Brooks [Preston S. Brooks], my, my middle name is Preston.  But each one gave me a little bit and a little piece there.  My dad [Elmer Burroughs] did not remember his grandparents, didn't know his grandparents' names.  You know, they died before he was born.  So he knew very little, he remembered we had some cousins that lived in, they worked at Tuskegee, he thought they taught at Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee University] in Tuskegee, Alabama.  He knew they were from the Carolinas but, but that was all.  His older brother, my Uncle Morris [Morris Burroughs], he remembered the cousins from down in Tuskegee, remembered she was a female, when she came to Chicago [Illinois] he had taken her out but couldn't remember her name.  Their sister [Irene Burroughs] remembered this cousin from Tuskegee, didn't remember her name.
Story_ID: 611805
Speaker 1: My Uncle Morris [Morris Burroughs] said that he remembered that, you know, some of our ancestors were, were Indians [Native American], said he, he remembered seeing a tomahawk around the house.  Never found no tomahawk, no connection with any Indians, you know.  My [paternal] grandmother [Alma Rice Burroughs] told me that, you know, her grandmother was part Indian.  Never found any connection, you know, with Indians, with, with my grandmother, you know.
Speaker 2: Now that's something just to chew on that for a second.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: That's something we hear every interview (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Every day, yes.
Speaker 2: Every interview--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --I conduct--
Speaker 1: Oh, every you--?  Yeah, that's, that's deep.
Speaker 2: When I ask people about their ancestors--
Speaker 1: Yes, right.
Speaker 2: --before they mention the fact, I guess, they think it's taken for granted they're African Americans or their A- part African, but they always say well, there's a Indian.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then if there're any white people they list those.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But they don't talk about--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --who the black ancestors were.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: They'll, they'll--they never mention it.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right, right.
Speaker 2: As if that's not really an important part of this lineage.
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 2: But everybody's got Indian.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: I mean, they say it.
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 2: But you found--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --in your own family, it wasn't really, really true?
Speaker 1: My grandmother told me that, my uncle told me that, and I believed it.  And I think as a black community, I think we all get those stories and we all believe it 'cause mama ain't gone lie to us, you know.  Not realizing that mama might not lie, but who says someone told mama the truth?  Who said the story was correct as it passed down from generation to generation to generation, you know?  One of the things that I do now when I speak around the country is if the question of, of how to trace Indians doesn't come up, or usually when it comes up, I often ask, who in the audience has Indian ancestry.  Ninety-five percent of the hands will be raised.  But then when I ask what name of the tribe, either A, nobody knows the name of a tribe, or let me go before that, what's the name of the Indian?  No one has an Indian name, but everybody says they had long straight hair and they had high cheek bones.
Speaker 2: Whatever that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I don't know what high cheek bones is, 'cause I look at a lot of folk, and I can't tell you what a high cheek bone is.  Now if you ask what tribe, 90 percent of the people that say they have Indian ancestry don't know a tribe.  Those 10 percent that do have a tribe, it's always Cherokee, Cherokee is the predominant, sometimes you hear, what, Choctaw.
Speaker 2: It's a lot of Mississippi--a lot of Choctaws--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in Mississippi or--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --there's a, there's a connection there I think in some ways.  But the--but here's one I hear I think that it's, it's unbelievable to me, people tell me in the--who were raised in the Southeast, and I say, what was the tribe, and they say Blackfeet.
Speaker 1: Blackfoot, right.
Speaker 2: Blackfoot.
Speaker 1: Right, very predominant.  Have you seen the research about Blackfoot?
Speaker 2: Blackfoot Indians are in the Northwest.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  Exactly.
Speaker 2: They're not even in the--
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 2: So it seems like a joke--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --name.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: But if the joke is on them they, they don't understand what the joke is (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly, exactly, exactly.  I, I run into Bla- I run into African Americans frequently that say they are Blackfoot Indians.  In fact, I've even incorporated that in one of my talks.  The Wall Street Journal ran into a, well shall I say, a journalist with The Wall Street Journal ran into a lot of African Americans said they have Blackfoot in this tree, and they were skeptical of it.  They did some research and find out that the Blackfoot were up in upper western Montana bordering on Canada, had never ever lived in any proximity close to black people, ever.
Speaker 2: I think York is the last one they saw up in--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --up in the, up in the bitter roots of Lewis and Clark [Meriwether Lewis and William Clark], you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And I don't think York went that far north, I don't think he went that far north.
Speaker 2: Maybe not, he, you know--yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right, right, exactly, exactly.

Speaker 1: When I started researching my [paternal] grandmother's [Alma Rice Burroughs] grandmother, my great-great-grandmother, who's from Virginia, who was born in the 1850s if I remember correctly, and started doing some research on Indians, I found out that the Indians in Virginia had been so far removed prior to 1850 it was unbelievable.  It was no way in creation she could have been connected to any Native American Indian.  Then when I started doing research on these quote, quote five civilized tribes, you know, the Cherokee, the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminoles, and whatever, found out that they all had constitutions that prohibited their members from marrying blacks, and they also owned slaves.  I said, there's some kind of disconnect there.  I also thought it was very odd that blacks would all have some kind of knowledge of Indian, but they had no knowledge of their black ancestors, which would be more important, would be more significant, had no knowledge of their ancestors that served in the Civil War, which was after the period that their ancestors would have some connections with Indians, and the Civil War being such a, an important climatic part of the history of the U.S., and played such an important role in the black community, you'd think that they had, would have some kind of, of stories that were passed down from the Civil War.  I had none, found out I've had at least three ancestors that served in the Civil War.  I found out I had an ancestor that served in the War of 1812 and that was not passed down from generation to generation.  So I found there was a disconnect between (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was that a ancestor in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 1: Pardon me?
Speaker 2: Was that ancestor in Pittsburgh that served--
Speaker 1: He wasn't in Pittsburgh, but he was in Pennsylvania.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well he, he was from Virginia, but he relocated after the War of 1812 and settled in, into Western Pennsylvania into Fayette County.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I, I--
Speaker 2: 'Cause I know that John Vashon [John B. Vashon] of Pittsburgh, the barber, in the 1800s was a, a world, I mean, War of 1812--
Speaker 1: War, yeah, yeah, yeah, there's quite a, quite a few.  And, in fact, my ancestors served in the Battle of Lake Erie.  And in Erie, Pennsylvania, where the ship, the flagship is there, there's a museum.  And, and Pennsylvania has a, a marker program for African American historic sites throughout Pennsylvania.  So there's a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's Blockson's, Blockson's i- right.
Speaker 1: Say what?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Charles Blockson I think came up with that idea.
Speaker 1: Maybe he did, maybe he did.  I know it's been going on for, for a long time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's Blockson's idea.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.  It's a great, great program.  They have a, a, a monument there to blacks that fought in the Battle of Lake Erie.  I was gonna go to the dedication, but it was the same weekend as the dedication in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] for the monument of blacks who fought in the Civil War [African American Civil War Memorial].  I had already made plans to go to the one in D.C. and those happened to be the same weekend, and I tried at the last minute to go to both and I just couldn't go to both.  Subsequently, I was very disappointed in the monument there at Erie because they talk about the blacks that fought in the [U.S.] Navy in the Battle of Lake Erie.  My ancestor, Charles Smothers, served on the Flagship Niagara [USS Niagara], in the Battle of Lake Erie with Commodore Perry [Oliver Hazard Perry] but he was not in the Navy.  He was in the [U.S.] Army.  And they have neglected those ones that weren't in the Navy (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 611807
Speaker 1: In this discussion you raise several problems in researching black ancestry and s- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --common, I guess, misdirects--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that people fall into.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But there's a, there must be some reason why everybody jump- when you ask them who they are, they jump to the Indian [Native American] thing.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And they say that, "My grandmother had long hair."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Or, "She knew all the herbs and, and flowers in the forest, and in the fields, and she could make teas out of the roots," and stuff like that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Something that, you know, well there were a lot of people in the (unclear) could do that, including Africans and Europeans as well--
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: --you know, that, they were, that grew--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --were raised in that kind of environment.
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: Plus the, the pharmacy industry was not as developed back then.
Speaker 1: And they say, you know, that's, that's the kind of thing they say.  Then, this Blackfoot thing.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Which seems like a, I mean, it seems, it's a, it's like a, it's almost like a joke that--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --you know, it's Blackfoot, to say well the Blackfeet were in--up in--
Speaker 2: Right, right, exactly.
Speaker 1: But these are, this is what you always hear.  And you never, you're right, you never hear anybody say, or very seldom hear anybody talk about the Civil War's aftermath, and I ask people, and then, you know, after almost seven hundred of these, I mean, it really becomes profound, you ask 'em like, do you have any stories from Reconstruction or the Civil War passed down in your family?  What was your family doing when the slaves were freed?  Any--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --story about that?
Speaker 2: Right, right, no.
Speaker 1: It's almost zip, nothing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Maybe 5 percent of people have any kind of story.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, um-hm.  And see, in speaking around the country and teaching genealogy for fifteen years, I've grown to realize there's a big myth that there's strong oral history in the black community.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And that's a myth.  There is no strong oral history in the black--there is an isolated situation, like you say maybe 5 percent have had stories that are passed down, that are significant, that have a large degree of truth into it, but for the most part, you know, we don't have stories that were passed down, you know.  And it's really very, very sad, you know.  And I think that because there were oral historians in Africa, so called griots and whatever, in certain parts of Africa, and because of the fact that as slaves we were prohibited legally from reading, from writing, from going to school, so we had to have a lot of oral communication by the laws and the nature of society, and then because of the fact that even in the aftermath of slavery that our education was not as prevalent, it was not as good, it was not the quality education that you received in the white community.  I think this whole thing developed that we have this oral history because we're not a intellectual people, you know.  But that, that's a real, real myth, you know.  In terms of the Indian thing, which I've thought about a lot, my theory on it is, is that in the late 19th century and the early 20th century, when segregation was legal from Plessy versus Ferguson, 18--what--'96 [Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896], because the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] was very prevalent, because lynching was the law of the land, and that black folks could be lynched at the drop of a hat because blacks could not work in Corporate America.  Black people, or shall I say (air quotes) colored people and Negroes and niggers were on the low rung of the totem pole.  And there was no black pride movement.  I mean, there were, there were a few blacks when you look at like Carter Woodson [Carter G. Woodson] and W.E. Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] and, and, and Booker T. [Booker T. Washington] and a few people that were into doing some kind of research on who back people were, but on the, on the majority part, people did not wanna be colored.  They did not wanna associate with black people at all.  Those people that were very light skinned passed for white.  Those that weren't, they wanted to do everything they could to show that they weren't black because black was a bad word, you know.
Speaker 1: You could get people to fight by calling them--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Calling someone black was fighting words, yeah, no doubt about it, you know.  People put stuff in their hair to straighten their hair, you know.
Story_ID: 611808
Speaker 1: And I think what happened was as a defense mechanism, so they could survive in the society, that if people weren't as light skinned as those that could pass and they were like, you know, my complexion or whatever, they'd say, well, I'm part Puerto Rican, or, I'm part Native American Indian, you know.  And that helped them survive in the community because they weren't like all black which was the lowest rung in the totem pole.  And I mentioned this once to [HistoryMaker] Warner Saunders and Warner Saunders said his mother [Georgia Saunders] told him the same thing and said if you were part Indian you could get a job, you know.  So I said yeah, well that really, really makes sense.  So I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Do--well go, go ahead, finish this (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I think that sometime in the latter part of the 19th century or the early part of the 20th century, that black people said they were part Indian just so they could survive, maybe to get a job or whatever.  And they just said that and at some point in time, people started believing it, I guess once it started passing down from generation to generation, you know.  But then in, in many cases, didn't have a shred of truth to it, you know.  And it's something that I've been wanting to research more to see when this started to develop, and, and why it started to develop, you know.
Speaker 2: Now, I'm going to take it a little bit deeper even.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this is scary ground here.  'Cause I think people are ashamed, have deep shame about some of this--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and that's the fact that many of our, our, our mothers and grandmothers and aunts and great-aunts and so forth, and in some cases today even sisters, you know, worked or did, doing day work in white homes--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and so forth in place and, and at the beginning of the century, they couldn't come home--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you know, they would live--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --there was a movement (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I had a great-grandmother lived in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in a white family.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: They had to live in.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, absolutely.
Speaker 2: And they would come back home sometimes with babies that are much lighter than--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you would guess they would be.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: And, you know, we guess the circumstances, if we believe that all white men are honorable then I can stop this discussion right now.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, what I mean?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: So this is stuff that that, you know, we've always--the tendency in society is to blame the woman--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --no matter what the situation is--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --for children out of wedlock or--
Speaker 1: Sure, sure.
Speaker 2: --or children out of, you know.
Speaker 1: Sure, exactly, yeah.
Speaker 2: But I mean, that's a tough thing for people to deal with, I think.
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Absolutely, no doubt about it.
Speaker 2: So an Indian becomes a convenient--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know (unclear).
Speaker 1: That's true, I hadn't thought about it in that aspect but, but you're probably right, you're probably right.  And which also leads to another thing is that there's a lot of stories, I wouldn't say there's a lot of stories, but you get stories that that say this ancestor was the, had a relationship with the slave owner, you know, and, you know, she was light skinned, but you never, the thing I often countered with is that the slave owner often gets blamed, but you have no knowledge of what the overseer was doing.
Speaker 2: Or the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And the overseer had more--
Speaker 2: --farm hands or--
Speaker 1: Right, exactly.
Speaker 2: --or any number of people--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --the shore stop--shopkeeper and--
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 2: --the, the--
Speaker 1: And in most cases they had more access than the owner did.  Because sometimes the owner was an absentee owner or sometimes the owner, you know, they were doing whatever they were doing, but the overseer and people that are working in the fields had much greater access to black women than a slave owner did.  But how often, how many times, and I'm saying that the thirty years I've been doing genealogy, I have never heard once about their ancestor had a relationship with, with the overseer, you know.  But I've read many cases where it talks about relationships with overseers, you know.  But, you know, there's that whole disconnect.  But I'm saying this to say I hadn't thought about the point that you raised that our ancestors that had to live in as a housekeeper and as a domestic servant, the relationship that she might have developed that was beyond what she wanted to develop and the product coming from that relationship, you know.  I don't know if anybody's ever explored that.  That that is--
Speaker 2: Well I think there are plenty of stories.  I know I can go to my family for some of the stories.  And--
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure, sure.
Speaker 2: --there are, I think there are plenty stories, there are things I never thought about after I, you know, especially after doing this job, and you hear everybody's, oh, so wait a minute--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --maybe, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 611809
Speaker 1: We raise a lot of--so genealogy as a pursuit is--just from the, you know, the fire we can stir up in this little conversation (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I mean it raises a lot of--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --questions.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: It raises a lot of questions (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely, absolutely.  Oh, yeah, no doubt about it.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: 'Cause see the, other thing that that that I work with a lot is oral history.  Like this project here, I mean, I've done a lot of research into, to slave narratives from the WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration], as well as those that are outside the WPA.  Now you hear a lot about the WPA ex-slave narratives that were done in the late '30s [1930s], early '40s [1940s] because that's the largest collection.  But most people that even know about that don't realize that there are six thousand narratives that were done outside the WPA which is much, much larger (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now who conducted those, I mean, or, or what different groups conducted those?
Speaker 2: Well it was much more fractionalized.  But a lot of abolitionists during slavery once--Africans, you know, came up through the quote quote Underground Railroad or whatever were liberated, they were often interviewed by abolitionists and their accounts were published in newspapers because they wanted to talk about the horrors of slavery to let people know that, you know, this slavery thing is, is, is really terrible.  The best way to do that is to get some firsthand stories of people that escaped out of that, you know.  So Frederick Douglass', you know, like books and, and his lectures and whatever is just like the tip of the iceberg, you know.  But oftentimes when, when, when people were able to get away, they told those stories that were published in newspapers, and pamphlets and other things, so that's where the genre actually started.  But Marion Wilson Starling did her dissertation ['The Slave Narrative: Its Place in American History'] on, on slave narratives which was eventually published by Howard University Press [Washington, D.C.].  And here she documents all the different organizations and individuals that had done interviews, you know, with ex-slaves.  As well as now, I think, it's the University of North Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] is trying to capture all of those that were done, I think, they said prior to 1920, because there were narratives that were done with Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee], there were narratives done with Hampton University [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], and those were actually published as part of the WPA even though they weren't done during the WPA.  But when George P. Rawick decided to commercially publish the WPA narratives, he included the narratives from Fisk, from Hampton, and it was one other institution that had done some interviews during the 1920s, and he included those in 'The American Slave: A Composite Autobiography' which is the commercial version of the WPA narratives.  North Carolina wanted to do all the other ones and, I guess, they know about the six thousand that Marion Wilson Starling had identified and try to not only transcribe those but actually put those on the web.  So those are, are being placed on the web.  I don't know how many are on the web now but they're trying to do all the ones that were done prior to the 1920s because I think with the WPA in the late 1930s and 1940s and the ones from Fisk and Hampton from the 1920s, I think those probably encompass all the ones that were done from 1920 forward, the University of North Carolina is trying to do the ones from 1920 all the way backward, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is a lot of material.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's huge--
Speaker 1: And for one--
Speaker 2: --huge.
Speaker 1: --one stretch of about fifteen years at every February I'd read nothing but slave narratives.  I mean, like it was a inexhaustible supply of 'em.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, no doubt about it.
Speaker 1: John Blassingame's last book I think was 'Slave--' (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, right, right, 'Slave Testimony' ['Slave Testimony: Two Centuries of Letters, Speeches, Interviews, and Autobiographies'].
Speaker 1: 'Slave Testimony.'
Speaker 2: 'Slave Testimony,' right.
Speaker 1: About the size of a telephone book.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And he documents a lot of 'em, right, that are not in the WPA, you know, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Dorothy Sterling had a book ['We Are Your Sisters: Black Women in the Nineteenth Century,' ed. Dorothy Sterling]--
Speaker 2: Oh, she sure did, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she had a book of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --I forget the name of it now, but she had a book of--
Speaker 2: Right.  But I think hers might have come from--
Speaker 1: --compiled--
Speaker 2: --the WPA though.
Speaker 1: Some may have, but I think she had some that were--
Speaker 2: That were outside of that?
Speaker 1: --done by abolitionists and stuff back--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --way back.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, the, what the criticism of, of the defenders of the South, you know, (unclear) they would say that, of course, these narratives are written by abolitionists, people that wanted to--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --get rid of slavery so--
Speaker 2: Right, sure.
Speaker 1: --they're gonna exaggerate the--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --horrors of slavery--
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: --to make a point.  You know, and (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Sure, sure, sure, sure.  And in some cases there were some, some funny kind of editing done to some of those too, you know.
Story_ID: 611810
Speaker 1: I guess the bottom line on that discussion, I saw someone wrote and said that hardly any of them would wanna be a slave, I mean--
Speaker 2: Right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) nobody wants to be one--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but everybody thinks it's all right, everybody who defends it says it's all right--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --for other people.
Speaker 2: Right, right, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: It's better, they argue the slave was better off than the northern--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --industrial workers and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But none of them wanted (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Well the, the, the other part of oral history, I--since, you know, I, I do oral histories, you know, I've interviewed, you know, many of my relatives, I've worked with some clients, you know, and done some interviews, you know, for clients, as well as study academically oral histories, and use them for research purposes, but I've also looked at, looked into the strengths and weaknesses of oral histories.  And, and, and one of the studies I had seen, I think there was a anthropology professor [Barbara G. Hoffman] from Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] had actually gone over to Africa and had interviewed some griots, and interviewed many, many, griots to try to get an understanding of how you become a griot, how you do your job, how far they can go back, what's the quality of the information that they actually receive, you know, and just what kind of, of details do they capture.
Speaker 1: Now let's, let's just for the sake of, I guess, of the education of whoever is watching this, what is a griot and--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --where does that word come from or what are we talking about?
Speaker 2: Good.  Griot is actually a French term, and it's for a, a person whose profession is a oral historian.  And the griots that I'm familiar, were basically from West Africa, although there is a oral tradition in East Africa also that were similar to oral historians in West Africa.  I would not attempt to say that oral historians are universal to Africa because as we know Africa is not a country, it's a continent made up of several countries, and, and many, many different tribes and peoples, and whatever.  But in certain areas of Africa there are oral historians and their job through life is supposed to keep the oral history of that community or that village or whatever.  And they train for that by being an apprentice, working with an elder who's an oral historian, and, and, and just learning the stories and how they do their craft and whatever.  And some of them are actually musicians in addition to oral historians, work, you know, kind of like in conjunction with each other, excuse me.  And the other term that's used is call djeli, I think it's, I don't--I can't remember if you pronounce it jeli but it's--
Speaker 1: Djeli, (pronunciation) djeli, I think it's djeli, I think, when you, well Muntu Dance Theatre [Muntu Dance Theatre of Chicago] when they sing the song 'Lamban' [ph.]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I think it's about, they, it's about a, it's to a djeli, you know, they could--they, they call them djeli, djeli, yeah--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --djeli, I don't know if it's djeli well, you know, the pronounc- but, yeah, it's, it's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --usually D-J-E-L-I, right?
Speaker 2: D-J?
Speaker 1: D-J-E-L-I, I think, that's the way they spell it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I've always seen it pronounced with a J--I mean, spelled with a J.
Speaker 1: With a J?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I thought the pronunciation was something like djeli or dje- djeli or something like that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know.  But I can be wrong on the, on the pronunciation but we're both in sync about that.  And I think that's the African term, actually, at least from West Africa.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the different groups of, all along the Guinea Coast, the ones the French came in contact with first, the people, the Mandinkas and the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Songhais and the people like that, you know.
Speaker 2: Right, right, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: Bamabaras, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 611811
Speaker 1: I don't know what they call 'em in East Africa.  I know in Ethiopia there're oral historians, but I don't know, I can't remember technically what they call them in East Africa, you know.  Or if it was done outside of, of, of Ethiopia.  But Ethiopia is the only example I really know.  'Cause a friend of mine, you know, was Ethiopian, and there was an oral historian that that could remember back in their family like twelve generations.  But I don't know if they remembered--I don't know, how broad it was in, in terms of, of, of, of knowing the whole history of the whole village or whether they just do family lineages or whatever, you know, I don't know.  I need to see if I can find out more about that.  But this Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] professor [Barbara G. Hoffman] who, who went to Africa, to, to research and interview, you know, these griots found out that they, the extent of their knowledge going backward, I think went back maybe 120, 130 years.  But the further they went back, the more general their knowledge base went.  So it was like--and the more mythological it started to become.  So that you had, you know, the names of rulers, and kings, and queens, or whatever tribal--elders, and the military generals, and, and whatever, they didn't call 'em military generals but they were the, the ones that, you know, were the great warriors and whatever.  So as you went back past a hundred years, it's like, you know, they didn't have any knowledge of the common everyday people that lived in the village (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  For instance, the song of Sundiata that's been published numerous times of--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --Sundiata, (Unclear), he, he, you know, how he is, the whole myth around him being, you know, part of a conquered people--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --I think there was this big battle with Sumanguru, with lightning bolts and (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Right, exactly.
Speaker 2: You know, that kind of stuff, you know.
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 2: But, I guess the current--the, the--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --the more current you get the less lightning bolts and, and that sort of thing, you know, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right, yeah, yeah.  And, and that's when I also learned that events sometimes turn into myths, you know.  I mean you have very large, important stories, whatever, and then it's passed down from generation to generation and it seem like it's embellished as it goes on.  And then all of a sudden it just becomes almost totally mythological, you know.
Speaker 2: Can you imagine describing Ali [Muhammad Ali], maybe a thousand years from now like that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 2: --they said he could float like a butterfly--
Speaker 1: Exactly (laughter).
Speaker 2: --he, he had a stinger, you know, he had a stinger, he could actually, you know.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Exactly.  And that's exactly what'll happen, exactly what'll happen, yeah.
Story_ID: 611812
Speaker 1: So by being in genealogy and, and, and studying all different aspects of it, you understand or you come to learn that even though oral history is important, but there's inherent weaknesses in oral history.  So applying that with this whole thing about us being Indians [Native American] and whatever, you see that there's some logic disconnects.  So you see that there's a difference between oral history and reality.
Speaker 2: Especially Blackfoot and that stuff but--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Now here's something though.  In my--my in-laws are LeFlores [ph.] from Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there's a lot 'em--
Speaker 1: There's a Flor- Leflore, it's Leflore County [Mississippi] there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Leflore County.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And Leflore County is named for, for Greenwood LeFlore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Who was a Choctaw Indian.  He was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --part white and part Choctaw.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And he owned a huge plantation.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: And the, the relatives--my, I think, my ex-wife's grandfather--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --nickname was Choctaw.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Wow.
Speaker 2: Now that doesn't mean, that's not an Indian name necessarily--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --I mean, it's a, but it's--you know, it's, and, and it's not a specific Indian name--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but it's the name of the whole group but--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --it's a, and LeFlo--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but there's some kind of connection--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --there you would think but I don't know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: I mean, there are a lot of, but--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --Greenwood LeFlore owned a lot of people at one time.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yeah, I believe it.
Speaker 2: You know, so--
Speaker 1: I believe it, I believe it, I believe it, yeah.
Speaker 2: So what all that boils down to we don't know but--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --we have to like--you know.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Well what's amazing to me is the fact that black folks are more likely to be slaves of Indian versus having relationships with Indians, you know.  And see how many, how many people do you run into that have the oral histories passed out where my ancestors were slaves to Indians.
Speaker 2: Now, now--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but then, then there's, I think there are, I guess the, if there's any documentation for this relationship at all, you know on a large scale it would probably be the, the Seminoles and the Creeks, right?  Unless--
Speaker 1: Well, in Oklahoma, they had the Dawes Rolls.  And the Dawes Rolls were official government records when they were deciding upon the land allotments, you know, after, or in the process of Oklahoma becoming a state, where they had to declare, you know, if they were a tribe and if they were, you know, what percentage of the tribe they were and all this and that and the other.  So that's the primary documentation, you know, or the best documentation.  I wouldn't use the word best documentation, but that is some documentation as to the relationship of blacks with Indians.  Now there's, you know, a lot more.  What a lot of people don't realize is--because a lot of people that don't understand historical research, don't understand genealogy research, don't realize that the Bureau of Indian Affairs has volumes and volumes of, of information, you know.  But for some of it you gotta be able to read, you know, Indian languages, you know.  And you gotta know where this stuff exists, and you gotta know where to interpret it, and you gotta know how, how to research it, and this and that and the other, you know.  But there is, you know, at the National Archives [National Archives and Records Administration] there's just, just tons and tons of information, but most people, you know, have no idea how to access that.
Story_ID: 611813
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then the other part of the Indian [Native American] thing, well I mean, look at the work of J.A. Rogers [Joel Augustus Rogers] and then William Loren Katz, Jewish guy--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --out of New York [New York], he had written like about blacks and Indians and some of the, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well the, well the best historian is like Daniel Littlefield.  Daniel Littlefield did, did histories of blacks and I think it was either four or five of those civilized tribes, you know.  He's much more academic than Loren Katz is, you know, his stuff is, at least the stuff I've seen that he's done.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Katz is self trained.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: And from what I understand.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's makes sense.
Speaker 1: So is Rogers--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for the most part.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, absolutely, yeah.
Speaker 1: But they--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --they, I know Rogers claimed Osceola, you know, are the--
Speaker 2: Oh, did he?
Speaker 1: --Seminoles was was black or part black and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, there are other, there are pictures and, you know, Katz even says that the, the BIA often would separate in Oklahoma--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the black Indians from the rest of them.  If you were like--if you were an Indian, you could get Bureau of Indian Affairs money--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --unmixed Indian.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: If you were part white and part Indian you could get it.  But if you were--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --part black and Indian--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --then no money for you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I've heard there was a lot of exclusion there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: In fact there's a court case, just came up just recently about that, you know.
Speaker 1: So you couldn't be one--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --on that level.  And then there's the--oh, there's another, it's a group, the group out in Connecticut, the Pequots--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --would have--who have Afros, they clearly show (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, right, exactly.
Speaker 1: --you know, but, but nobody, but as you said--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --nobody claims to be a Pequot though.  They don't--nobody says (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, they have some.  I had a client that did, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yeah.
Speaker 1: But hardly anybody, if you ask them about their ancestors, says there's part Pequot, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: They, they come up with Blackfoot or Cherokee.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a--
Speaker 2: Well it's those, some of those, those old Connecticut, you know, New England families, you know.  'Cause there's, there, there, there are some blacks out there that have remained in that area, you know, in New England that never left, you know.  And they have, you know, some kind of connections or reported, reputed connections, you know.  'Cause there was a, I know a guy here who I had as a, as a client, had Pequots, and I had known about the Pequots, I guess probably from the casinos and that had, it was a lot of publicity on that.  And then he said that his family was tied in to there, you know.  But you don't, like, again, you don't hear, you don't hear it a lot in the Midwest or in the South.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now if you were up in New England you'd probably hear about it a little more, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 611814
Speaker 1: We got kind of off the chronology (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A little sidetracked, yeah, right, right.
Speaker 1: But, but this is a good discussion.
Speaker 2: Sure, oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: But now, back to the chronology, so in '77 [1977], you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --'Roots' comes on.  Now what--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --but do you have a critique of--I mean, when did you first really get some serious training in genealogy, I guess?
Speaker 2: Well what happened was in '75 [1975] when I got started, I got started from, from the Boy Scout book.  And then I actually joined the Chicago Genealogical Society [Chicago, Illinois].  And I went to a lot of their meetings, used to meet up at, at Newberry Library [Chicago, Illinois].  And so some of my research, my early research was done at Newberry Library.  The National Archives [National Archives and Records Administration], which has a lot of the excellent records for doing genealogy, headquartered in Washington, D.C., but they have like thirteen branches around the United States, and one of the branches here in Chicago [National Archives at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] over on 74th [Street] and Pulaski [Road].  So I would go over to the National Archives to do research in census records.  However, at that time back in '75 [1975], '76 [1976], the National Archives branch on Pulaski did not have all of the census records, so I could only research some of them there.  Other ones I had to go in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] to the Center for Research and Libraries [sic. Center for Research Libraries].  The Center (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now that's--let me just--
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Oh, I just had to put on brakes here.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's--how do you get in there?  I've, I mean, I've known about that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and the stuff they have--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but I've never been able to get in because you have to be, who do you have to be to get in, in the Center for Research Libraries?
Speaker 2: Well the, the Center for Research in Libraries is a, is a consortium.  And I think it's just for Midwest schools, I could be wrong, but I know it's for Midwest schools, you know, it's, it's on the campus of University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  And I know University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], and I think it's broader than just the Big Ten [Big Ten Conference].  I can't remember how many schools participate in the consortium.
Speaker 1: But if you're an average person, if you're a person like me, I'm not affiliated with one--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --of the schools--
Speaker 2: You can get in.
Speaker 1: It's right, it's right on like 56th [Street] and Cottage Grove [Avenue] I think or something like that, or, or around that area?
Speaker 2: That was, that was the old place.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they've relocated now and they're on six- I think, it's 60th, around 60th [Street] and University [Avenue].  Right, 'cause they're right north of, of 61st [Street].  And I think they're on University.  If they're not on University, on one, on one of those streets close to Woodlawn [Avenue].  But you're right, originally they were over on Cottage Grove, but then they relocated and got new facilities and whatever.  What it is, it's set up for universities.  Let's say, you're a library at University of Michigan.  Let's say you have like $5 million for acquisitions--or operation and acquisitions for your library, whatever.  Let's say you wanna acquire a lot of stuff but your acquisition budget is not large enough.  Well, you take a percentage of your money and you put that money into a pool of other universities.  So that pool buys all these other resources that you cannot afford to buy yourself, as your institution.  So therefore, you can go to the Center for Research and Libraries and then you can borrow materials at your library when you need them.  So it's a consortium of all these, these libraries.  But the public has access to it, you know.  And I don't know how I found out about it.  I guess it was probably from talking to other genealogists, realizing that all the census records were not at the National Archives, and I think that was the only place that we could go to look at these census records.  So census records was just one of the groups of records they had there, but they had all of these other huge volumes of records. And then I found out that they have all these other records there too.
Story_ID: 611815
Speaker 1: I would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So it's accessible to the general public now?
Speaker 1: It is.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I know at one time I tried--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and they said if you're not offici- associated--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --with the university.  Maybe I should have said I was (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, I hear you, I hear you.
Speaker 2: I couldn't get in.
Speaker 1: I, you know, I had been going there for so long, I can't remember, you know, how I actually got in originally.  But I've been there recently, I think I was there like last year, and I still had some access.  I don't remember giving them any special qualifications or whatever.  I know in genealogy some of the research we do is in private libraries, historical societies, all kinds of different places.  And some of 'em, do state, you have to have a (air quotes) quote, quote legitimate reason to use this facility, you know.  Some of them say, you know, well that legitimate reason is being a genealogist.  Some of 'em frown upon genealogists, you know.  You go in and just say you're a historian or whatever.  But there's not a lot of places like that but there are some places that do try to restrict access.  And I think it's more so, like, say if you go to Vivian Harsh collection [Vivian G. Harsh Research Collection Reading Room, Carter G. Woodson Regional Library, Chicago, Illinois] over on 95th [Street] and Halsted [Street], unfortunately there's a lot of school kids in there, you know, working on a paper for Black History Month, you know.  They're not what we would consider serious scholars looking for manuscript records and stuff, you know, or working on a article for a scholarly journal or working on a, on a book or something, you know.  So I think some places try to restrict access so they have people that are used to, you know, looking at manuscript materials and are doing (air quotes) quote, quote something scholarly, you know.
Speaker 2: Maybe take better care of 'em (unclear).
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely, absolutely, yeah.  And they know how to use finding aids, you know, and how to do more sophitica- sophisticated, sophisticated kind of research and they're not going to use as much time to the staff there because they have limited staff, you know, and this and that and the other, you know.  Unfortunately, there's not that many places like that but there are, there are some around.  So I would go to Newberry Library [Chicago, Illinois], I'd go to Center for Research and Libraries [sic. Center for Research Libraries, Chicago, Illinois], and I would go to the National Archives [National Archives at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  And I guess probably from going to Newberry Library, I learned about books on how to do genealogy that were more sophisticated than the Boy Scout book.  So I read all the books that had to do with, with how to do genealogy that were all written by white folks.  So I learned a lot of sophisticated techniques of doing genealogy and how to do genealogy properly, how to document your sources and, and all these sources that existed and et cetera, that were written by all the top genealogists going back--

Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your name for us?
Speaker 2: Tony Burroughs [HistoryMaker Anthony "Tony" Preston Burroughs].
Speaker 1: And we are continuing an inter- an interview that we started I think in June, followed up on in August, and now this is our third session, correct?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I believe, so.
Speaker 1: And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is, what's today--the 13th of October?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  It's the 12th.
Speaker 2: Oh, is it--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's the 12th, yeah.
Speaker 2: It's the 12th, okay.  The 12th of October, okay, 2005.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're at The HistoryMakers at 1900 South Indiana Avenue in Chicago, Illinois, in America.
Speaker 1: All right.  It's on actually South Michigan [Avenue].
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Did, what did I say?
Speaker 1: It's Mich- Indiana.
Speaker 2: Oh, did I say Indiana?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, wow.  Sorry, I meant Michigan (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We don't wanna mislead those future generations that--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, exactly.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 611817
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I think we left you in 1977.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we were talking about 'Roots' coming out and--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you were talking, you had started like--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --yeah, doing genealogical research in '75 [1975], actually, actually.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: But tell us about, I think you mentioned it before but we'll just put this in a chronological context, and tell us about the thou- the three week genealogy workshop at the National Archives [National Institute on Genealogical Research] and James Dent Walker.
Speaker 2: Right.  In, when I started in '75 [1975], I read an article in the Chicago Sun-Times written by the president of the Chicago Genealogical Society [Virginia M. Meyer].  And that talked about a book by the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America], so I went out and got the book.  And subsequently started interviewing my mom [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs], my dad [Elmer Burroughs], my relatives, grandparents, going out east, you know, interviewing relatives there.  I also joined the Chicago Genealogical Society [Chicago, Illinois] and learned techniques on, on how to do research that were more advanced that what was in the Boy Scout book that was in the article in the Sun-Times.  So probably with going to meetings at the Chicago Genealogical Society, and also going to the National Archives, there's a branch of the National Archives [National Archives at Chicago] on 74th [Street] and Pulaski [Road] here in Chicago [Illinois], I learned about this institute.  The institute was three weeks long at the National Archives, sponsored by the National Archives [National Archives and Records Administration] and I think it was American University [Washington, D.C.].  And the way it was structured was that you would attend for three weeks, and you'd learn how to do genealogy during the day, and then you'd research your own family in the evenings.  And archivists from the National Archives would give lectures.  Archivists from state archives around the country would give lectures.  Professional genealogists and authors, you know, would give lectures.  So we learned all the nuances of how the National Archives worked.  We also went to the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] and learned how the Library of Congress worked.  We went to the Daughters of American Revolution library [Daughters of the American Revolution Library], which was in Washington [D.C.], learned how that worked.  So it was a lot of sophisticated techniques and learning how to do genealogy.
Story_ID: 611818
Speaker 1: We also had two side trips, you could choose either going to the state archives of Virginia [Library of Virginia] in Richmond [Virginia], or going to the state archives in Pennsylvania [Pennsylvania State Archives] in Harrisburg [Pennsylvania].  Since I had ancestors from Pennsylvania then I went to the state archives in, in Harrisburg.  One of the lecturers there was James Dent Walker who specialized in military records, he supervised the military records division at the National Archives [National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, D.C.] for twenty years.  He actually worked at the National Archives for thirty years who's--happened to be African American.  And when the, when genealogical societies had meetings and workshops and conferences and they would contact the National Archives to have a spokesman sent out, then Jimmy Walker would be the spokesperson that would go out and he would give lectures and represent the National Archives.  So he was really the, the face of the National Archives out in the field.  So I had read about him and learned that he not only was a specialist in military records but also a specialist in African American genealogy.  So I corresponded with him, I believe, in 1966.  And then in 1977--in fact, actually I was supposed to go to Europe that summer, I was teaching school at Francis Parker [Francis W. Parker School, Chicago, Illinois], and the headmaster at the school had planned a bicycle trip to Europe.  And so we were gonna fly in I think to Luxembourg or, or, or Frankfurt [Germany] or somewhere and ride around France for like six weeks and just do a tourist thing.  And it was one other brother besides myself who was a teacher there at the school was, was scheduled to make the trip.  He dropped out and then, you know, I started getting a little cold feet wondering, you know, if I wanted to ride around rural France, you know, (laughter) for six weeks.  And then I, I, I decided that, well, maybe I would fly in with them to Luxembourg and then go into Paris [France] and then spend the rest of my time in Paris and then meet them on the way going out.  And then when I heard about this institute [National Institute on Genealogical Research], I said, well, I think I'd really like to spend the summer just tracing my family history.  So I dropped out of the trip going to Europe and I spent the three weeks at the institute and several other weeks tracing my family history going back and forth to, to Pennsylvania.  By teaching school I had the whole summer off so I spent the entire summer just doing genealogy.  So after I corresponded with James Dent Walker and I actually met him at the institute, and he saw that I had a Buffalo Soldier ancestor and his specialty was military records, then he took me into the back of the archives in through the stacks, and really took me under his wing and grabbed stuff off the shelf and say, look at this and look at that, and then I would sit down and, and research in those and then he would evaluate what I did and then give me more recommendations.  So it was really, I was able to develop a very personal relationship with him 'cause there was only I think two other blacks that were in the institute at the time, out of about, I don't know f- maybe twenty students or whatever that, you know, came from all throughout the country.  So it was, in addition to learning all the skills and techniques from the institute, then I got all this personal attention and education from, you know, Jimmy Walker.  Later on when I started going to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and doing research, he invited me to stay at his house and then again giving me personal attention and telling me about things that I would only know by talking with him because again he had been there twenty or thirty years.
Story_ID: 611819
Speaker 1: I just wanted to raise a issue that--I mean a point that, I mean, a question, did the other black person approach James Dent Walker too and talk to him or, or were you the only one that did?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of, not that I know of.  He could have had, it's nothing that I recall, you know.  I ran into him about seven or eight years ago and saw the guy somewhere and I said, "Boy you look familiar," then we, we were able to figure out, you know, where we knew each other from.  But I, I don't know, I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Well, I just ask because like mentorship is something that, you know, I mean, it's, it's rare to find a good mentor.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And to find somebody--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to really take you through it and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --probably being the only black person in the National Archives [National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, D.C.] at that position--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --he probably was happy to meet somebody that (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  And it's a very point because that was his personality.  His personality was one of being very giving, and if he could help you out, you know, he could.  And in '77 [1977] is when he was one of the founders of the Afro American Historical and Genealogical Society in Washington [Afro American Historical and Genealogical Society, Inc., Washington, D.C.] along with a couple other African Americans and European Americans that founded that society.  But when he would go out and speak, there weren't any other African American genealogical societies.  So most of the group, groups he spoke to were all-white groups.  Then naturally he assisted blacks that came into the National Archives there in Washington [D.C.], but when he went out in the field 99 percent of his audiences, you know, were whites.  So when he had an opportunity to help African Americans then, you know, he would naturally do that.  Also at the time, I was so excited about genealogy I actually started an organization of, of African American genealogists here in Chicago [Illinois], which I think was called the institute of African American and genealogy research [Afro American Institute of Ancestry] or something, I can't remember the exact name, but we had about ten members here, a couple people that had been doing some genealogy, some that wanted to and never had started doing any genealogy.  And I think when I mentioned that to Mr. Walker he was talking about forming this organization in D.C.  So we had some things in common and he was just the kind of person that if there was any way that he could help you out, he would be more than willing to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you said he also, 'cause I, I think I got this backward in the bio I was trying to write about this, he assisted Alex Haley after 'Roots' ['Roots: The Saga of an American Family'] but not prior to 'Roots.'
Speaker 2: Right, right, exactly.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: In fact, Jimmy would mention things about Alex many times when I would come by the house.  What I found out was, is that, after Alex finished his research with 'Roots,' he wanted to start a genealogy organization or institute which he called the Kinte foundation [Kunta Kinte Alex Haley Foundation, Inc., Edgewater, Maryland].  And it was set up to do oral histories with elderly African Americans so they can get those stories just like the griots got stories in Africa, as well as doing research on African American history and combine the history with the genealogy.  So he found out about Jimmy Walker at the National Archives and he hired him to work in this Kinte institute, along with Leonard Jeffries and several other people, there were a couple of histori- other historians that he had work with him.  And Alex had said that he wished he had met Jimmy when he was doing his research because he thought that, you know, he could have done a much better job since Jimmy had been working at the National Archives for thirty years.  Unfortunately, you know, there's been some things in print that Jimmy helped Alex with his research on 'Roots,' but he really didn't; all that happened much later (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 611820
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now we may have gotten this earlier but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I just wondered, I mean, now if we didn't, you know, I can't remember.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But did you have a critique of Alex Haley's--or, or what did you think about, I mean, he was pioneering something at the time--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --that nobody else had--
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: --really gotten into at least on, on a public level.
Speaker 2: Right, right, exactly.  I had heard about 'Roots' ['Roots: The Saga of an American Family,' Alex Haley] before it was published back in the, the mid-1970s, 'Roots' was, was published in 1976, the book.  The television miniseries ['Roots'] came out in 1977.  I started doing genealogy in 1975, and when I started doing some research--because I re- when I had actually first seen Alex was when I was at Southern Illinois University [Carbondale, Illinois] in 1969 when he was our keynote speaker for black--for Negro History Week [Black History Month], and he was talking about doing his research then, although the book was not called 'Roots,' it was called 'Before This Anger' at that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we, we got that part.
Speaker 2: We, we talked about it, yeah.  Well, when I read the article [by Virginia M. Meyer] in the Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times] in '75 [1975], I had this flashback about Alex doing his research.  And when, you know, I had never heard of the book come out, and he said he was working on a movie, I never heard about that, I think what I did was I did some research on Alex, and I found out that he was still planning on publishing it, and there was a, it was either an article or it was a series in Reader's Digest that he did about his research ['My Search for Roots: A Black American's Story,' Alex Haley].  And that article came out I think, maybe '74 [1974] or '75 [1975].  So I found out about that and that's how I found out that he was still planning on doing that, but it didn't come out until later.  So I was in great anticipation for that book to come out.  I had--started in '75 [1975], by the time it came out in '76 [1976] the following year, it was not the book that I thought it was gonna be.  I was looking for a book that was a how to guide on genealogy, but 'Roots' was really the story of his family history (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I guess, what I'm getting at though like what is, did, is that good genealogy?  I mean the, his, his genealogy--
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: --that had formed 'Roots' is that good genealogy?
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.  Alex Haley admitted to me that he was not a genealogist.  In looking back over the book 'Roots' and understanding as much as I can about how he did it, it appears to me that Alex had some oral history.  He was basically a writer, he did some research, but didn't know the finer points on doing genealogical research.  He had a researcher do some research for him, but I don't think that individual had a lot of research skills.  As well as at that time, back in the '60s [1960s], there was not a lot of, of records that had been microfilmed, there were no genealogy conferences, there were no institutes, there was one institute that had just got started I think in the late, mid to late '60s [1960s], but genealogy was not very sophisticated back at that point.  There were, there were genealogists that were trying to get into the DAR [Daughters of the American Revolution] and the Mayflower Society and things like that.  But organized genealogy and, and published--there were some genealogy that were published, primarily, New England had published, you know.  They had nothing to do with African Americans, you know.  So the base that Alex Haley started with was very, very minimum, he was very, very pioneering in his field.  Alex Haley has been criticized because of the quality of his genealogical research.  But I think it has, it has been largely taken out of context understanding what resources were available, what the level of sophistication was at that time, and also what Alex Haley was trying to do.  Alex Haley was a writer; he wasn't a genealogist.  He had become renowned for writing 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' [Malcolm X and Alex Haley] and doing the series in Playboy magazine.  So when he got this opportunity to deal with his family history, he saw a larger story there.  A larger story that had not been told, the one of someone tracing your family history back to Africa.  People knew that blacks came from Africa, but we knew a lot of the records had been destroyed, our names had been changed and all that kind of thing.  And I think, once that he started doing his research on his family, trying to solve some family riddles, I think he saw a larger picture.  And where he couldn't--when he ran into some brick walls and couldn't go in any further I think what happened was he used his creative license to tell the larger story.  So is it in fact--does it stand up today's rigorous standards of genealogical research?  No it doesn't, you know.  But I think what it did was it inspired millions of people, blacks and whites, to do their family history and develop more sophisticated techniques so that some people have been able to do it, you know, genealogically through unbroken links.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I think we have to really put it in, in proper context.
Story_ID: 611821
Speaker 1: What's the most important thing you learned from James Dent Walker?
Speaker 2: The most important things I learned from James Dent Walker were--gosh, I guess, there were some many.  One is the fact that the National Archives [National Archives and Records Administration] is a huge, huge resource that is, is basically untapped in many different aspects.  We primarily use it for census records.  A lot of European Americans use it for immigration and naturalization, ships' passenger lists, as well as census records.  But the National Archives being the library of the federal government, is so vast and so huge, there's a lot of things that are uncatalogued and there's many of 'em that are very valuable for us to do our genealogy.  So that's one thing that I learned: that you can, you could spend the rest of your life researching at the National Archives, and you would never exhaust all the things that are important for you.  That's point one.  Point two, I learned from him, things called finding aids.   There's not, there is no card catalog to the National Archives like you'd find in a regular library.  It's a manuscript collection, so you have these finding aids, which are like catalogs to the individual collections.  And you need to understand those finding aids and you need to go through them with a fine tooth comb because there's a lot of hidden gems that you can only find out by going through these finding aids.  And he would take these finding aids home, and he would study each and every entry, and he would mark up the ones that he thought were important for genealogy, and then he'd go to the archives and he would pull those out, and he would look at them and if those are the ones that were important, then he would give lectures and talk about those different things.  So I learned how to really deal with those finding aids at the National Archives.  I also learned from him that it's just important to understand African American history as it is to understand genealogy, and you can't do one without the other.  And he was really a stickler for that and he was one of the main founders for the Afro American Historical and Genealogical Society in Washington [Afro American Historical and Genealogical Society, Inc., Washington, D.C.], he made it a point to put the word history before the word genealogy.  So the name in the organization is the Afro American Historical and Genealogical Society to emphasize history.  Because too often genealogists get so excited about genealogy, they try to find, you know, their ancestors and go back as far as they can as fast as they can, and they neglect researching history, and they, they research their families out of context.
Story_ID: 611822
Speaker 1: Did he [James Dent Walker] ever talk about who his mentors were?
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: You know, there's a, I know the book called 'Black Bibliophiles and Collectors' ['Black Bibliophiles and Collectors: Preservers of Black History'] by Elinor Des Verney Sinnette, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, sure.
Speaker 1: --at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: And it mentioned some of the people that were collecting books and started--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --historical associations and--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: --back in the early part of the century.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I just--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --wondered if he came across any of those, or?
Speaker 2: He was an avid book collector, he was a very avid reader, he talked to people all over the country, he knew all the archivists around the country.  I never remember him talking about who his mentor was.  I'm sure he had some, who they were, you know, I don't know.  But that's a good question, I have to look at some of his--.  Once he died in '93 [1993], I went out and bought all his tapes, you know, of lectures that he had given.  I've collected many of his, his works that he had written in terms of books and articles and whatever.  I don't recall specifically, any ment- any mentors.  I know he had some but I don't recall any specifically.  He was born and raised in Washington, D.C. and spent his, the bulk of his life in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 611823
Speaker 1: Throughout this period of time you're still--geneal- genealogy is not your, your major focus, you still have to earn a living doing other things.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're teaching at Francis Parker [Francis W. Parker School, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Right.
Speaker 1: And--oh, tell us just briefly about the Chicago Genealogical Society [Chicago, Illinois] and how does an African American fit in--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to that?
Speaker 2: Right.  Since the article that I read [in the Chicago Sun-Times] in '75 [1975] was written by the president of the Chicago Genealogical Society [Virginia M. Meyer], and I started researching at Newberry Library at 60 West Walton [Street] on the North Side [Chicago, Illinois] which is, has one of the largest genealogical collections in the Midwest.  In addition to the National Archives [National Archives at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], the Newberry Library is one of my primary repositories to do research and that's where the Chicago Genealogical Society had their meetings.  So what I did was I started attending their meetings, and I joined their organization.  And they met like once a month, and so they would give a lecture on a different aspect of genealogy.  There were, I think, one or two other African American members, but it's predominantly a white organization.  I was, was not the first black member; there were a couple others.  But I was able to meet people that were involved in genealogy on a broader scale.  That was my first entree into organized, what I call organized genealogy from like just going to the library, doing it yourself, by hooking up with other individuals that are doing it, that know about published resources, that know about advanced techniques and discuss those on, on a regular basis.  So I was able to develop some contacts, learn some sophisticated techniques and--
Story_ID: 611824
Speaker 1: Now was Woodtor, Patrick's--Woodtor's--
Speaker 2: Dee Woodtor.
Speaker 1: --ex-wife--
Speaker 2: Delores Woodtor [Delores "Dee" Parmer Woodtor] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Dee Woodtor, yeah, was she--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --was she there?  I know she's written a book on genealogy.
Speaker 2: No, Dee Woodtor didn't come along until the 1980s, I think that, the late 1980s, or even the early 1990s.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, I should know because Newberry Library [Chicago, Illinois] developed a grant to develop a collection for African American genealogy.  And they got some money from the State of Illinois and from a couple foundations.  And they knew there were a lot of African Americans in Chicago [Illinois] that did genealogy.  So with that, I mean, first of all, Chicago has a large African American population, then we had an African American genealogical society and we were doing a lot of research.  And oftentimes we would come to Newberry Library and the primary focus of the collection at Newberry was the Midwest and New England; there were not a lot of things from the South.  So David Thackery, who was the curator, got this grant to purchase materials for African American genealogy and also do outreach.  So with that he hired Dee Woodtor to work with that program.  At the time he hired her, she didn't have any genealogical experience.  She learned it there at Newberry Library from David Thackery.  And the more I think about it, that program started, maybe it was in 1990, but I know it was in the early 1990s.  So she learned it on the job from David and then started researching her own family.
Speaker 1: And she produced a book as a result of that, right?
Speaker 2: Well what happened was, with the grant, they produced a bibliography on the collection, from the things they had purchased along with other things in the collection that were important for genealogy.  So that bibliography was published.  And then Dee also worked with David for doing a case studies book ['Case Studies in Afro American Genealogy,' David T. Thackery and Dee Woodtor], which was four or five case studies on doing African American genealogy, kind of like a, a starting guide but it was limited because it was based on resources at Newberry Library.  So that's the two things that she was involved with.  Later on, she did research to publish a book on African American genealogy ['Finding a Place Called Home: A Guide to African American Genealogy and Historical Identity,' Dee Parmer Woodtor].  And, in fact, she wrote it one summer, and I forget the year that she wrote it, but she went to, to Jimmy Walker [James Dent Walker] 'cause Jimmy Walker had published a small book called 'Black Genealogy: How to Begin.'  And even though it's referred to as a book, it was really a series of handouts where he did a genealogy program for the State of Georgia.  And it was almost like an institute where he taught people how to do genealogy, they filmed it, so it was a part of a PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] program in Georgia.  And the handouts he had used in his lecture, he had some of these handouts in a little booklet form which he called 'Black Genealogy: How to Begin.'  People refer to it as a book, but it was really like a collection of handouts.  He was in discussions with, I think, it was HarperCollins [HarperCollins Publishers LLC] to do a real book on black genealogy.  He was so busy giving lectures, you know, and speaking around, and also working at the National Archives [National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, D.C.] that he never got around to actually doing the book.  Well, Dee had met him through going to the, the conferences, the Afro American Historical and Genealogical Society [Afro American Historical and Genealogical Society, Inc.] started having conferences in Washington [D.C.].  Well, Dee attended those conferences, she met Jimmy, became friends with Jimmy, Jimmy helped her with some of her research.  She told Jimmy she was working on this book, and so he referred her to HarperCollins.  I'm pretty much sure it was HarperCollins.  She talked with HarperCollins about her book but her book was primarily on slavery, and HarperCollins was looking for a beginner's guide.  And they wanted her to do a whole lot of changes, Dee didn't wanna do the changes, so after she got the contract with, with HarperCollins she never revised her manuscript.  After that she decided to self publish it, which she did.
Story_ID: 611825
Speaker 1: In the meantime, I guess in '89, 1989, I had started to write a book on, on black genealogy and I was going to do it based on the Boy Scout book, which is what I had started doing genealogy, which was basically a fifty page guide, kind of little small thing.  And after I started working on it, I sent it out to several people to critique for me, people that were genealogists, people that were not genealogists, to see if they understand--understood the concepts I was trying to, you know, write about.  Well, one of the persons that I submitted to was Dee Woodtor [Delores "Dee" Parmer Woodtor].  Dee read it and she along with other people made a lot of, you know, very constructive comments on it.  One of Dee's comments was very interesting, was she said, "You explain about charts in here, and you have blank charts and tell people how to use these charts.  Well why don't you use live charts with live data so people know how the data looks once you put it in the charts."  And I thought that was an excellent suggestion.  So I started reworking the book or the manuscript, and I went to my own charts and I looked at 'em, and when I looked at the charts I said, well, you didn't footnote this source and you know where that source came from, and you didn't update this information, and you had that information, and I realized that I had made a lot of mistakes in doing genealogy.  So what I had to do was stop and correct some of my mistakes by updating the information I had researched, by footnoting my sources properly 'cause I was explaining it in the book but I wasn't--I had not been doing everything myself properly.  So I incorporated those suggestions.  So in the meantime later on as I was working on this book, I would do a lecture and I'd add that lecture to the book.  Well, the book started to grow from fifty pages to, you know, a hundred pages and two hundred pages and developed into this very large, huge manuscript.  And as I started speaking and got more speaking engagements around the country and started airing on television and newspapers, I said, well, maybe a major publisher will be interested in this book, 'cause I had planned to self publish it because I had self published a book back in the, the '70s [1970s] called 'Underground Chicago' ['Underground Chicago: Downtown Walking Routes to Avoid Severe Weather,' Tony Burroughs].  And so I was planning on self publishing that, but as I developed this national reputation, I said maybe a major publisher would be interested in it.  So what I started doing was looking for publishers, and I had attended a book fair, it was a national, American Booksellers Association conference here in Chicago [Illinois] and they had a track just dealing with black bookstores, black publishers.  And I went there and I met a, a brother who worked for Random House [Random House Inc.; Penguin Random House].
Story_ID: 611826
Speaker 1: I went to the, the American Booksellers Association conference here at McCormick Place in Chicago [Illinois], and they had a tract dealing with African American booksellers.
Speaker 2: This is about 1995, you think, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I think it was in '95 [1995], right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so they had lectures and kind of workshops dealing with black bookstores, black books, black customers, et cetera.  And I was there trying to get a feel for who I might be able to get as a, as a publisher.  And there was a brother who was a sales marketing rep from Random House [Random House Inc.; Penguin Random House] who was very, very impressive.  He had a good rapport with the, with the black bookstores and he had a great knowledge about the industry and whatever.  So I went up to him after one of the sessions, introduced myself, told him I was working on a book on black genealogy.  And prior to that I had written a chapter ["Records Specific to African Americans," Tony Burroughs] in this book called 'African American Genealogical Sourcebook' [ed. Paula Byers] that was a genealogy reference book published by Gale Research [Gale Cengage], and I had written the largest chapter in there and I showed that to him and he was very impressed.  And I told him I was looking for a publisher, that I was working on, you know, a how to guide.  And he said, you know, well he wore two hats, you know, that he was not only a rep, but he was also an editor, which at the time I believed him, you know.  After that I said, I don't know if he was or not, you know (laughter).  But anyway we exchanged cards and he said that, you know, once I get my proposal done to send it to him 'cause I was working actually on a book proposal.  Once I had, I had joined the, the authors union and then--or the writers union and found out that when you're submitting a nonfiction book you don't really complete the manuscript you really work on a book proposal.  So I was really working on this book proposal I was gonna send to Random House.  In the meantime I was interviewed by a journalist out in Los Angeles [California] for a story on the Underground Railroad, which I had done some research on the Underground Railroad.  And after the interview she said, "Well, you know, you're so knowledgeable, you should write a book."  I said, "Well it's funny you mentioned that, I've been working on it," you know.
Story_ID: 611827
Speaker 1: Now was the first little book you wrote, 'Chicago Underground,' about the Underground Railroad in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  The book I wrote in '78 [1978], it was called 'Underground Chicago' ['Underground Chicago: Downtown Walking Routes to Avoid Severe Weather,' Tony Burroughs], but it was not about the Underground Railroad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What it was, it was a series of maps that you can use to walk through buildings downtown instead of walking outside when it was snowing or raining or cold outside.  And I connected with walk--'cause some buildings you can walk into the building in one block and walk straight through the entire building and exit at the end of the block.  So you can walk an entire block inside rather than being outside.  And also some of these could connect through the subway corridor down, you know, under the stores.  So what I did was I found out there were so many different buildings you could cut through and so many different subways, that I connected them all together and did 'em with a series of maps.  So I self published that in 1978.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just, I just--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Clarification if that was on the Underground Railroad.  No.
Story_ID: 611828
Speaker 1: So this sister who had interviewed me from Los Angeles [California], when I told her I was working on a manuscript, and I told her that I had developed a contact with Random House [Random House Inc.; Penguin Random House], and I was trying to finish up the proposal to send to Random House.  And she says well, "I'm surprised you're dealing with a publisher rather than dealing with an agent."  And I said, "Well, I don't have an agent," you know, and I said, "I don't even know how to get an agent, I know, you don't look through the telephone directory."  So she said, "Well, you know, you can use my agent."  And so I asked who her agent was, and she said Jeff Herman [The Jeff Herman Literary Agency, LLC; The Jeff Herman Agency].  And so I said, "Wow, well I know Jeff Herman because I was using his book to write my book proposal."  She said, "Yeah, well, you know, I have a contract with Jeff, and I can, you know, you can mention my name, and that you're a friend of mine, you know me and it's always good to have a personal contact."  So I said, "Great."  So what I did was instead of, you know, going to Random House, I started working on the proposal to send to the agent, Jeff Herman.  At the time I would have periodic conversations with Dee Woodtor [Delores "Dee" Parmer Woodtor].  And, and she had told me about, you know, her dealings with HarperCollins [HarperCollins Publishers LLC].  Well after I got the agent, with Jeff Herman, the following year, I think 1996, and Jeff liked my book proposal, he thought it was great, he thought it would sell well.  And then the following year, he was able to get a contract with Simon and Schuster [Simon and Schuster, Inc.].  So what happened was I, you know, ran into Dee and I told her I said, "Yeah, well, you know, I was working on Harper Col- on Random House and they, you know, were very interested in my book.  And then I got a deal, you know, with Simon Schuster."  And we actually, what happened was Simon Schuster actually made the first bid on the book, my agent didn't like their bid and thought it was too low, he gave 'em a counteroffer, they didn't go for that, so then he put the book out for bid.  So there were several publishers bidding on the book, and one of which was Random House.  And actually Random House and Simon and Schuster were bidding, you know, back and forth with each other, but since Simon Schuster had made the initial bid, after the bidding was over, in fact, it was, actually Random House and it was a, one of the publishing houses in Boston [Massachusetts], uh, the name temporarily escapes me, but them and there was another house in Chicago [Illinois] that was bidding on it, so it was really three houses that were bidding on it.  Once that bidding stopped, then Simon Schuster had a right to bid--to go over the highest bid which was Random House's if they still wanted it, and they did and so they won it out.  Well I explained all of this to Dee, so Dee knew that Random House was looking for a book on black genealogy, and she had self published her book.  She took her book to Random House, and then they went and published her book ['Finding a Place Called Home: A Guide to African American Genealogy and Historical Identity,' Dee Parmer Woodtor], (laughter).  And since Random House had my proposal, and they knew all my background, and they knew the quality of work that I had done, they wanted to try to beat me to the market, and so they took Dee's book and they rushed that book to the market and actually got that out before my book ['Black Roots: A Beginners Guide to Tracing the African American Family Tree,' Tony Burroughs] was published, you know, which kind of hurt me in the marketplace a bit because mine would have been the first major book out in, (makes sound) fifty years or so, you know.  So Dee's came out even though Dee's was very, very different from mine.  It's a book on black genealogy, it concentrates on slavery, mine concentrates on beginning, you know.  So, there was a little bit of confusion in the marketplace, but mine still did well, you know, I mean, I'm, I'm not complaining at all.  Although it would have been nice to have that first one out there, it just took me a long time to, to get it done, you know.  Because the book actually took me about ten years to work on after I got the contract in ninety--what '97 [1997], it really did not come out until like 2001.
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: So it even took a while after I, you know, got the contract.
Story_ID: 611829
Speaker 1: I wanna backtrack to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 1: --not--well, you know, you worked for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange [Chicago, Illinois] from '82 [1982] to '87 [1987], I don't know how much you wanna get into that but I--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I mean but the point I guess is that you didn't really start working full time in genealogy until--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --about 1990 or so.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: When I first got into genealogy in '75 [1975] and I did research for about three years, maybe four years, I had more information than I could process, 'cause this is before personal computers had come out.  So everything I was doing was like manually.  There weren't even a lot of, you know, photocopying machines out back then, people were still using mimeograph and carbon paper and stuff, you know.  So I had a ton of files, had done a ton of research, and I just couldn't keep track of it, couldn't process it all.  As well as I was trying to do, you know, genealogy full time, and, you know, and I just had to work for a living.  So I just stopped genealogy and filed everything away and got out of it and, you know, picked up a couple of odd jobs.  I was a manager at McDonald's for a while.  I was bartending for a while, trying to start a business during the day and that's when I had published the, the 'Underground Chicago' book ['Underground Chicago: Downtown Walking Routes to Avoid Severe Weather,' Tony Burroughs] 1978, '79 [1979].  And then a guy I was bartending with, worked at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  So he said he could get me a job down there.  So I went down there, and I was actually a pit recorder where I stood in the pit, recorded the prices, handed them over.  And got a little bit of money, wasn't making a whole lot of money, but then I was able to get promoted since, you know, I had like four or five years of college and I was promoted up into the audit department off of the trading floor.  Well before I was promoted, I remember sitting in the pit one day after the markets had closed and, you know, they transact like trillions of dollars' worth of, you know, transactions during the day, and I'm sitting up there thinking about like all the money that's being, you know, handled down there.  And I said, I would be foolish not to learn what the heck is going on 'cause I had no background, I had studied stocks when I got out of college, so I knew a little bit about the stock market, knew nothing about the commodity market.  Since we were employed at the Mercantile Exchange we could take classes for free and they gave classes that traders took to learn different techniques of trading and whatever.  We had a library that concentrated on stocks, commodities, investments, and whatever.  So what I did was I took all the classes that they gave, I read all the books, I read about fifty books on, on trading commodities and investments and whatever.  And I started saving my money along with working there at the exchange in the audit department.  And eventually, I learned how to use computers, 'cause personal computers had come out.  And then after a while the person that was in charge of computers left, and then since I knew more than anybody else about computers, 'cause again I could take classes for free, I was in charge of computers there in the, in the audit department.  And so I saved up my money and in, I think it was 1987, I left the exchange and I started trading on my own.  So I put together, you know, a pile of money and I wanted to eventually manage some commodity funds for other investors, but I said I wanted to learn how to do it myself first.  I had read all the books, I had taken the courses, so theoretically I knew how to do it.  I got a software program and I learned how to do it, you know, on the computer, but then the next step is to actually go from the theoretical to the practical.  So then I put my money up, opened up an account, had prices coming through to my computer all day long and I traded for six to eight months, started losing money at first, then I started making money, then I, I started making money, you know, two or three months in a row, then when that big crash happened in '87 [1987], I lost a ton of money and it blew me out of the market, you know.  So then I started computer consulting at that time.  I had known a lot about computers and people that had small businesses started hiring me to train their employees and to set up, you know, their, their systems.  So at the time, a little later after that, I guess probably around that same time, in the late '80s [1980s], I would say this was like '87 [1987], '88 [1988], around that time I was starting to get back into genealogy.
Story_ID: 611830
Speaker 1: Through the mid-'80s [1980s] I started getting back into genealogy, and then in the late '80s [1980s] I started getting back into it, you know, like quite a bit more.
Speaker 2: Was there, was there any major incident that that just kind of signaled you getting back into it and, and--
Speaker 1: Back into genealogy?
Speaker 2: --yeah, and, well what incident or things--
Speaker 1: That's a good question, Larry [Larry Crowe] (laughter).  Excellent question.  I go to art fairs, and there was a big art fair [57th Street Art Fair] in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], you know, which is the first one of the season, and DuSable Museum [DuSable Museum of African American History, Chicago, Illinois] had a art fair, Lake Meadows [Chicago, Illinois] had an art fair, and I would go to all these art fairs, you know, during the summer, primarily on Saturdays, it would be like Saturday and Sunday.  Sundays I would like play tennis or I would sail out on Lake Michigan.  And one of the art fairs I went to, there was a genealogical--African American genealogical society started in 1979 here in Chicago [Afro American Genealogical and Historical Society of Chicago, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].  I knew the people that founded the society, they asked me to, you know, be a founding member with them.  And in '79 [1979] was around that time I was getting out of genealogy, you know, 'cause I'd just kind of had it up to here (gesture), what I call the information overload.  So I kind of supported them, but I said, you know, I don't have time right now, I'm not really in it, you know, but, you know, I'll, I'll support you and whatever.  Well, in the late '80s [1980s] or the mid-'80s [1980s], I would see those people at art fairs and they would have a booth set up trying to get people to join their genealogical society, and I would see and say, "Hey, how you doing, haven't seen you in a long time."  "Have you been doing any research?"  "No, not really, you know, but, you know, I kind of miss it, you know."  So I would talk to them and then I started thinking about genealogy again.  So then it just started eating at me and eating at me, I said I need to get back to my research.  And I started, you know, recalling back what I was doing in the '70s [1970s], you know, and I kind of missed it.  So I said maybe what I'll do is join this genealogical society and that will force me to get back into my research.  You know, 'cause for a long time I would see them, but I couldn't go to the meetings 'cause they were on Sunday and I was either, you know, playing tennis tournaments or, or sailing, you know.  So finally I decided, you know, let me just take some time out and just attend--the meeting's only once a month, so that one time I can go to a meeting.  So I went, started going to the meetings, they were held in the basement of DuSable Museum.  And I would ask a question, or I'd raise a point and people would turn around well who is this guy, you know, and they said wow he's got a lot of knowledge, you know.  'Cause I had been to the institute [National Institute on Genealogical Research], I'd researched for three or four years, a lot of those were just beginning, or they had not been to the institute and didn't know any real sophisticated techniques.  So they would, you know, like call on me and then they started asking me to give lectures, you know.  And I hadn't done any lectures since the '70s [1970s], you know.  So I started giving some more talks.  So by going to the meetings and giving lectures, I started pulling out my old files and going through, you know, things and then personal computers had come out and genealogy software, so I started computerizing some of my stuff.  So gradually I started getting back into the flow of genealogy.  What I hadn't anticipated was after I started giving lectures to the group, then they asked me to be on the board and they asked me to be vice president of the organization, which was I think, '89 [1989].  And then after I served as vice president for a couple years, then they, you know, elected me as president of the organization.  But that's how I started gradually getting back into it.
Story_ID: 611831
Speaker 1: You started teaching at Chicago State [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] in 1990?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now what--how did that happen?
Speaker 2: Well, even before I, I, started at Chicago State, in '89 [1989] I developed a course that I taught at Chicago city colleges [City Colleges of Chicago] through their like enrichment program, I think it was at the Harold Washington College [Chicago, Illinois] on Lake [Street] and State [Street] or whatever.  And I taught that for one term.  And then I presented the course at the Field Museum [Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, Illinois] because they had enrichment programs, and I taught it at the Field Museum.  All my students were white down at the Field Museum, you know, but it still worked out very well.  Then I proposed it to Chicago State and Chicago State accepted it.  And at that time I taught it, I think four, four terms throughout the year: the fall, the winter, the spring, and the summer, you know.  And it became very, very successful.  So for some reason, it seemed to catch on more than Washington College and from the Field Museum.  So I started teaching it, and there my students were predominantly African American, there was one or two whites that would take the course periodically, but predominantly African American.  And then I started evolving it and adding, you know, more sophisticated techniques.  I had a, a field trip to the Newberry Library [Chicago, Illinois] where I taught them, you know, how the Newberry Library works, what resources are there.  I had a field trip to the National Archives [National Archives at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] to show them how to research the census records.  And the week before we would go I would have a whole two hour session on how to do census research.  The week before we would go to Newberry Library, I'd have a whole two hours on how to research at a library.  I developed the course as a how to course but I also set it up so that students could work on their own families during the course of the, of the whole eight sessions, it was two hours a session for eight weeks with two field trips.  And so it just caught on, you know, became very popular.  And as well as Chicago State advertising it, then when I would go to genealogical society meetings I would advertise it, put notices in the newsletter, put posters on libraries, you know, around the city and every now and then we'd get a newspaper article, you know, on it.  So it, it just kind of stuck, so people, you know, started knowing about it, and I think I've been teaching there for like fifteen years, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 611832
Speaker 1: Now you became president of the Afro American genealogical association [Afro American Genealogical and Historical Society of Chicago, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is that here in Chicago [Illinois] or is that--that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right, here in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What happened was they asked me to be vice president, I believe, in '89 [1989] which was a two year term.  And being vice president, one of my primary responsibilities was to run conferences.  We had two conferences a year, one in February for Black History Month, and then a smaller one in October where our members were the lecturers.  The one in, in February for Black History Month we would bring someone who is pretty renowned in the field of genealogy.  And we did it in conjunction with the Chicago Public Library [Chicago, Illinois], and they would pay for the speakers to come in.  So I did that for two years.  Then when I became president I realized that we were getting these huge crowds of people at the, what is now the Chicago Cultural Center [Chicago, Illinois] and we would get like two, three hundred people in.  But the library would pay for everything, we couldn't charge any admission but we still had costs involved, you know, for putting together the handouts and refreshments and a lot of other things and, you know, we would go out to dinner with the speaker and whatever.  So my suggestion was we need to do this on our own because we've been doing it for ten years with Chicago Public Library, we can do it on our own and we can make money by charging.  So, I was able to ha- convince the board that we had the skills to do it on our own but one of the things we did with that is we cut it back from doing two workshops a year to doing one a year because I thought we needed to concentrate for a whole year on the conference rather than like just six months.  So we did that and that became very, very successful too.
Speaker 1: So this conference included the local people as well as a national speaker?
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, exactly, exactly, very much so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who were some of the--what--we met like some, in fact, we've interviewed, we interviewed [HistoryMaker] Roma Jones Stewart.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Right, oh, good.
Speaker 1: --and probably some other people from the genealogical society, I'm trying to think.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Did you, did you interview Jeanne Jones [Jeanne Boger Jones]?  You need to interview Jeanne Jones.  Jeanne Jones' ancestors were some of the first blacks to come to Chicago.  They founded the first black church in Chicago, Quinn Chapel [Quinn Chapel A.M.E. Church] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Are they related to John Jones?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, they're not, no, no.
Speaker 1: John and Mary Jones?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, no they're not related to John Jones.  But Absalom--was it Absalom?  Abram Hall [Abraham T. Hall], her family was the Hall family.  Abram Hall founded Quinn Chapel, first black church in Chicago and it was very instrumental in the Underground Railroad.  And one of her ancestors [Charles E. Hall] was in charge of--he worked at the bureau of the census [U.S. Census Bureau] in Washington [D.C.] and did a landmark study on blacks in the U.S. census records ['Negroes in the United States 1920-1932'].  But, yeah, you definitely need to interview Jeanne Jones.
Speaker 1: Are they related to George Cleveland Hall too, the--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yeah--wait a minute (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The surgeon that, you know, that the library's named--
Speaker 2: Wait, wait, wait, George Cleveland Hall--
Speaker 1: He was the surgeon that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know George Cleveland Hall.
Speaker 1: --Provident [Provident Hospital; Provident Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois], yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: No, I don't, I don't think, no, no, no.  Not related to George Cleveland Hall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there's some other Halls in her family that were very renowned, and there are several of them.  Her father was Dr. Boger [Thomas A. Boger], they were, they settled in, after they left Chicago, they settled in Aurora [Illinois], and--one of the other suburbs near, near Aurora, but they, some of her ancestors were in the Civil War, worked on the Underground Railroad, you know, and she has a unbroken link, her family line goes back that far.
Speaker 1: Is that J-E-A-N, Jeanne Jones?
Speaker 2: Yeah, J-E-A-N [sic.]--I always forget if there is an E on the end, I can't remember if there's an E on the end or not, some of them are J-E-A-N, some are J-E-A-N-N-E or whatever and I always forget.  And her, her daughter [HistoryMaker Marquita Pool-Eckert], who's a producer for CBS in New York [New York] reminded me one day I felt so bad.  But I'll put you in, in touch with Jeanne.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 611833
Speaker 1: But this is, it sounds like quite an organization [Afro American Genealogical and Historical Society of Chicago, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].  Now we, we interviewed--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --[HistoryMaker] Roma Jones Stewart in relation to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --her law practice.  And--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --then came up as--
Speaker 2: That she was--
Speaker 1: --as like another--
Speaker 2: Right.  'Cause she was president of the organization.  She was president when I was vice president, you know.  So yes, the organization has been very involved.  In terms of some of the speakers, we brought in Ira Berlin one year who did the landmark, he did a lot of landmark things actually, did was it 'Master-' wrote 'Masters and Slaves'--or 'Slaves Without Masters.'  As well as he did, he started the Freedom and Southern Society Project, which was a huge project to publish forty thousand documents from the National Archives [National Archives and Records Administration] that documented the role that African Americans played in liberating themselves during and after the Civil War.  Also we brought in Dorothy Spruill Redford.  In fact, we brought in Dorothy Spruill Redford to be our keynote speaker in 1992, which was very interesting because Alex Haley died in 1992 on February the 10th, and when Alex Haley died, he was in Seattle [Washington] on that Sunday, that Monday morning it came across the wire services that Alex Haley had died.  My picture was on page three of the, of the Chicago Sun-Times for our genealogy conference, which was that following Saturday.  And the headline across the Sun-Times was: 'Expert Genealogist Inspired by Alex Haley' [ph.], and it had my photograph along with my family tree chart in the background, it was like a, almost a full page article in the Sun-Times.  So when the reporters got the wire services early in the morning and saw Alex Haley died, you opened up the Sun-Times, see my picture, 'Inspired by Alex Haley,' well I was on all the TV broadcasts that evening and I was on all the radio shows in the morning, and our conference, our, our phone lines were like filled to capacity with people trying to find out about our conference because it, not only myself, but Dorothy Spruill Redford, who had written a book, 'Somerset Homecoming' ['Somerset Homecoming: Recovering a Lost Heritage'] that Alex Haley had written the introduction to, she was our keynote speaker, and she was like in the forefront of African American genealogy.  So when she came to Chicago [Illinois] that Saturday, the new Harold Washington Library [Chicago, Illinois] had just opened up.  We were, our genealogical society was the first organization to have a program in the new library.  And in February, in Feb- you know, that, end of that second week in February, it was like freezing cold outside and people were lined up around the block waiting to get in.  The auditorium holds four hundred people and we had five hundred people there, all day, standing in the aisles and, and, and, and sitting on the steps to not only hear me but also to hear Dorothy Spruill Redford, you know, 'cause she had, since she had written this, this landmark book.  To this date, that's been the largest genealogy, black genealogy conference that's ever held.  'Cause I've been to a lot of 'em in Washington [D.C.] and a lot of 'em around the country.  But we got a lot of good feedback from that particular conference and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: --what's the name of her book again, Dorothy?
Speaker 2: 'Somerset Homecoming.'
Speaker 1: 'Somerset Homecoming,' okay.
Speaker 2: Dorothy Spruill Redford traced her ancestors back to northeastern North Carolina to Somerset plantation [Somerset Place].  And she researched the 471 slaves on that plantation, her ancestors and all the other ones that lived on that plantation.  And then researched the descendants of the slave owners.  And so she had a big homecoming of the descendants of the slaves and the descendants of the slave owners, and it was so huge and so innovative, it was covered on 'CBS Sunday Morning.' And Alex Haley was there, you know, to talk at that family reunion.  And I had seen it on 'CBS Sunday Morning' and then when I was in South Carolina to do some research, oh, a couple years later, that was in '88 [1988], I think her book came out, I was doing some research in, in South Carolina either in '89 [1989] or '90 [1990], something like that, the bookstore owner told me about her book, I picked it up and I read the whole thing on the plane and, you know, I couldn't put it down until I was finished after I got home, but it was a very, very good book and she had done some really innovative research on that.  So we knew about her and brought her in to be our keynote speaker, you know.
Story_ID: 611834
Speaker 1: Who have been some of the other, the others?
Speaker 2: We had a author in from Salt Lake City [Utah], David Streets, who actually was a white genealogist but had written a book called 'Slave Genealogy' ['Slave Genealogy: A Research Guide with Case Studies'].  And so it was really the first book that was kind of like a manual on how to research slaves for genealogy purposes.  So he came in one year.  And the interesting thing to me was, you know, we would always take the speakers out to dinner after, you know, the, the lecture.  And we went out to dinner, we went out to Army and Lou's [Chicago, Illinois].  And I asked him, how did you come to write this book on slave genealogy?  Knowing he's a white person and from Salt Lake City.  And he said that he had to do a paper, you know, I guess, his thesis or something or some senior paper, I can't remember if it was for undergraduate school or graduate school, and he said that everything had been written on, on whites for genealogy but almost nothing had been done for African Americans on genealogy, so he decided to do this book on slave genealogy.  And he found some case studies that fit, that showed how slave owners had transferred slaves from one owner to another using these court records.  The interesting thing about that is that it wasn't a realistic study because he didn't go from the known back to the unknown and take a family from freedom backward into slavery.  So the major problem that we had as African American genealogists, meaning, who the heck is a slave owner anyway, he never even addressed.  So his book was good for a theoretical case study, but it didn't solve our practical problems on how do you identify who the slave owner was.  So in research that I had been doing, I was able to figure out how to solve that particular problem because it was a problem not only I had but many of our other African American genealogists had.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he was a, a speaker.  We brought in a lady from Jackson State University in Jackson, Mississippi who was an expert on using Mississippi court, Mississippi--records from the Mississippi state archives [Mississippi Department of Archives and History, Jackson, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: And that's important for Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  The majority of our members [of the Afro American Genealogical and Historical Society of Chicago, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] had ancestors from Mississippi.  So we brought her in, Velvelyn, Velvelyn Foster.  At the same time we also brought in a lady who had done research in Louisiana.
Story_ID: 611835
Speaker 1: Ooh, she wrote a couple of books too and her name temporarily escapes me, but she researched plantations in Louisiana.  And again, there's a lot of African Americans who have Louisiana roots from Chicago [Illinois].  So we brought her in to speak about plantation records in Louisiana.  Frazine K. Taylor was an African American who was in charge of the ready reference desk at the Alabama state archives [Alabama Department of Archives and History, Montgomery, Alabama], and we brought her in one year because we have a lot of African Americans that have roots from, from Alabama.  One year we brought in Jimmy Walker [James Dent Walker].  He came in in '93 [1993] and was our, our keynote speaker.  And then we've had Christopher Reed [HistoryMaker Christopher R. Reed], a historian, at, at Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois] has spoken several times at our conference.  So we try to get a mixture between genealogists and, and, and historians, you know, to come in and speak periodically.  So we've had a couple of people from the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.], the San- Sandra Lawson, who is a genealogist, worked with the Library of Congress for many years, still there, we brought her in.  [HistoryMaker] Sylvia Cooke Martin who worked at the Library of Congress, she, she's come in and, and spoken to our group [Afro American Genealogical and Historical Society of Chicago, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: So that kind of just--well, now that's, that's a sample (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, gives you a good idea.
Speaker 2: That's an idea.
Speaker 1: Sure, sure.
Story_ID: 611836
Speaker 1: Another thing I wanna pursue is that you as a keynote speaker--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --at a lot of conferences and--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and you've kind of, I mean you've gained like national notoriety and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --some would say international with the (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, notoriety--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --with this, so--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: Yeah, what happened was, the local African American society here [Afro American Genealogical and Historical Society of Chicago, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] asked me to start speaking.  And then I would--when I was vice president, I would give introductions and--at our four conferences throughout the year, and I would give a lecture there.  One of the ladies who was a member of the Chicago Genealogical Society [Chicago, Illinois] would attend our programs at Chicago Public Library downtown, this is before, the old library that's now the Cultural Center [Chicago Cultural Center, Chicago, Illinois], and she knew that we had very, very good programs.  She nominated me to be on the national board, on the Federation of Genealogical Societies back in, I believe, about '89 [1989].  From there I met people on the national circuit, primarily whites that were involved either with the association for professional genealogists [Association of Professional Genealogists], with the National Genealogical Society, the Federation of Genealogical Societies, and people that were some of the top people in the genealogy field in the U.S.  And so--
Speaker 1: So, so there are professional genealogists that all they do is--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, oh, sure.
Speaker 1: --they, they do research for, for people, I guess, who are willing to pay--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --to have their ancestors--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --searched out.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yeah.  There are a number of professional genealogists that do professional genealogy on a number of different levels and aspects.  But yeah there are people that full time just research other people's families.  There are some people that consult and do problem solving for other genealogists.  There are people that that lecture and, and write books, and give tours, not only throughout the U.S. but also to, to England, to Europe, and other places on, you know, how to get (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Ireland I guess would be important--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, Ireland is very big.
Speaker 1: --in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: You know, England's very big.  France, Germany, you know, like fairly large, you know.  So there's a sizable number of professional genealogists.  And, in fact, I was actually on the board of the association for professional genealogists for a while.
Story_ID: 611837
Speaker 1: I would just imagine that there's a practical aspect to being a professional genealogist other than just the cultural enrichment part of it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I suppose legal, there may be legal cases that depend on, you know, that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --depend somewhat on genealogy, who's related to who, are they really related and that sort of thing.  Is, is that that--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  In fact--
Speaker 1: Property disputes, and--
Speaker 2: Sure.  A story that I often tell when I'm talking to beginning genealogists and also intermediate genealogists, is, is to place the role of genealogy, the science of genealogy and professional genealogists into perspective.  If a person dies and they don't have a will, we say they die intestate.  But let's say they had a sizable estate, with a will, the will determines who are the heirs to that estate and who gets what portions of that estate.  The majority of which maybe family members, but you can will property to nonfamily members.  If a person dies intestate, meaning they don't have a will, then the probate court decides who gets the proceeds of that estate based on the law in that particular state, and it varies by state, and even by time period.  But what will happen is if the, that estate is sizable, then people are going to be crawling out the woodworks stating that they're related to that deceased.  The court doesn't know who's related to that deceased, but there's laws stating who gets what portions based on state law, and based on how people are related to the deceased, whether their spouse is still living or not, whether parents are stilling living or not, if they had children and if they're still living, et cetera, et cetera.  So what the court does in some instances, is hire a professional genealogist to come into court to provide evidence in the court to determine who is legally related to the deceased so they can determine who gets what portion and which shares of that estate.  So that's one role that professional genealogists do play.  But the other thing it does is by those rules, in the probate court, that legally determines who's related.  Well those rules, those legal rules in that probate court are some of the same guidelines we use as genealogists to not only say who our ancestors are, but actually prove who our ancestors are.  So in the process of doing genealogy, we're collecting bits and pieces of evidence to prove who our ancestors are because oftentimes we'll go into the record and find two or three or four individuals with the same name in a small community.  So our job as a genealogist is to sort out those two, three, or four individuals and to determine which one is our ancestor, and who the other people are that just happen to have the same name.  And the court of law are some of the guidelines we use in sorting out who those people are, what kind of evidence we submit, how that evidence is weighed, and how it's judged being either true or false.  So genealogy is not just a hobby (air quotes), I mean it, it can be very serious if you wanna actually prove who your ancestors are, and if you want to apply to a lineage society like the Mayflower Society, the Daughters of the American Revolution, the son- the, the Daughters of the Confederacy [United Daughters of the Confederacy], or any of these other lineage societies, then you're bound by what kind of evidence you can submit and how you construct that genealogical research.  So I always instruct genealogists, African American genealogists as well as other genealogists, you need--you need to be aware of those rules, you need, need to be aware of evaluating that evidence, you need to be aware of those techniques and not only be aware of them but you need to join these organizations so you can actually submit your evidence to prove you do what you purport to do.  As well as become certified, and there's a Board for Certification of Genealogists where you can get any number of different types of certifications, so again, you're proving that you're doing what you purport to do.  And in the process of doing these things, you become a better genealogist because you learn about different techniques, you learn about different pieces of evidence, and you learn how to construct that evidence.  And when you don't have direct evidence to prove an allegation you learn how to construct a circumstantial evidence case using a preponderance of the evidence in order to still prove your case.  So all of these things help you not only learn about genealogy but become a better genealogist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So yes, to answer your initial question, there's all different types of professional genealogists.
Story_ID: 611838
Speaker 1: Back to your earlier question about me speaking and speaking on a local level and then starting to speak at, at a national level, by me joining this national board [Board for Certification of Genealogists], then I was invited to give lectures.  When I started attending the African American conference in Washington, D.C. and looking at some of the lectures that were given there, I said, well, I can give some lectures on some research that I've been doing.  So I started giving lectures at the African American society [Afro American Genealogical and Historical Society, Inc., Washington, D.C.].  And then from there I started giving lectures on the national level for the major white organizations.  And as I started giving lectures--initially they were on African American genealogy, but there were a lot of whites that attended my lectures on after African American genealogy because oftentimes they were librarians, they had to deal with African American patrons.  Sometimes they were professional genealogists that had to deal with African American clients.  And there were some people, whites that had had African American ancestors.  There were some whites that had known me and then after I started giving one or two lectures and people saw that the lectures that I was giving on African American, it was using sound fundamental techniques that they could use for their research.  So eventually they started asking me to give lectures that had nothing to do with African American genealogy; they were just on basic genealogy.  One of my major breakthroughs was being invited to give a lecture at a national conference in Dallas, Texas in 1997.  And the lady who was a conference chair said, "I don't want you to talk about black genealogy, 'cause I know you do found--sound, fundamental genealogy. I want you to give a lecture on just fundamental genealogy."  And she said she knew I do a lot of, I did a lot of things that deal with chronologies.  So she wanted me to put together a lecture for that.  So I worked on it very hard and it was one I titled, Creating Order out of Chaos, which was how to use chronologies in, in doing your research.  And amazing to me, as well as to her, as she was getting registration forms in, she said, "Well you're," (laughter), "well actually you're starting to become pretty popular."  And before the conference started she was tracking all these lectures so they knew which rooms to assign, my lecture happened to be the largest lecture that people had preregistered for, which again was a surprise to me and a surprise to her too.  But the other thing was that it turned out to be one of my best lectures because it started off with a lot of laughs and turned out to be some real big laughs that got people, you know, really humorous and really into what I was talking about, and it ended with a, a big crescendo with a big humorous part, and it turned out to be one of my, my most successful lectures, and the most successful one at the conference.  And so many people had attended that that I started developing a much larger reputation, so I got a lot other speaking requests at different libraries, at different archives, different societies, and whatever, and things started to grow and, and started to mushroom.
Story_ID: 611839
Speaker 1: So I started speaking a lot more at national conferences, African American well as, you know, predominantly white conferences.  And then I was asked to join additional boards that were on a national level, and some international boards, like the, the board of--Association of Professional Genealogists is an international board.  The New England historical genealogical society [New England Historic Genealogical Society, Boston, Massachusetts] was really an international board because they do a lot of things, you know, with England and Ireland.  Pri- predominantly England and Ireland but a lot of things with, with French Canadian, with, with French Canadian as well as European Canadian or English Canadian and then other things, you know, in, in Germany and, and France also.  As well as I started going to Canada researching the Underground Railroad and I was invited to speak at the--the Ontario Genealogical Society in Ontario, Canada, has a annual lecture.  And I had found out about that in conjunction with the Underground Railroad research that I was doing.  And they, their conference was being held in Chatham, Canada [Chatham-Kent, Canada], which Chatham is where John Brown planned his raid on Harpers Ferry [West Virginia].  That's also where Fergie Jenkinson [sic. Ferguson Jenkins] came from who was a pitcher for the Chicago Cubs.  And so there was always a black presence in Chatham.  And a lot of blacks from America had escaped slavery, gone through the Underground Railroad and settled in Chatham.  So they were having their annual conference in Chatham to try to play up the Underground Railroad.  I was trying to research the Underground Railroad to use in genealogy to develop a technique of tracing African Americans from America to Canada and back and forth through the Underground Railroad.  So I submitted a lecture to them, they accepted that, so that was my first Canadian lecture.  I met some other folks there, Bryan [Bryan Prince] and, and Shannon Prince who operated a museum in Buxton, Canada [Raleigh Township Centennial Museum; Buxton National Historic Site and Museum].  They started having a, a conference, genealogy and history conference [Canadian/U.S. Black History and Genealogy Conference], so they invited me every year to speak at their conference and I've been speaking up in Canada for about seven or eight years.  So along with Canada and being on these other international boards then people overseas started learning about me as well as some of the TV programs that I was in also.
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 1: In 1996 you won the Distinguished Service Award from the National Genealogical Society.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then, then in, and well I--that, you know, I don't know, know if we have to explain that but, but in 1997, '7 [1997], you were a part of the PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] series 'Ancestors,' you were featured.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Which was a big deal.
Speaker 2: In 1995, really, '94 [1994], '95 [1995], I was invited to be one of three co-authors of the 'African American Genealogical Sourcebook' [ed. Paula Byers].  It was the first major publication done in like seventeen years.  It was done by a commercial publisher, Gale Research [Gale Cengage] who's a library publisher.  I wrote that chapter ["Records Specific to African Americans," Tony Burroughs] and I was, I was planning on doing a book on the Freedmen's Bureau [Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands], which was my primary research and how the Freedmen's Bureau can be used for African American genealogy.  The Freedmen's Bureau got started right after the Civil War, transitioning slaves and also refugees from a wartime to peacetime economy.  There was about a dozen different records in the Freedmen's Bureau that are very, very instrumental for doing African American genealogy.  I had learned about them from, from the institute of genealogical research [National Institute on Genealogical Research] and researching at the National Archives [National Archives and Records Administration] and my work with Jimmy Walker [James Dent Walker].  And no one had really written anything substantial on them and I was doing a lot of research on them and I gave my first national lecture on using records from the Freedmen's Bureau.  It was very well received, and I was planning to write a book on using Freedmen's Bureau for genealogy.  Well when I was invited to do this chapter in the 'African American Genealogical Sourcebook,' I was really, didn't know what to do because it would involve all this research I was doing for the Freedmen's Bureau, which I had planned to do an independent book on.  And this work for Gale Research was a work for hire, so they would own the copyright to that.  So I felt like I couldn't do my own book on the Freedmen's Bureau.  But in the end, you know, I decided that this is a major publication, I would get a lot of exposure for that, so I sacrificed doing my individual book and I did that for Gale Research.  It was so well received that was in large part why I got the Distinguished Service Award from the National Genealogical Society.  Again the, the Distinguished Service Award by writing a book, you know, writing a chapter, you know, in the sourcebook and doing my other lectures on the national circuit and being a part of these boards, I was becoming known as the expert in African American genealogy.  So BYU [BYU Broadcasting] was putting together a program on genealogy called 'Ancestors.'  They started to ask around because they wanted an episode on African American genealogy and everybody said well you need to get Tony Burroughs [HistoryMaker Anthony "Tony" Preston Burroughs] because he's the expert in the field (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, now this is BYU, Brigham Young University [Provo, Utah]?
Speaker 2: Brigham Young University, right.  Brigham Young University has a communication department so they have a, a TV program--I think they have a TV program, I guess, so.  So they're the ones that had decided to do a genealogy series.  And they decided to do it on PBS.  So it was national in scope, it ran on, I think, something like 471 PBS affiliates throughout the U.S.  There were ten episodes, one of the episodes was on African American genealogy.  So I was invited to do that episode.  The first part of the episode was filming a meeting of the California African American Genealogical Society [California African American Genealogical Society, Inc.].  The second part was me talking about techniques, records, and resources on how to do African American genealogy.  So that in turn enhanced my reputation from, from doing that series.  That series not only aired on 471 stations, but they had a contract to air it for three years.  In part, that exposure helped me get the contract with Simon Schuster [Simon and Schuster, Inc.], because Simon Schuster knew that I was going to be getting three years' exposure on over four hundred stations throughout the U.S. and that was like free publicity for them.  So obviously that worked out very well, you know, for me.  In 2000 they came back with a sequel to 'Ancestors,' again, KBYU [KBYU-TV, Provo, Utah], which is the broadcasting arm of BYU, decided to do a sequel, this one did not have an African American episode to it; they decided to just talk about different types of records.  So they had me in that series on about six different episodes just talking generally about different types of records that anybody can use, not specifically on African American genealogy.  So again, I got a lot of very, very good exposure with that particular series also.
Story_ID: 611841
Speaker 1: Recently in 2004 you were involved with a, in a television series where you were searching the, researching the family of Jesus ['The Real Family of Jesus'].  Now this is probably--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --one of the most incredible--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 1: --of, of your, your adventures, I think.  I don't know.
Speaker 2: Yes.  In January of 2004, I got an email from the religion department of the BBC [British Broadcasting Corporation], and they were, had been doing research on doing a project on the genealogy of Jesus.  And they asked me did I wanna be involved in it, and I told 'em no (laughter).  I said I'm not a very religious person, and I don't research that time period, they were talking about during the biblical period.  I told them I do modern genealogy, 18, 19, 20th century research.  I said if you're doing something that involves modern genealogy then, you know, you know, give me a call back, you know, and we can talk about it, you know.  So a period of time left after that, and they contacted me again.  I was told that they had--I wasn't told directly at the time, I was told later they had looked at about fifteen other genealogists in the U.S. as well as in the U.K. [United Kingdom].  They had seen the work I had done on PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] and they had liked what I had done.  They had done research on my reputation and they had liked that.  And they were intrigued by the fact that I was doing African American genealogy and the complications of African American genealogy mixed in with the complications of doing biblical genealogy of Jesus, and he thought that would be a good mix.  So they went back to their producers and they said well what if we have him interview these religious scholars who are really the experts in this field.  So they came back to me and said, "Well, what about if we have you interview these experts, you know, since that's one of the things that you do."  And looking at it that way, I said, well that's much more to my liking, you know.  I was still kind of t- you know, problem--or I had some, some problems with it being a religious program, not being a very religious program myself, and understanding religious controversies.  Because after they contacted me I started doing some research on my own.  And then I realized that anything you do involving religion is controversial, no matter which position that you take.  Because different religions, you know, have fights with each other as well as within religions, you know, there's a lot of differences of opinion (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Interdenominational.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, very, very, very much so.  And I really did not wanna get embroiled in a religious controversy.  So it was a very, very difficult decision, you know, to, to work with a project.  And I thought about it a whole lot, I talked a lot--I talked to a lot of my colleagues in genealogy about it and tried to get a lot of different opinions.  And then after I, I thought about it and, and studied it, and slept on it, I finally made a decision to do it.  I thought that--in the long run I thought that it was a very important project, a very significant project, I would learn a lot on the project and I thought it would do a lot for my career also.  I hoped that I could steer away with some of the controversial aspects and I decided to do some research on my own on these things so that when something controversial came up that at least I had some kind of intelligence to try to deal with that whole issue.
Story_ID: 611842
Speaker 1: Now the name of the program was 'The Real Family of Jesus' produced by (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --BBC [British Broadcasting Corporation] and Discovery Channel, right?  I believe?
Speaker 2: Right, right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Now that, that's pretty much a, that's like, pitching a softball right down--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --'The Real Family of Jesus,' you know.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And I never really--
Speaker 1: It seems like they're heading right for a controversy.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, exactly.  I never agreed with that title.
Speaker 1: Not let's explore, not, let's explore the--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: --just, the real family.
Speaker 2: Right, right, exactly.  After I started to learn about the project it really wasn't genealogical in nature.  When we think about genealogy we're talking about taking a person and taking their ancestry going backward.  And it really wasn't about researching his ancestry.  It was really about revealing his siblings, his brothers, sisters, as well as aunts, uncles and cousins.  What the majority of people did not realize, or do not realize, is that Jesus had siblings.  Jesus, we get the impression that Jesus was an only child, that's the impression I grew up with.  And obviously that's the impression a lot of people grew up with, which is why the BBC decided to do a project on it.  And many people that I've talked to after it aired said the exact same thing: that they always thought Jesus was an only child.
Speaker 1: Well that's based on the, the Bible, I mean the New Testament that we--the King James Version, right?  Where you kind of see, if you read the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, no, the New Testament does talk about his siblings.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: You know.  It doesn't talk a lot about them, but it does mention them in a couple passages.  But it's more or less downplayed, you know.  And unless you read, you know, very finely on all these different things, you know, it would kind of like totally eclipse you, because they're not the main focus, you know.  They're very, very marginalized and only mentioned in, in, you know, a couple different areas.  Because interestingly, even some of the scholars that I interviewed were not even aware that Jesus had brothers and sisters, you know.  The fact that they had to sit down and really go through it and try to deal with--.  The, the basic philosophy of the Catholic church was even that he did not have blood brothers and sisters, you know.  That Mary was a virgin from beginning to end, and that passages of the Bible where they used the word brother, were actually, could be interpreted as referring to nephews and uncles versus a blood brother.  So it was a matter of interpretation.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I guess, likewise when they do his ancestry in the Bible when they try to trace him back to Adam or something, I mean, there's a couple (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Back to David actually, King David, right.
Speaker 1: They--that's--they trace him through Joseph who was not really his father, right?  I mean not--
Speaker 2: Supposedly, right, right.
Speaker 1: --not, not blood father.
Speaker 2: Right, supposedly, yes, yes, yes, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: So there's a lot of problems then.
Speaker 2: Right, right, exactly.  So just by those things can become somewhat controversial.  What satisfied me in my mind to work with the project, was I was very impressed with the BBC.  I was impressed with research and documentaries and programs that they've had that are nonreligious.  I was very impressed with the detail and the level of research that they did for this project, and I was also impressed with the reputations of the religious scholars that we dealt with that had impeccable reputations.  None of which I had known about before because again this is not my area, you know.  So by knowing the quality and the detail and, and the scholarly s- and the level of scholarly research that they do, then I was comfortable with working with the project.  The project dealt with--filming in Chicago [Illinois], they filmed me with my family doing research in Chicago.  Dealt with research at Oxford [University of Oxford, Oxford, England] where I interviewed a scholar in, in Oxford as well as doing some research there.  And going to Israel, interviewing some scholars in Israel as well as traveling to the places where Jesus and his family lived throughout Israel, and then the roles that his family played in his mission.  And one of things that I didn't realize was his family was an integral part of all of that and played a large role after he had died.  So all of this was a, a learning process for me.  I was learning something each and every day, research I had done on my own, as well as, you know, throughout the whole project.  The BBC actually wrote the script, they interviewed me as part of the research on how to do genealogy and how that should be incorporated in the project.  As well as when the script was, was written, I reviewed the script, I made a number of, of changes based on my research and my knowledge and they accepted almost everything that I had recommended other than some things that came up late and it was like really, you know, like too late to really change.  But I gave them a lot of respect as to how they, you know, researched the project, how they organized it, how they filmed it, how they edited it, you know.  So I was very honored, you know, to be a part of that project.
Story_ID: 611843
Speaker 1: Just a couple questions here--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and probably--we're almost out of time on this tape but--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --is there a real historic family for Jesus that, I mean, that can be shown and, and who are they (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And if they are there, who are they?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  He had two sisters and four brothers.  And using the research from the Bible and, and subsequently, you know, after the, the program ['The Real Family of Jesus'] aired I got a lot of feedback as you can imagine, locally as well as international feedback.  And one of the emails that I got was from a, a guy who is obviously Catholic and explained this whole controversy about Mary being a virgin and Jesus not having any blood brothers and sisters.  And I had heard about the argument, but I had never seen it detailed the way he had outlined it to me.  I subsequently did some additional research on it, and I found an individual, a scholar we did not interview, who was the foremost authority on historical Jesus, John Meier [John P. Meier] who is a Catholic priest, who taught at Catholic University [The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C.] I think for ten or twelve years and chaired the religion department [Department of Theology] at, at, at Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana] who says that Jesus did have blood brothers and sisters.
Story_ID: 611844
Speaker 1: Let's talk a bit about your contributions to the field of African American genealogy.
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  What I've done is developed a couple of new techniques to use in African American genealogy.  I tell people in a heartbeat that African American genealogy is in its infancy stages.  We've only been doing genealogy for about twenty-five years, you know, since Alex Haley.  But Alex Haley didn't give us a road map on how to do it, so African American genealogists have been, you know, kind of going by trial and error.  There was an early book came out called 'Black Genealogy' by [HistoryMaker] Charles Blockson.  But Charles Blockson was not really a genealogist, he was a African American collector, and so he collected memorabilia.  And in his book he had things that had to do with documents and whatever, but it was not fundamental techniques of doing genealogy.  My book is a beginner's guide to get people started into it, and I have a lot of innovative things in, in my book, 'Black Roots' ['Black Roots: A Beginners Guide to Tracing the African American Family Tree,' Tony Burroughs], but once you get to the intermediate and advanced level then it tends to become very, very complicated and very challenging.  And I've made some breakthroughs in those areas, I just haven't written about them yet, I've lectured about them, but I haven't written about 'em.  I found out--one, one of the, one of the problems I initially had when I started doing genealogy is I was able to trace my family back in South Carolina on my dad's [Elmer Burroughs] side, the Burroughs line.  They first came to Chicago [Illinois] in 1887, Morris Burroughs was my great-grandfather who was a Pullman porter, he was working for the Pullman Company [Pullman Palace Car Company] in 1887.  And I have it documented through the payroll records in the Pullman collection at Newberry Library [Chicago, Illinois].  Everything indicated he came from Spartanburg, South Carolina, but I could never find him on any records in Spartanburg.  I did find a slave owner by the name of Burroughs, Cynthia Burroughs [ph.], who was a slave owner in 1860 in Spartanburg County [South Carolina], and she owned five slaves.  Even to this day I do not have a list of those five slaves that she had owned.  And I thought that she was the owner of my ancestors, seeing that she was from Spartanburg, her name was Burroughs, all the indications I had from my--Morris Burroughs was that, my great-grandfather that he was from Spartanburg.  I looked in the 1880 census and didn't find him in Spartanburg.  Looked in the 1870 census didn't find him in Spartanburg.  And I looked at that 1870 census, line by line, it took me three hours to go through the whole county, Spartanburg is a town as well as a county, I went through that whole county, line by line, it took me three hours, didn't find him.  Years later I went back again thinking well maybe I was rushing, I spent three hours again still didn't find him.  Well subsequently I started doing research around 1991, again doing historical research along with genealogical research, and I ran across this book about 'The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom' ['The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom, 1750-1925'] by Herbert Gutman.  In Herbert Gutman's book he has a chapter on naming practices.  And Gutman researched a lot of records from the National Archives [National Archives and Records Administration].  Some of the records there indicated the name of former slaves from essentially Freedmen's Bureau records and other records too, I believe, I know it was definitely Freedmen's Bureau [Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands] records, where the record indicated the name of that person who was a former slave, and the name of his former slave owner.  And oftentimes that name was different which freaked me out because I assumed that the names should be the same 'cause I was always led to believe that we took the name of the slave owner, I knew our African names were gone.  Well I kept reading that chapter and I found all these different instances and it really intrigued me.  So what I did was I took all the cases that he had and I entered it into my computer.  And then I realized that it was completely different than what I had imagined.  I entered them into a spreadsheet so I could total up the columns.  And I saw that the majority had a name other than the former slave owner, which is exactly the opposite of what I had thought.  David Thackery who was a curator of local and family history at Newberry Library [Chicago, Illinois] wrote an article in Newberry Library newsletter, I think it was called Origins, where he did a case study on some Kentucky freedmen and I think there was something like eighty, eighty-five different individuals, none of them had the same name as the last slave owner.  And I said, wow.  So I entered that in my computer also.
Story_ID: 611845
Speaker 1: Then the records I had looked at from, that Jimmy Walker [James Dent Walker] had turned me on to, they weren't from the Freedmen's Bureau [Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands] these were from the U.S. Army Continental Commands, which was the actual army as they were going around during the Civil War.  They had made a census of inhabitants in South Carolina in 1864 and they called it a census, but it was just a register of people that lived, you know, in that area.  And, and now I think it was actually a contraband camp.  And in that they listed the person's name, where they were from, where they were living, and they also listed the name of the former slave owner.  And so I took that data, and I counted up all the names and which one had the same name as the former slave owner, and which one had a name different than the former slave owner and I entered that into my computer.  And every time I ran across a record or a study or an article that a former slave indicated his former slave owner, I entered those into my computer.  A lady was doing a--Agnes Kane Callum who is a African American genealogist out in Baltimore [Maryland], she had done some research on, I think, it was the 7th U.S. Colored Troops [7th Regiment Infantry] where her ancestors participated in, and in their, their payrolls or some records she had, they indicated the name of the former slave owner and I entered that in my computer.  So every time I ran across that, I entered it in the computer and I plan to publish this, I'm way behind on publishing it (laughter) I'm gonna try to do that this year.  The final totals that I had were over five thousand cases, or five thousand individuals, less than 15 percent had the same name as the last slave owner.  Now to me this was totally against conventional wisdom.  And so what I started to do was, if you know that that's reality, then if you trace your ancestors back to 1870 and you start to look at an 1860 slave schedule, in 1860 the U.S. census had two population schedules.  One was a population of free inhabitants and one was a schedule of slave inhabitants.  And on there they list the name of the slave owner and the numbers of slaves that that owner owned; there's no names on there.  The reason there's no names on that slave schedule is that the census, the, the bureau of the census [U.S. Census Bureau] was not interested in collecting names of slaves.  They were interested in the numbers of slaves in those communities.  I'm sure you've heard of the phrase three fifths of a man, and that slaves were counted as three fifths of a man, but people don't know where that phrase came from, or why they use it.  It was used because this was used in--the census was taken not for genealogy but to determine how many people went to the [U.S.] House of Representatives for each state, and how many went from local communities and it was based on population, whereas the [U.S.] Senate you get two senators from each state, so that's standard.  House of Representatives is based on population.  When they were having the constitutional convention there were more white males of voting age in the North than there were in the South, so therefore the North would control the country because they had the numbers.  The South offered a compromise: hey, what if we include our slaves and then we could equalize this out.  Well they didn't wanna include slaves as whole numbers and they compromised in having them being counted as three fifths of a person.
Speaker 2: Because they couldn't vote.
Speaker 1: Right, they couldn't vote, there was no way they were gonna vote.  But they included them in the numbers to determine who went to the House of Representatives, so that's why we heard this three fifths of a person.  So when you look at the census records each slave is enumerated there just so they can count up the numbers of three fifths.
Story_ID: 611846
Speaker 1: So for in genealogy that puts us at a disadvantage 'cause whites can look at the free population schedule and see the names of their ancestors, we cannot.  But what African American genealogists tried to do was find their ancestors on the 1870 census, see what their age was and their sex was, then find a white slave owner in that same community with that same surname and try to match up the ages and the sex.  And if they don't match up then they had these creative reasons of why they didn't match up, not realizing those probably weren't their ancestors, or probably not their ancestors, which is what I tried to do.  Which is what David States [sic. David Streets] advocated in his book 'Slave Genealogy' ['Slave Genealogy: A Research Guide with Case Studies'].  Well, once I had read these things about Herbert Gutman and I started doing my study on naming practices, and when I totaled it up and it equaled somewhere around 15 percent had the same name, I said, if you use that philosophy, then 85 percent of the time you're looking for the wrong individual.  So I realize not only could I benefit from this, but African American genealogists around the country can benefit by knowing this statistic because they're looking for the wrong individual; they're doing their genealogy based on an assumption, assuming that person had the la- same last name, rather than basing it on statistics stating that, you know, it's really a long shot if they had the same name.  And there's a variety of reasons why that name could be different.  One, they could have been sold numerous times from one family to another, but retained this one particular surname that they happened to be using after the Civil War.  Two, they could have stayed in the same household, but a slave owner could have had no sons, his daughter inherited his property, she got married and her surname changed, her daughter could have inherited her property, she married and her surname changed, so at the end of the Civil War there could have been no sales of slaves within that family, but the end of the Civil War, if that freed person went by the name of that original slave owner, they could have done that, but that last slave owner was that female who had a surname different from her grandfather because of her marriages.  So there's a variety of reasons why their name could be different.  The other thing that I maintained through reading Herbert Gutman and looking at some of the records is the fact that in some instances, and I don't know how many, some slaves had surnames.  And they indicated that they had surnames, but the slave owner didn't know it.  In other instances where the slave owner knew it, he didn't recognize it, he said that's old slave talk, you know.  But the thing that we often forget that is during slavery, slaves were considered property and this was a facade set up to justify dehumanizing people and mistreating people and buying and selling people, so therefore they created this thing of property.  But even though the slave owner looked upon black people as property, those enslaved Africans didn't--did not look upon themselves as property; they looked upon themselves as human beings.  And they said, you have a surname, I have a surname, whether you recognize it or not, I still have a surname.  And they retained surnames from their ancestors so they can keep ties to their ancestors.  So in effect they were doing genealogy, whether the owner recognized it or not.  It's only after the Civil War are they able to use these surnames legally.  So this is one of the things that I explain and express to people in doing genealogy, merging that history along with genealogy.
Story_ID: 611847
Speaker 1: There's also some instances too of people who only took a surname after the Civil, after the Civil War was over.  I know that we've interviewed a couple of them.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: One, one in particular is Kojo--Cur- Curtis Morrow [HistoryMaker Curtis "Kojo" Morrow], you might know him, he's a, he's an artist, and he writes--
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: --he's written about his experiences in Korea and--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Africa.  But his ancestor was given the name Morrow by the Union Army.  And he has a funny story about it, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: His ancestor wanted to be George Washington and they--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --they said, no we had enough of those already so.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, right.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) the last name of Morrow--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --they, they called him George Washington Morrow [sic. George Wash Morrow].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.  Well where did the Morrow come from?
Speaker 1: Well they said somebody, he was taking up too much time, and somebody yelled from the back of the line: "Come back tomorrow."
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter).  Well, well it would be interesting to see if that story is documented in the pension application file.  Did he know that from oral history, or did he have the pension application file (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oral history.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well--
Speaker 1: That's the tradition in his family.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's tradition.  That may or may not be true.  It, it'd be interesting to see what's in his pension application file.  And I don't know if that gentleman's researched, you know, the Civil War and got his ancestor's pension application, or if his ancestor applied for a pension, you know.  I would take that as oral history but I would keep it as a grain of salt and I would look for the documentary evidence to support or deny that.  There were individuals that did quote, quote (air quotes) take surnames or take names, yeah, given names and surnames, and I've seen them mention that in records.  I don't know how many of that--I don't know the percentage of those that did it.  Another part of my study is to try to quantify the reasons of different surnames.  And that's a project that I'm, I've been working on just a little, but it's related, you know, to the major project of coming up with the statistics on when they're the same and when they're different.  So understanding that, and educating people on that, one of the things that I've developed is what I call methods and sources of identifying the slave owner.  So with that, what I do is I educate people as to what records exist, where the former slave indicates the name of his former slave owner.  So for example in the military pension application files through the Civil War, they fill out a deposition or an affidavit indicating the name that they're going by now as a civilian and the name they went by in the [U.S. military] service, and if that name was the same or if the name was different and sometimes why it was different.  There are ex-slave narratives.  And in the ex-slave narratives they talk about their time during slavery and who the name of their slave owner was.  So slave narratives, primarily done through the 1930s and '40s [1940s] but some of 'em done earlier than that, they indicate the name of their former slave owner.  I found incidences, or, or some of my colleagues have found incidences in county histories where they've indicated the name of their former slave owner.  In court depositions, they've indicated the name of former slave owner.  I've seen divorce records where they've indicated the name of their former slave owner.  So one of the techniques that I've developed is first telling people that the surname you're searching for might not be the right surname but also giving them resources where they have records where they can find documentary evidence of who that former slave owner was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's significant 'cause--
Speaker 2: Very significant.
Speaker 1: To think 85 percent of us are on the wrong track.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, absolutely.  I mean, it was very revealing to me.
Story_ID: 611848
Speaker 1: The other thing is that when I was, when I was doing genealogy and meeting different relatives around the country, I met a relative in, a couple of relatives in Cincinnati [Ohio] that were related to my South Carolina Burroughs' ancestors.  And in meeting them I got some oral history from them and they told me that our ancestors were given land by the former slave owner.  So I went back to South Carolina and I looked in the land deeds and I found that ancestor, it was a common ancestor between my family and the family in Cincinnati, and I found the land transaction.  This African American woman by the name of Ellen Burroughs had received land from a former slave owner, but the person she got the land from was named Twitty, T-W-I-T-T-Y [Lafayette Twitty].  So then I'm saying, well is the former slave owner Burroughs or is it Twitty?  And, you know, I, I really didn't know but it caused me to go off in researching this Twitty who owned six slaves in Spartanburg [Spartanburg County, South Carolina], you know, in 1860 prior to the Civil War.  So I'm like checking out both of these individuals.  Now, in the meantime, I still never found my ancestors on the 1880 or the 1870 census in Spartanburg.  Well one year I was out in Salt Lake City [Utah], this board I was on, the Federation of Genealogical Societies, had two board meetings a year.  One meeting was at the national conference wherever, wherever it was at around the country, which is another reason why I was able to speak on the national circuit because I was able to get speaking engagements where, where we were having a board meeting.  But our winter board meeting was in Salt Lake City.  So in addition of attending the board meeting then I would do research there.  Salt Lake City is where the Mormons have their Family History Library, which is the largest genealogy library in the world.  So I'd always do research there, spend a couple days after the board meeting.  One of the, one of my colleagues joined me out there from Chicago [Illinois], African American, Cristal Simmons [Cristal R. Simmons].  And she had researched her family back to the antebellum period in Kentucky, Todd County, Kentucky.  And they were free in 1860, I think they might have even been free in 1850.  And she was researching an individual with the first name of Underwood, his last was McCoy.  But she was also researching this Bristow family, and she could not find her Underwild--Underwood Bristow, but she found this Underwood McCoy.  And since Underwood is a very unusual first name, she wondered was it the same individual, even though he had a different last name.  So she wanted me to come up to her hotel room and, and look at it and analyze it for her.  And I went up there and I looked at it and looked at it and looked at it, and finally after a while I saw it was either three or four distinct families enumerated all together.  It was this huge family all with the name of--now I can't remember the, yeah, it was Bristow but they were grouped by age, so if you looked at the grouping by age, you could see four distinct families.  So I, I deduced that this was her right ancestor, but what had happened was the census enumerator, as told to him by his supervisors, is to record the name of the head of household, which he did.  Everyone under there he recorded with the same surname, even though there were four families there because he had like ditto marks.  So there was only the surname of the head of the household and everybody else appeared to have the same surname but in fact were four distinct families.  So this in fact was her particular ancestor.  So at first I thought that was like an aberration.
Story_ID: 611849
Speaker 1: Well a little bit earlier than that there was another researcher, African American researcher here in Chicago [Illinois] by the name of, of Nettie Nesbary.  And she had ancestors from Mississippi.  And she was the first person I knew that bought a microfilm machine.  And she would go to the National Archives [National Archives at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], but she worked a nine to five job.  And so when she got the archives she was always rushing, you know, didn't have enough time to complete her research.  So she actually bought a microfilm machine at home, she rented the microfilm, and then on the weekends when she had time, she could slowly go through the microfilm reel and find--and look for her ancestors.  Well in doing that, she found her ancestors in 1880, where previously she had only, I mean, in 1870, where previously she had only found them in 1880--excuse me.  The reason she found them this time in 1870 was because they were under a different surname.  She knew it was the same family because it was in a family unit, the first names were same--the same, and the ages were the same, I mean, like ten years earlier in the ten year earlier census.  So she knew that they were the same family.  She was familiar with the surname because there were some slave owners she was tracing that had the same surname.  So when I saw that from Nettie, I thought it was an example of people like rushing into research and they need to take their time.  But when I was in Salt Lake [Salt Lake City, Utah] and I was able to help Cristal [Cristal R. Simmons] solve her problem with this Underwood [ph.], McCoy [ph.] and Bristow [ph.], I thought about Nettie and how she had hers that was the same family with two different surnames.  Then I thought about my ancestor who I couldn't find in 1880 or 1870 in Spartanburg [Spartanburg County, South Carolina] and I said well, I wonder if they're there but they're actually under a different surname, just like Nettie's and just like Cristal's.  So I resolved to go back and look again for the third time, 'cause remember I had looked for these people in Spartanburg twice, it took me three hours each time, that was six hours of negative research, but I'm willing to go back for the third time to look again, but this time I'm gonna search a little differently, and instead of searching under the surname Burroughs, I'm gonna look under his first name, Morris [Burroughs' paternal great-grandfather, Morris Burroughs], then if the surname is differently, I'm still gonna pick it up and I'm gonna jot down every person by the name of Boris--Morris, no matter what their surname is and see if it makes some kind of sense.  I'm also not gonna look at the complexion, the race column, because I have some ancestors that are very light skinned and listed as blacks on some census and white on others, so I'm not gonna look at the race column.  And I've jokingly said to people I'm not gone look at the sex column either but (laughter), I'm just gone look at everybody named Morris.  I did that and I found it in about fifteen minutes.  And there he was listed under a different surname, under the name Norton.  The person who's above him, who appears to be his mother is named Ellen Norton.  She's a s- the, it appears to be the same person I found in real estate records who got the land from Lafayette Twitty listed as Ellen Burroughs.  Person below him appears to be his sister named Charlotte Norton, is the same one in 1880 listed under Ellen Burroughs living with--I mean listed as Charlotte Clemons [Charlotte Burroughs Clemons] actually, with Ellen Burroughs as her daughter.  So in 1880, Charlotte and Ellen are the same ages, just ten years different as they are in 1870, and whereas Ellen and Charlotte are living together in 1870, they're living together in 1880 as mother and daughter, although Charlotte is married at this time, so I deduce that this is the exact same family.  Morris listed as Norton is the same age that he should be based on all the other records I have for him from 1887 up to the time he died in, in, in 1903.  So I deduce that this is the same family.  Why he's listed as Norton, I have no idea.  However, I combined that experience of using Nettie, Cristal, and my research into a broader situation to help other African Americans of what I call the Nettie Rule.  And I've subsequently found other researchers, some of my students have shared with me where they found two families with different surnames wondering if it was the same family.  And I said yes it is and I've included them in my case study.  So my study in terms of the Nettie Rule states that if you find ancestors in 1880, and you don't find them in 1870, don't look under the last name, look under the first name.  So it's a different way to search, and it lets people know that they might find their ancestors under a different surname.  Especially combined with the research that I did under Herbert Gutman understanding that, you know, African Americans may be listed under different names.  So I wrote an article on that for Heritage Quest magazine in 2001 ['Finding African Americans on the 1870 Census,' Tony Burroughs], to not only do my family, Cristal's family, Nettie's family, but about three other families that all had the same phenomenon.  So I think that that it's more a rule than a aberration that African Americans can find their ancestors on the--under a different surname in 1880--1870 as they do in 1870 [sic.].  So those are two or three of, kind of like groundbreaking things that I've made in, in African American genealogy.  As well as the stuff from the Freedmen's Bureau [Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands] that that people had not integrated, you know, into African American genealogy.
Story_ID: 611850
Speaker 1: Subsequently I've done research into contraband camps.  And I've just given my first lecture this year on contraband camps and let people know that researching contraband camps is an extension of researching the Freedmen's Bureau [Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands] because the work that went on in the contraband camps folded over into the Freedmen's Bureau.  As well as researching the contraband camps, I was able to find out why the sl- the name of the slave owner was listed in Freedmen's Bureau records as well as [U.S.] military records.  Which is essentially--because when the first contrabands went to Fortress Monroe [Fort Monroe, Virginia] and they had left their plantations and joined, you know, the Union troops [Union Army]. And the Union troops initially sent them back to the Confederates [Confederate Army] and said this war [Civil War] is not about slavery, it's about saving the Union, but they saw they were being put to use to build Confederate fortifications, as many slaves were, they said, we're not sending you back any more.  So then they declared them a contraband of war and then any slaves that left the plantations would be held behind, you know, Union lines and they were set up in, in contraband camps.  Once they left, there was no way of telling if their former owner was loyal to the Union or not.  So they said that what they would do is they would record the name of the owner and then after the war determine if they were loyal or not, and if they were loyal, they determined that the [U.S.] Congress would probably supply them with compensation for losing their slaves.  So this is a new area, you know, that I've just gotten into.
Story_ID: 611851
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about the will?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Most of the research I've been talking about has been on my, my father's [Elmer Burroughs] side of the family.  On my mother's side of the family, my mom [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs] was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and my ancestors, you know, had been in Pennsylvania for decades and decades.  What I had done is I had researched them back to 1810, they were actually free in Pennsylvania because Pennsylvania did have slavery in Pennsylvania, but it was the first state that passed a law to abolish slavery in 1780, but it was a gradual abolition act [An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery of 1780].  I had no idea my ancestors were free in Pennsylvania back to 1810.  Trying to get 'em back further than that, I had a very, very difficult time.  My ancestor--my seventh generation ancestor was named David Truman.  And again I was looking for all these Trumans and I, and, and the, there were white Trumans in Fayette County [Pennsylvania], which is about thirty miles south of Pittsburgh.  They didn't have any blacks associated with them, they didn't have any bla- any slaves that they had owned.  They came from the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] area and I traced them all the way back to the 1790 census, there were never any blacks around them.  But doing the work in the South, researching Herbert Gutman, researching my ancestors there, I realized that there could be a difference in the name.  So the name I'm looking for might not be a Truman.  So again I thought it was good that I had done the research in the South because this was gonna help me in the North.  What I started to do was--some white genealogists were talking about a neighborhood theory.  And see one of the things that I've done over the years is that I've not only just went to lectures that have given by African American genealogists, I've, I've went to lectures given by white genealogists on all different types of topics and usually I learn something.  And, and sometimes I can figure out a way to apply that to African American research.  Well one of the techniques that, that was getting very popular around the early 1990s was neighborhood research, or cluster research.  And the basics of it is, when, when people migrated westward across the country, they didn't hop on a plane or get on a train, they went in wagon trains and they went in large groups.  So they took their whole communities with them.  So the theory goes, if you can't find where your ancestors came from, research the neighbors and wherever their neighbors came from, they probably came from the same place.
Story_ID: 611852
Speaker 1: So in using this neighborhood theory what I started to do was research the people, the neighbors of David Truman, my [maternal] ancestor.  So I took the census records and started making listings of people that lived above him and below him on the census.  Then what I realized was they lived along this bend in the Monongahela River, a little north of a town called Brownsville [Pennsylvania], Brownsville.  And they lived there each and every year on the census.  So I started to concentrate on that area, and it was--I identified a township, it was Washington Township [Pennsylvania], which is a smaller subdivision within the county.  So within that township I identified all the free blacks, and I identified all the whites were, that had free blacks living in their household, as well as I identified all the whites that owned slaves and there were a few, there wasn't a lot, but there were a few.  So I started concentrating on them.  And I was looking at this journal called Lafayette [ph.] which was for the county of Fayette County, Pennsylvania.  It was named for General Lafayette [Marquis de Lafayette] who was a general in the American Revolutionary War who was from France, served with George Washington.  So in this journal a lady in Uniontown [Pennsylvania], which is the county seat of Fayette County, would go through the court records, abstract records, and she would publish them in this journal every quarter.  So I would look at it religiously, you know, to see any mentions.  And I looked at one issue and there was this name Edward Simpson [ph.].  And the families I'm researching in Fayette County were Simpsons, Smothers, Goe, and Truman, they were all my direct line ancestors.  So when I saw the name Simpson, it had the name Edward Simpson.  And I had an ancestor named Charlotte Simpson [ph.] and I was trying to figure out if her father was Edward Simpson or Thomas Simpson [ph.] because there were two free blacks, one named Edward and one named Thomas, and I figured one was her father but I couldn't figure out which one.  So this Edward Simpson was mentioned in a will.  And so I read the abstract of the entire will and it not only mentioned Edward, but it mentioned all the slaves that this lady had owned, the will was written in 1795.  The lady, slave owner died in 1797.  Her name was Margaret Hutton [Margaret Goe Hutton].  I was familiar with her because she was the largest slave holder in the county, she owned like twenty-five slaves which is not a lot but for that county in Pennsylvania it was a lot.  So I had researched her and was following her and I knew that she had owned slaves and these slaves that were living with her and whatever even though I didn't have the names.  Well I kept reading the abstract of the will and it mentioned in there David, a mulatto lad slave, and I realized this was my David Truman who I had traced back to the 1810 census.  So he was like fourteen years old.  And so I calculated he would be the same age born in 1781 of my David Truman I had found in 1820--1810, 1820, 1830 census.  So in that process what I did was I ordered the original will because we always instruct researchers when you get abstracts always get the originals because we always wanna get the original source.  I got the original will, which was five pages long.  And the abstract was only about a small half page in the journal.  So I got it and immediately went to my computer to transcribe it and typed every word.  And when I got to the part of David, I mean, tears started flowing down my eyes because they said, you know, little David a mulatto lad, fourteen years old, should be taught to read and write, and they didn't use the terms read and write, it was like the--what was it?  Something about the rule, the rule of numbers or something but it, it boiled down to basically, you know, math, arithmetic, and whatever.  But it also said that he should be sold out until 1806, when he got to the age of twenty-five years old.  So then I realized if he was sold out until he became twenty-five in 1806, then he would first show up on the census in 1810, which he did.  And it dawned on me that this will, was the document that freed my ancestors for the first time in America, written in 1795.  And when she died in 1797 then the provisions of that will were implemented.  So this naturally was very mind boggling, you know, when I realized this and actually got this will.  None of my relatives on my mother's [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs] side of family had ever heard that any of our ancestors were slaves, and I interviewed tons of 'em, no, none of 'em knew that we had ancestors that were slaves, particularly slaves in Pennsylvania.  But now I was faced with a major problem.  My ancestor was named Truman, but the slave owner's name was Hutton.  So I had to then prove that he was the David Truman who was only listed in this will by first name as David, and the owner had a different surname.  Again my research into Herbert Gutman, my study into difference in the family in, in, in surnames, I knew there was, I figured there would probably be a difference but I had to prove that this was the right one.
Story_ID: 611853
Speaker 1: What I ended up doing was I took another trip to Salt Lake City [Utah] and I spent an entire week, six days--the library is closed on Sunday--but I spent six days all day long, working on this one problem, trying to prove that this was the David Truman that was listed as Little David in a Hutton will.  Margaret Hutton's maiden name was Margaret Goe [Margaret Goe Hutton].  I had got some histories of Fayette County [Pennsylvania] and the Goe family had come in from Prince George's County, Maryland in 1773.
Speaker 2: How do you spell Goe?
Speaker 1: G-O-E, G-O-E.  So I knew they had come in from Prince George's County, Maryland.  This Truman that I had been following in Fayette County never panned out.  So then I wondered, was there a Truman in Maryland where they came from?  So I got a copy of the surnames in the 1790 census, looked under Maryland and there's Trumans there.  So I said great.  So I figured that there was probably a transaction of slaves being sold from Trumans to Goes.  I got an index called the PERSI index for Periodical Source Index.  It's like Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature where Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature indexes general periodicals like Time, Newsweek, Ebony, Jet, things like that.  PERSI index indexes over five thousand genealogy journals and genealogy newsletters.  So I had never researched Maryland before because I thought my ancestors actually had come in from Virginia to Pennsylvania, but I see that they really came in from Maryland.  I never researched Maryland before.  Never researched Prince George's County before.  So what I did was I got the PERSI index and I photocopied every--the titles of every article that was about Maryland, generally as a state, and about Prince George's County, fifteen hundred articles.  And again there were like fifty on a, on a page, just the title of the article and the name of the periodical.  So I took that list, and I went through each and every line, and I put a pencil dash on an article that I thought was important, that I wanted to look at, and all the articles, or the vast majority of articles were at the Family History Library in Salt Lake where I'm doing this research.  Then after I did that, I went through another time and went through all the dashes, and the ones with the highest priority I put a cross on it, crossed the dashes.  So then I had a list of actual articles.  I wanted to start actually pulling the articles and reading those to see if I could figure out what that had to do, you know, with solving my problem.  And after reading so many articles I found the one key article.
Story_ID: 611854
Speaker 1: It was a family history about the Goe family, also about the Truman family, about how they intermarried, but there was a third family called the Magruder [ph.] family.  And the Truman family intermarried with the Magruder family, and the Magru- family intermarried into the Goe family, and the Goe family intermarried into the Hutton family.  So whereas I thought it was a simple situation going from A to B, I'm going from A to B to C to D.  So I got that with that family history.  But again, it didn't list my ancestor on there, the article just mentioned the relatedness of these three particular families.  So from there what I had to do was to research each and every one of those white families and get family histories and get genealogies.  Family history is different from a genealogy.  Family history is a narrative on a particular family which may include some history background material et cetera, et cetera, whereas a genealogy traces the lineage going actually downwards starting at a progenitor, which is the earliest known ancestor and tracing all the descendants, linking them genealogically with genealogical evidence.  A genealogy may or may not have narrative with it giving, you know, biographies on these individuals.  Whereas a family history may not link every one genealogically, and it's more narrative about individuals within their family.  So I'm pulling genealogies and family histories on all these four related families as well as looking at local histories on Prince George's County [Maryland] and also on Fayette County, Pennsylvania.  As well as doing brainstorming, you know, trying to figure out what's the best approach, looking at everything I can.  And then after a while, I started putting together descendant charts, taking each and every one of these white families and doing genealogy charts showing all their descendants and who they intermarried, picking up marriage records, you know, death records, cemetery records, all kinds of different records to show how these families interlink.  And finally found how really there wasn't any sales of slaves, but, again, one of the daughters got married and inherited property and slaves were passed through inheritance through wills from one family to another.  So this is how I was able to prove that these families interlinked and that David Truman, who's my ancestor I have in the 1810 census, was, in fact, the one that's listed in this will, that's only listed under a surname.  So and that whole research I'm in the process of, of publishing that too.
Story_ID: 611855
Speaker 1: And there's one more piece too: the, the Soundex instructions (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  When I was writing my book, 'Black Roots' ['Black Roots: A Beginners Guide to Tracing the African American Family Tree,' Tony Burroughs], one of the things that I write about is how to use census records.  And in using the census records, there's an index to the census.  The index is based on the sound of the name because names were spelled differently--the same name was spelled differently.  My name Burroughs, B-U-R-R-O-U-G-H-S, is also spelled sometimes B-U-R-O-U-G-H-S, with one R instead of two Rs.  Sometimes it's spelled without a S as Burrough instead of Burroughs; with a S, and sometimes without a S.  Sometimes it's spelled B-U-R-R-O-W-S instead of O-U-G-H-S.  So in the process of doing genealogy I found about twenty different ways that Burroughs is spelled.  So when you're looking in the census, you have to be able to compensate for these variations in spellings.  So the primary index to the census is based on the sound of the name, and it's called a Soundex.  And that Soundex picks up all these spelling variations.  And when you go to the National Archives [National Archives and Records Administration] and research the census, the first thing you learn is what is a Soundex and how to Soundex your surname.  And what the Soundex is, it's a code of one letter and three numbers.  And those are for a particular surname, but it also encompasses other surnames also.
Story_ID: 611856
Speaker 1: Well in writing about this, when I'm doing my book ['Black Roots: A Beginners Guide to Tracing the African American Family Tree,' Tony Burroughs] in the 1990s, what was this, 1996, 1997 or something when I'm writing about this, I have this flashback of when I first started to look in the census records back in 1975, 1976.  And I recall that when I used the instructions I couldn't find my ancestors in the census records.  And for some reason when you use the instructions the National Archives [National Archives and Records Administration] has, somehow it just doesn't code it right for Burroughs.  I found a different Soundex code that worked, and so that's the one I was using 'cause I knew it worked.  Well when I'm writing about it, and I have to use my [paternal] grandfather [Asa Morris Burroughs] in the census as an example and I use the instructions the National Archives uses, it just doesn't work.  And I couldn't figure out why it didn't work.  So when I couldn't figure out why it didn't work, then I called the National Archives, and I talked to one of the archivists that work in census records.  And said, look, I'm writing about census records and Soundex records and I need the original instructions for the Soundex.
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Well, we were talking about the Soundex--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.
Speaker 1: --situation.
Speaker 2: So in trying to find the original instructions I decided to go to the National Archives.  So I contact the archivist that was in charge of census records at the National Archives and asked him, where were the original instructions, and he said he didn't know.  Which I was, frankly, very surprised because again we always talk about getting the original records.  So he said, you know, they tried to look for 'em and they could never find them.  So I said fine.  Then I talked to another archivist there and essentially got the same response, said they've looked and they've never been able to find 'em.  Then I find out, you know, these other researchers were trying to find 'em, and never found them.  So then I talked to an archivist who was retired from the National Archives, who wrote one of the catalogs on census records, and I asked him, and he essentially said the same thing: that they've looked for 'em, they've never been able to find them.  And so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now wait a minute now, just--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --this is a aspect of the National Archives, this is a tool that you're supposed to be able to use, and you're saying it's not there, and it hadn't been there for years?
Speaker 2: Right.  These are the instruc- the National Archives' pamphlets and books explain the Soundex and how the Soundex works.  And I'm trying to find out where the originals--
Speaker 1: 'Cause it doesn't work, right?  The, the instructions--
Speaker 2: Right, it didn't work for my name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Didn't work for my name.  And none of the archivists knew where the original instructions were, which to me sounded preposterous.  And so I asked this retired archivist, 'cause he had been there for, he had been retired--when I talked to him, he had been retired I think for about five years.  I knew him when he had been working at the archives.  He worked out of the archives for many years.  And I asked him point blank, well how does the National Archives publish instructions, and they don't have the originals?  And his response to me was, "The National Archives has been winging it."  I said, "Winging it?"  And that statement just blew me away.
Story_ID: 611857
Speaker 1: So I went on a mission to find the original instructions.  And again, from my training from Jimmy Walker [James Dent Walker], I got the inventory to records from record group twenty-nine, which are records from the bureau of the census [U.S. Census Bureau], from the very first census, 1790, up until the current census.  And I went through all the correspondence, I went through the reports, everything about the census I started going through with a fine tooth comb.  Every time I'd go to Washington [D.C.], you know, I'd, I'd look at a different part.  And I started finding these monthly reports, quarterly reports, correspondence, everything.  Also I knew that the founder--the person that supposedly invented the Soundex was a guy named Robert Russell [Robert C. Russell], and a couple of the census books had mentioned this guy Robert Russell and said he invented Soundex, but there was very little information on him.  Remington Rand was in the mix, and how was Remington Rand in the mix?  (Pause) Remington Rand had the, the trademark on the Soundex, on the term (air quotes) Soundex.  So when I would go to Boston [Massachusetts] I'd research in Boston in the Boston Public Library and other institutions up there.  And everywhere I went, I tried to do some research on the census 'cause it was supposedly implemented during the WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration].  Well after going through all the correspondence and all the reports and everything else, I finally found the original instructions.  In locating the original instructions, I also found out how the project started, 'cause it wasn't started by Remington Rand, it was started by this guy Robert Russell from Pennsylvania.  And I found out not only when he, he actually licensed it to Remington Rand.  And I got a copy of their licensing agreement.  I found out the earlier versions he had of this, which he didn't call the Soundex, the Soundex was a term invented by Remington Rand.  He called it the Russell Index and a couple other names 'cause it changed periodically.  He got a patent to his technique, I got all of his patents from the patent office [U.S. Patent and Trademark Office].  And I ended up creating a biography on him because I, I had to research his whole life to see how he developed this, when he licensed it to Remington Rand, and Remington Rand was only one corporation he licensed it too.  He had licensed it to county courthouses within Pennsylvania because he developed the system because he worked in the courthouse and what would happen was because people spelled their names differently, when a lawyer is doing a title search for a property, if he can't find all the transactions to that property, say because some of the names were spelled differently, he's still liable for that title search.  And it was so bad in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] of trying to find names of deed transactions that some attorneys refused to practice in Philadelphia.  So what he did was he started studying phonics and the way words and names are sound, sounded, and then he realized that certain vowels were interchangeable.  And so he gradually developed this system of, of, of indexing names based upon their sound and he tweaked the system several different times, had over a dozen different patents on it.  He had licensed it to Remington Rand, and Remington Rand got the contract with the bureau of the census to implement it as a WPA project.

Speaker 1: When I found the original instructions, I found out that the National Archives [National Archives and Records Administration] left out one of the critical steps, and that critical step was the step in coding not only the name Burroughs, but the name Hughes, and other kind of names that had Hs or Ws in it.  So once I got the original instructions and I compared it--which were much more lengthy from the ones from the National Archives, what I did was, well I did several things.  One, I wrote a letter to the archivist of the United States, John Carlin [John W. Carlin], and I indicated to him that the instructions to the National Archive--the instructions published by the National Archives, left out a critical step.  And I showed him the originals, I proved that the originals were in the National Archives from a report that was done.  I also showed the instructions from Remington Rand who implemented them during the WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration] and had the contract with the bureau of the census [U.S. Census Bureau], and showed how leaving out that one step miscodes names, like my name, Burroughs, and other names.  So I asked them to change their publications and update them so that they're correct.  I also contacted the National Genealogical Society and asked them did they wanna publish the original instructions in their National Genealogical Society Quarterly because the original instructions had never been published, people had been searching high and low for them and nobody could find them.  And so they said, yes, we would like to publish them.  So in the December 2001 issue of the National Genealogical Society Quarter- they published the instructions and I wrote the prelude and the introduction to that.  I got a letter back from John Carlin's staff in the National Archives that agreed with my findings and they agreed to change all their publications as well as retrain their staff.  And when the new publications came out the next year, they used Burroughs as one of the examples, you know, in using the Soundex.  So I feel real good about that, that I corrected an error that had been in print for like forty years, you know.
Speaker 2: That's a quite story, I mean, that's--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that's really--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 611859
Speaker 1: One question we always ask is this: what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: In related to my field or--
Speaker 1: Just in general.
Speaker 2: --in general?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Wow, that's pretty--
Speaker 1: And, you know, well--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --from whatever perspective--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's, that's, that's pretty big.  Well, some of my hopes for the African American community as a whole in terms of, of, of long term, I would hope that at some point in time we could bridge the educational gap and bridge the economic gap between whites and blacks.  I don't know if that could ever be done but that was, is definitely like a utopian hope that I would have.  And I, I think that if that gap would ever be bridged, I think that we could live in a much more harmonious society, and I think that society would be much more productive because I think there are a lot of great minds in the black community and the fact that the country as a whole is not benefiting from all of that intellectual capital that is not being utilized because of discrimination on many, many different levels.  Also I think that the levels of poverty could be greatly reduced if we reduced that economic gap between whites and blacks.  With all the economic wealth in this country there's no reason why we should have poor people in the United States.  You can take the top ten wealthiest people in the U.S. and they could wipe out poverty just with their wealth alone, let alone a more economic distribution of wealth in this country.  In terms of my particular field, one of my hopes is that more people get into genealogy, more African Americans get into history and learn about history.  Unfortunately, because of the proliferation of the Internet, because of the proliferation of, of videos and, and DVDs, and movies, it seems there's less people reading and more people, you know, watching, you know, a video and, and commercial movies, and whatever.  And a lot is being lost because a lot of knowledge is not in videos, it's not in movies.  There's a lot of, of, of history still to be researched, still to be published.  I would hope that not only more people get into African American genealogy, but the skills in African American genealogy continue to evolve, continue to be heightened so that we can develop more sophisticated methods of, of techniques for doing African American genealogy, so that people coming after me, you know, have an easier time, that more records are, are, are found, they're uncovered, they're published, they're transcribed, indexed, put on the Internet, whatever, so that more people will have the ability to make definite links with Africa.  Whereas now, it is very difficult to not impossible for many people to do, but I think that if more records are unearthed and transcribed and more methodology is put together, I think many more people will be able to do it in the future that it's difficult for them to do it now.  Again, you know, African American genealogy is only in its infancy stages.  I've been able to develop techniques, different historians have unearthed records and made them available.  I don't know if you're aware, but, but Cuba just sent tons of records of early Cuba to, I believe, it's the University of South Florida [Tampa, Florida], that have never been looked into, and with the guise of preserving those, of microfilming those.  And many of those are not only of blacks that were in Cuba, but those blacks that were in the Spanish colonies and went to other Spanish colonies and went to Spanish America, places in what is now the United States that came through Cuba at some point in time.  Very few of those records have been utilized for, for historical purposes let alone genealogical purposes.

Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Is there any major thing I would do differently?  Not that I can think of.  I wish I had more money (laughter) you know, I could deal with it differently.  Then I guess probably the only thing I might have done differently is I might have gone back to school earlier and finished my degree.  Because certain opportunities that--I've been able to do a lot of things that other people had degrees and I was the only one that didn't have a degree, but there have been certain opportunities I think that would have opened up to me that I couldn't take advantage of.  Although I have no regrets about anything that I had done and how I had done them, but if I had to change anything that might be about the only thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 611861
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look back over your life, what would you consider at this juncture to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well I guess my legacy is being a person who was a pioneer in African American genealogy, well not only African American genealogy but also genealogy in gene- general.  That I have evolved from African American genealogy into the genealogy field as a whole, and have developed techniques and methodology that tens of thousands of people, you know, have been able to benefit from.  And it's very humbling to sit back and reflect on the fact that thousands and thousands of people, you know, have read your work, have attended your lectures, seen you on television, and have used that to locate their ancestors, locate some of their own relatives, increase their, their research skills.  It's a very, very humbling, you know, like feeling.  People come up to me all the time and, and tell me, you know, how one of my lectures or one of my books or one of my consultations with them has really helped them in solving some of the riddles, finding some of their relatives.  I mean, some people, I mean, literally like come to tears when they talk about finding, you know, some of their own relatives, you know.  And it's hard for me, you know, to keep a straight face and not come down to tears, you know, when I hear some of these stories, you know.  Or people writing me letters, you know, and talk about how much my work has effected them, you know.  And also understanding that that's not just current but I've got over seventy tapes of lectures that are, you know, available for sale that people, people come up to me all the time and say they've never attended my lecture until this one time and they've bought all my tapes, you know.  And knowing that that will outlast me, that my books, my writings, and, and my, my audio and video performances, people will benefit from that long after I'm gone is, is, is truly, truly humbling.  And then, you know, just the mere fact that I've been able to take ancestors of mine, that I had no knowledge of, that none of my family has knowledge of, and to find them in records and resurrect them and recreate their lives, which were basically hidden heroes, you know.  That if it wasn't for them I wouldn't be here today, and my relatives wouldn't be here today.  And to resurrect them and recreate their lives and create biographies and family histories of them, so that their send- their descendants know about them many, many years later, is just an awesome, awesome, awesome task.  [HistoryMaker] Charles Blockson, who I know you've interviewed, said once when I was at a lecture that genealogists were chosen people.  And he said that and, and I firmly believe that because very few families even have genealogists.  And those families that do have genealogists, there's only one in the family.  I've tried to get other family members in my family to do genealogy and a couple have just bit on it a little bit but they've never done any amount of real genealogical research.  So I under- so I understand that genealogists are chosen people, and it's our responsibility not only to, to find out who our ancestors are, but to report back and tell our family members who our ancestors are and help recreate that hidden history for the larger community because now even historians are relying upon a lot of the original work that genealogists do.  So our, our work is extremely, extremely important.  And I think that even though Alex Haley's work is not solid genealogically from beginning to end, I think the sophisticated genealogical research that genealo- African American genealogists are doing now, are helping to develop genealogists that can prove that link genealogically that is very solid going back.  And I think we're making much, many, many, more strides for that and the think future will be much more successful than it is right now in the present.

Speaker 1: Just a quick question about DNA--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and how that fits into genealogy, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --just it crossed my mind, I don't think we've discussed that at all.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But just a--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --just briefly what, how do you feel about that?
Speaker 2: DNA has been popularized for doing family he- as family history research since it was used in the Sally Hemings and, and Thomas Jefferson case, where the descendants of Sally Hemings, who was a slave to Thomas Jefferson, have said through oral history that Thomas Jefferson, you know, and Sally Hemings had children and those were our ancestors.  This, the white descendants of the Jefferson family have always denied that.  After oral history was put together, then genealogical research and historical research was put together, assembled, that also proved that Thomas Jefferson was the father of Sally Hemings' children.  After DNA technology advanced, then DNA was used with the descendants of Sally Hemings and descendants of Thomas Jefferson to prove that they were related and DNA evidence proved that they were related.  Since then geneticists and microbiologists have taken DNA and figured out ways to use it in other ways genealogically.  And so now that's on the cutting edge of genealogy, is adding DNA as another tool to do research.  In New York [New York] when they were building a federal building [Ted Weiss Federal Building], I believe it was back in about 1991, and they struck bones sixteen feet underground, they found out that those bones were African bones, part of an African burial ground.  They, through a long process, halted construction, there was a big fight with the GSA, General Services Administration that controlled federal construction and renting of federal buildings.  And GSA, you know, botched the project of protecting these human remains.  And through some congressional hearings, those bones were transferred from New York to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] where [HistoryMaker] Michael Blakey, who's an anthropologist, was assigned to care for the bones, to analyze them.  And one of the things they did in terms of historical and anthropolo- anthropological evidence, is that they decided to do some DNA evidence because DNA was on the cutting edge of identifying and matching people.  And they decided to use DNA to try to figure out where these people were from in Africa.  'Cause the burial ground was in the 1700s, I think it was the 1790s in New York.  So they used DNA and I think they were able to identify some of the remains but I need to go back 'cause I don't know if that study was ever finished or what the final conclusions were on that.
Speaker 1: So we don't know exactly where they were from right now, I mean, well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm not, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: --they might know but--
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I haven't seen the final report.
Story_ID: 611863
Speaker 1: I hear stories now of people who, for a certain fee they give their, a sample of their DNA to someone who tells them exactly where they're from in Africa or exactly where they're from.  Is that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well that was, well that was where I was going to.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The microbiologist [Rick Kittles] that worked on that project [New York African Burial Ground Project] developed a theory that well if they use DNA to identify human remains, we should be able to use DNA to identify human beings and where they came from in Africa.  So he put together a company [African Ancestry, Inc.] and was supposed to go to Africa and collect DNA samples and use them to match with African Americans to tell where they came from in Africa, which started in the 1990s.  What I've looked at from talking to geneticists, from attending lectures on using DNA for genealogy, reading newspaper accounts on using this DNA, as well as using accounts in genetic journals, it's my conclusion that it can't be done.  And there are several reasons why it can't be done.  One, is that you have to have enough DNA samples from populations in Africa in order for it to be reliable.  One, you have to understand migration patterns in Africa of where people migrated to from wars and famines and other things, which there is some historical evidence, but from what I understand from reading, you know, the scholars' reports on that, there isn't enough research done on the migrations to have any degree of accuracy.  And this was reported in the Journal of Human Genetics.  You know, it wasn't, it's no theory that I have, this is in that particular field, where population genetic--geneticists have worked on these things.  As well as talking to some of the other DNA companies that primarily match white individuals to see if they're related or where they came from in Europe, in order to use DNA reliably, the more markers on the DNA you use, the more reliable your data is.  And from what I understand right now, and this is the year 2005, many of the white companies are using da- DNA are using I think twenty-seven markers.  The black company who's trying to tell people they can tell where you came from in Africa is only using eight markers (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There's a, I don't wanna interrupt, but there's a--
Speaker 2: That's all right.
Speaker 1: --there's a story that I thought was suspect where I think some Israeli scientists tried to prove a relationship to South Africans, and did you hear about that?
Speaker 2: That's something totally different.
Speaker 1: Was that (unclear)--
Speaker 2: And I'll tell you about that in a minute, yeah.  But what one of the other geneticists or, or I wouldn't say he's a, I don't know if he's a geneticist but he runs one of the DNA labs, I think he has geneticists, you know, like work for him, he said only using eight markers is almost like flipping a coin.  You know, that you're not, you don't have enough s- markers in order to get some reliable results.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The other thing I understand is that the way they're doing the DNA tests that it's telling you who you're related to in Africa today, which is where they based their samples on, not who your ancestors were historically.  And then the other thing is I understand that DNA goes back at least a couple thousand years if not more than that, and with genealogy we're just trying to go back a few hundred years, anywhere from two to four hundred or five hundred years maximum because we're starting with ourselves and we're going backward one generation at a time and we're trying to find who that ancestor was that got on the boat and came over to America from Africa.  And if this genealogist is going back two thousand years, that's not the same individuals that we're talking about.
Story_ID: 611864
Speaker 1: Because DNA is very (air quotes) sexy, it's very exciting, you know, it's so called scientific, people are catching on to it without understanding the details with the science of it.  They're also being sold a bill of goods implying that there's no other evidence besides DNA.  Dr. Gwendolyn Midlo Hall did some pioneering research on records from colonial South Carolina where she uncovered records for one hundred thousand enslaved Africans.  Ten thousand of which indicate where they came from in Africa, what their African ethnicity was, as well as what is their African name alongside their slave name.  That's direct evidence taken from the horse's mouth.  There's another historian by the name of Michael Gomez who wrote a book called 'My Country's Mark--' [sic. 'Exchanging Our Country Marks: The Transformation of African Identities in the Colonial and Antebellum South']--I think it was 'My Country's Marks'--that used newspaper records from runaway slaves, where a slave owner said my slave ran away, he's an Igbo slave, you know, which indicates, you know, his ethnicity.  And, and, and, and did research trying to track where people came from based on these newspaper advertisements for runaway slaves.  There's a, this genealogist Nettie Nesbary that I mentioned earlier, she researched her ancestor back to this plantation and the slave owner died on the coast of Africa going to get slaves.  So I mean there is some direct evidence there.  Dorothy Spruill Redford, who I mentioned wrote the book 'Somerset Homecoming' ['Somerset Homecoming: Recovering a Lost Heritage'] the owner of Somerset plantation [Somerset Place, North Carolina] hired ships and went to specific places in Africa to get slaves.  We know from some work that historians have done that in different areas of the U.S., like in the Chesapeake region, they grew tobacco, in the Lowcountry of South Carolina they grew rice, and that they needed Africans that had certain skills and they went to Africa to find different individuals that had these particular types of skills.  So there is certain types of historical evidence that we use.  The problem is there are not names on the ship logs of slaves that came over from Africa to America that are in the National Archives [National Archives and Records Administration].  However, there's records in South America, there's records in the Caribbean, there's records in Europe, there's records in Canada, there's all kinds of records that nobody has looked at for genealogical purposes.  So just like those records from Cuba just got unearthed that we're just getting ready to look into, just like the records from Gwendolyn Midlo Hall that were just unearthed, Henry Louis Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.] went to Timbuktu [Mali] and found some books that had never been translated, never been read and those (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A whole library (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, a whole library of books that are five hundred years old--
Speaker 2: John Hunwick--
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: --at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] is going through those now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.  So I mean people don't understand the magnitude of records that does exist and the fact that we need to go through those for genealogical purposes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that's my whole take on, on, on DNA.  In addition to the fact that the DNA is unreliable, it doesn't do what it purports to do, and even if it did all of those things, it's only tracing two family lines: your father's Y chromosome line or your mother's mitochondria DNA line.  And what people don't realize until they get into genealogy, we've got two parents, we've got four grandparents, we got eight great-grandparents, and every generation we go back, the number of family lines double.  So by the time we get back to when our ancestors came from over, over in Africa, you could have well over a thousand different family lines but that DNA is only going to cover either that one male line or that one female line, so it's a real, real small part of what your family actually looks like.

Speaker 1: Tell us about your family now, who would you consider to be your family now in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: My family in Chicago?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, or, or--you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I have four siblings, brothers and sisters, one sister and three brothers, so it's like five of us.  And so we live in, in Chicago and, and the Chicago suburbs.  My mother [Mary Ellen Brooks Burroughs] and father [Elmer Burroughs] are both deceased.  On my father's side all my aunts and uncles are deceased.  On my mother's side she has one sister that's still living, Doris Brooks, she lives in Pensacola, Florida, and she has dementia now.  She was kind of like my griot, gave me a lot of the family history, you know, when, when I first started doing genealogy.  I have a number of cousins in Chicago on my mother's side of the family because her siblings, her aunts--I mean, I'm sorry, her brothers and sisters all had children and they're all here in Chicago.  So and then all my brothers and sister--I'm not married, but all my brothers and sisters all have two kids, and so, you know, they have, have children.  So that's kind of like my family in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Is there anything I haven't asked you that we need to address before we close out?
Speaker 2: Probably so but it'll take another twelve, fifteen hours (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's probably true.  But, but it's been good.  I think you've, you've really provided us some, some good information.
Speaker 2: Good.
Speaker 1: But the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  I guess, I'd like to be remembered as a, a person that joked all the time, that had a lot of fun, enjoyed life, enjoyed every, everything I've ever done, but was a serious person and wanted to make some contribution to humanity, wanted to make some contribution to my fellow man, and I've worked very hard to make a contribution and I think that I have made a contribution.  And so I think that the world is a better place by me having lived here.  I didn't just enjoy life and take everything with me, that I tried to give back to the community at large and I think that hopefully people will benefit by the work that I've done long after I'm gone.
