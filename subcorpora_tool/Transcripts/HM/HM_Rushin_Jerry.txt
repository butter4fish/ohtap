Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as kind of a warm up, and they only require a short answer. The first question is: do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: A favorite food, yeah, I do. I love a thin pork chop sandwich (laughter). Yeah, I love that every now and then. That's--I have a craving for that sometimes, and that's about it, really.

Story_ID: 657776
Speaker 1: Well, I'm going to ask about your family history now.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side but separately, and then we'll try to put them together.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Well, her maiden name, or after she--her and dad got (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, yeah, maiden name, and, and--
Speaker 2: Okay. Well, her name was Louise Edmondson [Louise Edmondson Rushin], and then she married my father, who was Johnnie Rushin [Johnnie Rushin, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: How do you spell--
Speaker 2: Edmondson?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: E-D-M-O-N-D-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: You know, she's born in 1926, January, I forget the exact date, 19--1926.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born Eastman, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what can you--how far back can you trace your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: You know, I know a little about her grandfather and her grandmother, you know, who was, was one of those, what do you call it back then? Interracial situations. I think my great-grandfather was white, and my mother's grandmother was Indian [Native American] and slash white. It's (laughter), it got, got kind of crazy on her side of the family. You know, that's about it. They were the Davis family [ph.]. My, my great-grandmother's last name was Davis, so I don't know that much, but that, that's about it.
Speaker 1: Okay. So your grandmother [Willie Edmondson], was she African American at all?
Speaker 2: My--
Speaker 1: And she was--you said she was--
Speaker 2: She was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Indian and white.
Speaker 2: --she was part African American and part Indian.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was just--they kept mixing somehow in there from white and black until the offspring married a Indian, and so it was kind of crazy, but she was--looked very much like a Seminole Indian, you know, complexion, the reddish skin and the hair, you know, my mother's mother, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. And so that's, that's one set. Do, do you know the other set of grandparents?
Speaker 2: Well, my father was born in--
Speaker 1: No, no, your mother's--
Speaker 2: Oh. I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Your grand- you know, because she's got like--
Speaker 2: Ooh.
Speaker 1: She'd have like four grandparents, I guess, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. I don't know much about her, her father's--my grandfather's [Alonzo Edmondson] heritage or his people. I've never--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They never said much about my grandfather's side of the family, but I just know my mother and her mother would talk about her mother, so to speak, so.
Speaker 1: So are there any stories about your mother's people, in terms of what they were doing? What, what kind of occupations they had or what kind of--
Speaker 2: No. All I know is that during those days, they--not adopted, but families would take them in almost like a family member--white families that is, when I say families. And they would be like the washing and ironing, and, and, you know, sometimes cooking and full time, more of a mother than a nanny, 'cause they were--usually, the parents were busy, you know, making money or whatever it was they were doing, and then, actually, these, these black women, pretty much raised these young white kids for that reason, you know, but I guess they would be nannies or something like that would be one term, but, really, more like a, you know, a surrogate mother in many cases.
Speaker 1: Right, right, you're right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And there was a prominent family in my hometown that they worked for, the Stuckey family. If you ever seen the candy company, the Stuckey's candy [Stuckey's, Inc.; Stuckey's Corporation], and you see--used to have those signs alongside the highway back in--
Speaker 1: Right. Stuckey's was a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --big family in terms--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of that time. I mean, Stuckey's rest stops, and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, exactly.
Speaker 1: --I think there were restaurants--
Speaker 2: Yeah. They lived--
Speaker 1: --all over.
Speaker 2: --in Eastman, George, and my--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --mother and her grandmother and her sister [Lila Edmondson Smith], I think both of them worked at one time for the Stuckey family.
Speaker 1: Yeah. That's a huge chain.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Used to be very popular.
Speaker 1: So your, your female ancestors were raising the Stuckeys (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, yeah (laughter), for a while there, absolutely.
Speaker 1: So many connections. So, now, do you--okay. So your grandfather [sic.] was, was he a Stuckey?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, not at all.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. And were they--did they--was it, was it a formal relationship? Did they get (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was just one of those things where, you know, they hire you, and they like you, and I guess they treat them well, paid them well or whatever, and they just worked for them, you know, for a lot of years back in those days.
Speaker 1: Well, no, I was referring to the relationship between your grandfather and your grandmother, if, if they were--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) If they got married, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yes, yeah. They were married.
Speaker 1: --did they, okay.
Speaker 2: They were married, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was it--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --was it--well, she was--okay of mixed heritage. He was white. Was there any issues with that in--
Speaker 2: Not that I know of, you know, not that I know of. That was--would have been a little bit before my time, but not that I knew of.
Story_ID: 657777
Speaker 1: So, what did your mother [Louise Edmondson Rushin] say about growing up? Did she, she have any stories to share about what it was like when she came up?
Speaker 2: No. She was--you know, she used to talk about the neighborhood that we were--that she was born in and I was born into [in Eastman, Georgia]. How, how it was all about, I guess, the class, the economic class, that everybody had got along mainly because everybody there was pretty much poor. I mean, not pitifully poor, but nobody had, you know, an excessive amount of money in the neighborhood, and I remember just one house was where we lived, and down the street on the side was a white family, and a white family and a black family, so it was very mixed, but I think it was because, you know, the rich white people at that time, they stayed where they stayed, and if you were poor, you stayed wherever you stayed, and if it happened to be in a neighborhood that had blacks in it, and we pretty much got along very well. I mean, I don't ever remember as--even as a kid, anything, you know, really racial coming up from--within that neighborhood. I mean, I'm sure there was other stuff politically, whatever, but, but as far as neighbors in the neighborhood, it was just mixed neighborhood back then, and everybody struggled and helped each other, making quilts. They'd go to each other house I remember.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, sewing quilts, yeah. And I remember there was this one guy that was--he--I, they were--I guess he would have seizures. Back in those days, they would call them a fit, you know, and he would get very violent, and he was a white gentleman, and when he'd have these seizures, the only person he would listen to would have been my grandfather [Rushin's maternal grandfather, Alonzo Edmondson], and they would come down many times to get my granddad to go down to the house to talk to this dude 'cause he get his shotgun, want to kill his wife and the neighborhood, but he'd only listen or let my grandfather in the house and talk to him. I remember, I remember that happened on several occasions, kind of--everybody trying to get along, you know, at that particular time, in that neighborhood, that is, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah. That's an interesting dynamic. And I've, I've seen that before where someone has a--some kind of mental issue, will only listen to one per- person, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So that was about it. It was, you know, it was rough, but, you know, it was love. I mean, you know, I had my mother and my brothers and, you know, we were fine. We ate okay and, you know, the winter was kind of rough, but we--fireplace. We survived.
Speaker 1: Do you think there was any difference between the time your mother grew up and the time that you grew up in terms of--
Speaker 2: I think somewhat. I think that--because people started hustling individually or trying to make their own, own way out of that neighborhood, you know, and I think, with that, they got exposed to other thought processes, I guess. Many go to Atlanta [Georgia] to get a job or they go, wherever, wherever. And I think that gradually, it started to change. No major issue as far as racial stuff. I just think that, that we are one, or that neighborhood against the world concept kind of fell apart 'cause everybody trying to do their own thing, and many was trying to get up out of there, which, you know (laughter), I don't blame them for that either (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. So, so people got more mobile--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I guess, when--in--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --your generation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 657778
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Louise Edmondson Rushin] have a chance to finish school, or--
Speaker 2: My mom went to seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She went to seventh grade, and, yeah, but, you know, she just, just was just a smart lady; especially, when it come to life and maybe before we leave this morning, I will share just how smart she was, a lot smarter than me at some things in life in particular, but, you know, but she went to seventh grade as far as education is concerned.
Speaker 1: Now, these are segregated schools in those days, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah. At that time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When she went to school, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Even when I went to school, integration was just starting in the '60s [1960s] here in South Florida where we are now, but back then, it was all segregation.
Speaker 1: Now, was there a--was the school named after any, any famous black per- person, or, or educator or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Not at- you know, I'm not--you know, there's a name that--you know, you can tell me. It's--it was, it was called Peabody.
Speaker 1: Peabody School [Eastman, Georgia], okay.
Speaker 2: But that sounds like a name that somebody in history, I don't know. There was, there was somebody blah, blah, blah, Peabody, like it's--and I don't know if it was the same dude or not, but I do remember in history that name coming up for whatever reason.
Speaker 1: Yeah, George Foster Peabody probably was a philanthropist. I don't know if he--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --sponsored schools. A lot of, you know, rich white people in the North sponsored schools in the South. Carnegie [Andrew Carnegie] sponsored libraries and school buildings, and--
Speaker 2: So could, could be--
Speaker 1: --Peabody--
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, it could be--yeah, you know, the Peabody Award [George Foster Peabody Award] is named after George--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Foster Peabody, so--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --yeah, it could be. So the school was named after Pea--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It was a Peabody School.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. All right. So your mother, so she worked for the Stuckeys, too?
Speaker 2: No. My mother did not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother left, in fact, at a--I want to say--early age, she was married. Mother--my mother must have been like twenty, twenty-two, twenty-three when she left and came down to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Shortly after her and dad [Johnnie Rushin, Sr.] got married.
Story_ID: 657779
Speaker 1: I'm gonna leave her [Rushin's mother, Louise Edmondson Rushin] story right there, and I'm gonna pick up with your father. Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name is, his, (laughter) this is kind of a tricky question. His name was Johnnie Lee Avery, but all of his life and my life his name became Johnnie Lee Rushin [Johnnie Rushin, Sr.]. It's, you know, there's always a story somewhere, but his blood name, I guess, would have been Avery, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --all his life and all my life, I've never been able to--you know, never used the word--that name Avery. I wish I had because of the alphabet. A, being first, when I was in the [U.S.] Army, you know, we got paid by alphabet, so I says, dang, I wish it was a (laughter)--but, but, yeah, his name was Johnnie Avery, and, actually, most of his life, he was--all of his life--he was known as Johnnie Rushin.
Speaker 1: Now, what is the story behind the change--
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) of the name?
Speaker 2: --here's what happened as I got it (laughter). Back during those times when my dad was a kid and his father [Robert Rushin], you know, they--people were--black men, young black men would do something, maybe sass a white person in the town or do something, you know, that didn't--it wasn't appreciated by the county sheriff or whoever, and a lot of times, these guys had to leave town, and not to be found, they would just take on another name, maybe another family member, cousin's last name or something, but just to throw these people off of their trail, they would just say, "Yeah, my name is William," you know, instead of Rushin, I would change it to William, you know, just to kind of throw them off the trail, so to speak. And I know there was an incident involving my dad's dad, actually. And my dad started using Rushin. My dad's dad started using Rushin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, therefore, my father just started using Rushin also.
Speaker 1: So did they ever explain what the--not--well--
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: --before, but before I get into this, what's your father's date of birth, and--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I think dad was born in like, ooh, September, 1922.
Speaker 1: Okay. And, and where was he--so he was born in--
Speaker 2: Eufaula, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Eufaula, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) E-U-F-A-L-A [sic.], something like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah. E-U-F-A-L-A, yeah, Eufaula, Alabama.
Speaker 2: Yeah. That's close enough (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right. So, now what is it? So, so what is the story? This is good--this is history.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, just--he had a run in--my dad's dad, I believe, had a run in with--how, how would he call it? Like the sharecropper guy that owned the land.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the landlord or whatever.
Speaker 2: Yeah. They wanted to punish him. One Monday, I guess, he was late to work or something one Monday morning, and a altercation broke out, and, of course, back in those days, remember this is my dad's dad, so this is some time ago. You don't--you wouldn't fight, certainly, wouldn't hit a white guy, you know, in these little towns in Alabama unless you was going to really leave town. So that's pretty much what, what he had to do. He had this altercation with the, the guy that owned the sharecropping property because he wouldn't let him beat him, and he fought back, you know, pretty much whipped the guy's ass. "I'm going to whip his butt," so to speak, and now you got to go. You can't stay here now, so along those lines, and he just changed his last name, and, you know, I think later on, he may have come back. I'm not sure. But my--he did change his name, and eventually, my dad changed his name to Rushin--
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) also.
Speaker 1: --I, I know the history is replete with those stories, and we have plenty of them in the archives where people--
Speaker 2: Yeah, (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) had to, had to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --move, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because of that. So, so at any rate, that's--so they moved to--did he have relatives in Eastman [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: In that area.
Speaker 2: No, he did not. All his people were from Alabama.
Speaker 1: From Eufaula, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And do you know if he--was it along a train, I mean, a route, or a railroad route or something, or how did they--
Speaker 2: You know, I don't think--
Speaker 1: --they get there?
Speaker 2: --there was a train.
Speaker 1: I know those were the days when people would hobo onto a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Catch a train.
Speaker 2: You know, I don't think there was a direct train route so to speak. I'm not sure how you would get from Alabama to, to Georgia back in those days, you know, I'm not sure. Probably hitching rides or something, or a lot of time they would work, they would--excuse me, they would work their way on jobs, work a few days, and then they get work further down the road, and they end up there, you know, wherever they were headed.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, how, how old was, was your father born when your--his--when your grandfather had to move from Eufaula to Eastman?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. This must have been 1940-ish, '42 [1942], maybe so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. So in the 1940s, they made the move, and so, so did your dad get a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: Dad went to third grade. He was a truck driver, and what he called pulpwooder. He worked on the pulpwood trucks and haul logs and stuff for the lumber, lumber mills, in, in the Georgia, Alabama area.
Story_ID: 657780
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: You know, dad [Johnnie Rushin, Sr.] would just say (laughter), he saw that little red woman one day and said, "Well, I'm gonna marry her," you know, in, in Georgia, in Eastman, and that's all I ever heard about that. He said, he saw her, and he, and he said, "Hey, I'm gonna marry that lady, that little girl," and he did (laughter), so, so that's about it. You know, you know, I, I don't know much more than that. He saw her and said he had fell in love the day he saw her, and I think they were married for like forty-six years before he passed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right. So they, they got married in Eastman, and then they moved to--
Speaker 2: Yeah. They came down here in '48 [1948]. I was, I was a year old when they came down. In fact, they brought me down here with them, and they left my other three siblings at that time in Georgia 'til they got a home, a place to stay. Then later on, they sent for my brothers and sisters.
Speaker 1: Now, was there a particular, good situation here that they were moving here to?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, you know what, what happens is, some people in that area may--say, go to Detroit [Michigan], Baltimore [Maryland], and if things were good, they would communicate, "Hey, it's nice up here in Baltimore." It's nice here in whatever, Washington [D.C.], or Detroit. But some, some of our people from that area in Georgia that my dad and my mom [Louise Edmondson Rushin] knew, for whatever reason, they came down south to the Fort Lauderdale [Florida] area, and I guess they got jobs, and word got back that it was nice down here, so to speak. And they came down, you know, just taking their friend's word for it. "C'mon down, man. There's plenty of work," whatever the case may be, and that's normally how it happened, you know, word of mouth. "Hey, man, it's really slick up here." "It's really slick down here. C'mon down," or, "C'mon up." It all depends on where your friends went before you, and, and they would help each other when they come down, you know, until you get a place to stay. Like a lot of cultures, you know, you--, "Well, you can stay at my house, man, until you find you a place to rent or get a job," or whatever. And I remember some of those people from that time taking care of me.
Story_ID: 657781
Speaker 1: Dad worked for one company, oh, for thirty-five years, and he worked--while he worked for that company, I know he worked a couple of other jobs also during that same time, so he's always worked--
Speaker 2: And so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) since he got here.
Speaker 2: --so what company did he work for, for thirty-five years?
Speaker 1: He worked for a company here called Causeway Lumber Company [Fort Lauderdale, Florida] and he retired in the '80s [1980s], so I forgot what year it was, maybe '82 [1982] something like that.
Speaker 2: So he was driving truck for them.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Eighteen wheelers, you know, he would take me with him a lot of times. I'd go on the road. He'd go up to Clewiston, Florida; Belle Glade [Florida]; Jacksonville [Florida], and it was fun for me. You know, mama [Louise Edmondson Rushin] would fix us a box, box lunch and some chicken and biscuits or whatever it was at the time, and, and to see my dad, he was my hero. I mean, 'cause that--to drive that eighteen wheeler, everybody couldn't do it. I remember. Other companies, we get places and guys would call my dad, "John [Johnnie Rushin, Sr.], see if you can back this truck in here, man, so we can unload this lumber," 'cause guys said, "Man, I can't back that truck in that little hole." And daddy would say, "Sure," and I was like so proud. Look at my daddy. He can do it, you know, that kind of thing, and--
Speaker 2: That does take a particular skill. That's not, not easy (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah. I just--I mean, I went to truck driving school in the [U.S.] Army. They flunked me, told me not to drive anything but a jeep. (Laughter) Said, "Don't you ever try to drive any kind of truck," but it is a certain skill to drive those eighteen wheelers; especially, to back them up. It's very difficult. But, you know, so, yeah, I, I enjoyed that period, riding with him while he did his thing with the truck driving, you know.
Speaker 2: So it was mostly in Florida that you drove around.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. Every now and then he went up to--I remember, there was a place in Del- in Georgia called Del-Cook Lumber [Del-Cook Lumber Company]. I think maybe in a town named Del [sic. Adel, Georgia] or something. I'm not sure. But every now and then, we'd go up to just the other side of the Florida line. To this company up there and pick up some lumber and bring it back, but, yeah, it was always great.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Truck stops, I think were great, you know, 'cause he'd let me sip on some coffee. I thought, yeah (laughter), coffee. That'll work.
Story_ID: 657782
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about your parents' personalities, their sense of humor, their--the way they--their, their views on issues, the way they walked, the way they talked, what, what they looked like. Who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Oh, my god, you know. That is something. You know both my parents--you know, it's like my dad [Johnnie Rushin, Sr.] was--you know, he was probably--if I, if it's possible, John Wayne probably imitated my father. My dad was one of those guys that would preach to me, you know, "You never start a fight, son, but you never run from a fight." I mean, this is the kind of stuff, you know, it--and my mother [Louise Edmondson Rushin] was one who I got a--I got beat one day by some kid in the neighborhood [in Fort Lauderdale, Florida] and came home. Not boohoo crying, but tears in my eyes, and mom goes, "What happened?" I told her. She says, "Well, you go back down there, and you punish him. You beat him. You don't come in here crying. You fight and you win the fight." But they taught me--like dad was always, take care of your responsibilities. Take care of your kids if you get kids and take care of your family, and, you know, just, just good sound stuff as, as being a man, you know, and doing the right thing, you know. Look out for your mama. "Okay. I'm going to be out of town for a couple days, so make sure your mama is all right." And I wasn't even the oldest boy in the family. I was the second oldest son, but he was always, "Jerry [HistoryMaker Jerry Rushin]," you know, "make sure your mama okay. Look out for your mama." And, you know, and between my mother and my father and that kind of language and watching old movies where the good guys always was against the bad guys, you know, you started to understand. Like, you know, I want to be the good guy, you know, 'cause the good guys, you know, they always won, and the bad guys needed to be punished or needed to lose. So, I mean, all that, between mom, dad, and, and them darn black and white movies, you know, with the good guys, bad guys, it really started to shape me in my, my thought- my thinking as being a man. I remember, I learned--I saw that everybody, everybody was not as strong, for whatever reason, as, as some other people in, in our, in our society. In other words, it could be a small man. He's not as strong but just because he's just a small man. And it would drive me nuts when I see a big kid pick on a kid because the other kid was smaller, and I would--I'll fight him. You know, could have been big. It didn't matter if he was--even if he was bigger than me, I'd fight him, you know, but--so I had a sense of like wanting to protect people who could not protect themselves, were very--some didn't have the education as I grew up. Some guys just didn't know better. Some people didn't know better, not necessarily guys singly, but, you know, and so you had to do something to help those people, you know what I'm saying. If you, if you were strong enough (background noise), you know, why not help them. You know, it's not, you know, their fault in many cases that they weren't strong enough to defend or protect themselves, so, you know, but all that came from my mother and my father and, and crazy movies where good versus evil, so to speak, you know. And even as an adult, in business, I always felt that way, that communities, in many cases, black communities need help, and if you were able to help, you help. Same thing, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you--your parents reinforced the--or the, the TV shows reinforced the values your parents were giving you in many ways (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah. I remember one conversation, everybody has like a core. You know, in other words, I tried to be a bad kid. I mean, but my core is good. I just couldn't rob. I couldn't steal. I couldn't snatch a woman's purse, and I--of course, well, a lot of my buddies did, so, you know, not peer pressure, but I wanted to fit in, so I tried to do those things, and, damn it, it just wasn't me 'cause my core, it just wasn't in my core. And the same thing, you have some guys that try their best to do good, but the core ain't there to do good, so they typically end up in jail doing something wrong. It's just in the DNA. And I believe that because, honestly, I didn't try to like kill anybody, but the--okay. "What we going to steal? All right. This ain't--." "Man, I don't--I can't steal this man's stuff." "Are we gonna do this?" You know, "Okay, okay," and I--, "This is wrong." I just--wasn't in my core, you know, and so I--finally, I rolled with it. I stopped that struggle of trying to be a bad kid or whatever, and say, okay, Jerry, obviously, that ain't your thing, so, you know, you're not a scaredy cat, but you just don't want to do--hurt anybody for no reason, you know, so, I don't know, it's--and this is what happens, I think, with most people. You have to just learn, the earlier the better, really what's your core. I mean, and work on it. And then just take advantage of it and go with it. I don't say if it's a bad core, go out and commit murder or raping, you know, and mayhem, but, you know, but I, I think you need--and the same thing with your skill set or your talent that--you got to find out what it is you, you're good at; your hands, mechanics, you know, writing, reading, whatever it is. You had to find all those things out.

Speaker 1: What did you get from your mother [Louise Edmondson Rushin]?
Speaker 2: Just--she was just fearless. Just never be afraid. Never be afraid of anything. Just if you're right, it doesn't matter. Just make your decision based on if it's the right thing to do. You know, if you really--even if you're wrong in what you're thinking, but if you think it's right, and it end up not--you didn't go out there to hurt somebody. You did what you thought was right. And I've made decisions in business (makes sound), they were wrong, you know, but I thought it was right. But you have to--she taught me just, you know, to be of conviction. You know, if you're--if you feel good about something, do it. Just fear will go away once you start doing it, whatever it is, if it's a job. I'm afraid I don't know how to do this thing, you know, but once you start doing it, fear will go away. Just be fearless. It's they want me to do this, do that, and I, and I gave--an example is, on my very first job--forgive, excuse me, I got a sinus problem here. But my first job, they wanted me to deliver a piece of furniture one day, a television, actually, and I never drove a stick shift, so I remembered, I figured it out, scraping gears left and right, but I did figure it out (laughter), and I drove the stick shift and I was petrified.
Story_ID: 657784
Speaker 1: Tell me about your brothers and sisters, or how many do--
Speaker 2: Well, it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 2: --it's six kids altogether, three girls and three boys. I was--
Speaker 1: Can you name them from the oldest to the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my--
Speaker 1: --young- youngest, and let us know a little bit about what they're do--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --what they do for a living.
Speaker 2: Well, my, my older brother, John [Johnnie Rushin, Jr.], and John was a small guy by comparison 'cause my mother [Louise Edmondson Rushin] was short, so he took height after my mother, and so he always had a chip on his shoulder. He, he always thought he had to prove that he was just as tough, so he played football, you know, running back of all things, you know, little fella, but he protected me coming up. And, actually, my brother, John, John passed February of this year. You know, he was like seventy, seventy-one years old, but he was just a great guy, you know. He went to the [U.S.] military. He went to Vietnam, and, and I went to--the week he was leaving Vietnam, I was going into the country that same week. We overlap each other, and then he got out, and he--we had a plan where he would go to broadcasting school and get involved in radio. When I get out of the [U.S.] Army, I will do the same thing. We gonna go to work together at some station, so he went to school in Chicago [Illinois], and--but he fell in love and got married and dropped out of school, and--but, you know, when I got out, that's how I got into radio. I, I followed--when I got out of the Army, I finally went to broadcasting school [Lindsey Hopkins Technical College, Miami, Florida], and I stayed with it for over forty years. My, my oldest sister is Rose [Rosa Rushin Ferguson]. She's always been like in the nursing thing, you know, working in the hospitals as a nurse's aide, and the medical field, doctor's offices. And my second oldest sister, right above me, Shirlene [ph.], she, she's retired forty some years from Holy Cross Hospital here in, in South Florida, Fort Lauderdale. And I have a younger sister that's like sixty-two now. Worked in the medical field. And I have a younger brother that's--also works in the medical field. And, actually, in Vietnam, I was a--flew what we called rescue missions, a dustoff company, medevac, medical evacuations, so I had intended to become a doctor, actually, you know, so somehow, that all six of us ended up doing the medical thing, you know, at some point, but, of course, later on, I got into broadcasting instead of the medical field, but I would have been probably a surgeon or something 'cause I had a chance to do a lot of emergency surgeries in Vietnam, and I enjoyed helping and healing, you know, but, obviously, you gotta be a lot smarter to be a doctor than to be a disc jockey, so I, I took the easy way out became a jock. (Laughter) But, but, yeah, that, that's somebody, and then, you know, they all--remaining five of us, we're all right here in the Miami [Florida], Fort Lauderdale area, you know. Mom passed last October of 2013. And, of course, dad [Johnnie Rushin, Sr.], dad passed in 1988, but there are five siblings. We, you know, five of us are still here. We still, you know, we're still getting along.
Story_ID: 657785
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Childhood memory?
Speaker 1: An earliest one.
Speaker 2: Yeah. It's a couple of things. I'm very, very--I was a year old when I came down [to Fort Lauderdale, Florida], but I remember things, I guess, from age two or three. I remember like a flood in, they say, '49 [1949]. I would have been two. I remember watching the water come up through a knothole in the wooden floor where we lived. The water was bubbling up through that floor as it was rising outside. I remember sleeping by--this one family that tried--they wanted to like adopt me, I think, but not officially, just--they just loved me so much. They wanted to just take me from mama [Louise Edmondson Rushin], really, but he had a grocery store, and he would--a cash register here on top of the counter, and I would sleep up under the cash register. He'd put a pillow and a blanket under there for me, you know, during--'cause he kept me all day. This family did. And I remember the first day of school like a big guy pushed a little guy I had just met named Chris [ph.], pushed him out the hallway down to the ground and dislocated his elbow, and I found myself jumping on this dude for pushing the little guy down. You know, that was all a part of the early on identifying, you know, as far as looking out for people who just could not look out for themselves. The very first day of first grade, I remember that, you know.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the family that, that you stayed with--
Speaker 2: Coley.
Speaker 1: --where, where you slept under the--
Speaker 2: Joseph [Joseph Coley (ph.)] and Marie Coley [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was, it was, you know, 'cause it's the neighborhood. You know, I got my siblings. Everybody roughhousing, but Ms. Marie, you know, she would make me come in around 5:30, 6:00, take a bath, you know, okay, cool. But then she don't want me to go out and--I can't go out and play anymore. My brothers and the kids in the neighborhood, they playing football, they're jumping in the sand. They're roughhousing. And then she put me on this--these little outfits, little short outfits with little matching tops with darn sandals. Everybody else had on UFs--what was it, US kids shoes or PF--
Speaker 1: Flyers [PF Flyers], yeah.
Speaker 2: Flyers shoes or sneakers, and, and blue jeans. I got on little, little blue pants, short pants and, and sandals, and I hated it (laughter). I wanted to be like the other kids. And the first time I saw a waffle iron was in her kitchen. I says, what the heck is that thing? And I remember she (makes sound), feeding me waffle, you know. In the meantime, my brothers and sisters, I wouldn't say hungry, hungry, but I wanted them to eat some of these waffles, too. You know what I'm saying (laughter)? But, but it was--she--I don't know why they got attached to me. But most of my life as I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so, I was, I was going to ask that question. Like, why were you the one that they were attached to or, or that your parents let them keep you.
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know. But all of my life, literally, through Vietnam [Vietnam War] and even my broadcast career, there was always somebody, for whatever reason, that liked me and wanted to help me do well and look out for me. All--usually a older person, a mentor. I remember Jewish family, a couple of Jewish brothers, the Brodsky brothers [Jacob Brodsky (ph.) and Ludwig Brodsky (ph.)], they taught me so much before I got into radio. My mother used to work at their home as a--like a maid, so to speak, and they hired me, and taught me the business, and sense of business, and how to, you know, profit and loss statements and stuff, at a very early age. I'm twenty-one, I'm just out of Vietnam at the time, but they saw something in me, made me--
Speaker 1: You, you think it's just personality? I mean, you think--I mean, the basic thing may be per- personality, your personality as a kid, were you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you talk a lot as a little kid, or did you--
Speaker 2: Well, not a lot.
Speaker 1: Or did you have a--
Speaker 2: But when I did, most people said I had something to say, you know, I, you know, I--and even now, as recent as a few years ago, I'm at a company meeting, and the, they guy says, "You know, you don't talk much, but if you notice, Jerry [HistoryMaker Jerry Rushin]," one of those classes for leadership classes, "but you notice when you did talk, everybody listened." So it's part of his thing on me, his evaluation of me was, you know, he goes, "You know, in these meetings, you ought to speak up because people are really interested in what you have to say." So I don't know, but in the [U.S.] Army, there was a guy that--Sergeant Paine [ph.], took my under his wings, taught me what to do while I was in Vietnam to stay alive and what not to do, you know. And in radio, elderly white lady, you know, just pretty much said, "You could be the GM [general manager] of the station." This was over forty years ago. I said, "I don't want to do that because I want to, you know, I want to have fun as a jock [disc jockey]. I don't want to have--I don't want to wear a suit and tie." But she's--she said, "You know you can do it," you know, and I said, "Okay." I, I felt I could, but I didn't want to. But she just forced me kind of to, to take the job as manager. And I don't know why. I was--wasn't, you know, I wasn't the latest and the greatest thing. I mean, there was other people around that she could have hired or given that position to.
Speaker 1: So there's something about you that, that is kind of magnetic, I guess--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to pe- to people--
Speaker 2: It--
Speaker 1: --in a sense.
Story_ID: 657786
Speaker 1: We always ask this question. What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: (Whispers) Oh, man. Okay (laughter). My mother [Louise Edmondson Rushin] would always say--and I heard this Sunday. I played golf, a round of golf this past Sunday. But my mother would always say, "Boy, you come in here smelling like the sun," so I learned to recognize that smell. The sun, it just--the sun gives your skin a certain odor. I mean, you're out playing or you're out working or whatever it is, golf or whatever it is, playing golf, whatever it is, whatever the case--or whatever. So I remember this thing about the sun. I can smell it easily when I--once I'm outdoors, working out or whatever, sweating or working, whatever the case may be. I don't know. I just remember, I've always been into architecture. I thought about doing that as a living, but I've seen--I've always watched houses sitting up on stilts, brick stilts, sometimes wooden stilts, or whatever the case may be, and windows that would slide up and you put the stick under it. It was--as I saw these things evolve from the slide up window, the stick to hold it up to crank out windows, and then I actually saw a hole in the wall and air conditioner unit, a wall unit, I guess you'd call it. I was fascinated. And when I went inside, and the same family [Marie Coley (ph.) and Joseph Coley (ph.)] that wanted to adopt me, they had, in fact, and it was so cool inside that living room. I was amazed. I was like, wow, you know. And, of course, there's always the food smell coming up 'cause, you know, every--the neighborhood on Sundays in particular, your nose would get confused. You're smelling collard greens here. You're smelling okra here, you're--fried chicken from over here. Somebody baking something over here, so the, the smell of food, you know, and there was just, just the stuff, man, just, just day to day stuff that you run into, you know.
Story_ID: 657787
Speaker 1: So Eastman [Georgia] was a--I mean, was there a--how was it laid out? Was there like a--I think you said before that people were just kind of scattered around. I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --bla- black and white, or was there like a black neighborhood or, or what? What was it?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I mean, we had a black neighborhood, but we also had--I don't know how to say this, but black neighborhoods that was integrated. Or do I say white neighborhoods that was integrated? What, however it goes. So we did have one that was predominantly black, you know, or all black, and then we had the one where we lived where it was just homeowners. And the ones that were all black was pretty much like projects.
Speaker 1: Okay. So these--
Speaker 2: Apartments.
Speaker 1: --are people who didn't own their own homes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but--
Speaker 1: --and they were, they were renters.
Speaker 2: --homeowners, you know, the white guy down the street, you know, he didn't care. If a black guy down the street. They didn't care, you know. It was a little different where, where I was born and raised in, in that particular neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Now, was segregation, it's--from what you're saying, I'm gathering that segregation was not as pronounced in Eastman.
Speaker 2: Nah.
Speaker 1: When you were coming up.
Speaker 2: No, no. It was--I think--it was really a economic thing there, you know, because you have to survive I think, and people would--bartering. Somebody, you know, had the hog or a pig and somebody got corn growing. "I tell you what, I give a few stalks a corn or whatever it is, you give me a couple chickens." I don't know but, but everybody was like trying to make it together, so to speak.
Speaker 1: So, so in a lot of--you're saying, well--we know schools are segregated, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And the--were the downtown facilities segregated like a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, black and white fountains and all that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, not that extreme, but we had the theater, you had--which I always thought was weird. The, bla- the whites were downstairs, and we went upstairs to see the movies. I always thought upstairs was so, so much cooler. You know, and then you didn't had to worry about people throwing stuff down on you if you go upstairs, so I'm like, I think they made a mistake when they came up with decision to put the blacks up top. It didn't punish us. I'd say it gave us a better view to me, you know, and then a lot safer, you know, for that reason. But--so that was, obviously, some, some segregation, you know, but the people were just, just different. You know what I mean? It was--you know, they called my grandfather Mr. Short [Rushin's maternal grandfather, Alonzo Edmondson], and everybody addressed him as Mr. Short, white, black. "Good evening, Mr. Short." "Hey, Mr. Short." Sometime the older guys, "Hey, Short," you know, they were just--I just remember watching this, and, and how much they respected my grandfather, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah. That's different from a lot of places where (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I'm sure you can probably ride twenty miles, it would be totally different, you know, from there, you know, but it was, it was good. I mean, you know, it's not like, like people--you see in 'Roots.' I'm sure that was happening somewhere, but, personally, my neighborhood was, you know, it was cool. It was really nice.
Speaker 1: Did the Stuckey family dominate the, the town, or--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah. Well, they had the Stuckey's Hotel [ph.]. They had like some other restaurant and Stuckey's grain and feed [Stuckey's, Inc.; Stuckey's Corporation, Eastman, Georgia]. Stuckey's pecans 'cause, you know, those pecan rolls [Stuckey's pecan log roll] they made, you had to have pecans, you know, you know, so, yeah, they had, their presence was there, was stamped on the town. It was Stuckey's this and Stuckey's that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, they, they call them a pecan log, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Pecan log. We called--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: --them pecan rolls and pecan logs.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, you got to have pecans for those, so we had this land with pecans on them, and, and this factory where he made up the stuff that go in the pecan log or whatever the case may be.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, yeah, but you, yeah, you knew it was Stuckey's town (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. All right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Big boss man.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Big boss man.
Story_ID: 657788
Speaker 1: Now where did you go to--start school? I mean--
Speaker 2: Florida. Remember, I was a year old when, when my mom [Louise Edmondson Rushin] and dad [Johnnie Rushin, Sr.] came down to Fort Lauderdale [Florida], so I started school in Fort--in Florida (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, I'm--yeah, I'm talking about Stuckey's [Stuckey's, Inc.; Stuckey's Corporation] when I should be talking about--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --Fort Lauderdale.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. But, but the--okay. So in Fort Lauderdale, yeah, where--so where did you start school?
Speaker 2: I started school at a place, Walker Elementary School [Clarence C. Walker Elementary School] in Fort Lauderdale. Went there for a couple years, and then we went to Lincoln elementary [Lincoln Park Elementary School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida], which was a new school they put up in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: So Walker, you were at Walker in first.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you started there in first grade, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Or did--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --did you go to kindergarten, no?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: No. I was--no, I was stuck around my mama before I started school. I wouldn't leave her, but (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. So first grade at, at Walker, and you were there from first grade to--
Speaker 2: First through maybe third.
Speaker 1: Third, okay. All right. And so how, how did you like school? Did you like school?
Speaker 2: You know, it was great. I mean, you know, it was--you know, I was--I think I was probably--I never studied a lot, but I was just naturally--I don't want to say smart, like, you know, but I just--it, it was easy for me. It--to, to learn--learning came easy 'cause I enjoyed reading for one, one thing. I've always been--had a passion for reading, even today, but, so it was so easy for me as far as school work is concerned, you know, you got a chance to, to interact with other kids. And then when I went to, the other elementary school was Lincoln Park. It was the very first year, Lincoln Park Elementary. They had a contest. They wanted to start a school newspaper, and they, they needed a name for the, for this, for the newspaper, so I--in the contest, I submitted the name Lincoln Park Tiny Pen [ph.], and it won, and I got some little yo-yo or something, little prize.
Speaker 1: Lincoln Park Tiny Pen?
Speaker 2: Tiny Pen, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Like an ink pen.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Right?
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So now it's time for the first edition, and I drew on the cover like a logo which was Lincoln Park Tiny Pen and I drew the picture of a ink pen laying down at the end of the, the word--N in the word pen, so I just laid it--drew out an ink pen laying down, and so Lincoln Park--
Speaker 1: So you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Tiny Pen.
Speaker 1: --you were an--
Speaker 2: I draw, yeah.
Speaker 1: --artist, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: It was just--these are things I just did and still--I still do sketch and stuff, you know, and I just knew how to do it. I never really had any real training. Everybody had arts and crafts class, but I just--if I saw it, I could reproduce it with charcoal. I'd take a look a box, a building, telephone, apple, orange, you know, and probably could have went far in that field if I would have wanted to. Then we went on to junior high school, Dillard, Dillard junior high school and, and senior high school [Dillard High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida] where I graduated high school in '65 [1965].
Story_ID: 657789
Speaker 1: Now were there any particular teachers that were mentors to you growing up that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. There was third grade, Ms. Washington [ph.], was just nice to me. Ms. Robinson [ph.] was nice to me. She would have me even after school go pull weeds out of her yard, and she would give me fifty cents, you know, she, you know, helped me economically, so to speak. And elementary school, and those are two. And Ms. Lamar [ph.] in elementary school [in Fort Lauderdale, Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I--later on, there was one teacher that took an interest in me. And I--again, I don't know why. There was an incident one day at--during physical education, and some of the bigger guys had roughed me up playing volleyball. One guy held me, and one of them took the volleyball and hit me repeatedly in the head, just, just roughhousing. Well, okay. It--you know, like I said, mama [Louise Edmondson Rushin] knows, don't have any fear. Don't start a fight, but don't run from a fight. But it was both--all three of these guys were a lot bigger than me, so what I did, I went to the Coke machine and got a case of empty Coke bottles, the little small Coke bottles back in those days. And I just wait on these guys to come out, so I'm throwing Coca-Cola bottles. Each time the door would open in the little gymnasium thing. I'm dead wrong. Now the kids can't go to class because this nut out there throwing Coke bottles. So now the teacher is all looking for all the male students who has not showed up from the gym, so next thing you know, the principal come out, but this one teacher came out, Mr. Getty [ph.], my science teacher, and he and I talked, and he kind of, you know, I, I explained to him what had happened. And he said, "Well, you know, but you can't, you know, hijack the whole male class or student body because some guys, you know." But what do you do? I mean, you, you see some- something is wrong. It's just the good guy-bad guy thing. I thought they were being bad when they beat me with the volleyball and something should happen to them. And maybe I took it to an extreme, but, but Mr. Getty always, you know, took an interest in me and my wellbeing and, you know, and my temper, "And remember, Jerry [HistoryMaker Jerry Rushin], you know, talk about it. Think about it. Think about it five times. If you feel the same way after the fifth time, go ahead." You know, you mean--you know, so there's always somebody which I appreciated. They--all those people over the years.
Story_ID: 657790
Speaker 1: Now was church a big factor in growing up?
Speaker 2: You know, I read the Bible. As I said earlier, I enjoyed reading. I re- probably read the Bible a couple of times, but I wasn't big on going to church. My grandmother [Rushin's maternal grandmother, Willie Edmondson] made us go, you know, probably twice out of the month, you know, but I wasn't one of those kids that was there every Sunday or whenever the doors opened, but I, you know, I, I tried (laughter). I did the best I could. But I did read the Bible, and, and, you know, 'cause I wanted to know what, you know, what it's all about, and what, you know, some guidance, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember--pretty good memory of stuff I read, so I could really quote some stuff, you know, when we talk about it sometime in conversation. "Well, how do you know?" I said, "Well, I read it." "When?" "Well, I don't know, fifty years ago, but I read it." I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: What else were you reading in those days?
Speaker 2: Oh, man, novels. I mean, I remember--I was telling someone the other day. I asked my mother [Louise Edmondson Rushin] once, when she would do the maid work, could she bring home some magazines if the people she worked for wanted to throw them away. And she would bring home Life magazines or some magazine I never heard of 'cause a lot of times, she worked for Jewish people, so a lot of stuff was about their culture or stuff, but I read them anyhow. So it was just newspaper. I remember the first time--there was a girl named Jayne Mansfield was an actress back in the day. Marilyn Monroe look alike, the blonde hair. She got killed in a car wreck. I think I saw it in New Orleans [Louisiana], but I remember the article I read that day that time, and her head was laying on the side of the road. That's when I first saw the word, decapitated. Straight to the dictionary I go. Oh, god, her head was decapitated. What does that mean? So (laughter). Oh, man, I said, oh, wow. She lost--you know, her--something happened and it just removed her head, severed her head from her body. But that was from reading the newspaper in 1962 [sic. 1967] maybe when she--when this happened. I'm not sure exactly, you know. But reading is great. I just think it's the greatest thing in the world.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I actually read the dictionary, you know, AA, double A. I read--in Vietnam for two years--I read a set of encyclopedias, volume A, just, just, just knowledge and just to know stuff.
Story_ID: 657791
Speaker 1: What about radio in those days? Were you--did you pay much attention to, to the radio?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I can tell you, excuse me. Briefly, what happened is, in my home in Fort Lauderdale [Florida], I saw a couple of homes being built, and one home was a two story home, really nice; especially, for that time of, of--in my life. And the other home had a big hole in the front, brand new home being built. And every day I watched the construction guys build these homes, so I went to the guy that left the hole in the front of the house, when I, when I got my nerve up. I say, "Sir, why you left this--what's this hole in front of this home?" He said to me, "Well, that's a picture window." I said, "Picture, how so?" He said, "Well, you know, when we put the glass in, you know, and you--inside, and you look through this, this--everything on the outside looks like a picture, a frame." Oh, so now--then, I said, wow, you guys must be rich, two story house, and the house has got a picture window. Who are these guys? Who's building these homes? And one was a doctor, Dr. Shirley [ph.]. And the other one was a local morning broadcaster on WFTL [WFTL Radio, West Palm Beach, Florida], Luther Holland, who had a Saturday TV show. Said--so then I kind of made up my mind, you know what? These guys are rich from looking at those homes. That's, that's what impressed me to make me think that way, so I'm going to do what they're doing. That's where doctor came into my mind because of the home that Dr. Shirley had built, and also the home that Luther Holland had built, the radio announcer at the time, so--
Speaker 1: So now is Luther Holland white or black, or--
Speaker 2: Black.
Speaker 1: He's black.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was 'cause he was building like two blocks from my mama's [Louise Edmondson Rushin] house at the time in Fort Lauderdale (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so you had a black radio personality on the radio when you were growing up.
Speaker 2: He was on for two hours every morning. He--you know, I think they went county western when he got off, but he would play some R and B and stuff from like five to seven [o'clock] maybe every morning.
Speaker 1: So this is in the early '60s [1960s], right? We're talking about, the--
Speaker 2: Late '50s [1950s], '58 [1958], '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: Fifty-eight [1958], okay.
Speaker 2: Sixty [1960]. So, you know, I kind of say, okay. If they can afford a home like this doing what they do, I'll do what they do for a living, and that's where the radio thing popped into my mind. And it's funny 'cause I go back now. I see those homes occasionally. I go back to Fort Lauderdale to see my family. You know, that's, that's a nice home, but not as impressive as it was when I was eleven, twelve years old. (Laughter) Here's the thing, I look at them, and I'm like, okay, that's nice. But at that time, I thought it was like, wow, look at these two houses here, you know, so it was an impression that I had, and got into radio probably because of that.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you associated radio with success.
Speaker 2: Yeah, with, with money, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And doctors. And keep in mind, too, the doctor element was that, okay, now I realize that doctors make money in my head because of this home I see, so it's like a double win. It's like, you also can help people, and you get paid well. How sweet is that? And that was a part of the concept when I got into broadcasting. I said, you know what? I can do some things to help people, and if I'm good at what I'm doing, I can get paid well. So you help, you help them with voter's registration. You help them fight drugs and, and stop violence, and, whatever, you know, I was scuffling with the--trying to get the Haitian community to be treated fairly when they would come over here on their boats in the '70s [1970s] and they were being mistreated, so it's--you know, so it wasn't healing per se, but it was helping. And, you know, and I was fairly good at radio, so I get--got paid fairly well, you know, so it was kind of like the same results, to help and get compensated for it, either one of those professions; doctor or radio.
Story_ID: 657792
Speaker 1: In high school [Dillard High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida] did you have much guidance in terms of what kind of course work you'd have to take to become a doctor or a broadcaster?
Speaker 2: Dr.--I mean, Mr. Getty [ph.], my science teacher, he talked to me about--you know, and, and to be a doctor, he thought that you had to have a certain amount of, of stuff involving formulas, and, and, you know, H2O, two parts this. And I remember he--we had one conversation about that kind of stuff, which really, it didn't turn me off, but I said, god, this seems like it's a lot. Now, in broadcasting, obviously, you have to be able to read, and that was always--like I said, it was a hobby of mine, so I enjoyed reading, and that came more natural to me, you know, still, of course, you had to learn to read so others could really understand what you're reading, not just self reading or speed reading for your brain, but you--now you gotta read it, absorb and then put it out there over the airways, so you have to work on that part of it, but the reading thing, so it was--you know, especially, as a jock [disc jockey], you know, and doing commercials and stuff, you know, so the, the reading skills came in very, very handy, and the creative thing, you know, always with the arts, you know, from drawing and what have you, so it kind of worked well for me in my natural, I guess, instinct or talents, for, for--broadcasting was more natural than it was being a doctor; although, I was very good at it in Vietnam during surgeries, not have--I was never a doctor, but, of course, I was forced to, to do surgeries, emergency surgery when guys got hurt, I couldn't, you know, there was no doctor--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) around, so--
Speaker 1: I just, just wondered if you took--if you tried to pursue science in high school (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, only, only my, my interactions with the science teacher that taught me a lot about life and, you know, and school stuff, you know. But I, I didn't gravitate. That was not like, bring it on, like when it come to reading, you know, you know. And then I'll tell you about the passion for reading. In my--in the sixth grade, at the school I was telling you about, Lincoln Park [Lincoln Park Elementary School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida], they had this contest. Everybody would have to go to the library and check out a book and come back the next day. You got a week. And stand before the class and talk about the book that you read, and the--when--you would get ink pen, pencils or whatever, crayon or something, I don't know, but little prizes. So I won this thing for like ten, twelve, straight weeks. And the week that I lost, I couldn't find a real interesting book. I found a book about a little boy who wanted--a Indian [Native American] boy who wanted to become a warrior or a grown man, and he had to go and kill a deer or a bear or something, as a--like a rite of passage kind of thing, but I could not make it exciting. You know, the book, you know, and I--'cause I did books on Christopher Columbus, and I could talk about the, you know, scurvy. And, "Scurvy, what's scurvy?" I could. "Oh, oh, scurvy," you know. And I did a thing on Magellan [Ferdinand Magellan], the straits of Magellan [Strait of Magellan]. I always did stuff on history, and I could just make it come to life, you know. I did a piece on Davy Crockett, the Alamo [San Antonio, Texas]. These kind of books, you know, it was the history kind of stuff. When I got to this last book, maybe I was just tired, but it didn't--I'd had no fire for the book, so I lost that after about the tenth or twelfth week, you know. It hurt a little bit, but I got over it like the next day. But I really enjoy--what I'm--my point is, reading was always, you know, a thing for me to, to enjoy even today.

Speaker 1: Was there a radio program in high school [Dillard High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida]? Was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, nothing at all.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Some high schools do have like a little radio station.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. I've been involved with a few.
Speaker 1: Did you do announcements on the--
Speaker 2: Excuse me.
Speaker 1: Did you do any of those?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I used to do that some in the, in the office in the morning. "Today we got this." "Don't forget we've got guests on campus today. We got," blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You know, just fooling around, you know, but, yeah, I did, I did a little of that. But, you know, it was, at that time, jocks [disc jockey], just jocks at that point, hadn't even thought about management. They seemed so smart. I mean, it's these guys who get up, you know, tell you what the weather is. You know, "It's going to be a high of blah, blah, blah, a low of this." "This afternoon, we got thunder showers." "Don't forget to do this." I thought, dang these guys are smart. You know, but, of course, they had, you know, little machine- machines at the time, UPS machines [sic.], or the UPI [United Press International] or whatever it was. But, anyhow, I just thought it was just a cool thing. These guys were like brilliant, and they played all this great music, and people, and people loved them. And, you know, I mean, they were like, they were like stars in the ghetto, these black jocks back in the day.
Speaker 1: So by the time you were in, in high school, was there a black oriented station in Fort Lauderdale [Florida] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We had a couple of them, the one out of Miami, WMBM [WMBM Radio, Miami Beach, Florida].
Speaker 1: WMM?
Speaker 2: WMBM.
Speaker 1: MBM, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and we had WAME [WAME Radio; WSUA Radio, Miami, Florida].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The Whammy in Miami, they called it. And we had WRBD [WRBD Radio; WWNN Radio] up in Fort Lauderdale [sic. Pompano Beach, Florida], and, ironically, I ended up buying that station when it--I owned it. I bought it in 1990, the school--the station in Fort Lauderdale that I was raised with, you know, which I thought it was just so cool that my, you know, my kid station when I was a kid, have a chance to be part owner in it was like a--I don't know, just a good feeling all around.
Speaker 1: That--which was one was that? That's--
Speaker 2: WRBD.
Speaker 1: WRBD, okay.
Speaker 2: In Fort Lauderdale.
Speaker 1: So you bought this in 1990 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ninety [1990], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. I didn't have it on the outline, so I've got it now.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: When we get to it, we'll, we'll talk about--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --about that.
Story_ID: 657794
Speaker 1: How were your grades in high school [Dillard High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida]?
Speaker 2: B plus. But I, but I, again, I didn't put any initiative in there. It, it came--everything came easy to me. I guess if I would've studied and really applied myself, I could've probably been came out with some outrageous, you know, averages, you know. And back to the reading thing. I remember in first grade [at Clarence C. Walker Elementary School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida], my teacher, Ms. McCoy [ph.], they gave us these little books to read, so it was about the second day of school, you know, I go to her desk and gave it back to her, and she asked me what was wrong. And said, "Nothing. I read it." She said, "You read the entire book?" I said, "Yes, ma'am." "The entire book?" I said, "Yes, ma'am." So she decided, says, "Well, stop by the house after school," lived right down the street from where I lived. Stopped by. She quizzed me on the book. And sure enough, I answered all the questions. "Well, I guess you did read it," she said, "Well, here. Take this one and read it." Okay. Wasn't two days on that one. "Here you go." "You read it?" "Yeah." So this went on for finally, probably about the second month of, of first grade, there was no more first grade books to read 'cause I was just knocking them out every two days, so then she started giving me second grade books, and then she started give me stuff having to--books that had nothing to do with school, and I would go by and sit in her kitchen while she prepared dinner for her husband. I'd sit in the kitchen, and, and she'd quiz me on these things, and I would--she says, okay. And probably I got up through first grade year, I started--I was reading fourth grade books at that time. I remember some big discussion she had with my mother [Louise Edmondson Rushin] about it and the principal as they wanted to do something with it, but my mom said, "Eh, let him--put him in second grade with, with his friends. I don't need him--you know, let him stay with his friends." You know, so I don't know what the big deal was, but something impressed them there about the reading thing, but the books was really very--not silly but very easy reads, even at age six (laughter).
Story_ID: 657795
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now what about television? And did you--I mean, you grew up in a time when TV was changing. A lot more news is on, we had the assassination of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --President Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] in--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) sixty-three [1963]. You, you were in, in high school [Dillard High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida]. You were about, what, a sophomore--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a--
Speaker 1: --along in high school then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I was, what, tenth grade, maybe, I came out in--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the--
Speaker 2: --sixty-five [1965], so.
Speaker 1: --March on Washington, all those things were going on (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. And all of that and the sit-ins at Woolworth [F.W. Woolworth Company] and Wal- yeah, Walgreens [Walgreens Company], so--
Speaker 1: Was there much actually going on in, in Fort Lauderdale [Florida] then?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I remember our sit-ins, downtown Fort Lauderdale, at the Woolworth five and dime store. They had the little lunch counter there, and so I was on the fringes of that. I wasn't quite grown enough to really be involved, but I remember across the street and, you know, taking notes and watching the commotion and what have you. Television, it was like--it was so--to me, it was like so out of reach. I just remember Walter Cronkite, and that's the way it--and Edward R. Murrow [sic.], "And that's the way it is," doing his, his thing, his famous interviews, so, you know, but I say, well, those heights are beyond me, you know, I, you know. 'Cause there wasn't any black role models. I think maybe Nat King Cole had a show on ['The Nat King Cole Show'], but, hell--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --I couldn't sing (laughter), so that was out. But, as far as news and what have you, and there wasn't any really black shows on. I mean, you had some stereotype things where you--chauffeur or the butler or something, so there wasn't much to drive me or push me toward television.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But, but on the radio--
Speaker 2: Yeah, man, like--
Speaker 1: --you had disc jockeys, the black disc jockeys.
Speaker 2: Yeah, man.
Speaker 1: Who, who were some of the black disc jockeys that, that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, beyond Luther Holland, and it's--the good thing about Mr. Holland was, he wasn't a jive jock. He didn't talk jive talk. He was just--he would play stuff like--I heard 'Porgy and Bess' [George Gershwin]. He would play great Lena Horne stuff. He would play some R and B, too, but, but he had more of a Top 40 presentation. You know, "That's the sound of Lena Horne, WFTL [WFTL Radio, West Palm Beach, Florida], fifteen past the hour of six o'clock. Good morning, to you. I'm Luther Holland." And this is how he did it. And then, of course, as time went by, and we got a black formatted station, then you started hearing, you know, blah, blah, blah. "I'm on the scene. Here come the man with the record machine, (scats)." You know, so, okay. That was a whole different thing. But I always appreciated what Mr. Holland did, his way of--you know, his show. You know what I'm saying? Because it was just different. And I also appreciated the guy that did all the jive talking and stuff to. And, and I wanted to be able to not talk that jive, but I wanted to be able to say things that was positive to motivate people and, and make people feel good and share information, so I've always been very, you know--so, to me, radio became entertainment and information.
Speaker 1: Did Luther Holland, kind of share those positive messages on the, on the air?
Speaker 2: You, you know, yeah, he was one of those kind of guys. He couldn't--remember, the format at that time for that station was different so he couldn't really delve into that kind of stuff. He had to pretty much be middle of the road in everything he said and did.
Speaker 1: So he never talked--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --about, say, civil rights (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: --or that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was just a good morning guy with a great voice and good middle of the road presentation of his music, you know, and Sammy Davis, Jr., I remember, and, and Lena Horne, and Pearl Bailey had a couple of songs. It's--it was black music, but it was that kind of thing. I didn't hear James Brown on his show, you know, that kind of stuff at the time. Heard some Motown [Motown Records], early Motown on his show (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: But your hardcore R and B was left up to the other jocks at other stations.
Story_ID: 657796
Speaker 1: Now, were you involved in any leadership roles in high school [Dillard High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida], in terms of, you know, clubs, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. You know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) or student government and that sort--?
Speaker 2: I was always involved but as a supporter, and, and I'll tell you what happens is, the more you stand up and speak or speak out, the more you're going to be observed, and to be very honest with you, I didn't feel comfortable because my clothes was not the best, so I didn't want to draw attention to myself. Not that I wasn't capable of doing these things, but you gotta remember, if my shoes were not the best looking shoes, or my pants were not the best, and my shirt didn't quite match, whatever, you know, you kind of shrink yourself in the classroom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I realized that how you look is very important to your performing, so, you know, I mean, it took me a while to get, to get that, you know. It's that when the teacher asks for, "Okay, can anybody tell me the," blah, blah, blah, blah, "the Gettysburg Address?" Blah, blah, blah, blah. Hell, yeah, I knew it, but once I raised my hand, everybody going to do what? They going to stand and turn and look to see who's speaking. Then what are they going to see? They going see my green shirt with my burgundy pants or something. What the heck? He look like Barney or something, in disguise, you know. So I didn't, you know--not because I didn't know. I just, you know, I just, you know--
Speaker 1: So you were really self conscious like--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: --like a lot of teenagers are, yeah.
Speaker 2: And so I understood the importance, even with my kids, you know. I wanted them to always look good. I didn't ever want that to be a problem for them, so I make sure that they--you look good, so if you want to be seen, you want to speak, don't mind, let them look at you 'cause you're gonna look nice.
Story_ID: 657797
Speaker 1: What kind of counseling advice did you get when you were a senior in high school [Dillard High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida]? This would have been '65 [1965], is this your--
Speaker 2: Sixty-five [1965].
Speaker 1: Sixty-five [1965].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so did they talk to you about going to college, anybody ever--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, they--they pitched the college piece, and which I was going to do, but at the time, if you remember, the, the draft was going on for the Vietnam War, so I said, well, you know what? I don't want to go to college and blah, blah, blah, and then all of the sudden get started in my career, making me some money, and here come Uncle Sam saying, "Oh, excuse me. Yeah, I need you to do a little thing for me in Vietnam for a few years, a couple years," whatever it was. So I decided to volunteer for the [U.S.] Army at age--I got out of school in June. In August, I was in the Army, two months or so later.
Speaker 1: Did you--did the fact that your brother [Johnnie Rushin, Jr.] was already in Vietnam influence you?
Speaker 2: Well, he was already in the Army, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Well, I felt he was getting the Army behind him. He was doing his duty, and, and he could move on with his life. So I said, well, you know what? I'm going to do the same thing. Get in--'cause at that time, everybody is being drafted. I got to go. I either go now, or I go after I get out of college, so I said, let me get it out of the way, so I don't have to have an interruption of my career, whatever it was, doctor or radio. So I volunteered and it was a three year tour of duty. It was three years when you volunteered. I didn't know at the time I could have volunteered for the draft, and it would have been two years. I found that out later, so I just volunteered, and that was three years, but it could've just--I--they could've drafted me next week. I'd still have been drafted, but it would've been, would've been two, but because I went in the regular Army, it was three. So then, of course, I spent a couple of those years in Vietnam.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, so where did you--where did they train in--
Speaker 2: Carolina, Augusta, no, it was at--up there around Augusta, Georgia, so it would have been in--
Speaker 1: Fort Benning [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yeah, Fort Jackson [Columbia, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Fort Jackson.
Speaker 2: Fort Jackson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, you know--
Speaker 1: By Columbia [South Carolina], yeah, Columbia.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But after, after I got out of the Army and those two years in Vietnam, I, I got out of the Army in January of '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Well, wait a minute. Let's talk about Vietnam.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Vietnam is a big thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah. It (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, it's a--
Speaker 2: Yeah. It's--
Speaker 1: So it couldn't--it can't go by too fast, so--
Speaker 2: No, no. It, it taught me.
Speaker 1: Did, did you--I mean, what did you know about Vietnam before you went to Vietnam, and, and--
Speaker 2: You know, from what Walter Cronkite told me on the, on the evening news at six o'clock every day. I mean, I don't know with this guy Walter Cron- well, every day, he led with the Vietnam story and helicopters, and guys on stretchers, so all I knew was there was a war going on, and from what I saw on the news clips, we were getting our butts kicked 'cause I always saw guys on stretchers, and, oh, my god, helicopters taking them, you know, whatever, so that, that was about it. I didn't know the pol- politics of it. There was oil involved, the Gulf of Tonkin and all this kind of stuff, you know, but I just knew there was a war going on, and we're being drafted at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you weren't--you didn't think about the pol- political thing--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --at all anything like that.
Speaker 2: Not at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you know, and it was, you know, and especially when you did medevacs, medical evacuations like I did, you see a lot of stuff that's--a lot of blood, a lot of horrible, horrible stuff.
Speaker 1: How were black soldiers treated in Vietnam when you were there? I mean, it--was it what you thought it was going to be, or was it--
Speaker 2: You know, I observed some--I had some personal observations. I--there was rumors, you know, people, a lot of people said that we got the, the jobs, but it's, it's--you know, you're asked, you know, "What do you want to do in the Army?" So I picked the medical profession, and a lot of guys picked--what was it, 111 [sic. 11th Infantry Regiment], which is a soldier--
Speaker 1: On the mil--
Speaker 2: --combat, you know.
Speaker 1: Infantry or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah, infantry, yeah, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Like, okay. But I just thought that a lot of times in the 101st Airborne [101st Airborne Division], I just thought that a lot of the, the bodies I would see, and the people I would help rescue, and I think disproportionately, there was a higher number of minorities in those body bags.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But, you know, we wasn't taking up, what is it--
Speaker 1: Polls (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Communications, and this and all this other stuff to keep you off the--out of the jungle, so to speak. I mean, some did, you know, but, you know, a lot of us just went in and fight the war. So, you know, it's just my observation--
Story_ID: 657798
Speaker 1: Were you in the 101st [101st Airborne Division]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was in the 117th Assault Helicopter--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Company [117th Assault Helicopter Company]. I was attached to an assault helicopter company. I was in the medical, medical detachment. There was like twelve of us and we supported medically the assault helicopter company.
Speaker 1: So medevac [medical evacuation].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Kind of like the MASH units [mobile army surgical hospital] you see in the movie.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Or on TV, 'M*A*S*H.'
Speaker 1: So you're the guys that are flying the helicopters in with the, with the bodies and the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, the wounded, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So that had to be, that had to be really tough, too.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, at age eighteen--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --it was, it was crazy. It was rough. You know, there's no doubt about that. But you can grow up--you need something to transition young black men from that neighborhood to becoming a man. Maybe the vehicle is college. I don't know. But in, in my case, the vehicle was the [U.S.] Army, and even the two years in Vietnam--and what happened, I did a first year in Vietnam, and they gave me orders to go to Germany. Well, I, I knew I didn't like cold weather, so I tried to change--get--you know, "I will go anywhere, but not where it's cold." And, they said, "Well, we can't change it." So they say, "Only thing we can do is give you another year over here." Say, "Shoot. Unh-uh." Dumb me, I took the year in Vietnam, the second year 'cause I just didn't want to go--I don't want no cold weather. But, anyhow--
Speaker 1: So during the period of time that you were in Vietnam, did you have any experience in radio at all, or, or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, no. It was all medical stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: And lot of surgery, emergency surgeries and stuff.
Speaker 1: So you would do procedures and, you know, life saving pro- procedures on--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --wounded soldiers.
Speaker 2: Because I worked with the doctors. And here's another thing, too, I realized. A lot of my immediate bosses, so to speak, in, in Vietnam, were doctors, obviously, 'cause I'm in the medical field in the Army, but they were all doctors who got drafted after they had started their professions, and that's what I wanted to avoid. That's why I wanted to get it out of the way. And they were angry. 'Cause I remember one guy, I didn't do--he said, I--he was from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Dr. Casey [ph.], and he was saying, "I'm doing $125,000 a year job, and here they come." He hated the Army. But, you know, but in his case, you know, he was--had a great thing going, $125,000 a year ain't a bad salary in 2014. Most folk would never see that. But go back now to 1966 or whenever this was. That's like probably $2  million or a million and a half buying power, so that was--he--so all my doctors was drafted, my immediate bosses, and they would stay six months and they would go somewhere else, but, anyhow. So that--so then I thought I had done the right thing when I went ahead and volunteered for the Army and got it out of the way, and now I can go in my profession and not have that happen to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was there anything significant that influenced your career that happened in Vietnam that--
Speaker 2: As far as me getting into broadcasting?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, here's the, here's the thing. When I--like I said--when I got out of the Vietnam, and now I'm seriously considering becoming a doctor 'cause I, you know, I had a passion for it. I enjoyed it, the, the feeling I had, and I remember Dr. Casey's words about him making $125,000 a year, so, I mean, I'm not all benevolent here. I mean, I'm thinking, you know, livelihood, but what happened was after two years in Vietnam and doing the things and seeing the things I'd, I'd seen and done, I lost--I realized I had lost the discipline to be a classroom student because I could not go from what I had seen for two years to sitting in a chair behind a desk and raising my hand. I, I--you know, something happened, and I, and I lost that aspect that the discipline that it, it takes to be a good student, and I knew that, and to be a doctor, obviously, I had to go to college. I had to, you know, take up some kind of specialization. You have to do internships and all this other stuff. It probably at that time would take you easily eight years, more than like ten years to become a doctor, and I just had lost discipline to be a good student, so that's why--and broadcasting school was six months.
Story_ID: 657799
Speaker 1: You came out when, in '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968].
Speaker 1: Well, but what, what month in '68 [1968] do you, do you remember (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) August.
Speaker 1: Everybody remembers exactly the month they (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, man. Yeah, man.
Speaker 1: So August of '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And when you were--now, a lot went down when you were in Vietnam over here.
Speaker 2: Yeah. That's--
Speaker 1: Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is assassinated. You have all these riots.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight [1968] was a tumultuous year. I mean, the Democratic convention [1968 Democratic National Convention, Chicago, Illinois]. The riots in Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --were going on in '68 [1968]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when you came back.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what, what--so, so you decided to go to broadcast school in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mainly because of the, the time that it took to complete the course, you know. And, like I said, you know, I was kind of joking, but you really don't have to be as--quite as smart to, to be in radio as you do to be a good doctor; especially, if you want to be a surgeon.
Speaker 1: So where did you go to broadcast school?
Speaker 2: Right here in Miami [Florida] through the public school system, a vocational school, Lindsey Hopkins vocational institute [Lindsey Hopkins Technical College, Miami, Florida].
Speaker 1: So, okay. And I have a note here that you were--you worked in a furniture store, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah. That's where the two Jewish gentlemen--I worked there from '68 [1968] until I guess, '70 [1970], '71 [1971], '72 [1972] when I got into radio.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what were these two Jewish gentlemen's names?
Speaker 2: Jacob [Jacob Brodsky (ph.)] and Ludwig Brodsky [ph.], the Brotzki brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay. So the Brodsky brothers furniture.
Speaker 2: Yeah. It was called Zeno's [Zeno Mattress Manufacturing Company, Inc., Fort Lauderdale, Florida] at the time.
Speaker 1: Zeno's, okay.
Speaker 2: Exactly. But, you know, they, they made me see--again, they liked me for whatever reason. You know, I started off as just polishing the furniture, making sure that the furniture, furniture didn't have fingerprints on it and stuff, and mirrors were clean and not--no dust. That was my job. And then one thing led to another. Then I was in the warehouse, and then I--at some point, I was in charge of the warehouse, and one thing to another, and next thing I know, they tell me to bring a tie to work with me, and, you know, and a change of a shirt, so then they started putting me on the floor as a salesman. You know, so they just kind of like--it's that someone has always helped, and, and that means a lot because I think it's important that, that I do the same thing, that I would have to do the same thing. And, I, I don't know why. There was a lot of guys working at that store that they could have, like I'll guess, I don't know. But they--
Speaker 1: So there was something about you that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and I'm--you know, and today, I don't know, but even as a grown man, even at Cox company [Cox Media Group] that, that I work for and I retired from, I, I knew I was different, but somehow, they embraced me, and they helped me, you know, and so I don't know. But that--that's how the radio thing came about that it was a choice either six, seven, eight, ten years of training in college and stuff to be a doctor or six months to get into radio.
Story_ID: 657800
Speaker 1: So you take the course [at Lindsey Hopkins Technical College, Miami, Florida], but you're working in a furniture store [Zeno Mattress Manufacturing Company, Inc., Fort Lauderdale, Florida]. Now, how did you--I mean, what was your first job in radio?
Speaker 2: Well, here's what I did. Christmas of '71 [1971], I quit the furniture store and started broadcasting school the 3rd of January of '72 [1972]. While in broadcasting school, I got a part time job as a board engineer with the--one of the stations in this building today, WEDR [WEDR Radio, Miami, Florida], and I would come in on Sundays and just play tapes. I don't know if you remember guys like Reverend Ike [Frederick J. Eikerenkoetter, III].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I would play a Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] tape, and I had the Jewish hour, the Polish hour, the Hungarian hour, just pushing buttons and letting these people come in. I was the engineer. I would open the mic [microphone], close the mic, and from there, I became a part time jock [disc jockey], you know. Then I became a full time jock.
Speaker 1: So you started out as the person that--I know a lot of other people in media be talking about that you always need an engineer that really knows what's going on--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --full time--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at the station, so, so you were that engine--that engineer.
Speaker 2: Yeah, kind of.
Speaker 1: That the made (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We call it a board op.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because they operate the board while--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the other person did the talking.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: You just hit his mic switch for him. You played his record for him. You know, he just sit before in the--in front of the mic and talk, and you did all the work and make things happen, which was, you know, nice.
Speaker 1: So was your goal to be on the air--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --eventually? Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I had--when I got that job, I was, I was in. You know, I was--because, because I understood that, that in life, if, if you're at a certain level, and you master that level, especially in a job situation, somebody is going to take you to the next level. They will not let you sit there, you know, if you--but you must master wherever it is you are, so an engineer's job, I got so good at that. I mean, 'cause I gave them advice, you know. They didn't have any intro music. I said, "Well, maybe you need a little intro to--I'll fade the music and let you talk over the top of it." Okay. Because the guys that had before me didn't care. And I said, "Let me do an intro for you." And I would say, "Good morning. It's ten o'clock. Welcome to the Hungarian hour with your host Mrs. Tula Maycrosse [ph.]." I remember she said to me, "Oh, no, don't say Maycrosse," says, "let it roll. Say, (imitates) Maycrosse." I was, "Maycrosse." Okay (laughter). But, but I helped them. And, you know, of course, they used to tell the lady at the time that, you know, the guy we got now, he's great. He's terrific. You know, but, you know, it was boring, so then I, you know, I did that for a while, and then I became a part time jock and then full time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then--
Speaker 1: So what was your first job as a jock, what, what did you (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was like a swing man where like if you couldn't show up, I'd come in, do your show, but I had a regular show I did on, on Saturdays, and then I would substitute while people are on vacation, and, and that was about the beginning as far as actually being on air.
Story_ID: 657801
Speaker 1: Now, WEDR [WEDR Radio, Miami, Florida] went into a black format in 1970, right? Just be- just as you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. It was what we call underground soul, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it wasn't R and B, but it was a black format, black, black jazz.
Speaker 1: Okay. Under- so what, what type of music are we talking about?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.
Speaker 1: Underground soul (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just some instrumental stuff. You may have heard some Miles Davis. It was that, that--I forget the flautist that played the flute.
Speaker 1: Herbie Mann or something like that or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Herbie Mann.
Speaker 1: Or stuff like that.
Speaker 2: The--god, these guys, gosh, I can't think of their names now. But, you know, then every now and then, you may slip in a Nina Simone song or stuff like that, you know, but it's basically a jazz format, a lot of Miles. And what's the gentleman name? Jimmy Smith on the organ, but you, you know, but we were playing a little cook--they were playing a little cooking jam, little, little up tempo jazz. It was like, you know, we're jamming, you know, wasn't like that old Eddie [Eddie Harris] stuff (scats). There was a little of that, but most of it was like rerecording of popular R and B song but a jazz version, so it was kind of familiar to the audience, although it was, you know, it was jazz, you know, kind of a jazzy flavor. Actually, I started playing R and B when I, you know, got in charge, I started playing--
Speaker 1: Now, were you deep into music when you started? Were you really--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was into it.
Speaker 1: Now, what was kind of music did you cleave to or what artist did you--
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, on the scene, you had, Al Green was just really starting to cook up. We had this first little-- I guess it was a regional hit, 'Back Up Train' before 'Love and Happiness' and, and those songs came about. You had the guys from Memphis, you know, Eddie Floyd and those guys, The Staple Singers, the Memphis sound, Atlantic Records. Then just your basic R and B stuff, that, you know, from The Bar-Kays out of Memphis, Tennessee, Bobby Womack, your--you know, [HistoryMaker] Tyrone Davis, your blues singers out of Chicago [Illinois], The Impressions, Temptations [The Temptations] was still doing stuff, the Motown [Motown Records] stuff, so there was plenty of R and B to play, so that's what we did. Because remember on FM band, they just played what we called elevator music.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So it was unheard of to play--to hear James Brown. I jump dead on James Brown. I forget what the song was, 'Get on the Good Foot' or something like that.
Speaker 1: So you started off on the FM band?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, and so, you know, we just made a regular R and B format, and, obviously, all the competition was AM, but the signals were not near as good, of course, on AM.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So it gave me an advantage, although I had a low powered FM. Later on, I did get up to, you know, full signal, but in early days, it was still better than a lot of AMs, although it was low powered. That was only sixteen thousand watts.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Now, in those from what I remember, there was kind of a, you know, tension in the broadcast industry over the AM and FM 'cause FM broadcast, the soul stations on FM that you said had a weaker signal, but--I mean, I mean, they sounded better, but people didn't have AM--I mean, FM radios in their cars (unclear).
Speaker 2: This was optional.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That was another problem that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --we had. It was--in the old days, you bought a car, had no radio.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You tell them what you want. I want AM. In fact, my first brand new car, I bought in the '60s [1960s]. I said, just give me AM 'cause nobody listen to FM, you know, and then after I got into the business on FM. I went, Jesus Christ, everybody need to have FM, so they--you know, but, then, of course, they made it standard (unclear).
Speaker 1: I know they were making FM converters--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at one point.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: A lot of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --new urban black contemporary stations were, were broadcasting, "Go get your converter," you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Trying to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or, or, "Don't ride in a car that just has just FM."
Speaker 2: --trying to hang in there.
Speaker 1: AM, rather.
Speaker 2: You know. But the FM frequencies, it's just a lot clearer, obviously, a lot stronger. See AMs used--you--unless you were grandfathered in from the old days, your biggest, the most wattage you can have on an AM is fifty thousand back then, but then that--you had to be grandfathered in. That's where Wolfman Jack was down in Mexico. You had WLAC [WLAC Radio] out of Nashville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I listened to them in Vietnam and in Fort Lauderdale [Florida], but then you had--the max was like a thousand watts, ten thousand occasionally.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So they, you know, it wasn't that powerful. Only had about a few in, a few in the country that was really powerful, so FM was the way to go 'cause AM was on its way out; especially, when FM started playing competitive music, the same music as AM were playing.
Speaker 1: Everybody wanted to hear stereo (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah. And talk was on AM. News talk became the AM outlet, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 657802
Speaker 1: So you become, at some point, Super Jerry J [HistoryMaker Jerry Rushin], right?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) My first--yeah, my first radio name was--yeah, I don't know. Yeah. That was it, Super, Super Jerry J, and why, I don't know or how.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your intro? What would, what would you--can, can you reconstruct it for us?
Speaker 2: Oh, my god. Something, something, a song--I remember a song with Vicki Sue Robinson, 'Turn the Beat Around.' 'Turn the Beat Around,' a disco song. What did I say? Dah, dah, dah, dah. "It's three o'clock," some, "something as the funky music go. Something, something, round and round, Super Jerry J steps in to turn the beat around." Some, some old stuff like that, you know. Then we had this thing with super music, you know, (scats) Super Jerry J, you know, it was. I don't know. (Laughter) It was so--
Speaker 1: A lot of reverb super, sup- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah and stingers and stuff. But it was personality radio. See, now you won't hear that stuff now because everybody is handcuffed now. You, you--now you--it's just a format. You just present the music, you know, pretty much, you know. You got a few guys do a personality. Like Tom Joyner does personality, you know, of course, and Howard Stern does it on the talk version, but, yeah, yeah. I was Super--and then I lost name on a bet, on some dumb basketball game. Portland Trail Blazers against the 76ers [Philadelphia 76ers] or something, and I took one team or the other on the (unclear). I forget how it went, but--
Speaker 1: You took the 76ers, I guess, 'cause they, they lost that season.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So now I got to--I bet my name, so I lost, so now what are you going call yourself fool? (Laughter) Idiot, so--and then I came up with, with Mr. J for--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: --a lot of years. It was like 19--
Speaker 1: So you actually bet your name on--
Speaker 2: You know, that's what jocks [disc jockey] do back then. You know (laughter), you do crazy stuff like that, yeah. But I lost, so then we--I, I think we had a little contest or something, you know.
Speaker 1: It would have been, it would have been difficult for Super Jerry J to be against Dr. J.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In the playoffs. That's--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You know, and, and people now in this building call me Dr. J for whatever reason. "Hey, Dr. J." I said, "It's not Dr. J, it was Mr. J." (Unclear). But, you know, during those days, you were able to, you know, insert your personality and some, some opinion, your--some, to some extent your opinion, you know, things, you know, and that was the beauty of radio then. You know, you could step outside of the, you know, music box and, and talk about issues, you know.
Speaker 1: So what was your time format, I mean, or time, timeframe (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the fir- in the beginning, I did mornings from six a.m. to ten, ten a.m. [at WEDR Radio, Miami, Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Did that for about three years, and--
Speaker 1: So this is starting in--I mean, you're on the air full time in, what, '72 [1972]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '73 [1973] somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Seventy-three [1973]--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --seventy-four [1974].
Speaker 1: So you're a morning man.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--all right.
Speaker 2: And I did most years, I moved to afternoon. When I became the program director, I started going and coming in the morning to do my work, my programming duties, then I started going on the air from, from three until seven and I did that for maybe, the longest period of time, ten, twelve years in the afternoon, from three to seven p.m.
Story_ID: 657803
Speaker 1: So a, a typical like morning show, would you have a guest, or, or would you--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Back then, you didn't have the complete zoos like you have now. Like if you notice on Tom Joyner ['Tom Joyner Morning Show'], you got J. [J. Anthony Brown], you got Sybil [Sybil Wilkes] and all those people, and, and this Rickey Smiley got ten people in there with him. Back then, it was pretty much just a jock [disc jockey], and I think--but, again, if you can be creative, you can fill that talk void because you're not being scripted, just ten seconds worth of whatever. Or you could have phone calls, or you could have a guest come in. You can have--you know, do interviews. But I, I believe that I could express my opinion at any time because I'm on the air, so I was always concerned about wanting to know and share what listeners thought. I thought people, people like to listen because they either want to disagree with what you say, or they're looking for some kind of confirmation on what they're saying or affirmation of what they're saying. "Oh, he's right. See, that's what I was telling my wife last name. Hear what he just said?" "Oh, he's stupid. What are you talking about?" That's okay. But they listen for those two reasons, so that's why I like to get the, the audience involved, you know. And then sometime if it's not the fire that I wanted, I would say something silly to fire--to put some fire under it, just to, you know--but I would do it myself, you know, so you learn those things and how to do those things, you know, when you're--after a while in the business, you know.
Speaker 1: Well it seems like it would be like a tightrope on some level because you don't want to make yourself unpopular by saying something that's completely wrong, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So, so you learn, you learn to--you know, sort of--kind of like Joan Rivers. She picked at herself some, even when she started having the plastic surgery, she could talk about some other starlet and how the star had plastic surgery. So, what's the word, self hybrid--whatever the word be--
Speaker 1: Self effacing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Or, or--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --self deprecating.
Speaker 2: Yeah. So I was very good at that. I would always shoot myself down the hardest, you know, and it kind of took--you know, people say, "Yeah, you right. You sure are." You know, it kind of took the sting out of it, but now when your time come for me to come down on you, well, you know, there ain't much you can say. You know what I'm saying? But, but you learn how to do that. That comes with experience how to--that tight- the tightrope, get that balancing act. You learn how to do that, you know, without, you know. It's what I used to call going to the edge but not over. I would say, let me just take the audience to the edge, and if they decide they want to go over, they can do it by themselves, but I knew where the edge was on every, every subject that came up, and I would go right to the edge. Then I'd put my brakes on. And now if some listeners want to go over the edge--not that something bad gonna happen, but you want your imagination now to, to go wherever, that's fine, but I didn't tell you to go there, you know.
Story_ID: 657804
Speaker 1: When you started, you were about twenty-five, I guess, right? Twenty-six, twenty-five, twenty-six (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, twenty- let me see. Yeah, about twenty-five.
Speaker 1: Okay. And, and your audience was mainly what, what age group?
Speaker 2: Oh, at that time, it was--I had everybody. Remember, you didn't have all these--you had a--we had a station [WEDR Radio, Miami, Florida] that you heard [HistoryMaker] B. B. King. Everybody is into Al Green, young and old. There was no hip hop then. There was nothing like a young person song. All you had was dance songs. Everybody danced off of James Brown, or then when the disco thing came out in the late '70s [1970s], everybody danced off The Trammps' 'Disco Inferno,' and Tu- what's the girl name? Gloria Gaynor, 'I Will Survive.' The--so, you know, everybody, "Do the Hustle, do, do, do" ['The Hustle'], so if you were young or old, that's what you had. And then you started coming with the rap music in the late '70s [1970s] out of the New York [New York], Sugarhill [Sugarhill Gang], and now you have something designed, I think, for the younger person, but you--but I still played that, but also still played--you still hear B. B. King or Bobby Bland or, or [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson or The Temptations.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So at that time, black radio was--it was what I called a full service station. You did your news. You did your, your interviews. You did your, your dance stuff. You did your blues stuff. It was, it was all one station for every generation as I used to say, so you--I want you to listen, but your daddy and mama can listen with you, you know, 'cause they going to hear what they want.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You're going to hear what you want.
Speaker 1: Yeah. You're, you're right. I mean, the country has gone through some kind of a cultural shift in that regard because in those days, yeah, my mother--
Speaker 2: Sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) would listen to the same thing that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --teenagers were listening to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on the radio.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Al Green come to town, everybody went, you know, eighteen year olds, thirty-five year olds, you know, whatever, unless you was at a nightclub or something where the kids couldn't get in. I remember Candi Staton, 'Young Hearts Run Free.' I don't know if you remember that song, but--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean, I'd do (unclear) and everybody is out there, you know, with my, my sister knew it, and my mama [Louise Edmondson Rushin], and, you know, and teenage girls, was, you know, a great song.
Story_ID: 657805
Speaker 1: Were there certain artists that would regularly come by and be, and be guests on the show?
Speaker 2: Yeah man, I had developed great relationships with some. James [James Brown] and I got to be pretty tight. I mean, he would come to town, and he would--I was--my station [WEDR Radio] was deep in the hood at the time in Liberty City [Miami, Florida], deep in the hood, and I remember traffic, you couldn't, you couldn't even get near the building when James would come 'cause everybody--he's there live and they want to see him, and I'd have him in there for a couple hours at least, you know, and we're just talking and, you know, and playing his music. And a lot of artists would come to town, and we do--had MC Hammer at a concert one night, and Hammer is in my office 'cause I knew Hammer when he first got started and before he was singing, he was just a record promoter, but, anyhow, he was hot at the time. We sat in there. The concert starts at like 7:30, 8:00. I'm on the air with Hammer. It's like seven, and, "Man, you got a show to do," you know. But people outside trying to see him. Then later on, Puff Daddy [P. Diddy; Sean Combs] would come by a lot, you know, especially when he was in, in the hood, you know, and he still comes here, too, but, you know, it's--I don't think that happens as much. And then Ice Cube was here last week, and a few other--you know, so they still come by, but not the relationship to the extent--see, now the format will not let you take two hours with an artist like I did with James or Hammer or whoever the--you know, whatever the case may be. See, you do an interview. It's like TV. You give them their fifteen minutes, "Well, thank you for stopping by. We appreciate it." They're out a here. But back in those days, especially if the artist had the hits, I'd sit down with them. Man, Lionel Richie comes, sit down and we talk and play his music for a hour and a half, two hours, and it wasn't violating format. Yeah, and now you got this to do. The format will say this.
Speaker 1: I don't know why that's not done today, you know, in a lot of ways. I mean, I don't--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --understand it.
Speaker 2: You know, I honestly think that, that if you tell everyone what to do, that means you can control what everyone do. If you have each person come in based upon his or her own talent, now you don't have that talent, you can't, you know, you can't give it. You can't take it from them. It's theirs. And you can't reproduce it. You have no control over it. But if I script everybody, "I want you to speak at ten minutes past the hour, and this is what I want you to say." Now you're very interchangeable 'cause if you got a problem, I'll get somebody else to come in and speak at ten minutes past the hour, and to say what I want them to say. But once--and the community love your, your--and audience love your personality, I can't--you can't get somebody to come in and be Super Jerry J [HistoryMaker Jerry Rushin] 'cause that's me. But if I'm just scripted and told what to do, "Okay, Jerry, you're out of here. Hey, Will, c'mon in. Do this right here." "Yes, sir." That was a part of it, not all of it, but I think a lot of that came into play.
Speaker 1: You think it's like an over management--
Speaker 2: Yeah, sometime (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in a sense, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah. You see--
Speaker 1: You manage them based on an objective--a different set of objectives.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And, and some jocks [disc jockey], be honest with you, they abuse their popularity. They knew that personality had been accepted. They were big. And if someone tried to make outrageous demands, salary wise and other compensation, and I think that kind of started pitting some ownerships against personality as far as personality radio is concerned because some guys would hijack the station, you know, for whatever they want. "What you gonna do, you gonna fire me? You know who I am? You know, I'm Boo-bop Ditty, the cool, cool cat in the city." Okay, okay. You know, but when you do it this way now, "Okay. You're out. C'mon in. You're in." You know, so--and I think that was some of it, too.
Story_ID: 657806
Speaker 1: Now you were named program director in '75 [1975] at, at WER--DR, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, WEDR [WEDR Radio, Miami, Florida], yeah.
Speaker 1: WEDR, and--
Speaker 2: And EDR stands for Ed Rivers, E.D. Rivers [Eurith D. Rivers], who was the governor of Georgia. Ironically, you had Governor Cox [James M. Cox] later on that I worked for his company [Cox Media Group], who was a governor in, in--
Speaker 1: Ohio (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Ohio.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And--but before that, I worked for Ed Rivers. The old man there was the governor of Georgia but in the late '30s [1930s] and early '40s [1940s], I think, when 'Gone with the Wind,' came out he was governor (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I don't know why that's funny but it is.
Speaker 2: Hey, man.
Speaker 1: So, yeah. E.D. Rivers, right, okay. So he started the, he started the station and, and, of course, it switches format in, in the '70s [1970s] as we talked about before. And when you're program director now, now, what did--what, what does program director mean? What, what do you do?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you--in other words, everything you hear, I was responsible for what you heard, and that included music. When commercials are played, you got to strategize. You don't want to just play commerc- commercials randomly. You try to think what's the best way to put the commercial break within an hour and it will not--it'll do less damage to a person's listening habits. You know what I'm saying? It won't interfere as much with their listening, so you have to be kind of smart in where you place your commercials, and, obviously, a lot of that is music. (Cough) Excuse me. And all--and, of course, having talent. You have to very--be very careful with, you have the right talent in the right place, 'cause some guys are great in the morning, but they suck at night. Some guys are great at night but suck in the morning, you know, and, you know, so you gotta--that's your job, though, to get the right talent on air and the right music, I think because predominantly what you hear most of the time on an R and B station would be music, so that's your main product, commercials would be a byproduct, and to an extent, yeah, with personality radio, a jock [disc jockey] means a lot more because you--and he's inserting his or her personality, but if you're not inserting the jock's personality, the jock, who cares who push the button, but if there's personality, they may care because they may like it or dislike a personality, so the personality is a little bit more risky but the rewards are a lot greater.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I think Michael Baisden had success because he was personality radio. Joyner [Tom Joyner] had success because he's personality radio, and even Harvey [Steve Harvey], you know, but that's three I can't--I guess there's a few others across the country. I think a few other guys got syndicated shows, and they are syndicated by the--most local station's formats, you don't have personality radio. It's pretty scripted.
Story_ID: 657807
Speaker 1: Now, you were--the, the two, I guess, critical times for radio, especially in those days, I guess even today are, you know, morning--the, the drive times; the morning time and the afternoon when people are on their way home. Is that, that true?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is that true? Still true (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well yeah, you think that there's more people in, obviously, in automobiles going and come from work, so the potential for an audience--especially over the years because there wasn't all these devices we have now. You know, we got all kinds of stuff you can listen to now, ways to listen to radio now, but in the early days, you just had your home, and you had your car, so you had more people in the car in the mornings going in, and, of course, those same people coming home in the afternoon, so--and what it meant was a lar- larger potential audience. You can get a bigger dollar for your commercial prices, you know, take your price of the commercials in morning drive up and afternoon drive, you can take them, you know, take up your prices on that.
Speaker 1: Is there a typical personality that, that's better for afternoon than--
Speaker 2: Yeah. I, I think afternoon, you try to keep it--to me, yeah, I'm old school. I, I think it should be pretty much upbeat, you know, not crazy, you know, you can--you know, but it just should be upbeat and, and cheerful and keep it flowing, music wise. And content is important beyond music in the afternoons, just a little lively. You know, I think it's a easier show to do than morning because morning is so much information driven between--news is more important to a lot of people in the morning 'cause they want to know what the hell happened the night before. You know, they're pretty much up and about during the day, so they know--oh, nothing happened today 'cause I'm up and about, but what happened last night when I was asleep, so I think you had to do more news conscious stuff in the morning, information in the morning because people starting the day. "Don't forget, there's, there's a wreck. There's--the highways are rainy. The highways are wet, so you leave early, you know, take the umbrella." "Take a heavy coat 'cause there's--temperatures gonna dip midday," so there's more chatter in the morning, information wise. But, you know, so that would be the difference between those two basic shows, but they're the ones you can get your top dollar for, morning and afternoon, but, you know.
Speaker 1: Did you have like talk shows in the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I did special talks shows.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I you know, that was part of what I did. I did editorials, and I did talk shows because you also got to, I felt, there's a lot of--there was a lot of frustration, still is, in, in the, in the black communities. There's just issues with unemployment and stuff, and I think people need an outlet. They need--and some--it's like going to a doctor. You know, one of the things I did in Vietnam, for instance, when guys say they are sick. And I take a look at them, they're not really sick, you know. I'd give them some kind of placebo. I'd give them the basic aspirin and give it a fancy name and say, "Take two of these now. Take two tonight and take two tomorrow." And you'd be surprised how many guys, "Hey, doc, appreciate that, man. I feel--." "Hey, man, you know, I feel much better, doc, thank you so much." But I--you got, you know, so the same thing with radio. Some people just--once they express themselves, whatever their problem is, they feel better about it. Their problem may not be solved, but at least somebody heard them, and it's just like, "Yeah, no. I didn't know. I told him. I told him exactly what I thought we should do and what we're not doing," you know, so, so that's one reason that I provide that outlet. And I do that now as--I come back to work now. It's kind of like part time. I'm like a consultant now. I'll come in some days and sit in on a, on a session, and we just talk about issues like the stuff that happened in Missouri at that little town there in Ferguson, when the George Zimmerman trial and stuff was going on, you know, because that's pretty much a part of my reputation of what I used to do, and, and people kind of expect it, you know, either from me or the company that I work with [Cox Media Group], and so we try to keep that going for that reason.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.
Story_ID: 657808
Speaker 1: What about the shows, I guess, in the, between the morning and the evening, the, the middle of the day shows. Is there--
Speaker 2: Your midday?
Speaker 1: Yeah. What, what are you striving to do with that (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, mid- you want to try to hold your office workers, those who are allowed now to, to have music at the--you know, throughout the system, PA [public address system] or whatever--
Speaker 1: Or earphone.
Speaker 2: --at their desk.
Speaker 1: Or maybe earphones.
Speaker 2: Yeah, even earphones. But now you would rather for it to be a regular phone--or maybe a radio system in the ceiling because now you're rated on a meter that picks up your sound, and on headphones, you can't--it won't register--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --by the way. That's what Arbitron [Nielsen Audio]--well, not even Arbitron. That's what they're doing now.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I'm going to ask you more about Arbitron.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, yeah, but midday, you just try--same thing. You take a look at what audience is available. Most people are at work. You know, they're not in their cars, you know, not absolute, of course, people still out and about, so you try to--maybe your theory or your plan would be to--I want the office workers. So you--what would sound good in an office? You know, what would sound good if it's piped in through the restaurant? You know, so now do you soften your music? Are you not as hard midday, say on, say on Jamz [WEDR Radio, Miami, Florida], which is a hip hop station. Do I soften the hip hop midday because I want--I don't, I don't want to rattle an office, you know, so now do I do more R and B sound or less frantic hip hop music? I mean, there's a lot of thinking that goes into that programming and music and stuff, and, you know, and everybody got their ideas to what they think is great, but--you know, the winning formula, so that's, that's the basic difference. I mean, then at night, a lot of folk like do the Quiet Storm. I like to have a good medium tempo show at night myself. I may go Quiet Storm after ten o'clock, but I just think there's still a lot of life out there; especially, Miami [Florida], nowadays, the sun will go down at damn near 8:30, so I move Quiet Storm in a bright--you know--that's just me, though.
Speaker 1: Yeah. You want the Quiet Storm at night, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, exactly with me, you know, but now they come on--
Speaker 1: The Quiet Storm, this is the concept of slow--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) some would say love--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --making music.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but, you know, it's--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the--
Speaker 2: But, you know, once again, everybody got their strategy, not to say what's right or what's wrong, but usually one win and one won't, so you'll find out.
Story_ID: 657809
Speaker 1: What was your relationship like with management at WEDR [WEDR Radio, Miami, Florida] in those (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the early days?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: In the early days, it was rough because the one manager was not a nice man. See, and this goes back to the, to the movies that I was telling you about, what you--the good against evil. Was not a nice man.
Speaker 1: Now, is this a black owned station at this point?
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't black owned, but it was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --black operated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The manager was black. But he was the kind of guy that mistreated female employees, you know. What do you call it? Sexual harassment. You know, he would literally fire a woman if she didn't, you know, you know, go out with him. Just a bad guy, you know, bad. So, you know, part of my makeup was, this guy is not right. He's, he's hurting people. He's hurting, you know, the station, and he's hurting young ladies and young guys. If, if a young lady had a crush on you, he would fire you. He's horrible. So, yeah, in my mind, it may be the end of my career, but this guy has to go. So that's where that old thing about me not liking bullies kicked in. He was a corporate bully on a local level to me, so, eventually, you know, he was gone. That's how I got the job after he left. The, the lady said, "Jerry [HistoryMaker Jerry Rushin], you could do this job." Because he was a very bad person. I won't even get into the details because it's really sick.
Speaker 1: Did you help him go, or did you--
Speaker 2: No, no. I helped him go. Yes, sir. To answer your question. I really did. And I had a program director that was the same way while this same, the same GM [general manager]. This guy had me at least three times a week every Sunday at that time--the Dolphin [Miami Dolphins] perfect season was going on I remember in '72 [1972]. Every Sunday, we had a--we got a meeting, and it made no sense, you know, and he would say stuff to us like, "You know, the word is whether--," or not whether. "It's weather not whether, okay?" And then one time, one meeting he said to me, "When you say your prayers at night, you should pray to me because I am your god." Then I said, this guy is crazy. He's got to go. So I admit it. That's when that same bully thing kicked in again. He had fired some guys, same reason. He had to go, so I just said, okay. I know what to do. So he's gone, and, you know, that's how I became the program director, by the way.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--
Speaker 2: So like I'm just--I'm assassinating these guys to get their job but not really. These guys, they were just terrible men. They were just terrible men. And somebody had to do something. Everybody--see nobody wanted to lose their job. You know, it's--you know, I understand, but, again, I go back to what mom [Louise Edmondson Rushin] taught me about, "Don't be afraid. Think about it, son. If you're right, fear will go away once you get involved with it." And that--in both these cases, that kicked in. I mean, with the program director and also with the manager at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay. So as you said--as we said earlier, you were promoted to general--
Speaker 2: Program director (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Program director in '75 [1975], and in '80 [1980], you were promoted to general manager of the station, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. The same guy that, you know, we finally let him go, and the lady in charge, the vice president offered me his job, and I was telling you about my mother's wisdom. But I was very happy being the PD, the program director, and had my afternoon show, doing all right. Had little girls chasing me and stuff, you know, I was hitting up the nightclubs and stuff. I was, I was (unclear). I'm cool, you know. I had it--
Speaker 1: So at thirty-two years old--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Nineteen--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there you go.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So I'm still young, and, you know, so the lady asked--offered me the job. I said, "Well, you know, I don't want to do that." But said, "Do me a favor, get me a black person to be the manager." I, you know, I mean, 'cause there's not that many, only like two or three in the company at the time. I say--yeah, she said, "Well, Jerry, I'll try. Just don't--." I said, "Oh, just do the best you can." So I went by my mom's house that night, and I was telling mama what happened, you know, she knows. She knew some stuff that had been going on. So I said, "So they let him go," and I said, "and the old lady offered me the job, Ms. Wiggly [ph.] offered me the job." And she said, "Yeah?" I said, "But, you know, mama, I don't want to do that. I don't to be no manager and wear that suit and tie." 'Cause he did the sales and clients and stuff. I really didn't. I just dealt with the audience, which was, you know, regular dressing, whatever. So she's talk- you know, she thought about it for a moment, and she said to me, "But, baby," she says, "let me get this right. But this guy, isn't he the guy that, that does these terrible things to the young ladies and, and the guys down there?" I say, "Well, yeah." She said, "But, okay. But if you don't take the job, what if they hire another A-hole or another jerk? You're in the same boat working for a jerk." She says, "Maybe you should take the job to guarantee, first of all, that you're treated fairly, and the rest of your coworkers are treated fairly." I said, "Damn it, mama, there you go again making sense." So the next morning, I asked the lady, I got in, "Hey, did you find somebody for the job?" She said, "No, baby." I said, "You know, if you want, I'll take it." And only because of that conversation I had with my mother, you know. I didn't think about all that, you know, but it made sense after she'd said it to me.
Story_ID: 657810
Speaker 1: One of the things you did that was tremendous, was that you got the WEDR [WEDR Radio, Miami, Florida] signal increased from 16,000 watts to 100,000 watts.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: This had to make a big difference.
Speaker 2: Yeah, man, because at the time with sixteen thousand watts, that was a major problem, not enough, enough wattage, but the other problem was, my tower was right outside the building in Liberty City [Miami, Florida] in the, in the hood, and it could only go 165 feet. So what you want in an FM frequency, is a--the taller the tower, the wider the frequency spends out, so, obviously, I needed more wattage from sixteen to one hundred, and I need to go from 165 feet 'cause that's, you know, a 100,000 watts would go right into the ground if it's that low, so I--it took me a few years to, to get it done. Everybody told me no. And just, God so happened, I run into a guy that I know, engineer, told him my problem, and he said instantly, "Oh, well, we can do that. Just have to figure out a way to do it." But, remember, remember, everybody, everybody else said, looked at it and, "Nah, we can't do it because of other frequencies being in the way. If you go up, you're going to interfere with this person and that person." But this guy, Rick [ph.], said, "Hey, yeah, we just figure out a way to do it." In less than four months I had a construction permit, and this was 1990, April of 1990, and once I got that tower and that signal, and the tower went up from 165 feet to 1026 feet, we were probably--that's--we were number one for all of the '90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: Yeah. You reached number one in 1992.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Right on through to 2001 maybe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, and, you know, but, yeah.
Speaker 1: This is the number one station in Miami [Florida], Fort Lauderdale [Florida] market, you know, that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, thirty some stations, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Is the Arbitron [Nielsen Audio]--
Speaker 2: Arbitron rating, yeah.
Speaker 1: --rating at number one? So, so, so what were you-- what was on the radio in those days, and how did you keep it number one, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, I think that, you know, you, you gave everybody what they wanted. It's like a good menu, and you just got something there for the kids, you know, but you got a vegetable. You look at menus now, it's the same thing. For the person on a diet, we got the this or the that. And for you vegetarians, we got a assortment of these foods, so that's how the station was. So everybody--you'd just shop there. You shop with me and listen to me, and you're going to be satisfied. If not this song, the next song. If not this feature, the next feature. 'Cause you did mix shows. You did blues shows. We, at this point, our hip hop had, you know, had came on the scene, so you had to find a way to work that in, but you could not destroy your traditional R and B at that time because, you know, all--I needed all these people ears, you know, and it was, it was tough. But as time went on, you know, we'd kind of deviated from that 'cause I got involved with another station [WHQT Radio, Coral Gables, Florida], with the company's two stations, and they didn't want them to clash, so I had to really separate them and program philosophies. One became pretty much all hip hop. The other became pretty much adult R and B, you know, in this building, so we had to switch it up then.
Speaker 1: So, okay, so I know before the, the signal was boosted, the station--was the station going through a difficult time before the signal was boosted?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I, I had a period about eight months where I actually didn't take a salary for myself, but, you know, I made sure everybody else got paid. But, you know, I knew once I did the signal. In other words, it's like having a great voice, and with no signal it's like singing in the shower. I knew that once I could get somebody else to hear me sing, which was the signal that I needed, I'd be okay. So when I finally got that signal in April, just (makes sound) I was gone. It was on and popping.
Story_ID: 657811
Speaker 1: Did you ever try to buy WERD [sic.]?
Speaker 2: WRBD [WRBD Radio; WWNN Radio, Pompano Beach, Florida] or EDR [WEDR Radio, Miami, Florida]?
Speaker 1: EDR, rather, ERD, or D- DR.
Speaker 2: You know, I thought about it early on, but I didn't pull the trigger, but I, I knew then that it wasn't a good time to sell because I thought I could build the station to a lot more than it was. I mean, without giving exact numbers, I don't know. It was like maybe 4 or $5 million at one point in the '70s [1970s], '80s [1980s], you know, but then when we did finally sell in the late '90s [1990s], it was well over $60 million. I guess I could have tried to get the 5 million back in the early '70s [1970s], or '70s [1970s] rather, but that would have been very difficult for me at the time so I didn't buy EDR, didn't try to buy EDR itself, but--
Speaker 1: Now, now, you did buy--in 1990, you bought WRBD (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) RBD.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. That's the station in my hometown, Fort Lauderdale [Florida], the one I was raised with. Yeah. Me and one of my friends, and what I did, I got the owners of EDR [Cox Media Group] to be my partner also 'cause, y'all, obviously, don't want me working for another station while they--I'm still on that payroll, and they were paying me rather well then, so--but, if they became my partner, then I'm still working for them at both stations, so that's how I pulled that one off (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. I wondered how that would work.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So they were part owners also--
Speaker 2: Yeah, man. Yeah, man.
Speaker 1: --in WRBD. Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause, once again, it's a AM station, and the revenue potential is nothing compared to FM, so I wouldn't--you know, I, you know, I wasn't about to just abandon my career for a little AM station in Fort Lauderdale.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay. Okay. So 1990 also is when WEDR changed its slogan from Starforce 99 to 99 Jamz.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so is this the advent of hip hop or what?
Speaker 2: Well, no. Hip hop was, was around--well, LL Cool J was in it, which is, you know, soft hip hop is what I called it. You know, but later on it became--you know, and I think Luke Skyywalker [Luther Campbell] was still around, you know, the 2 Live Crew.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: You know, that's what they want to be. But, but as we found out later on what Luke was saying, it was not that bad compared to some stuff I'm seeing in some hip hop songs in recent years, but, yeah, it was--hip hop had been around for just a minute. And I, yeah, I wanted to start fresh, so I had a new audience come in. Remember when I was low powered, I was restricted to an audience only in, I guess, southern Miami [Florida], Liberty City area, you know, nothing in Fort Lauderdale or Hollywood [Florida] where we are now. But once I got a new audience because of my strength and my tower, I said, well, you know what? I'm brand new to these people, so let me just create a new product, so we changed from Starforce 99 to 99 Jamz, and, you know, and, and the word jams is to me, it's an action word. You know, in basketball, "Well, did you see that jam?" "Oh, you hear that band? They were jamming." "Oh, look at my man on the dance floor. He jamming." So jamming to me means action, so that's why I, I went with that, that phrase, jams, you know. To a lot of people, you know, it's whatever you want it to be, but that was my thinking.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. Okay. So the--so you played a variety of music from R and B to rap to reggae to, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, reggae was strong; especially, here in South Florida. These guys had great songs coming out of Jamaica and what have you.
Speaker 1: Okay. And with the--I guess the proximity to the Caribbean, does that make--you know--does that make reggae a stronger--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that--
Speaker 1: --music here?
Speaker 2: --give it a little bit more weight in, in the South Florida area 'cause you got a lot of Jamaicans that, that, you know, that relocated here in this area, you know, a lot of them, so it's a bigger audience here, you know.
Speaker 1: I know in the early '90s [1990s], too, there's a great influx of--influx of Haitians in the Florida--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) area, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah. They--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --they were coming over, you know. But I think that what happened with the Haitian community, they were trying really hard to assimilate to be a part of what's happening politically, socially, you know, and they--I don't know--I don't want to--how to, how this sound, but with the Jamaicans, they were--you know, well, they've always spoken their form of English, so that was not a big barrier as it was for a lot of Haitians who were speaking French Creole so it was a lot easier for a Jamaican audience, you know what I'm saying, to, to bring what they were accustomed to with them because it wasn't that far from what we were doing. You know, I mean, had this Jamaican, this reggae beats and stuff, but, it's, "Hey, mon. I love you, mon," instead of man, a mon, whatever, but it was, it was the thing. You know, it's a lot easier for them, so with the Haitian music there wasn't that much even being produced to even try to get exposure, you know. In fact, they were so--I think trying so very hard to just get themselves out of the Haiti thing, not that they don't care about Haiti, but into what English and America is all about.

Speaker 1: Well, I don't want to skip over all the '90s [1990s], I guess, but--that fast, but who were some of your on air personalities, I guess, that made this--
Speaker 2: In--
Speaker 1: --this station [WEDR Radio, Miami, Florida] a big success (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) in the '90s [1990s]?
Speaker 1: In the '90s [1990s], yeah, when it--when you were number one.
Speaker 2: Oh, man. Oh, gosh. There was a guy we called--name was Jimmy Griffin [Jimmy Griffin, Jr.]. They called him Jimmy G. Here's a guy that came to town--he was at the station when I came to in the, in the early '70s [1970s]. He came to town as a singer with the Otis Redding show. And he's one of those kind of free spirit guys that just loved Miami [Florida], so he decided, hey, I'm going to stay here, and I'm going to become a disc jockey. You know, he had a--you know, he could sing. He had a gift for gab. And he got his self on the--he talked his self into getting on the radio before I even got here, so Jimmy Griffin, Jimmy G was one of them. One guy is still with me today, James T [Jimmy Thomas]. He--he's on Hot 105 now, WHQT [WHQT Radio, Coral Gables, Florida]. He's doing middays as we speak. I think I was starting to work part time then on air because my other duties were starting to take over, consume my time. And we had a guy named Leo in stereo, Leo Jackson. Hey, we could do that then. (Laughter) That, that was about it.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So who was the most popular person, you think, on, on air in those days?
Speaker 2: Jock wise?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, in the beginning, Jimmy G, undoubtedly, was, was the most popular jock when I got here, and probably was for a lot of years, a few years, and I, I, you know, I came pretty strong in the, in the late '70s [1970s] because I was highly opinionated, you know what I'm saying, great music and somewhat controversial without crossing the line. You know, I was--I just think you had to have a purpose beyond just music, you know, you had to feed something there, something, some kind of nutrient had to come out of my show every day, you know, some, something had to happen beyond me just talking trash and playing music, so--and I think that's what people liked about my personality was that, you know, I really did care. When I had--I even held demonstrations on behalf of the Haitian community. I went down the courthouse steps, you know, but they were being treated differently from the Hispanics coming in.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And, again, it wasn't right, so some--you know, back to my roots again. Somebody gotta stand up and say, "Hey, this ain't right."
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Same as pushing the little kid down with somebody. You can't push him down. So we, you know, and we followed and we struggled, and, finally, we got some, you know, things got better for them, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I believe if I recall correctly, they were quarantining the Haitians, and if you came here from Cuba, if you were Cuban boat per- person, you were welcomed into a community.
Speaker 2: Yeah. They was talking double talk. One is a political refugee. The other one was an economic refugee. I says, you know what? Cuba just as poor as Haiti. Everybody looking for a better quality of life. Pol- politics is all right if you're living a good life. Trust me. It happens all the time. A lot of people say in this country here, your politics suck, but I'm living a good life. You know, and these people are suffering in, in Cuba. Yeah. Let them come. But, you know, they're suffering in Haiti, and you can't--I don't know--you can't eat, man. Let them--you let one come, let them all come, you know, so this was my whole thing, and, and then so they made some adjustments, you know, INS [U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service] did make some, some adjustments, and it got better. I mean, it's not like it should be, but it's a lot better than it was back in the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So--and we got involved. I--just not myself, but, like I say, I was in charge of the station at the time, so I got the station muscle behind it. You know, we were able to do some things as far as public service announcements, demonstrations, get out the vote campaigns, you know, because I realized that if people realize you can vote them in office or vote them out of the office, they will attend to your needs. You have to vote whether you vote for someone or not. This is the basic stuff that we've been doing. Al Sharpton [HistoryMaker Reverend Al Sharpton] being doing it for years, you know, I, I met Al through James Brown, speaking of Al, but it's the same thing. It ain't changed. It ain't changed one bit.
Story_ID: 657813
Speaker 1: I guess from the eight- probably before from the--I know from the '80s [1980s] through the '90s [1990s], there, there are quite a few urban rebellions and riots in the Miami [Florida] area beginning in the, 19--
Speaker 2: The '80 [1980] riots (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) eighty [1980] with the big one--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the big one was 1980, I guess, but, but there were other riots in Liberty City [Miami, Florida] (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We had one, 1980 was when Arthur McDuffie--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --my--a friend of mine got beaten to death by the police. Then we had a kid--
Speaker 1: So you, you knew Arthur McDuffie.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. I knew him well. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was such a crazy thing. Arthur got beat, beaten in December, and they had the trial in May, and they had a change of venue, and, of course, everybody was found innocent, so--
Speaker 1: What happened? Tell, just tell, tell us from what you remember (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, Arthur had came to one of my clubs one Saturday night, I think it was, and he was hanging out, but at some point, he got on his motorcycle, and what happened, I guess a cop wanted to stop him for a ticket or speeding. I don't know the details why they were chasing him, but at some point, you know, I think he crashed his motorcycle, and the chase ended right there, or he--and he just--I guess he's excited because of the adrenaline rush from chase--from the chase. And I know that happens when you chasing your kid about, "Don't you run from me, boy." Same thing, you get--so--and they just beat him, and then at some point, he passed away from the blows, you know, and when everybody was let go and the trial over in Tampa [Florida], it was on a Saturday, and I know some people called me up and said--you know, my jock [disc jockey]. Said, "Say J [HistoryMaker Jerry Rushin], we're getting a lot of calls about this trial."
Speaker 1: So, so he was tried in Tampa, which is four--
Speaker 2: Change of venue (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) hours away from here, yeah.
Speaker 2: So he said, "Well, you're getting a lot of calls, man." I said, "Well, you know, just, you know, just tell them we'll get, get into Monday." It's Saturday, but, you know, so I tried to like down play it. Then the jock called back, and said, "Man J, I'm telling you, man. The phones are going crazy." I said, "All right." So, whatever, whatever, so. Then he called me back said, "J, people is outside the building, man. They asking for you." I say, "Okay. I'll be right there." So I drive to the, to the station [WEDR Radio, Miami, Florida], man, 'cause we in the, we in the hood now, in the city. We're in the inner city. Sure enough, I couldn't get to the station for these cars. I'm--I know I was outspoken, but, I never thought about that kind of stuff, you know, like the people really gravitated to the stuff I would do, the things I would say, whatever. But I finally got to the little building there, and, and they just wanted to talk, so I stood outside and we talked and we talked, and then I went on the air, and I talked, and put one or two people on the air. Again, again let, let a couple of them vent. You know, they were upset, obviously. So what happened that night, they had what they called a silent protest at the government building [Metro Justice Building; Richard E. Gerstein Justice Building, Miami, Florida], and a couple police cars got turned over, and it was on for the next few days, and I think maybe twenty-two people [sic. eighteen] got killed, and it was--so, you know, and then some people actually said that the--that I started the riots, and at some point you got to realize, this man is dead and finding these people innocent. Nobody is being punish for it. That's what started the riots. And there had been some other incidents. That wasn't the only one. Nathaniel LaFleur, they broke into his house. Police thought that they had the wrong address, cracked his skull. Young kid was relieving himself outside a warehouse building in Hialeah [Florida], you know, they shot him down. A kid named Donald [ph.] was in his car drunk. They said they thought he had a gun. They shot and killed--all this led up to the ones in this riot, so this is a lot of--so that--now, see all these things and nobody should be punished [sic.]. So remember one of the things the police was saying commonly was, "Well, he made a sudden move." So we came up with this thing we called the sudden move syndrome, so I actually had to go in there and go step by step what to do if you're stopped by the police. You know, you put both hands outside the car. You don't reach for your wallet or your license or your insurance. You put both hands outside the car so he can see them. That way he know you don't have a gun or you're not reaching for a gun. I had some other steps in that whole thing, but--'cause it, it got crazy, and all the cop has to do is say, "Well, you know, he made a sudden move, and I thought he had a gun." "Oh, it was his watch flashing. Or I saw the flash. I thought it was a weapon." And if you say that, nothing happens. And it had to stop. You know, again, that same thing from my childhood kick in. Somebody got to stand up to these people. No, you're not going to fight. You know, you can't fight the police or the, or the government, you know, but somebody gotta make the process change. So, hell, it was--I was--just happened to be there. Again, it was like on my watch so to speak, so and that's how, how that whole thing pretty much went down in 1980, the riots of 1980.
Story_ID: 657814
Speaker 1: And then they shot a kid in, in Liberty City [Miami, Florida]. They had the Super Bowl [Super Bowl XXIII] coming in. Two--no--two guys on a motorcycle, a guy named Clement [Clement Lloyd] and another fella [Allan Blanchard]. Cop [William Lozano] just (makes sound) stepped out in the street and shot both of them, and he said, of course, he was about to be ran over by the motorcycle. I said, "Man, just stay behind the car. Why would you stand in front of any moving vehicle? You Clint Eastwood? Just stand behind your car. Your car is there three feet to your left. Get behind your car. You're safe." You know, but, nothing. So that, that was one, and there was another kid [Nevell Johnson, Jr.] got shot in the game arcade in the, in the inner city [Overtown, Miami, Florida], and the police officer said his gun had a hair trigger, and it--he was just holding him at bay, and it went off and shot him in the back of the head. So, you see, but if you were in radio, in black radio, at that time, you know, I had, you know, the authority or the autonomy or whatever you want to call it, you know, to express myself and then express, you know, on behalf of my people. Let my people express themselves, and when I say my people, I mean the black community, my listeners. So I wasn't going to let that opportunity not be used. I mean, you know, let's talk about it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Were, were there incidents of white people being shot like that with hair triggers and--
Speaker 1: No, no, no.
Speaker 2: --with other--you know.
Speaker 1: No, no. (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I mean, because of--
Speaker 1: No, it's--you know, so when I look back, man, and that's thirty something years ago now, but when I look back at this thing in Missouri; Ferguson, Missouri, and other places, I just kind of see this dream, have this nightmare like but, you know, in my history it's the same thing, you know. Is it better? You know, to be honest, I would say, yeah. But it's--well, god, we got--it's not that much that we can relax. We still got--it's still happening, so I--and I don't know. I did a--like I say, I used to do editorials and, and it just seemed that very seldom if ever, that black cops get nervous and shoot people 'cause they make sudden moves.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, as--I mean, as--so I said in one, one of my commentaries, well, is that--is the black cop a better cop? Does he have better nerves? I mean, I'm just looking at statistics here. They just don't do that. They don't accidentally shoot people, black or white. Or they don't--you know, so what is that, what is that about? What is it inside a black cop that's not inside a white cop that's killing these kids? Or vice versa, what's inside a white cop is not--I don't know. But it has to be something going on here that--after, you know, the first time, oh, accident, coincidence, or whatever, whatever. After about the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, time, there seem to be some kind of a madness going on here, you know, what is the method, you know? So it's, it's frustrating, you know, and then I'm not, not because of that, but I'm glad I'm not working now because I'd really be frustrated 'cause I really want to see me do more as a broadcaster, you know, so I'm going to do a meeting later on when I finish here. And one of the local newspaper want me to start doing editorial stuff. I may just so that these issues is addressed, you know, 'cause a lot of people just talk around that, you know, but now I, I don't have to, I don't have to worried about getting fired. I don't have to worry about the FCC [Federal Communications Commission]. You know, I can say, I can say the truth. Not that I say--become irresponsible, but I hate it when you don't say the truth. Here's for instance. The truth is in every job mistakes are made on--by people on the job. Doctors do it and sometime people die. Somebody probably made a mistake with Joan Rivers. I believe that. That procedure shouldn't have killed her whatever she was doing there, and the list go--I may, you know, and sometimes cop- but you know what? It's as simple as he made a mistake, and somebody got to get up and just say that. Hey, we were wrong. It shouldn't have happened. But each time I see something really bad happen and the police, benevolent, or whatever they are, union stand up, too, oh, no. It was a good shooting. The cop that was beating the lady on the ground, the state trooper.
Speaker 2: In California.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't--there's nothing wrong. You're gotta tell me that's according to procedure? And--I just want to see a good cop for once stand up and say, and call out a bad cop. I would feel better. Just to hear a cop say, "You know what, he's my brother and all. We both wear the blue code of honor," whatever that crap is, but I want somebody to say, "but, well, my partner, my man messed up this time." Say that, "You know, it was a man--he's a good guy, but he probably got a little nervous, a little frayed." And I've been in some of them hot spots, in them clubs and them streets. You can get nervous. And if you got a gun, and you, you know, I--it can happen, but, but just say that. Don't say like it's by the book. You know, when they stop and they look for the four black guys waving a gun in a tan car that stopped the lady with four kids in it, in a burgundy car, and the police got--chief come out and say, "Well, no, based upon the call, since they was looking for a gun." I said, "But they were looking for four black males, not a woman and three little babies." And the little boy, at that time, "Mom, are we going to jail?" They tell, "Put your hands behind--," and the cop said it was according to procedure. Just say, hey, they made a mistake. They shouldn't have--you know, the car looking for is tan. Her car is burgundy. They looking for four men. They got a big black woman and her little babies. And nothing was wrong with that. Everybody was going like, "No, no, that was according to procedure." You see, that's just wrong. And it's not because I'm black or what--it's just wrong. Because if some black dude doing it to some white kids. Man, you just wrong. (Laughter) You know, "Hey, bro, you shouldn't have done that." You can't be--you know, but they just will not stand up. They just protect each other until it becomes like--it's very frustrating, you know, it's just--
Story_ID: 657815
Speaker 1: Did you have basically any kind of, you know, formal relationship with the black newspapers in those days?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Or The Miami Times or the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Herald [Miami Herald], okay.
Speaker 2: You know, in fact, I didn't bring it, but I've got like--what you call it? Book--scrapbooks, just articles from all, all the newspapers on the station and even the riots, and even the, you know, sudden move syndrome stuff, you know, I got, they did a--frankly, I didn't even know her until a couple years ago. She, she gave me three scrapbooks with all these articles, and I said, "Wow." She said, "Yeah, I just started keeping it, and just every time something come up, I just put it in this book," but--
Speaker 1: Well, I had to ask 'cause--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) this, this is a major future of what's going on in Miami [Florida]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, days, and, and now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: Even today. So tell me about--I'm going switch a little bit and tell me about WHQT [WHQT Radio, Coral Gables, Florida], the purchase of WHQT. Did you buy--purchase that (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, no. Actually, what happened, Cox Radio [Cox Media Group] owned WHQT, and they bought WEDR [WEDR Radio, Miami, Florida].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And we had been competitors, you know, in, in the black format, the urban format for years, so when they bought HQT, they now--I mean, when they bought EDR, they--now they owned the--owned both urban stations, and they, shortly after that, asked me would I be the manager of HQT also in addition to my duties as a manager of WEDR, so I was managing both of the urban stations at the time.
Speaker 1: What was the difference in the format of the two stations?
Speaker 2: Well, EDR was a lot more hip hop and stuff. HQT was a variety of hits and oldies. You'll hear Luther Vandross, Isley Brothers [The Isley Brothers], on and on, [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson, Quiet Storm, you know. On EDR, you heard, you know, "The mix at eight at night," and you heard Lil Jon and Lil Wayne and DJ Khaled, so it was pretty much it. One was adult--urban adult for black adults and one for the younger black adult.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Supposedly, but everybody loves hip hop music, white, black, especially young people, you know. And somebody like myself, and I'm sixty-seven years old, and I like--you know, I love Ludacris, you know. I love some of that stuff, man. I loved Tupac [Tupac Shakur] back in the day, you know, so that was the main thing, so we just wanted to make sure that the stations didn't, say, cannibalize each other so we just separate them even more. We just took pretty much all the R and B off EDR pretty much, and it was just hip hop, and we just stuck with the hits and the oldies on, on WHQT. And both of them in their format, Hot, was number one, HQT was number one, 25-54 [year olds]. EDR was number two, 25-54. But EDR was number one, 18 to 34, which was its target demo, so both stations were number one in their, in their targets.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was, it was a beautiful thing for me, man. We rode that like that (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, so in terms of advertising revenue and selling ads, would--did that produ- I guess you'd have to--you have two different markets, right? You have to--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --or did it make any difference?
Speaker 2: It, it makes a difference because, you know, what happens is, there's always been a consensus that, that people between the ages of twenty-five and fifty-four--first of all, they--job stability, getting married, buying houses, needing to get furniture for those houses, yada, yada, yada, yada yada, so it's called the money demo. All right. And then you have eighteen to thirty-four, of course, which is younger end, but I think the buying power in that one has gotten--in the, in the younger end, eighteen to thirty-four has gotten stronger because, for whatever reason, now these guys are making more money at a younger age. It--you know, what I'm saying? Instead of waiting 'til they're forty-five, they, you know, they got them twenty-eight and thirty now doing, doing really good. I guess more of them are getting educations and better job opportunities, you know, for, for many of them, those that qualify, so everybody wanted to be number one in 25-54, but in my case, one of our stations I ran was number one, and the other one was number two, so that was very good for me, so I got a chance to dip in that money pool twice with a number one and two station. And the one station was number one, eighteen to forty-nine, eighteen to thirty-four, so we dipped in that station, so, financially, it was a good position, as far as selling the station.
Story_ID: 657816
Speaker 1: And what would g- would you consider the highlights of your career in radio?
Speaker 2: Oh, man. The highlights of my career. You know, I think buying RBD [WRBD Radio; WWNN Radio, Pompano Beach, Florida]. You know, to listen to a station as a kid, and at some point in your life, relatively still young, you, you kind of like--you own it. You wanted to own it. I mean, that's like, I don't know. It's--that was cool. I mean, it wasn't, you know--
Speaker 1: Well, was Luther Holland still on?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, he's--no, no, he's not. (Laughter). In fact, I'm not sure if Mr. Holland is still with us, but, but I think that would be one 'cause it's a good business move; especially, for a kid--guy that had no college training and what have you, just really scuffle and work and get to that point that I could actually be part owner in a, in a facility. And I guess the other stuff, man, would be just, just the, the--and I realize, as an--not an afterthought, but after analyzing that I've had a chance to really get involved and help so many people, you know, through my broadcasting career. I mean, from an organization perspective, to individual basis and, and scholarships, and, and during times of trouble from Hurricane Andrew. I mean, I had to fight like hell to get FP and L [Florida Power and Light Company] to turn lights on in all the black neighborhoods. I mean, I had to get trucks of ice in, you know. I raised over two hundred thousand dollars with the station in this building for that last hurricane [Hurricane Katrina] we had in '07 [sic. 2005], or whenever that was. I mean, just sent to New Orleans [Louisiana] and, you know, when they had that mess there, just convoys of people, you know, and, so all that is satisfying. That goes back to being a doctor where you also get a chance to heal and you get paid well, so I was given a chance to help people while I worked, and, and that made it a special job when you can work and also help other people while you're working. You're not just putting in bricks or digging holes or whatever. You're, you're helping people live a better life, and you happen to be getting paid for it. That's--I think that's kind of unique to me (laughter). So I, I guess that's about it, man, just the ability that I've had to help some people over the years, you know. You know, I'd like to think that at some point, you know, I did cool. I did well.
Story_ID: 657817
Speaker 1: I know the last--well, the last highly publicized social issue here was the Trayvon Martin case which was national in scope. I'm sure the station [WEDR Radio, Miami, Florida] played a role in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, obviously, with Trayvon's being from here [Miami Gardens, Florida], it was in our--with our history of disturbances. It was on people's mind, but I knew better, you know, I, I knew there wouldn't be any kind of riot or anything, but we were prepared just in case, you know, but I, real honesty, I was 98 percent sure. But, again, from a broadcast per- perspective, you have to be involved. You have to, you know, be in--you know, inform people. And then you must be informed so you can, in return, you know, inform the--your listeners as to what's going on because people were speculating all kinds of stuff. You know, everybody is--and now with these 'CSI' shows on television, everybody had it figured out. Well, you know, 'cause (laughter) still, so--but I just--what happened is, I think we're tired when it comes to like a riot. I don't think there's that element of young person now that wanna go out and throw bricks and bottles. You know, I just--I don't feel that same energy. I felt it all in the past, but now, I just--I never felt that with, with Trayvon's case, but, you know, we had to--again, people want to express themselves, and is that too much pressure, you know, balloon or any object, and you can just manage it, just loosen the cap and let a little bit of air out of it so that it don't burst, and that's how you try to use the station. As I said earlier, just let people express themselves so they feel better, you know, just take some of the air out of it. Just reduce that pressure so you don't have an explosion, so--and that's, that's pretty much what we did with Trayvon in that, in that case, yes. I remember that Saturday night when the verdict came out, I was here along with some other people from the community. I had some congressmen, some senators on the phone and in the studio, some lawyers, you know, 'cause--but, it was cool. Unfortunately, you know, these guys don't stand a chance because they've been colored and marked before anything happened. They're going to always be the liar, always be wrong, you know. I've done things that were--in my life, nothing--you know, heinous like murder and stuff, you know, but I could have easily had a record, you know, 'cause some of the craziness I, I may have done as a kid, but if something happened to me today as a young man, to go back and find that I stole mangos or watermelons from the farmer's market and--'cause now, it's like, "You see, he's not a good kid. He--look at this. He stole watermelon." Oh, who didn't steal mangos? Jesus, you know, but, but this is--these are the, these are the eight ball. This is the eight ball that, that the young black men are behind. (Cough) And I think, you know, we should do something as a broadcasters, as a broadcaster. Well, I've made a lot of money off of our listening audience, and I owe them, you know, personally. I think the company [Cox Media Group] has made a lot of money, a lot of broadcast companies off of the black audience, and you owe them something, and the same thing with any other audience.
Story_ID: 657818
Speaker 1: You retired, basically, in 2012, or, or retired with quotation marks around it, at least, in 2012 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, this month, it would be two years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: And what, what brought it on? You just felt you were sixty-five, you should--
Speaker 2: You know--
Speaker 1: --retire or--
Speaker 2: --that was that number I always said. You know, back in the old days, well, you know at sixty-five, you got to retire. It was stated time and time again over the years, and lo and behold, it seem- always seemed so far off, you didn't think about it. Then you look up, you're sixty-two. You're sixty-three. And you go, wow. And, you know what? And the business was changing, and I was becoming a little bit--I don't know, not, not frustrated, I guess. But the industry is changing, you know, so I was--that's a good time for me to take my bow and make my exit, you know, I--so it was good, you know, the right age, and, you know, I don't want to--you know, and like I tell people, you know, if you, you, you know, if you're too old to, to work, you're probably too old to play, so I wanted to retire while I could still play. You know what I'm saying? Instead of just working 'til I'm seventy, seventy-two, and then, you know, 'cause it's hard, man. (Laughter) Yeah. But I just think--and forty years was a good round number, sound good, forty years, you know, not thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-three, you know, thirty-five, but forty years, you know, so. It was--that's all it was, and, and it's good, and, you know, I mean, you, you gotta know when you're ahead of the game, and you, you gotta know when to--you know, you got a good woman. You gotta know she's good and you, you keep her. You gotta know you made a good decision and stay with it, so getting out at sixty-five, I, I think it was a great decision, you know. And that's about it. Wasn't no pressure or anything, but, you know, just sound good at the time and still do.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you're, you're still a part owner of the station, the station--
Speaker 2: No, I sold (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, did--
Speaker 2: --oh, I sold that.
Speaker 1: Oh, did, did you sell it? Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I sold that, yeah. It was a good business move. (Laughter) Yeah. You know, sold that one some years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, when we sold EDR [WEDR Radio, Miami, Florida], (background noise) I sold that station to a separate company, you know, because, again, if the company that was buying EDR didn't buy that station, they wanted me to be with the company that was buying us, and they, they wouldn't have been having me still working for another station competing against them, you know, with the money they were paying me at the time, which makes sense. And, you know what? I know AM was on its way out. I probably could have kept it and make a buck [dollar], but, you know, so it was a good deal. It would--you know, it was all right.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A good business move.

Speaker 1: Now you're a member of the National Black Programmers Coalition.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have been for years. Yes, sir (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm. And any other organizations in the broadcast industry?
Speaker 2: You know, not, not really as official members. You know, I, I've always found it more effective for me to support because most members have rules. To be a member, you can't--you know, but if you just support it, I could do what I want to do financially or say what I want to say. I can criticize if I didn't like the direction of the organization. As a member, you can't--you got to temper that stuff, so I'm not too quick on joining anything.
Story_ID: 657820
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there anything major that you would have done differently if you could go back and change it or do it again?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, I think I miss--I would like to experience the college thing, but, then again, I may have missed out on the [U.S.] Army and Vietnam. I, I don't know. But, you know, but I--'cause I sent my kids to college. I have friends of mine talk about college, and it, it sound like a fun period, you know, you know, but, that, that's about it, you know, just maybe I should have tried that, but I don't regret not going per se because, you know, I've done well, so--but, you know, that's about it. Not too much.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. Now, I guess, once again, if you look back at everything you've done to this point--and, now, you're still doing things, right? You're still--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --involved in--
Speaker 2: Yeah. I still--
Speaker 1: You're, you're thinking about writing a column now and you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. I do a lot of stuff online and on, on Facebook, rather. You can easily just, [HistoryMaker] Jerry Rushin on Facebook, you can pull up a lot of that nonsense I do. A lot of it is political stuff. Some of it's very serious. Some of it's satire. Some of it is just nonsense, but, but, you know, that's, that's me. And so--and, in fact, these--a lot of people read it on Facebook, and they say, "Man, you know, you just put this--just do us an editorial." You know, then it sounds like work. I probably wouldn't enjoy that, but, but, yeah, I'm, I'm gonna meet with them. You know, I know the people, and, I'll see, you know, but--you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Anyhow. I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do, do you still draw?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. I got a little sketchpad at the house that I've had for years, you know, and then I just put dates at the stuff, and I, I think this pad goes like, like 1992. You know, I've had some others, but I just didn't keep up with them over the years, but this one, the last one I kept up with, you know. And, as you know, that drawing thing is so--I don't know how, but as a little something, if I saw it, I could reproduce it. I just--it's just amazing to me. I just say, okay. This line got line got a line going up. I just, just see it and do it, you know, it's--and I'd always thought, I don't see why more people can't 'cause it, it looks so easy to me (laughter) just reproduce what you see. Go left, go right. You just go up like that, and that's how you know--but, yeah, I see anyhow. I've often thought about taking up painting, you know, just to see if I can transfer my ability with charcoal or pencil to a canvas with, with oil, you know, or either watercolor, water painting. You know, I don't know. I think that may be a bit more difficult. They used to have guy come on, this guy [Bob Ross], had this Afro, yeah, he used to be like--
Speaker 1: He's from Florida, too, isn't he? I think he is (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, I think so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And I've watched that show ['The Joy of Painting'] on Saturdays.
Speaker 1: I know his name, and I can't think of it.
Speaker 2: Yeah. He be like--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --"Yeah, you just need to put some leaves and the sun is setting. Let's put some birds over here. There you go. Now, I need to get this shadow from the setting sun over here." And it was like (laughter), yeah, so you had to go in there for a minute. My wife would come in and say, "Why you watching this stupid painting show again?" "It's not stupid. Look at what this guy is doing right in front of your eyes. It's great." (Laughter) You know, it's crazy, man, but, hey.
Story_ID: 657821
Speaker 1: Do you have any big project in mind to complete si- now since you're retired, or (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, the one thing I might take on, and I, you know, if I'm going to do it, I probably should jump on it. I just think that older people, old folk just ain't getting treated right, you know. I'll make sure I, you know, get some money together and get with some people I know and try to do some things for the elderly. I just think we get forgotten that. You know, you can't vote. I think you--you know, you can't vote anymore, so we don't need you for that. And you don't, you don't work. We don't need you to help, you know, da, da, da, yeah, yeah. And all the laws to me like favor younger people or rich people or something, but I--if it's just like Dolphin [Miami Dolphins] season starting, if it's just an organization that would take an old--an elderly person to a ball game, you know, I got some friends down at the Dolphins, and if y'all can just, just give us some seats and give us access or whatever, or some Marlins [Miami Marlins] game, you know, it's--you know, and I work in conjunction with some existing, you know, organizations. I'll just help try to get them some more funding and, and, and get them some more resources and just help them. Go buy and read a book or watch a game on TV with them. I think that's nice. You know, pick up a couple piece of a chicken and soft drink, and let's go out and watch a Dolphin game, you know, 'cause you get lonely. Old people to me, their kids are busy raising their kids, so their kids not really, you know, doing--you know, but, hey, that's the way, the way it goes, so that might be the next thing, you know. Like I say, I probably should get on that right away if I'm going to do it. Yeah. And I'm getting older now, so I can, I can--and I kind of feel--I'm on the phone a lot people like my Humana [Humana Inc.]. I mean, people just--you know, after you retire, and they honestly talk to me like I'm stupid or senile, and it's, "So, how are we today, Mr. Rushin [HistoryMaker Jerry Rushin]? Did we take our--?" I said, "How old is your daughter, ma'am?" (Laughter) I, I give her--and it's so crazy. I say, I'm just retired. I'm not dead. You know, I'm, I'm not stupid. I'm not--whatever. I don't have Alzheimer's, you know, some do, some don't. So--but treat us like we're--like young people, all them ain't brilliant. All young folks are not smart. All young folks don't work. A lot of young people got more issues than older people, but they treat us really, really bad, man, really bad; especially, on the phone, you know, but, you know, so I don't know. I just feel--I don't know. Somebody need to do something for the elderly. I mean, really do something. You know, and I think on a local basis I can do something. I don't know. I can't set government policy for the country, but I think I can physically go to a house and, and visit some old people or pick up one and take them for a ride to the Dolphin game or to a picnic. That I can--I'll say I can do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's what--get some people to--you know, get a little movement going.
Story_ID: 657822
Speaker 1: Once again, if you look back at everything you've done to this point in, in your career, you know, through retirement, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I don't know. Just that I touched a lot of things and people, and most of them are better after I touched them. You know, I, I put a glow on them. You know, I've seen guys who were, guys who were lost and now got families and going to church, and they--we talk about it, and they say, "Man, remember?" "Yeah, I remember." There's so much of that, I mean, in a forty year period, so many. One guy is a preacher here in Hollywood [Florida]. Man, he calls me all the time. "Man, if not for you, I'd have, I'd have still been out there, Mr. Rushin [HistoryMaker Jerry Rushin]." But you remember that day? I remember the day. And there's just so much of that, you know, not counting organizations and stuff, but--and that's just it. It's touched a lot of people and hope that there's a glow there after I touched them, you know. That's, that's about it.
Story_ID: 657823
Speaker 1: Tell us about your family. Now, you're, you're married. You--do you have children?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I'm divorced. I got kids and--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and grandkids. I got three--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --daughters, five grandkids, four granddaughters and one grandson, and took them all on a cruise with their spouses and everybody last December for, for Christmas. We went on a three day cruise, twelve of them, thirteen of them. We had a ball. So I--you know--I enjoy that kind of stuff now. I got a Mayweather [Floyd Mayweather] fight this weekend, so I got a game night coming up at the house, and I'm going to get the girls and their significant others if they want to come, and the grandkids, we're going to play some games and watch the Mayweather fight, so--and that's stuff I never did. You know, I took good care of my kids, but I didn't give them a lot of fatherly time. I mean, I was never missing or absent, but I, I think I could have been--my presence could have been even more, but I was never married to their mothers for any length of time. That was part of the problem, but, but we kept great relationships. We talk--we text every, day. We group text. Sometimes it's jokes and it's BS. My daughter right now, one is in Rome [Italy]. She says she's ready to fly back to New York [New York] today. They're at the airport in Rome, the baby girl, so they're very--and they're thicker than thieves. They're very, very close to each other, so all is well there, you know, and that takes up some of my time, too, but it's all good.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's all good.
Story_ID: 657824
Speaker 1: Is there anything I haven't asked you that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, man. I--hey, man, it's simple. It's an open and closed book to me, man. I might write a book, by the way, but I might do a book.
Speaker 1: Yeah. You probably could--
Speaker 2: I think. Yeah.
Speaker 1: --could put together a good one.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, wow, the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different. Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Just, just you know, just a, just a good guy that, that tried to make a difference or either made a difference, either one, tried. I'll take effort. But you know, just a good guy that made a difference, man, it's--that's all you can do in the end is, what did you--what's different because of you? That's what that boils down to. Well, my kids went to college. I didn't go. They say that's different. You know, what I'm saying? But this happened, you know. I got one granddaughter that's a tennis champion, you know, fifteen year old (background noise) whiz on the tennis court. I mean, but you push. You know, you--I mean, she want that. You buy the racket. You buy the sneakers 'cause they wear out sneakers every other day, you know, so you spend the money and the time, you know, you know, it's--just make a difference, family and friends and community. That's it, man, a good guy that made a difference.
Speaker 1: Okay. Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
