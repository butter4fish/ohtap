Speaker 1: Okay.  So tell me about your mother.
Speaker 2: Oh, wow.  Well, you know, I can start smiling when I think about my mother.  She is actually the one who inspires me to do quite a bit, actually the things that I'm doing now. Over the years, of developing products for the last twenty years.  And she was the one that has encouraged me.  She is the one that--she is the backbone.  She is the one that tells you that you can do it, don't quit, and keep going.  And she actually developed me on the spiritual side, too.  And so, she is really the backbone of our family.  She holds us together, and she is the one that actually--when we get ready to have our Thanksgiving dinner, she has all that together.  And you know, she's the one that everyone looks forward to.  Everyone looks forward to Thanksgiving, and certain things, times of the year.  You know, she is the one that encourages the family, encourages the grandchildren, encourages my children.  And so, she is the one that a lot of us look forward to talking to when we're having trouble or what have you, or getting down or what have you.
Speaker 1: Where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born right here in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she share any stories about her growing up in Atlanta?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, do you know about her background at all, growing up?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Just what her background was here in Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Basically, I know that she was a hard worker, and trying to take care of three kids by herself, my two brothers [Michun Anderson and Darrell Anderson].  She worked three jobs.  And we knew that, during that time, we knew that was something that was challenging for her.  And even at a young age, we knew that she was doing all this by herself.  And so, you know, it's, it was something to see her and to go out and do what she had to do.  But you know, she had the strength and the energy to move forward.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What type of work did she do?
Speaker 2: Back then, you know, she was working doing a lot of--I know she was working at Rich's Department Store [Atlanta, Georgia] in the early years.  And then she moved over to Mutual, Liberty Mutual [Liberty Mutual Group], which is an insurance company.
Story_ID: 402604
Speaker 1: So your mother [Linda Johnson] had, she worked for Liberty Mutual [Liberty Mutual Group].  So, you as a child growing up with your mother working outside of the home, tell me how that made you feel about your mother?  You talked about how you understood as a small child that she had to go to work, and so you were okay with that?  Is that right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Well, you know, here again, to see your mother have to work, and have to work three jobs like that--and during that time I guess I was around, I was about seven or eight years old.  And I can remember a time when we would actually ride the bus home.  We would actually ride the bus to school, but we would walk home, my brothers [Michun Anderson and Darrell Anderson] and I.  And we would walk home just to save enough money so that the bus fare she would give us--we actually wouldn't let her know that we were saving that money.  And we would save that money so that during the Christmas holidays and the Christmas season we could buy her a gift.  So that fifteen cents, that twenty-five cents that we were using to ride the bus, we would take it and we would walk home every day, to actually be able to purchase her something during the year.  Because we, you know, we just really knew that she had it hard.  And we wanted to come up with, you know, during that time of the year with a gift.  And I can remember those days walking home every day, my brothers and I, and trying to save some money to buy her a Christmas gift.  And during that time, you know, we lived in the projects.  And actually, we didn't know it.  You know, it's amazing when you're living in the projects, but you don't know you're living in the projects.  And I can remember living in Englewood [Englewood Manor], that's in Atlanta [Georgia].  And you know, eventually we were able to find out years later that that was actually the projects.  But, you know, we actually didn't lack anything.  You know, there are some things we didn't have--the nice, the nicest, you know, the finest of certain clothes and things of that nature.  But you know, my mother did everything that she could, and we didn't lack anything.  But it's amazing to know that we were actually in the projects, but we didn't know we were in the projects.  (Laughter) And you know, when you look back on those days and how hard my mother had to work, it's amazing, you know.  She had to have been a strong person to go through that.  And here again, you know, she was working two other jobs on the side.  And those other two jobs, I never really knew.  But I knew she worked at Rich's [Rich's Department Store, Atlanta, Georgia] and she worked at another store.  And she would work three jobs, and still would come home and cook and maintain the household and prepare us for the next day for school, you know.  And we, one of the things we would definitely have, we had, I mean we had the most exciting Christmas.  I mean it's amazing.  Our Christmastime was just unbelievable.  I mean we actually had everything.  Stuff was just laid out all on the sofa.  And you know, it was just amazing during that time.  And when I look back on it, that's why Christmas really is my favorite time of the year, when I look at some of the things my mother actually did during that time, and she did it by herself.
Story_ID: 402605
Speaker 1: Being a single parent, was she [Anderson's mother, Linda Johnson] a strict disciplinarian?
Speaker 2: Well, she--yeah.  She was, you know, she had her, she had her levels of how she managed her household.  She wasn't strict, strict, but she definitely had her way, her level of how she managed her household.  I can remember a time when I was at the house.  And we always joke about this.  And I was there with a lot of idle time.  And she had just bought--and here we are still living in Englewood [Englewood Manor, Atlanta, Georgia]--and she bought these fancy curtains and wall to wall drapes back during that time.  And I was just there with some idle time.  And for some reason, the curtains ended up in my mouth.  And I began to chew and chew, and eventually I actually chewed a--bit a whole through the curtains, and I tried to hide it.  And she came home that day, and you could see the light coming through the hole.  (Laughter) And so, that day she was really upset.  And we talk about that and we laugh about that a lot.  But for some reason to this day I can't understand why I bit that hole in the curtain.  I was just, just gnawing and nibbling on the curtain, and all of a sudden a hole came in it.  And you know, she--here again, I still don't remember getting a spanking during that time, you know.  But at the same time, she had a way of looking at us, me and my two brothers [Michun Anderson and Darrell Anderson], and she could just look at us.  And we knew when we went to certain places and out to eat, or other people's homes, she could just look.  And that told the story right there, you know.  So, basically she just had her own natural way of how she managed her household.
Story_ID: 402606
Speaker 1: You said that she [Anderson's mother, Linda Johnson] set the foundation for your spiritual life. How so (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, right, you know, back then, you know, we was attending a church called The Move of God [The Move of God Church, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia].  And she became a Christian, I think through the witness of her sister.  And from there to this day, it was something that she set the foundation for us understanding God and putting the fear of God--understanding that this is something--she wanted to set the tone, so this way it would pass on to us so we would begin to live a Christ-like, or righteous type life.  And so, she set the foundation for that.  And even today, by me being a born-again Christian, you know, I look back on my mother and the things that she was able to exemplify and show in my life and her life, and it actually passed right on into my life.
Story_ID: 402607
Speaker 1: Your mother [Linda Johnson] had how many s- siblings?
Speaker 2: I have two older brothers [Michun Anderson and Darrell Anderson] and one younger sister [Kimberly Anderson Finley].
Speaker 1: Okay, you do.  But you, your mother (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I'm sorry, my mother?
Speaker 1: Your mother, that's all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she actually has three other sisters.  And one actually died early.  And her oldest sister's name is Diane Williams [ph.].  And the middle one is--next to the youngest is Gloria Harper [ph.], and the one that actually died is Tanya [ph.].  And then we have one in between there, her name is Donna [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  How, if you had to use just a couple of words, how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: A couple of words?
Speaker 1: Or maybe even just one word.  What would you say when you thought about your mother?
Speaker 2: Loving and strong.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Loving and strong.  I mean she is, she is the one who, she's going to state her mind.  She's gonna, she's not going to hold back her feelings or her tongue on what she wants to say.  But at the same time, she is, she's very strong and very loving.  And when I look back on it, those are the things that, those two words; I would say strong and loving.  Strong and loving.
Story_ID: 402608
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your dad.  Tell me your father's name.
Speaker 2: His name is Bennie Anderson.  And it's spelled B-E-N-N-I-E.  The last name is Anderson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when was he born?
Speaker 2: If I could look back on it, I think it's 1947, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in a small town, a little town in Georgia.
Speaker 1: What is the name of it?
Speaker 2: I think it's West Point [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Oh, West Point, okay.  And what can you tell me about your father?
Speaker 2: During the early years, my father was not really that much in our lives in the early years, especially during the days when we were living in Atlanta [Georgia]. We were living in Englewood [Englewood Manor, Atlanta, Georgia], we were living in the projects, but we didn't know we were in the projects.  You know, so here again, you know, he came by on certain occasions.  He made the birthdays, or he did his best to try to make the birthdays.  He made the holidays.  But basically he was, he's an entertainer, and he actually sings with a group called the original Drifters.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And so that's something that he was doing all the way from my small childhood all the way up to, actually to this day, to now.  That's what he does.  He's an entertainer, he sings with the original Drifters.
Speaker 1: So, your mother [Linda Johnson] and father separated when you were babies?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  We were very, very young when they separated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, you know, there's not much, a lot of memory there.  But it's Christmas, those times, when he could make it.  And you know, birthdays when he could make it, and those special times when he probably came by and visited, what have you.  But basically, you know, he was on the road a lot, he did a lot of traveling.  And so actually we didn't see him much.  And that's why there's a lot of vague memory on that side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 402609
Speaker 1: All right.  Now tell me about your siblings.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I have two older brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what are their names?
Speaker 2: His name is--my oldest brother, his name is Michun Anderson.  And the middle, his name is Darrell Anderson.  And my sister's name is Kimberly [Kimberly Anderson Finley]--
Speaker 1: She's the youngest one (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Finley now, so she's just been married about a year ago.
Speaker 1: She's younger than you?
Speaker 2: Yes, she's younger than I am.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're a middle--in the middle kind of.
Speaker 2: My older brother, he is a, he's a radiologist, and he studied that for a few years.  And Darrell, he is actually, he owns his own limousine service along with my stepfather [Herman Johnson].  And actually he, he's been in that business for about twenty-five years.  And my sister, here again, she just got married, and she's pregnant today.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know, that's--you know, my middle brother, he is, he's an entrepreneur like myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he is, he's not--what amazes me about Darrell is that he is, he has, he has no college training or no special trade.  But he's a very smart guy.  He has a very, his background is--I mean he could handle any business guy.  And he built a million dollar business.  And I think that really amazes me about him, you know.  I think he's done well for himself.  And just to see a person who has no college training, who has no trade at all, go from the ground up and build his company.  And here again, my oldest brother, he is, he did his training at Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia], and he is, here again, he's a radiologist and he's doing well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Kimberly, you said she got married, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Kimberly got married last year.
Speaker 1: But what does--does she go to school or--?
Speaker 2: Yes, she went to, she actually got a degree in, I think it's in English.  She's an English major.  And what was the name of the school that she went to?  It's on the tip of my tongue, but it, it'll come to me as we go ahead (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 402610
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned that your brother [Darrell Anderson] is in business with your stepfather.  Who is your stepfather?
Speaker 2: My stepfather name is Herman Johnson.
Speaker 1: When did your mother [Linda Johnson] remarry?
Speaker 2: She remarried in the early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She married Herman Johnson.
Speaker 1: So you grew up with him as a part of your life?
Speaker 2: Yes, Herman is, basically he is the actual, the father figure that I've known basically all of my childhood years.  And I can remember the first time that I saw him.  My mother and I was in a small grocery store and he came in, a tall guy.  And I said, "Mama, you can marry that man."  And (laughter) she, you know, we talk about that, we laugh about that story all the time.  But Herman is, he's, he loves to fish, he's a professional fisherman.  And he's definitely I would say the guy who has been behind me throughout the years of all my projects and all the business.  And he actually, here again, he's a partner with, a co-owner with Darrell in the--a national limousine business.  And actually, Herman, we go all the back to, back in Atlanta [Georgia].  He was around during that time in Englewood [Englewood Manor, Atlanta, Georgia], in the early years living in the projects.  And so, he is the one that would come by.  He is the one who would take us out to eat all the time.  And you know, during that time, we would go to McDonald's.  We would go to McDonald's on the weekend, and we would think that was just unbelievable, you know, to go to McDonald's every week; ten dollars every week.  And so when we look back on that, Herman is the one who--he is also the foundation of our family.  And he is the one who helped put a lot of time into the family, a lot of money into the family, a lot of his own personal money into the family.  And so he is, he is the one that always holds his head up.  And he's, he's, he's also, he's a strong one also.
Speaker 1: What educational level did your mother go to?
Speaker 2: Well, I know she finished high school, but she doesn't have any college training or any kind of trade.  I know she specialized, at that time she was eventually specializing in insurance.
Speaker 1: With?
Speaker 2: With Liberty Mutual [Liberty Mutual Group].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Herman?
Speaker 2: Herman, yes, he actually studied about four years of college education.  And I can't remember exactly what school he went to, where he did his college training.  But yes, he has about, he has four years of college training.
Story_ID: 402611
Speaker 1: So, we talked about your siblings.  So, let's talk about you and your growing up years.  Can you think of what might be your first childhood memory, something that you think about when you think about your childhood?
Speaker 2: In the real young days, in the early, early years?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: When I look back on it--here again--especially every time I think about Englewood [Englewood Manor, Atlanta, Georgia]--we always--you know, I think about how fabulous our Christmas was, I go back to that.  And that--you know, for a child to remember certain things, you know, you want to remember--you're going to remember if it was great.  I remember my Christmas, and we had just an outstanding time.  I mean we would get up at--it's amazing how my kids actually don't get up that early.  But we would actually get up during those days about 3:30 or 4:00 in the morning, just to open up the gifts and to get ready to go outside.  And you know, we had some great times, you know, living there, and we were really close to a lot of people that were living in that area.  And we stayed outside and we played quite a bit.  I mean, we just stayed outside.  And we had a great time.  And you know, you know, looking back it was just--during those days we just--you know, looking at the holidays we just had a great, we just had a great time.
Story_ID: 402612
Speaker 1: What were some of the things that you did on Christmas besides, besides receiving, you know, toys and gifts?  What are some of the sounds and smells that you remember as a child?
Speaker 2: Well, well we moved over to, off of Freda Court [Decatur, Georgia], that's where my mother [Linda Johnson] lives today.  And I think I was around the seventh grade.  And during those ye- during that time, my mother would always cook a lot of pound cakes.  She did a lot of cooking at night.  And so, I remember her preparing and doing a lot of pound cakes.  I mean, we were just--and another thing, too, we would always try to find where my mother would hide the gifts.  To this day, we do- I don't know.  We could never find where she would hide--we would look all--I mean we would look in the attic.  We would break the house down trying to find out where she would hide the gifts, and we couldn't.  But here again, you know, we would always have big dinners, and have a lot of the family over for Christmas, and especially during the Thanksgiving years.  During that time we would always have, and to this day, we always have several people over, and the family over.  Everybody knows that, you know, they come to my mom's house for Thanksgiving.  And you know, it's, we just had a great time during, during that time.
Story_ID: 402613
Speaker 1: Tell me about Englewood [Englewood Manor, Atlanta, Georgia], where you grew up.  Wher- where is it located?
Speaker 2: Englewood is in Atlanta [Georgia].  I can't, I can't remember--and it's actually still there.  And I can't remember exactly the street name, but it's still there.  And here again, we lived in the projects, but we didn't know we was in the projects.  It's amazing that back during those days, the projects didn't look like the projects.  And I think that was, that was healthy for everybody; (laughter) it was healthy for everybody.  (Laughter) But I can remember we used to have a guy that was c- would come through the neighborhood on a bus, on an old used school bus, and his name was Pop.  And he would come through there selling all types of candy and potato chips.  I mean, we wou- couldn't wait to go back out there.  And every day he'd come, and we'd go on the bus and get what we needed to get and buy it, and what have you.  And he would come through there.  And also you had the ice cream guy, ding, ding, bringing the ice cream truck.  And so it was just a, it was a different type of environment during those days.  But we had a great time.  And it's amazing, most of my immediate--not really immediate--but some of the cousins and my grandmothers, all of us lived in the same area.  My [maternal] grandmother [Mable Avery] lived in Englewood; my mother's [Linda Johnson] sisters lived in Englewood.  And we always would go to, you know, to different people's--my different relatives' houses if we wanted to eat there, spend the night.  So we all stayed in the same area, and we had a great time.  And--
Speaker 1: Who were the other people that lived in that area?  Were all the people black, or was there any other races or nationalities that lived there?
Speaker 2: Well, we had all black.  You might have had one, one or two people that might have been white.  And they was there and they kind of stuck out like a--they was a little different, but they was there.  And we played with them, and we all had a great time.
Speaker 1: And, but you did have your--there were times when things broke out (background noise) that was pretty dangerous (background noise).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, speed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, Englewood--
Speaker 1: You said things broke out.  What do you mean by that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah you know, there were times--you know, I don't want to paint a perfect picture about the projects.  But I can remember when I was very young there was one lady that lived actually next door to us.  And for no reason at all, they were arguing over some clothing that was hanging on the line.  You know, but during those times, you know, quite naturally you didn't have a washer and dryer.  You didn't have those types of appliances, and you would hang your stuff on the line outside.  And so, these two women began to argue, and I saw the whole thing.  And I had to go and talk to the police and what have you.  One stabbed the other one, and the other one stabbed each other, and things began to break out.  And so, you did have those, you know, times when things got out of hand.  But one thing I can remember that I thought was quite--I think is quite unusual--and that is we didn't have any drugs.  You know, it's amazing when you think about it today, and I look back on it then.  You know, we didn't have any--well, I didn't see any--and we didn't hear about it.  We didn't have any kind of drug selling or anything like that going in the projects during those days.  And so I think that is, that's interesting within itself, that you just, we didn't have any drugs during those times.  But we had folks who got a little rowdy, folks who got a little out of hand.  But it was the projects, and we had a good time.  And I remember my first Cub Scout days during the projects.  And we went to--the elementary school that I attended during those days in Atlanta was D.H. Stanton [D.H. Stanton Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia].  And we would go there, I would go there.  And I had a Cub Scout teacher, and his name was, I can remember it was Mr. Phillips [ph.], but I can't--I think that was his name.  And he was, you know, he was really inspirational during that time.  And he was the one that introduced us to the Cub Scouts, and introduced us to a whole 'nother, a different environment, different things.  And even living in the projects during that time, it's funny that we went on our first vacation, first vacation ever.
Speaker 1: Where did you go?
Speaker 2: We went to Florida. Went to Pensacola, Florida.
Speaker 1: Was that with the Cub Scouts?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't with the Cub Scouts (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're talking about with your family?
Speaker 2: Yeah, with my family.
Story_ID: 402614
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The people that lived in Englewood [Englewood Manor, Atlanta, Georgia], of course, you had friends.  What did their parents do?  Did--were most of, did most of the people have jobs?  What type of jobs did they have?
Speaker 2: Most of the people were low-educated, not highly educated people.  But you know, they normal regular store jobs or what have you, nothing fancy at all, to what I can remember.  And I really didn't have too much of a memory on what their parents were doing and what have you, but everybody worked.  And one of the things I can remember most is you didn't have a, you really didn't have a--no father figure in the houses at all back then.  And so you really didn't have a--most of the families that was there, there was no dad, there was no father there.  So, it was unusual for us to have my stepfather [Herman Johnson] that was there.  And, but when  you look back on it, most of the guys that we played with and went out and played basketball and football and things of that nature--most of those guys, you know, it was just their moms.  Their moms were trying to make it, and trying to do what they had to do.
Story_ID: 402615
Speaker 1: What kind of games do you remember playing as a small kid in say elementary school, in the s- you know, in the playground there?
Speaker 2: Football.
Speaker 1: Football?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I played a lot of football and a lot of basketball.  I can remember one time playing football at D.H. Stanton [D.H. Stanton Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia], and we were playing on this concrete.  And I was going back and trying to catch the ball, and running and running and running.  Eventually I caught the ball, and I went down about five flights of steps.  And actually, my pinkie to this day is the evidence of that, and it's actually crooked.  And I got up, and actually the whole finger was leaning toward--the top, the tip of my finger was leaning toward the left here.  And so, you know, we played a lot of basketball.  And actually in the community we had those goals, but it's amazing when you look back on it, we never had nets on the goals.  You know, we were always playing on an empty rim.  So, you know, we actually, we had our times to play football in the streets.  And here again, going back to the Christmas days, I can remember when we got our first equipment.  All my brothers [Michun Anderson and Darrell Anderson] and I, we actually got the shoulder pads and helmets and jerseys.  And we went outside to play, and the stuff was so heavy we barely could move.  And so, you know, we definitely had our--and then the normal game, the most popular game that everybody played was hide-and-go seek.  And so, all of those things that you played around the projects area.  And you just, for some reason we stayed outside longer than my kids do today.  And so, we had to be called in.  And so, we had a great time.
Speaker 1: You didn't--some people describe the fact that they knew it was time to come in because either the streetlight came on, or dusk.  What was your signal when it was time to go in?  Or did you just wait until someone called you?
Speaker 2: There were times when my mother [Linda Johnson] would call, she would holler out.  And we just knew that there was a certain time of the day when it was time to come on back in.  Or quite naturally during those days, my [maternal] grandmother [Mable Avery] lived in the same community [Englewood Manor, Atlanta, Georgia], and my mother's sister lived in the same community.  And so, we would all stay--I'd either go over to my cousin's house or we'd be at my grandmother's house.  So, she had ways to get us.  And we just had a, you know, like again, here again, my kids know to come in when the streetlights come on.  But we just knew when it was time to come in, you know, when it was time to come it.  And plus, you know, I was the youngest, so I was following my older brothers at that time.
Story_ID: 402616
Speaker 1: You talked about your first family vacation to Florida.  Tell me about that.  What do you remember about that?
Speaker 2: First time ever, first time on a vacation.  And that was something that Herman [Herman Johnson], my stepfather, he actually had won some money; I think about five hundred dollars if I can remember.  And he took a portion of that money and took all of us and my cousins, took the whole family on a vacation.  We all went to Florida, and we drove down to Pensacola [Florida].  And we had a great time.  I mean we was on the beach, and we was grilling hamburgers and hotdogs, and we swimmed almost every day.  And I think, when I look back on it, one of the generous things I think that Herman did was that he did not, he didn't think about just us.  He took my cousins and everybody on a vacation, and we all had a great time.  I mean that was, it's amazing.  I've been on several vacations since then, but you know, that was--that still sticks to your mind to this day.  And it wasn't nothing fancy or fabulous or what have you.  But that was, I thought it was, it was a great time.  All of us was together, and we were able to go out, and eat out, and fish, and do all that stuff.  And that's one of the things that--growing up during my early childhood, we did a lot of fishing.
Speaker 1: Who taught you how to fish?
Speaker 2: Herman.  And we would go to Pensacola and we would fish off the bridge, and he would show you how to do it.  And actually, we would sleep on the bridge.  So we never--actually, when my mother [Linda Johnson] and all of us would go on vacation, she would stay in the hotel, but we would stay on the bridge.  And we would fish, and sleep, and sardines, and back then I think even some potted meat.  (Laughter) But you know, we had a great time, and we'd spend a couple of days on the bridge.  And I think the worst thing about being on that bridge was having to go and use the bathroom.  My God, it was horrible, but we had a great time.
Speaker 1: Did you set up tents or sleep in sleeping bags?  Or--
Speaker 2: We'd sleep in the car.
Speaker 1: Oh, in the car.
Speaker 2: We slept in the car.  And I'll never forget one time when I caught this big marlin.  And it was amazing for a fish to come in that close to the bridge.  And the fish was jumping out of the water, and my actual reel was bent all the way down.  And we were beginning to bring him out of the water, bring him out, bring him out, and pop, he broke the line.  And so I remember that was--and to this day that's one of my favorite pastimes, is to fish.  And quite naturally, he, he turned his passion into a profession.  That's what he does professionally now.  So, he actually fishes on the side in various different tournaments and things of that nature.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Where did you learn to swim?  Was there a community center, or a Boys and Girls Club [Boys and Girls Clubs of America], or--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I learned to swim when we actually went on vacation to Pensacola, Florida.  And we was out there in the ocean, well, in the actual, maybe three or four feet of water.  And Herman was showing me to let go, and eventually I let go and began to swim.  And eventually I began to put my head underwater, and eventually I began to swim on top of the water and dive.  So, actually, I learned how to swim in Pensacola with--on that particular vacation that day.
Speaker 1: How old were you then, about?
Speaker 2: I think I was between s- about s- between s- eight and nine.
Speaker 1: Eight and nine, okay,
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 402617
Speaker 1: You said that you went to D.H. Stanton Elementary School [Atlanta, Georgia], and that's where you were introduced to the Cub Scouts.  Is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the, who was your--
Speaker 2: The Cub Scouts was great times.  And actually my youngest son [Christian Anderson] now, he is in the Cub Scouts.  And that was the first time we was able to be introduced to something that was more organized.  You had a group of other guys that was there, and everyone was trying to win certain awards.  We would go camping.  And I can remember one time we went camping, and it just rained.  It rained and rained, and water was just floating in the tents.  And it was cold, but we had a great time.  And I think the Cub Scouts is a great experience, it's a great experience.  And we, I can remember to this day that we actually had to learn how to climb this tree, going up the rope trying to climb to get to the top of the tree to see who was going to win this medal.  And we was, I was going up the rope, going up there, and eventually I got up there.  And they lied to us, because they wanted us to really go at it with all, with everything we had.  And I began to climb and pull up and pull up and pull up.  And I got to the top, and nothing was there.  But that was something they'd normally do to get your energy level up and get you all hyped up.  And so, we had a great time.  One of my best friend's, his name was Philip Jelks [ph.], and we were just like together all the time.  And so, the Cub Scouts was great.  I think it's great for a lot of young guys to get into.  I had a great time being in the Cub Scouts (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you move up the ranks?
Speaker 2: No, I never did go through the level of Webelos [Webelos Scout] and Boy Scouts, and--but in the early years, I stayed in the Cub Scouts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I never did go up, and begin to advance in different levels.
Story_ID: 402618
Speaker 1: Who were some of your, your teachers in elementary school that you can remember, or had an influence in your life, if any?
Speaker 2: We had one teacher, and you actually--you wouldn't believe his name.  You could not believe his name.  His name was Mr. Tuff [ph.].  And Mr. Tuff actually played, he played college football.  And he had an opportunity to play professional football.  But I don't know what really happened on that end.  But Mr. Tuff was a seventh grade teacher and he was, when I say he was tough, he lived up to his name.  If you got out of hand back then, you'd have to stand up with one leg in the air.  Or, he'd have you hopping around the classroom.  But he was a very, very tough teacher.  But he actually was, he was the one that you learned a lot in his class.  And today he's a minister, he's a pastor.  I can't think of the name of his church, but he is the pastor to this day.  And I had one teacher, I think it was about the fifth grade.  The only thing I can remember about Miss Leach [ph.], she would, she would come into the classrooms and make sure everything was together.  And if the classroom got out of hand, she would walk out.  And if she was walking down the hall or whatever, she would come back.  She never did come in the classroom.  All she did was pop, she would pop three fingers altogether, and make a sound that was unbelievable.  And that was Miss Leach.  Yes, I remember her.
Speaker 1: The teachers at your school, were they black or white?
Speaker 2: All black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, we didn't--I don't recall any, any white teachers at D.H. Stanton Elementary School [Atlanta, Georgia].
Story_ID: 402619
Speaker 1: What type of student were you?
Speaker 2: You know, we, I wanted to do good, you know what I mean.  I was a, I was an A, B student.  And the reason why my brothers [Michun Anderson and Darrell Anderson] and I--we wanted to do good in school because we wanted to please our, we wanted to please my mother [Linda Johnson].  And here again, we knew that, you know, she worked all the time.  And so we, we, you know, we just wanted to please her.  And so basically, I was an A, B student.  And most of my brothers, all of us were pretty good students in school.
Speaker 1: Did you do a lot of reading?
Speaker 2: I didn't do a lot of reading.  I only, pretty much--you know, I'm not a big reader.  But in the early years I would just read what was given to me to read.  So I wasn't a real big reader at all, not at all.  But basically we did--you know, in Cub Scouts you would read the little small pamphlets and different things.  And there were things that you had to read in school at grade level.  But just reading a lot of novels, novel after novel, I wasn't a real big, big, reader at all.
Speaker 1: What about television?
Speaker 2: Television, I watched okay--basically, you know, when we lived in Englewood [Englewood Manor, Atlanta, Georgia] we had maybe--if I can remember, one or two--I think maybe one, if that; we had one television.  And we played a lot.  We didn't, we weren't just in front of the television.  And so we wasn't, you know, quite naturally we didn't have those specialized games that you have today.  We were outside, and we rode the bikes, and football and basketball, things of that nature.
Speaker 1: So would you say you were--well, were you well-mannered, mischievous?  Did you and your brothers get into trouble?
Speaker 2: No, we were all well-mannered.  My middle brother, Darrell, was the one that everyone says was the one who was conniving and getting into stuff, sneaky and stuff like that.  But for the most part, all three of us, we were well-mannered.  I mean we would go to different places, and we'd just go in and sit down.  And we knew not to move around or jump around.  And here again, my mother had that stern look, or her way of how she managed certain things.  And she could just look at you, and, and you knew to get yourself in order, to get yourself in gear, you know.
Story_ID: 402620
Speaker 1: When you were in your elementary years, did you ever think about what you would want to be when you grew up?  What were your, did you have any dreams or aspirations at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, I think in the seventh grade, I--just like all boys, I wanted to play some type of professional football or basketball.  And I actually wanted to do basketball and football.  And I played basketball in the seventh grade for the school.  At that time the name of the school was Kelley Lake [Kelley Lake Elementary School, Decatur, Georgia].  And I played basketball there, and it was for a club called Mark Trail [ph.].  And there, you know, we was able to play and have a good time.  We played other s- other, other teams, and what have you.  And, but quite naturally at a young age like that,  you--everybody wants to be some type of professional basketball player or football player, or any- something like that.
Story_ID: 402621
Speaker 1: On Sundays, I'm sure since your mother [Linda Johnson] was the backbone of you- of your religious experience, tell me what it was like to go to church?  What church did you go to?
Speaker 2: We went to a church called The Move of God [The Move of God Church, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia].  And we had to go to church.  We had to go to church every Sunday.  And then we would go back some days in the evening.  And one of the things I can remember in that it was a very long service.  (Laughter) It was a very long service.  I mean we would be there, and I'm pretty sure church went about three hours solid.  And, but you know, we had a great time.  But it was just, I think the length of time was just, it was just too long.  And the pastor's name was Reverend Harris [Edward Harris], and his wife.  It was a high energy kind of church, it's a Holiness church.  So, a lot of things were restricted as far as what women could do and what they could wear to a certain degree; you had to dress a certain way.  But I think my mother always did what she wanted to do.  You know, she wasn't stereotyped in that particular box, or what have you.  But those, that was the actual beginning part of my spiritual life.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you have any experiences there?  You said it was the beginning part of your--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, during that time, you're a little child.  You're probably in the seventh or eighth grade, and you're really not taking nothing serious at all.  You're not serious about none of it.  You come in because your parents are making you go.  And then you might have one experience after another, where someone is casting out a demon out of somebody.  And then all of a sudden you're scared now.  And but, you know, during that time, you know, you was able to see a lot of people get saved and born again.  And you know, quite naturally you didn't pay that much attention to the pastor.  I can't sit here and say that I was all in it, that I was all, a spiritual guy coming up.  It wasn't anything like that.
Story_ID: 402622
Speaker 1: Okay, so, the junior high school you went to was, was Kelley Lake [Kelley Lake Elementary School, Decatur, Georgia], is that right?
Speaker 2: Well actually Kelley Lake was the elementary school.
Speaker 1: Oh, it was--
Speaker 2: D.H. Stanton [D.H. Stanton Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia] was the elementary school.  We just actually transferred--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when we moved out to the DeKalb County [Georgia] area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when did you make that move?  How old were you?
Speaker 2: I was in the sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Sixth grade?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And you moved from the projects?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we moved from Englewood [Englewood Manor, Atlanta, Georgia] to Eastwyck [Eastwyck Village, Decatur, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Eastwyck, okay.
Speaker 2: And Eastwyck, here again, that close-knit immediate family moved from Englewood to Eastwyck.  So, my [maternal] grandmother [Mable Avery] moved to Eastwyck; my cousins moved to Eastwyck.  So, in other words, both of my mother's sisters moved to Eastwyck.  And so, here again, we had that same scenario, where I was over to my cousin's house, or we was down to my aunt's house, or we was down to my grandmother's house.  And so, we all have been pretty much a real close-knit family, that particular group--my mother [Linda Johnson] and her sisters and my grandmother.
Speaker 1: And tell me where Eastwyck is located?
Speaker 2: Actually, Eastwyck is off Candler Road, and that's in Decatur, Georgia.
Speaker 1: So, we're talking about somewhere--you say you were about nine?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Eastwyck is, I was actually in the sixth grade.  When I moved, when we moved there, I was in the sixth grade.  And I think we ended up moving in the latter part of my seventh grade year.  So, we didn't stay that long.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we- we're probably somewhere around '77 [1977], 1977?  Is that right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 402623
Speaker 1: Where did you go to junior high school then?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, during that time we didn't really have a lot of middle schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, we went from elementary school right into high school.  And then high school was Columbia High [Columbia High School, Decatur, Georgia].  So the eighth grade and the ninth grade--your eighth grade year was actually high school.  And I actually attended Columbia High at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And who were your friends during this time, your high school years?
Speaker 2: Well, I had quite a few guys I played football with.  One in particular was Robert [ph.], and you know, we would all--Robert and Fred [ph.] and all of us, we would come, we'd all get together and play football after school.  And here again, that was in the eighth grade.  So when I actually got into Columbia High, to me it was like a shocker, because at that time it was amazing to see people smoking in a smoking section.  They had a smoking section in high school.  And so you had guys who was--actually had beards, and here you are in eighth grade.  So, it was a culture shock to a certain degree to come in.  And you had people driving and leaving campus.  And you're walking down the sidewalk there, and you look and you see a smoking section and you see all these people smoking.  And you just--you know, for me, I just pretty much put that in a position as an adult.  And to see students smoking in-between classes, I think that was a culture shock for me.  That was, that was to let you know you're in high school, I guess.  I don't know, you know.
Speaker 1: So are you a fan of middle school now--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that you experienced going--
Speaker 2: I think after--yes, I agree.  I think middle school is well needed.  I think it's something that--going to middle school, going to the eighth grade in high school, is, it's a little bit too fast.  And I think you still have some growing to do.  You have some development to take place; you still got some more developing to do.  So, I think that introducing a middle school program in all areas of the counties nowadays, I think it's great.
Speaker 1: You also said that when you lived in Englewood [Englewood Manor, Atlanta, Georgia], you didn't see any drugs.  What about at Eastwyck [Eastwyck Village, Decatur, Georgia] or in the high school?
Speaker 2: You know, that's amazing.  Even here, again, in Englewood, I didn't see any drugs.  And in Eastwyck, if I saw it, I didn't know what it was.  I didn't, we just didn't have that kind of coming up.  We didn't have the kind of things that you hear about today, all types of drugs and things of that nature.  I didn't have that in Eastwyck, and I didn't see it at all.  Quite naturally it was probably there, but we didn't, we didn't have that.  And here again, when we moved to Eastwyck it was, I mean it was like we were really moving up.  You know, they're townhouses, and here we are, now we have three or four bedrooms, maybe three bedrooms and a basement, a finished basement.  And so it was really like, wow, we have arrived.  And we had to switch schools.  And actually when I got to Columbia High, it was kind of, I had my first association with some white students.  So, that was the beginning of changing the environment some, you know.  So, you know, during Columbia and during that time, we--in my early years, I just didn't have a lot of experience with dealing with and seeing a lot of drugs and alcohol.  Even with some of the guys that we would drive off campus and go to different--to get something to eat, or leave and go to the mall.  You just didn't have that in the early years when I was coming up.
Story_ID: 402624
Speaker 1: You said that in high school, at Columbia High School [Decatur, Georgia], it was the first time you had some interaction with white students.  Did you have any experiences around that?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have any experiences, any communication with them.  But I think that was the first time--to come from D.H. Stanton [D.H. Stanton Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia], and to come from Kelley Lake [Kelley Lake Elementary School, Decatur, Georgia] and to go to high school, and now you have a small population of white students, it was like, oh, you know.  And it was, it was a little different just to see--different, you know, a different race, to go to school with a different race.  And I come to find out that we all are the same, you know, especially when I went from Columbia High over to Southwest DeKalb [Southwest DeKalb High School, Decatur, Georgia], and that's where I actually graduated from.  And that was a real shocker.  Because when I got there, you know, you were able to find out that, you know, that you had some smart black guys and smart black girls, and you had some dumb black guys who just didn't have it all.  And you had the same thing on the other side with the white groups.  And so, you was able to see that there was really not much--there wasn't that much of a difference.  It was just going to, to school every day, and being able to perhaps go to school with a different cul- with a different race.  I had never experienced that before.
Story_ID: 402625
Speaker 1: Did your parents talk to you about the civil rights?  Because you were a little younger than the Civil Rights Movement, but did your parents talk to you about Civil Rights Movement, or were they involved at all in the civil rights?
Speaker 2: No, we--we would ask them a lot about it, especially my [maternal] grandmother [Mable Avery].  And basically during that time they would say that, you know, they pretty much--if they had to sit here, they would sit there.  Or if they had to--you know, I think they did what they had to do to keep the peace.  And I think they weren't looking to be a hero, or anything of that nature.  And, but it's interesting that Herman [Herman Johnson], my stepfather, he would say that there were times that he would march.  He actually marched with Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And I don't know if he did some stuff with Hosea Williams or not.  But I know that he would say that a few marches that he participated in.  And so, you know, we would want to know why--you know, if Dr. King was here in Atlanta [Georgia] why didn't you guys go down and march with him?  And why didn't you, you know, have a heavier involvement, more of a heavy role in the whole King movement?  But I know Herman, actually during that time and to this day, he actually did a lot of painting.  Actually, he's done a lot of painting on Dr. King and the movement, and different things that he has felt as an artist that he needed to, to illustrate.
Story_ID: 402626
Speaker 1: Your family moved again, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: From Eastwyck [Eastwyck Village, Decatur, Georgia] to--
Speaker 2: We went from Eastwyck, and then once--I think in my seventh or eighth grade year we moved to Freda Court, and that's in Churchill Downs.
Speaker 1: And that's located where?
Speaker 2: That's in DeKalb County, Decatur, Georgia.
Speaker 1: And it's near which street?
Speaker 2: It's, it, it's south of Rainbow.
Speaker 1: Rainbow Drive?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, Rainbow Drive.  And it's funny, when we moved there--and that is actually the house my mother [Linda Johnson] is in to this day.  And when we first saw that house, we were like, my God.  We just knew--it looked like a mansion.  It's a beautiful house, even to this day, yeah.  So, it has a lot of space, and the set-up of the house is very nice.  And so, when we went from Eastwyck to our first home, to that particular home, it was actually, it was, that was a move.  That was, it had a look of a mansion.  We just actually knew that we were living--we were living pretty--we thought we were living large at that time (laughter).
Speaker 1: How many bedrooms did it have?
Speaker 2: It actually has five bedrooms.  It has five bedrooms, three baths, and it has two dens in it, one huge den, a sunroom, a living room and dining room, an all brick house, and it's a very nice house.  And that is the house, the home that we go to, here again, to share all of our Thanksgiving dinners and festives, even our Christmases and birthdays and things of that nature.  So, that's home.  That's home for us.  That's home for all my brothers [Michun Anderson and Darrell Anderson] and my sisters.  And I can remember my sister [Kimberly Anderson Finley] saying that she shou- we should never, my mother should never sell that house, because it should be home.  Even if she decides to leave and move to some other place, she shouldn't sell that house, because there's a lot of memories at that particular house, you know, growing up, my brothers and I, and all that stuff.
Speaker 1: What specifically do you remember about growing up in that house?  Because now you're in high school, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm in high school.  I'm actually in eighth or ninth grade.  And I actually finished at Southwest DeKalb [Southwest DeKalb High School, Decatur, Georgia].  I actually started from eighth grade, all the way up to the tenth grade at Columbia High [Columbia High School, Decatur, Georgia].  And then from there, I transferred and I went to Southwest DeKalb.  And some good memories, to this day, is all of our Thanksgivings.  I think that when you have all the family come over, everybody knows to come to my mom's house.  And my mother and [maternal] grandmother [Mable Avery] can cook very well.  You know, a lot of people say that.  You know, everybody wants to say that their mother can cook and their grandmother can cook, and things of that nature, but actually my mother--they can actually cook very well, I mean extremely well.  Matter of fact, I think they did some catering for Kirk Franklin down at the Fox [Fox Theatre, Atlanta, Georgia], and he requested them again.  But it's just too much work for them, so they kind of like backed off of that.  But you know, here again, we've had great birthdays there.  We have great--all our holidays has been fantastic at, at my mom's house.
Story_ID: 402627
Speaker 1: Even our dating, and during those times, and bringing the girls over and to meet the family, and my brother sneaking the girls in the house, and things of that nature.  I don't know if you want me to say all this, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: But you know, we, you know, when you're young and the early years--and the way that house was actually--the way it's set up to this day.  It has two levels, and so you have two ways you can enter the house [in Decatur, Georgia].  It's looking like it's two front doors, and so you can come in through the bottom level, and it's so large that no one would know that you actually have entered into the house.  And my brother would actually, you know, sneak out.  I'll never forget one time he actually--and this is kind of funny.  He wanted to sneak out the house and go to where he wanted to go.  And so late that night, he decided that he would sneak out the house.  And during that time he was playing football for Columbia High [Columbia High School, Decatur, Georgia], so he was in pretty good shape.  And he would take the car--he would push--take my mother's [Linda Johnson] car, actually stealing the car.  He'd take the car and he would push it all the way out of the driveway, push the whole car.  Because their bedroom was right over where the driveway was, so you could hear the car if it cranked up. So, he would push the car all the way to the end until he'd get to the street, and then he would crank it up and leave.  And one day he did that--so he was doing that over and over.  I think one day my mother looked out and didn't see the car.  And she came down and--my brother used to always keep his door locked to his room.  So they were able to open up the door, and he jumped in through, in through the window, and there he was, you know.  So he was sneaking in and out, and taking the car.  And you know, those things that you do in the early years, trying to--because you want to go out here, or you want to go back to this party, or see this girl, or what have you.  So, he would do those little things like that.  And I was so young at that time, and I just didn't have enough nerve to do some of that stuff.  But here again, you know, I did have--I'd bring the dates over to the house, you know.  And during that time, we had, you know, we can look back on it and say, wow, it was amazing how we was able to get through some of that stuff when we was doing our--when we was dating, and things of that nature.
Story_ID: 402628
Speaker 1: Were your parents [Linda Johnson and Anderson's stepfather, Herman Johnson] st- strict about you going out?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They was more so like if, you know, "At least tell me where you're going, you know.  At least let us know where you're going and what time you're going to come back."  But we did have a curfew, we did have to be in at a certain, basically at a certain time.  I mean, I can remember it was before eleven or twelve, or something like that.  We couldn't stay out all night or all day or all morning.  My mother wasn't going to have anything like that if we lived in her house.  And you know, so my mother just--here again, she instilled those type of values.  And even when it comes to working, to this day, I can remember one--you know, summer my brothers [Michun Anderson and Darrell Anderson] and I, we all thought we were just going to just relax and sit around the house and have a great time.  And my mother, this was during the summertime, and she said, "Well, I tell you what.  When I leave, everybody's gonna leave."  So that meant that all of us eventually ended up getting a job.  And that was the--I think that was the foundation of establishing good work ethics.  And we all went out and got a job, you know, because she said, "And you can't come back until I come back."  (Laughter) "So, you're not going to be here all day sitting around eating and relaxing and doing nothing."  And we had to pay her an allowance.  We had to pay her so much money a week, which was good.  I think that it's--especially for boys, young men.  It's establishing a good work ethic, a good understanding that these are some of the responsibilities that you've got to eventually start understanding what you're going to have to do when you get older in your own life.  And so, we had to pay.  We had to pay so much out of that check every week.  Every week, so much came out of that check.  And it's funny when you look back on it, but I think it, it helps.  It was something that was, that, here again, instills a good, instilled a good value in you when it comes to your working and trying to make it, and pushing, all the way leading up to entrepreneurship.

Speaker 1: So, Southwest DeKalb High School [Decatur, Georgia], at this point is there--what is some of, what are some of the influences at the school?  Are there teachers, counselors?  Are you thinking about college?  What's going on in your later high school years?
Speaker 2: Well, during that time I--when I was a senior in school, I pretty much knew what I wanted to do.  And letting people know that you want to be a hairstylist--you just didn't go around, you know, letting the guys know that you wanted to be a hair designer, and things of that nature.  It just didn't sound good, you know.  And so, I really didn't need a teacher to tell me what--you know, say, this particular teacher inspired me to do this, or that particular principal--because I knew what I really wanted to do.  And my [maternal] grandmother [Mable Avery] was, to a certain degree, she would do hair in the home and for the different people around the neighborhood.  And so, she would use the Marcel irons, and I watched her use the irons a little bit.  And, but for some reason I knew that--you know, going to see my mother [Linda Johnson] when she was able to get her hair done, and when I went--during that time I was getting my hair done.  And I just knew for some reason that's what I wanted to do.  I wanted to do something in that line, in the hair care business.  I wanted to do hair.  I had the knack for just doing hair, naturally.  And so I didn't have to, it didn't take a lot of training for me.  And so, as a senior in high school, I pretty much knew that's what I wanted to do.  I knew that's what I wanted to do, but I didn't share it with a lot of people, because it just didn't sound good, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: What do you mean it didn't sound good?  I mean, because it's a stereotype?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's very, it's stereotyped really bad, as far as most guys who do hair--that they're, that they're gay.  And it's, and when I went into--when I got into--we're not there yet.  But once I got into school for hair, it really was just the opposite.  It wasn't--you know, you have some of the guys that was in that, going that way.  But the bottom line was, you know, they were good people.  You know, they were, you know, I treated them nice.  And a couple of them, you know, I was great friends with.  I mean, I actually was great friends with them.  You know, they respected me as far as, you know, my position, and I respected them as their position, and we, we had a great time.
Story_ID: 402630
Speaker 1: You said you were doing hair, and you were getting your hair done.  Whose hair were you doing?  I mean how did you know you had the knack?
Speaker 2: Well, I would, you know, during that time I would go--and you know, curls were out, real popular then.
Speaker 1: Curls?
Speaker 2: Jheri curls.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, we would go to the salon and you would spend all day trying to get a Jheri curl, or whatever they put into your hair.
Speaker 1: Okay, w- let's talk about Jheri curls.  What type of process is that?
Speaker 2: A Jheri curl is, it's a double process, a chemical that allows a black person to have a curly textured look hair.  And you have to put a straightener on the hair.  And then from there, you have to break it down with a straightener, and from there you have to put it on rollers.  And from rollers, it has to be neutralized, and from there it allows you to have a curly textured hair.  And here a guy by the name of Willie Morrow invented the curl.  But it's amazing that he actually invented the curl.  But it was Jheri Redding--a lot of people might know him from Redding products.  Jheri Redding actually formulated it for--well, I'll take it back.  Jheri Redding actually developed the curl pattern, the active curl product itself.  But Willie Morrow mastered it, he made it work on black hair.  So Jheri Redding really was the one who laid the foundation for a black person to actually have a curly look, or curly hair from a chemical.  And then Willie Morrow mastered it and found out the different things that you might need to put on your hair to get it to where you need to get it, to make it stay curly.
Story_ID: 402631
Speaker 1: So, going into the salons and watching various people do hair, and watching one particular guy do hair. I can't think of, remember the name of the salon, but I would watch him, and I would say, "God, that looks pretty cool."  And he's--you know, I didn't want to go to school.  I really didn't want to go to school for four or five years, that wasn't in me.  And I wanted to go to something that, I wanted to do something that was quick, that I knew I could do within two years.  And for some reason, it just so happened that the Lord had blessed me with the natural knack to do hair.  And so, I didn't have to work as hard as the average person in the hair care business.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So after high school [Southwest DeKalb High School, Decatur, Georgia], you just decided to go to what school?
Speaker 1: Yeah, after high school, I went to Pivot Point [Pivot Point International].  And Pivot Point is, at that time--it don't exist.  It was in Buckhead [Atlanta, Georgia].  And that was where I got my training for cosmetology.  And basically, I was there for about two years.  And the name of the school was--by the name, a guy named Frank Arnold, and he actually, I learned a lot from him, from the owner of the school.  He was recognized nationally as an award winner, and the guy was, he was extremely good when it came to hair-cutting.  He was a white guy.  And so I really learned how to cut and color hair at Arnold's International [Arnold International School of Cosmetology, Atlanta, Georgia], and I won quite a few competitions there in the early years.  So, right then and there, that was where I got my foundation.  That's where I really began to get the understanding of the concept of hair, and learning.  And one of the things I wanted to do once I began to get into the hair care business, I wanted to learn how to do both black and white hair.  And I knew that was something that would set me apart from the average person, and I got very skilled at it.  You know, I was a black guy, but I could do white hair just as well as I could do black hair.  And Frank Arnold always said, "You need to come work out in this area here, because you can make a lot of money."  But I ended up working in the DeKalb County [Georgia] area.
Story_ID: 402632
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's just step back a second.  What year did you graduate from high school [Southwest DeKalb High School, Decatur, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: That was n- 1983.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Have him spell Jheri Redding, too, because it's an unusual spelling.
Speaker 2: Okay, 1983.  Yes, can you give us the spelling for Jheri Redding?
Speaker 1: Yes, it's actually J-E-R-R-Y, [sic.] Redding, R-E-D-D-I-N-G.
Speaker 2: And when you say Pivot Point [Pivot Point International]?
Speaker 1: Pivot Point is a, it was actually started in Chicago [Illinois] by Leo Passage.  And Pivot Point is like, it's the top, it's the top, it's the highest level you can go in education dealing with hair.  Leo Passage developed it back in the early 1960s with Vidal Sassoon.  And Leo Passage is a very skilled hair stylist.  And it's a science.  Pivot Point is a scientific approach to understanding hair care, understanding roller control, and placing rollers, and cutting hair.  Whenever you see--I can walk into any mall or walk into any salon and I can watch a hair stylist.  And I can tell if they know Pivot Point, because that's how they're cutting the hair, or that's how they're rolling the hair.  And it's a scientific approach of how we look at doing everything--the shapes of the hair, the shapes of the head, the shapes of the face, and how we cut the hair.  Everything is done off a point.  When we cut the hair, we cut off a point.  So, it's funny, we look at it.  And everyone who knows Pivot Point looks at it like a martial arts in the hair care business.  So, when you see someone cutting hair or styling hair, immediately I can say, she knows, or he knows Pivot Point.  And it's the highest you can go to in the hair care business.  It allows you to be very skillful in coloring and cutting hair, and somewhat roller control. very, very high-skilled in cutting hair.
Story_ID: 402633
Speaker 1: What did your family think about you wanting to be a hairstylist?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it was, like they say, it was all good for them, you know.  Because it was, in the early, during that time I was using them as guinea pigs.  And I was experimenting on my mother [Linda Johnson], and her sister, and anyone in the family that would let me do their hair.  And I started out very young.  I mean, immediately after high school [Southwest DeKalb High School, Decatur, Georgia], I went to Arnold's [Arnold International School of Cosmetology, Atlanta, Georgia].  And so I would say within a year of training--and I actually built my clientele, a good deal of my clientele, in school.  And that was the most unique thing about it, because when I left school I had a clientele.  I had somewhat of a ready-made clientele.  Some of the women followed me from school into the salon.  So, it was easy for me to build up my clientele very fast.  And so basically at nineteen or twenty years old, I was actually working at a salon called Daweed's Hair Designs [Lithonia, Georgia].  And that's when I really learned, with a guy named David Fields.  I began to learn how to--there's a different level of doing hair in school in relationship to doing hair and learning how to do hair to get paid.  So, even though I had the background and the foundation of cutting hair and coloring hair, but I was able to learn how to do hair from David Fields.  I was able to get those techniques that he had.  There were certain techniques that you needed to know that are salon techniques.  That's why a lot of people who come to the salon say, "I can never get my hair like the salon," or what have you.  Because there are certain techniques that we do to make the hair layered, to make the hair smooth and soft, and what have you.  And once I was able to watch him--and I was a quick learner, so I could watch one time.  I could watch you one time.  I can watch you cut any haircut, or style any style.  As a student, I was a shampooer for him at the time.  And I could watch you, whatever you was doing, I could watch.  And from there I would go back to school and duplicate the same exact hairstyle.  So, you know, I can remember going to David's salon and asking him to, I will work for you, but you don't have to pay me.  And my thing was, it wasn't the money.  Because I was working a regular job, so the money wasn't a major thing.  It's just that I needed to know the insides of what they was doing to make the hair look a certain way, to make the hair shine a certain way.  I just needed to know.  And so, my thing was, you don't have to pay me.  And he couldn't believe it.  He was just like, you've got to be kidding me.  I said, "No, I'll shampoo for free."  And so eventually he, he just, he just, I guess he said to himself, "This is just not right."  (Laughter) And he ended up, I ended up pay- receiving a salary from him every week.  And then eventually, I came on as a full-time assistant after I left school.  And then I came on as a full-time hairstylist at his particular shop.
Story_ID: 402634
Speaker 1: You said you were in school, an- and the school was in Buckhead [Atlanta, Georgia], at Arnold's [Arnold International School of Cosmetology, Atlanta, Georgia], right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did you build the clientele in the Buckhead area that would follow you to Decatur [Georgia]?  Were there--because it was a school, your clientele was black?
Speaker 2: No, actually (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not necessarily?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, the clientele, most of the white clientele still did not follow me back to the DeKalb County [Georgia] area.  Because I ended up working in the DeKalb County area.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But when I was in school for hair, I had white people, I had black people, whoever would sit in the chair.  And some of those ladies eventually ended up following me to the salon.  And I can remember one incident when I actually was learning how to really use the curling irons properly, and I dropped the curling irons on the lady.  And they fell in her lap, went down and fell in her lap.  And it scared me and it scared her.  And I would say about a year and a half later, I've graduated, and I'm working as a professional hairstylist at David--Daweed's Hair Designs [Lithonia, Georgia].  And I'll never forget, early that morning, I think I had an 8:30 appointment.  I pulled up, and this particular lady pulled up.  And she had booked an appointment with me, but you know, it's been about a year and a half, so I didn't really remember her.  And she didn't remember me.  And, but she actually had the opportunity to see someone else's hair that I actually styled, not knowing it was the same person who dropped the curling irons on her in school.  And so, I actually got out of the car.  And she got out of the car and walked in, and she said, "I'm here to see Antonio [HistoryMaker Antonio Anderson]."  I said, "I'm Antonio."  And that was my time to redeem myself.  And to this day she still comes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's been about, that's over twenty years.
Story_ID: 402635
Speaker 1: Daweed's, spell Daweed's, because that is an unusual way that it's spelled (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  It's actually D-A-W-E-E-D-S, Daweed's.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's actually my understanding that it's Hebrew for David.
Speaker 1: Okay. (Laughter) And you said that you really just wanted to get the experience and learn from him, you know, tap into his knowledge, and he didn't have to pay you.  But you said, "Because I was working a regular job."
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What were you doing besides going to school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes I--well, in school, I was working at ITE [ITE Circuit Breaker Company], which is an electrical plant.  And I would go there to finance my education, the trade school that I was attending.  And so I worked there.  I would go there in the morning about seven.  I would take my clothes with me, and I would work and I would leave.  I'd have to be at school about 4:30, so I would go back and change clothes about three.  And then I would make it over to Arnold's [Arnold International School of Cosmetology, Atlanta, Georgia].  And from there, I worked that job for a while all the way out of school.  And it kind of led a little bit into, with David [David Fields], with Daweed's Hair Designs [Lithonia, Georgia].  And then I particularly--basically I just stopped working there, because I really wanted to focus more so on my career and developing my clientele.
Speaker 1: You said it was an electrical company?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What did you do?
Speaker 2: We actually, we built electrical power boards and circuit boards that turn your lights on and off.  And basically I was, I did a lot of packaging.  And we- I actually did some mechanical work, inserting the breakers and things of that nature.  But that was something that I knew I didn't want to do for a living.  But it was okay, it was something to do.  And here again, that goes all the way back to my mother [Linda Johnson], as far as the work ethics--that we all worked.  So, I worked my way through school.  And so from there, I was able to work with David.  And I think I stayed with David, Daweed's Hair Designs, for about a year and a half.  And at that time, I guess I'm twenty years old at that time.  And so I built a good deal of my clientele there, and I began to do a lot of hairstyling competitions, a lot of competing, and things of that nature.
Story_ID: 402636
Speaker 1: So, okay, so you were at Daweed's [Daweed's Hair Designs, Lithonia, Georgia] for about a year?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, now you're about twenty years old?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at David's [David Fields] place I really got a good understanding of hair and competing, and things of that nature.  As a matter of fact, one of my first big competitions that I did was here in Atlanta [Georgia].  It's called the Bronner Brothers hair show [Bronner Brothers International Beauty Show].  And I'll never forget the first one that I got in; we got whooped, in other words. Because we didn't know what to expect, and I went in there with my, I used my cousin.  And I think I had like a windmill on the side of her head.  And we had, it was one of those cheap, I had one of those little cheap looking outfits on.  I thought I was looking good.  And these girls came in with all this high fashion stuff on.  I mean, they were looking good.  And we lost.  It was like, like I said, we got whipped bad.  And the Bronner Brothers show is a hair show that brings people from all over the country.  You're talking about 125,000 hairstylists.  And if you can win one of those shows, I mean, it pretty much sets the tone; it gets you out there.  So, everyone is trying to win a Bronner Brothers hair show.  And so when I lost that time, I went up to the judge to ask him exactly what I did wrong?  And he said, "You concentrated too much on your hair," and this and that.  Because it was a total fashion competition.  So that means that you got to understand, from head to toe--you've got to dress the model from the hair, earrings, makeup and clothes, all the way down.  And the way I am, I'm the type of person that is, I'm a, you know, I'm not going to quit.  I'm going to make this thing happen.  And so, I decided--I opened up my salon [Styles by San Antonio, Decatur, Georgia] the following year.  So at this time, I'm twenty getting ready to turn twenty-one.  So I went into my salon I think in 1986.  And I began to compete, and I decided that I was, that I would actually get back into the Bronner Brothers show again.
Story_ID: 402637
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we were talking about the hair care show with the Bronner Brothers [Bronner Brothers International Beauty Show].  And you stayed at Daweed's [Daweed's Hair Designs, Lithonia, Georgia] for a year.  And as a young man, you decided what? That you were going to go out on your own?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was, here again, I was at David's [David Fields] place for about a little over a year.  And it was funny, because actually I did not want to own my own salon.  I wasn't really interested in that, because I knew the actual, the weight that it carried with all the responsibilities, the bills.  I was just fine, renting a booth.  And so, my brother found this place on Candler Road, it's an actual house.  And so he was talking to my father [Anderson's stepfather, Herman Johnson], and they all got together.  And so I was really kind of like pushed into it, because it wasn't something I really wanted to--you know, it was okay to have your name, but it wasn't no big deal for me, because you got more bills.  And that's exactly how I looked at it.  But it was, here again, when I look back on it, it was the best thing to have happened for me.  And I went in it at quite a young age, too.  When I look back on it, it didn't seem like I was that young at the time, to me.  But when I look back on it, a lot of people were like, oh, wow.  And so, when I got there, I was about twenty-one.
Speaker 1: So, this is 19--
Speaker 2: This is '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: Eighty-six [1986], okay.
Speaker 2: And that's when I opened up my salon [Styles by San Antonio, Decatur, Georgia] in the fall.  It was, I think it was around September or October.  And, you know, from there we actually began to do very well.  We had one side, and that's when I began to bring my mother [Linda Johnson] into the business.  And we had one side that we were going to turn into--it was like adjacent to my hair salon.  And we began, we were going to turn it into a, a beauty supply store.  But the cost of that was too much, so I ended up turning it into a nail salon.  And that's how my mother came onboard, and she worked there for about fifteen years.
Story_ID: 402638
Speaker 1: And when I got in my salon [Styles by San Antonio, Decatur, Georgia], we began to--here again we go back to the competition--we began to compete.  And I decided to do the Bronner Brothers show [Bronner Brothers International Beauty Show] one more time, because I just couldn't, I just couldn't walk away that way.  And so I got my mother [Linda Johnson].  And she has a little seamstress background, but she had a good eye for certain things.  And at that time, I was dating my wife [Raquel Lett-Anderson].  And I wanted to, I wanted to find a way, I wanted to get an understanding of what I did wrong at the first competition, so that way, we could make the adjustments and changes.  So with my wife, she knew a lady by the name of Linda Sears [ph.] who could sew very well.  And I knew that looking at the other fashions and looking at some of the other stylists, that they concentrated, to me, on a lot of, quite a bit on their outfits, and the look of the outfits.  And so, we got with Linda, and we began to tell her that we wanted to do another show, and that we was going to do the big show, which was going to be in August.  And so, Bronner Brothers carried two shows, which is the February show and the August show.  And so, I knew at the time that I needed a great model.  Looking at the other girls--I was able to look at all the big guys who won that show and walked away with all that money.  I knew that I had to make some changes in my model, and I needed to make some changes in the outfit.  But the hair wasn't a big issue, because I could handle that.  And so, I got together with my mother and my wife, and we were able to--here again we found Linda Sears.  But I also found a friend of mine who I actually used to do her hair in school.  And she came to the salon to get her hair done, and she was extremely tall.  Her name was Lynn [ph.].  And I asked Lynn--and I knew she was a professional model.  And I asked Lynn would she actually consider modeling for me for the Bronner Brothers show, and what would be the costs, and things of that nature.  And I perhaps told her that we could split the purse, because I knew she didn't come, she didn't come free, because that's what she did for a living.  So I went out and got the best model, I knew she was good.  And she had a great look, and we found a great designer.  And I knew I could handle the hair.  And so from there we probably rehearsed all that--during the summertime. The show was leading up to August.  We started way back in probably April preparing for the Bronner Brothers show.  And those are some of the things that we didn't do actually the first time.  We didn't prepare ourselves; we didn't get ourselves in position to handle such a large competition like that.  And in looking at how serious a lot of the guys and the stylists and the females took this competition--because anyone knows that if you can win a Bronner Brothers show, it will launch you out there.  And so from there we began to prepare and rehearse, and go over different looks and designs.  And we probably changed looks several different times.  And that led up to the big day.  And from there we were able to get with Linda, and we worked out a dress that was really nice.  It was black and fuchsia, and I made some adjustments with my own taste to it.  And we had a train on it, and it was black and it was fitted real tight, and had these tiers on it.  And so we knew had the look; we had the dress.  And so when I got there I had, actually I decided to put two models in.  So I really wanted to have a backup model.  And my second model was Manette [ph.].  And so with her, I decided to do a short look with her, a short dress with gold and black.  And my second model was my insurance that if anything went wrong, then I could pro- perhaps have a better chance to win the competition.
Story_ID: 402639
Speaker 1: And so each girl had their own different look, own different presentations.  But my whole emphasis--Lynn [ph.] was my star quarterback.  She was the one that I knew could make this thing happen.  And so, when we got in there, I got a little nervous and I made some adjustments on her hair.  I made actually some adjustments right on the spot on some color.  I'd actually mixed different colors to come up with a certain color, fuchsia, to blend with her dress.  So I took a chance and mixed that on the spot.  And so, we got there and all the other girls was in there.  I even had one of my instructors that was competing.  So, I was competing against my instructors and some of my colleagues and friends, so it was pretty tight.  And some other folks from all the country and all over the world.  And so I told Lynn, I said, "Lynn, we're going to have to do something big if we're going to win this competition."  I said, "I need for you to stand up."  I said, "Normally, you're sitting down holding your number as a model.  But you're so tall, and your presentation is so nice and elegant, I want you to stand up."  And she really got on me that--half of that night was over.  Because she had to stand up in some heels for about a good hour and a half.  But the interesting thing about it, when the judges came into the ballroom--if you know anything about competing and judging a competition, normally when they're looking at a model that they want to score high on, they'll go to a model next to her.  So really they're judging the model that's next to her, and they're looking at another model, because they don't want to draw too much attention to that particular one model that has a great possibility to win the show.  And they don't want to look biased--to keep--everyone to keep going up to that same model.  And so, they always would go up, but they would look like they were judging the other model.  Most competitions are done that way.  And so, Lynn hit the runway.  And when she hit the runway, she did what she could do.  And I mean it was, it was hot.  And she left that runway, and they called the winners out, and we won.  And everyone was jumping around the room, and I did ask the judge why my second model didn't win.  And I got the an-, the response I got was they just couldn't give two awards to one person.  And so we came back the following year, and we won at that particular show [Bronner Brothers International Beauty Show].
Story_ID: 402640
Speaker 1: You talk about the, the purse.  What was at stake?  How much was at stake there [Bronner Brothers International Beauty Show] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, normally the purse rai- ranged about five thousand dollars, from five to--in the early years, it would go all the way up to ten thousand dollars.  And they stopped printing the pictures in Jet magazine and things of that nature, they didn't do any of that.  But from there, you built--you were able to bring in more clientele, more people heard about you.  Leaving out of the ballroom, you're walking away with this huge trophy, about four or five feet tall.  And it's just a, it's just great recognition as far as, among your colleagues, to win an international competition like that.
Speaker 1: So did it increase your business?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I think it gave us the big boost that we needed, because we were just moving into my salon [Styles by San Antonio, Decatur, Georgia] at that time.  And we were actually moving into territory that was unknown, that we weren't really sure about, because I was going into my own business.  And actually Herman [Herman Johnson], my stepfather, set that up.  He financed the whole deal.  Because I'm nine- twenty years old, I mean, nineteen or twenty at the most.  And I don't have the credit to finance, you know, something of that nature.  And so what we decided to was--which is the smartest move we could have made to this day--my brother, he talked us into buying the property.  So we bought the property, and that was probably the best move we could have ever made.  And so Herman put the money up for that.
Story_ID: 402641
Speaker 1: So from there, you know, we competed in other competitions and we won a few more.  And you know, competitions got--it's a lot of work dealing with competitions, and I kind of began to stray away from them.  And I did a lot of platform, I did a little platform work.  It's hairstyling, where you're styling hair and you're working for another company.  And I probably did that for a couple of years.  I worked for Pro-Line [Pro-Line International, Inc.].  And I worked with my instructor, his name was Chuck Garland [ph.].  As a matter of fact, he was my, he was the instructor that was the one that was--when I look back on it, he was the one that really began to show me a lot of things when it came to understanding the hair care business and understanding the hair care--understanding the foundation of hair itself.  And actually, he came out of, he came out of Detroit [Michigan] here to Atlanta [Georgia].  And here again, we became best friends outside of the hair care business.  We became very good friends.  And so, Chuck was another person who just really laid a good foundation down when I look back on it, in the hair care business.  He was one of the instructors over at Arnold's [Arnold International School of Cosmetology, Atlanta, Georgia], at Pivot Point [Pivot Point International], that we talked about earlier.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you're in the salon [Styles by San Antonio, Decatur, Georgia], and business is going well, and you've finished the competitions, working with the competitions and platform work with Pro-Line.
Speaker 1: Pro-Line.  And Chuck and I, actually Chuck pretty much set that up for me.  Because, let me see, I was twenty-one, twenty-two.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And it was kind of heard o- unheard of for a guy that young to be doing educational and instructing type work on a platform.  So, he pretty much set that job up for me, and it went well.
Speaker 2: So who was running the salon while you were doing the platform work?
Speaker 1: Actually I was--the platform work basically was on the weekend, it was actually on like Sundays and Mondays.  So the way they did it was, and the way it's always done, is they always set it up on the days, on the times when most stylists are off.  Especially like on Mondays, that's when stylists can come out and work at workshops.  They can come out and do various things, you know.  They can come out for different clinics, different hair shows, and things of that nature.
Speaker 2: So l- explain what platform work is, so we can make sure that's clear.
Speaker 1: Platform work is something that stylists do when they're trying to educate and teach and train other hairstylists.  So, you're training and educating your other colleagues, people that are in your industry, on various different techniques, on various different types of chemicals that probably was introduced by the company, and new methods, new styling methods, things of that nature.  So it's like a workshop.  And as a platform artist, you are considered the best of the best to teach the other hairstylists exactly what to do, how to do it, how to do the style, how to work the chemicals, and how to use and introduce the new chemicals that the manufacturer perhaps introduced.  So it's your job to really make that particular company look good, and to make the product look good.  And so, normally most stylists are chosen by their ability to style or to design hair, and some of the credentials they might have that comes along with it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, this is around 1985?
Speaker 1: That's, actually, no.  That's about eighty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Eighty-six [1986]?
Speaker 1: Eighty-six [1986], '87 [1987]--
Speaker 2: Eighty-seven [1987].
Story_ID: 402642
Speaker 1: Okay, so what, what happens next?
Speaker 2: From there we began to get a roll on in the salon [Styles by San Antonio, Decatur, Georgia], and from there I think I brought in about six other hairstylists in my business.  And we probably changed over stylists over the years, over the years.  And one of the things that I think was most memorable, here again, is we would have people come who actually used to come there to get their hair done, of if they didn't come there anymore.  But we would have an annual Christmas dinner at my shop, and people would come from all over, ex- I mean, clients that we used to do and current clients.  And it would be a big, I mean, it was a big thing.  And so, that was the way that we used to maintain the clientele and to maintain that, that atmosphere that we wanted to keep--a family type atmosphere in the salon.  And then at that time, my mother [Linda Johnson] was actually, she was overseeing and working in the nail salon that was adjacent.  I think she probably had about four techs on her side.  And it was kind of unusual, because during that time back in '86 [1986], '87 [1987] and '88 [1988] perhaps, you couldn't find a fully established nail salon during that time, during those days.  Mostly your nail salons that you see now, I mean you see a nail salon pretty much on every corner--a nail salon here, a nail salon there.  But we were the ones that pretty much innovated and started the nail, a full service nail salon in the DeKalb County [Georgia] area.  I mean we did all types of different nails and pedicures, manicures.  We didn't do any skin care or anything of that nature.  We thought about getting into the ski- the esthetician business, but we decided to back off on that.  And for a while my wife [Raquel Lett-Anderson] worked up at the salon, she pretty much managed the shop.  She was overseeing certain things, and she kind of updated the place for a minute there and brought some computer skills there.  And so, she worked there, and the reason why I wanted her there was because of her knowledge.  But at the same time, I just didn't really want her to work where she'd have to work and stay in and work for someone else.  And during that time she was pregnant with my first child [Bryce Anderson], and so she worked there for a couple of years.
Story_ID: 402643
Speaker 1: When did you get married?  What year did you get married?
Speaker 2: We got married back in 1991.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we went from--okay, we went from '88 [1988] to '90 [1990].  And then '91 [1991] is when you got married.  Okay, all right.  And your first child was born when?
Speaker 2: That was Bryce [Bryce Anderson], Bryce was born, actually he was born in '91 [1991] also.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was born that same year.  And, and today he's, actually he's fifteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so she actually, Raquel [Raquel Lett-Anderson] worked there [Styles by San Antonio, Decatur, Georgia] for a while, but not long.  And from there, she ended up getting into non-profit type of, a fundraising type business.
Story_ID: 402644
Speaker 1: And so, during this time the salon [Styles By San Antonio, Decatur, Georgia] is still progressing, but we're going through our slumps where you might have seven, eight stylists, and eventually you cut back down to about four.  And you'd go back up, and then down to about two.  So, one of the things I was finding out in the hair care business was that the business was beginning to be a little bit unstable, or the stylists was beginning to be unstable.  Stylists were up and down; so we were having too much going on.  And one of the things that--to kind of go back just a little bit--when I was at David's [David Fields] salon [Daweed's Hair Designs, Lithonia, Georgia]--this will lead right into my shop.  One of the things I was really concerned about when I got into the hair care business is why--when we would applying chemicals to hair, we would--I couldn't understand why we were actually using a comb to put a relaxer on, a back of a comb.  It just didn't make sense to me.  And I would ask Chuck [Chuck Garland (ph.)], my instructor, or I would ask David about it and a lot of other people about it.  Why?  You know, I'm just getting into the business and I'm beginning to pay attention to certain things.  I said why are we using the back of a comb to put the relaxer on the client's hair?  I said actually, the client is doing it the same way.  They're using a comb the exact same way you can use it, that we're doing in the salon.  So in other words, they can--actually, you're doing nothing different than they're doing at home.  They can use the back of the comb, they can get a jar, they can get the comb, and they can dip it in and put the relaxer on.  So, why are we charging the client sixty, seventy dollars, and we're not looking, we're not looking professional, we're not taking it to another level?  If you go to a dentist, they don't use a toothbrush to clean your teeth.  They have special utensils and equipment to clean and to maintain your teeth.  And I began to think, why don't we have something that can apply the chemicals?  Plus, it took too long.  To me, it was just too repetitious to take a comb and dip into the relaxer jar and put the relaxer on.  You dip it in--so you're going backwards and forward, backwards and forward.  And I began to get a little innovative at that time.  And that's when I began to, I began to think--like I call it, think out of the box, instead of thinking the normal way.  And I came up with a way, I came up with a drawing.  I had my aunt, who was an artist, I had her draw something for me.  I laid it out on a machine, and I said, "This is the way we can apply relaxers to the hair."  And I began to pursue that.  And it, it was a challenge, I mean it was a lot of work.  But I found out there was nothing on the market that was out there that allowed professional hairstylists to put the relaxer on much faster, much neater, than the old conventional way of putting the relaxer on with a comb.  I really couldn't believe it, I mean once I really got into the business.  It just didn't make sense to me.  Once you really start doing a lot of clients, and you start doing a lot of relaxers back to back, you're like, "This is unbelievable.  I can't believe no one thought about this."  And so I'll never forget when I had my aunt do the drawing.  I introduced it to my wife [Raquel Lett-Anderson], that's when we were dating at the time.  And I showed her the drawing, and she was like, "Wow, okay, all right."  And she kind of like, kind of giggled a little bit at it, like, "I don't know," you know.  And I said, "No, we're going to do this.  We're going to ma- we're going to bring this machine to life, we're going to make this thing happen."  And she was like, "Okay, all right, all right."  I said, "Get ready, we're gonna do this."
Story_ID: 402645
Speaker 1: And then going back, getting right back into the salon [Styles by San Antonio, Decatur, Georgia] thing--I kind of put it on the backburner, because I was opening up the salon.  And so once I got in the salon, it came back to my mind again.  I just couldn't put it down, I just couldn't understand why we didn't have a machine that puts the relaxer on, and things of that nature.  It just didn't make sense.  So I began to really pursue it.  And so I decided that I could make it myself, I'll build it.  And with no mechanical background or no nothing, understanding of any kind of engineering or anything like that, I decided that I would hire a student engineer.  And my, at that time, my cousin, who was an attorney, would come and get her hair cut.  And I would ask her exactly how can we construct some kind of agreement or contract with him, and how would I go about bringing in a student engineer?  Because I knew that would probably be my best route, as far as financing the whole deal and keeping my costs down.  So I brought in this guy by the name of Rodney [ph.], who was a senior student.  I think he was at, he had done some study at Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] at that time.  And he came in and I began to show him the problems in the hair care business, as far as putting the relaxer on with a comb, as well as the color.  And he looked at it, and he said, "Okay, I think I can design or build something."  And so during that time, he did what we call some schematics and some drawings.  But his drawings, once I was able to show them to some other people--they were really like what you call ghost drawings, meaning that he did a housing of the machine, but he did not do any, he did not do any--in other words, there was no mechanical functional parts on the inside.  And so, from there I began to look at the fact that--so I pretty much let him go, because he just didn't, he couldn't make the thing work.  And so, I began to get these engineering books.  And so what I decided to do was take the- these particular books and begin to look at different pumps and pumping systems, and figure out exactly how can you get the machine, how can you get this machine to spray out relaxer?  Not having any understanding of how pumps worked, you know, I would call the various manufacturers and tell them that I needed a pump, but I needed a certain size pump that would fit in the housing.  So we had the housing already built, but we had nothing on the inside.  We had no mechanical function on the inside, no guts on the inside to make it work, no mechanical parts.  And so, I built a good relationship with this guy on the telephone.  And I said, "Well, man, I'm trying to, I need a pump.  But I need it this size so it can fit inside.  But I need something that can move a consistency like peanut butter."  And that was our biggest challenge with Rodney.  We could not move the relaxer through the tube, (laughter) you know.  And actually I have those machines here, too.  So, we could not move the relaxer through the tube.  And the compressor that he was using just didn't work.  And so, the guy said, "I'm going to send you a certain pump that has a certain PSI, and hopefully that can work for you."  And from there, he brought the--they actually FedEx'ed the parts down to me, and I put those parts in--you know, a friend of mine who was another hairstylist.  He actually has a salon to this day in the Mall at Stonecrest mall [Lithonia, Georgia].  We worked closely together trying to get that machine working.  He was kind of assisting me along, and motivating me a little bit.  And so, we actually brought in the different parts and brought in the pumps.  And I told him that this pump, this motor didn't work and that motor didn't work.  And he said, "Well, try this motor then."  And he'd call me back, "Tell me how did that motor work?"  And he said, "Well, I'm going to send you another motor."  So eventually, he found the right motor that could push the chemical through the tube.  In other words, we had to get the motor to get the relaxer to go from the container, from the jar, all the way out into the gun.  So we had to have a pump that could do that.  And we began to find other things that's on the market.  For example, to spray the relaxer, he had a little gun that we ended up using.  We went to Home Depot, and we used a regular water hose gun.  Actually, it didn't look like a water hose gun, it had a great look to it.  And we began to use this thing, and it began--we put all the parts together and we were able to get our first piece to work.  And we videotaped it and recorded it, and it worked. And that's when we went, from there we went to my patent attorney to get a patent on it [Quick Dispensary 2000].  Actually, I went to him a couple of times before then.  But he was able to explain to me that you cannot get a patent on something that is not functional, if you don't have any--you can't get a patent on a drawing.  And that's what I came to him with in the beginning stage, with a drawing.  And so, you can't patent a drawing.  So you had to have something that had some patentable novelty to it.  And so from there I went to the patent attorney, and we were able to do some patent work on it.  And so it took about two and a half years to do that.
Story_ID: 402646
Speaker 1: Tell me about that process, about getting a patent.
Speaker 2: The patent process?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, it's, it's a very tedious process, and it's something I wouldn't request anybody to try and do on your own.  I have a lot of people who try to do their own patent work.  But it's something--you start talking about the language in a patent.  And the art of how it's written--it's too complicated.  It's--one word can throw your whole patent off.  So, I actually requested people to go out and use a professional patent attorney or a patent agent.  And so, we hired a guy by the name of Walter Rogers, who was actually doing our patent work for us.  And so the process is to find something that is, a product itself that has patentable novelty to it.  And then once you do that, then you need to turn it over to a professional, and he can determine whether or not you can have something that can perhaps be a design patent, or a utility patent, or what we call a plant patent.  And prior to that, you know, we had to make a decision on which way we were going to go with this thing [Quick Dispensary 2000].  But I tell anyone, when you're dealing with the patent process, before you even go the patent attorney, one of the most important things that you can do is, you can begin to journalize. Begin to journalize and write down everything about your product--what it is and what it looks like, the different functions and the features, and the things that it has to have if you improve something.  So, you want to write everything about that product down and keep it in a journal, and perhaps mail those items, mail those things back to yourself in a registered mail.  So that way, you can keep that.  So that way, if anything ever happens in a court of law, you can open it up and show that this was your original idea.  So that's one of the early things that we tell people to do when they're trying to do the patent process, is to try to journalize the whole idea.  And from there, we went to the patent attorney, and he began to file our stuff with the patent attorney's office in Washington [D.C.].  So in other words, our stuff was on file, and it was pending.  In other words, it was patent pending.  And so from there, we went to the patent attorney.  And so, it's a waiting process, it's a waiting period.  But while it's patent pending, you cannot market your product or your idea.
Speaker 1: So you have to wait until, until (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You don't have to wait.  But say it's a waiting--normally it takes about two and a half years to receive a utility patent.  And a utility patent is a very, it's a complicated patent, but it holds a lot of weight.  So, it's more valuable than what we call a design patent or a plant patent.  And a utility patent is, it's something that's going to hold up better in a court of law.  You really have to have something that has new novelty, new ground, you have broken ground.  You have been granted something by the law, something that is totally new and unique.  In other words, you have done something that someone else has not done before.  So that's what a utility patent will grant you.  A design patent is basically going to cover just your look and your design of something.  And it really doesn't carry that much weight, but it is a patent.  And quite naturally, a plant patent covers things dealing with plant mechanisms, and growing things and stuff of that nature.
Speaker 1: So you were waiting for the utility patent?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we actually received a utility patent on that.  And we rece- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did it take two and a half years?
Speaker 2: It took about two and a half years.
Story_ID: 402647
Speaker 1: So, you said it, it takes about two and a half years to get a pattern [sic. patent].  But you can go ahead and market--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the product?
Speaker 2: It takes, it takes about two and a half years to receive a utility patent.  A design patent can take, you can get it within twelve months if you don't have any problems.  And even with a utility patent, if there's some challenges--if the patent office [U.S. Patent and Trademark Office] challenges your patent, then it could take longer, because there's something--in other words, they've found something that's out there that is similar to what you're doing.  And that's one of the things that you have to--you need a patent attorney to do what we call a patent search.  And a patent attorney is going to do a search to find out the things that are similar to what you have out there.  And they get to find out--in other words, before they can even look at trying to get you a patent, or look at trying to get a patent pending, they've got to look at other things that are similar--things that you might have cross-referenced, or things that you might have infringed on that you just didn't know about that was already on the marketplace, or never made it to the marketplace.  And those are the things that a patent attorney, that is his job.  His job is to go out and to look at all the, do cross-references.  And he would have someone go out an examiner who will look at everything that is similar to your product or your idea.  And he will go out, his job is to find things that are similar to your product.  And if they--then he will bring those papers back to the patent attorney and he will, the patent attorney will read the language, not necessarily looking at the picture, but he will read the language to see if it's anything similar to what you are doing, or what you're trying to do or what you're trying to get a patent on, and then he will cross-reference those items.  And then he will tell you--most likely, a good patent attorney can tell you if you have something, here again, that has patentable novelty, or he can tell you if it's pretty much going to be patentable or not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To keep you from really wasting your money and your time.
Story_ID: 402648
Speaker 1: You went ahead to put this on the market, or what did you do (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, that was in the early stage with the patent attorney.  That was my prototype [for the Quick Dispensary 2000].  And we knew that we could not take the prototype, and we could not sell that.  A prototype basically was designed to prove that the concept works.  We knew that we could spray relaxer, that we could do color with the machine, and things of that nature.  So what we decided to do was bring in an engineering firm.  So this thing is really getting to a whole 'nother level at this time.  And so, my wife [Raquel Lett-Anderson] and I, at that time--during this time now my wife and I decided to raise some money.  And quite naturally that's her background, and so she's fully in the picture now.  So we decided to bring over some family and friends to finance this whole thing, because we knew we needed to--if we're going to get it on the market, we needed to get into a more professional look.  But prior to going to the engineering office, we did de- try to introduce it to some companies.  And we introduced it to Revlon [Revlon, Inc.], and Soft Sheen [Soft Sheen Products, Inc.], and at that time M&M Products, and a lot of other big guys--Clairol [Clairol Inc.].  And we had a lot of interest from Revlon and we had a lot of interest from Soft Sheen.  As a matter of fact, Soft Sheen was getting ready to put a deal on the table.  They flew down and brought some of their big guys in.  And one of the ladies that I can remember, she was the vice president of strategic management, a new business.  Her name was Sharon Reed [Sharon Reed Walker], and she was with Soft Sheen Products.  And we all met at the engineering office that we hired, to put our product in a more professional manner.  At that time, it was still in the prototype form.  But the engineering guys had already put it into a--they had the drawings of what it could look like in a production piece.  And so, we decided to bounce it off these big guys who was already in the hair care business who was making hair care relaxer and colors, and things of that nature.  Why not try to license the product with them?  And one of the problems that we ran out with them, especially Soft Sheen Products, they just did not want to cough up the kind of money--they did not want to--they felt like it didn't fit their marketing plans at that time, and their strategic planning.  And so, we decided to move forward on our, on our own.  And that's when we decided to move forward with fundraising, and move forward with developing the machine and putting it into a more professional manner.  And that's with David Walls and Associates [ph.] here in Atlanta [Georgia] at that time that we brought in to build a prototype--build a production piece, take the prototype and get it into a production model.  And they did just that.  They put it into a very nice piece.  It was a piece that could work with both, with two stylists at the same time.  You could do relaxing and you could do color.  And it has a built-in flushing system.  It had all the whistles and the bangs to it.  And we went around to different trade shows, and Bronner Brothers shows [Bronner Brothers International Beauty Show], and different salons.  And one of the problems that we had with that piece after we did raise our money with the family and friends--once we built the machine--because we still didn't have enough money to mold it and get it to the proper price.  On--during that time a lot of folks, twenty years ago you weren't able to have a China reach.  We weren't able to take our part to China and have it--the costs out there.  So, we were having to manufacture it here, and the costs of it were too high for our market.  And with my wife [Raquel Lett-Anderson] having a background in marketing, it was just too--she was able to find out, along with the engineers, that the costs, what it cost us to make it and to sell it to the end user was just too high.  And we had to find out a better way to make the machine smaller or to retool it.  And to do some of that stuff, you needed to have bigger, bigger money, or either go into China and try to have it manufactured or what have you.
Story_ID: 402649
Speaker 1: You did use it in your salons [Styles by San Antonio, Decatur, Georgia] though?
Speaker 2: Yes, we actually started the machine for about three or four years we used it on clients coming in every day.  We used the color, we used the relaxer.  It was much faster.  We actually was able to take the machine to Regis Hair Salons [Regis Salons], actually, when we took a trip to Chicago [Illinois] because we was invited to do a presentation for that group up there.  And so, we was trying to sell it to all the salons in that particular network they had.  I think they had about fifteen hundred salons at that time, and so we were trying to tap into a franchise.  But the problem is, here again, is that the pricing of the machine was too much for them to put in every salon.  Because one of the problems that we found out that they really tried to keep quiet for a while, was that you go to these mall salons like Rich's [Rich's Department Store, Atlanta, Georgia] and Macy's, and those department stores like that--and when you go into your high-end areas like Alpharetta [Georgia], Perimeter [Perimeter Mall] here in Atlanta [sic. Dunwoody, Georgia]--they was finding out that some of the white stylists did not want to do relaxers because of, quite naturally, they wasn't, they was not well-trained in putting a chemical on, or they just didn't want to deal with it at all.  But when you come into those kinds of salons, you have to do whatever comes through the door.  And so that was one of the vice president's, one of his things that he was trying to do, was perhaps bring in a machine like this that could perhaps put the relaxer on, that anybody could pick up and use.  If you could spray toothpaste on a toothbrush, then you could spray relaxer out with this machine.  That's how easy it was.  And so, that was one of the things that they were trying to do.  And when they found out that they were having lawsuits pending--because you had some black people that were perhaps going to these white areas and they were turned around because the white stylists just didn't want to do the relaxers--and so this was, this was something that they wanted to use a remedy to solve the problem.  But the pricing was too much, because we could not sell it to them at the price they wanted it at.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Okay.  So, what year are we in now with the, the marketing of this?
Speaker 2: This is around (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the name of it?  Was there a name for this?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the name of the machine was called the Quick Dispensary 2000. Quick Dispensary 2000.  And so right now, we're still around about 1996, between '91 [1991], '96 [1996], '96 [1996] area. We're really pushing hard for this machine, to get it on the market.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we actually got in on the market and did some Bronner Brothers shows [Bronner Brothers International Beauty Show], and we traveled quite a bit.  We did presentations for J.C. Penney's [JCPenney]; they were interested in it at one point.  But the problem is that everybody got down to--the bottom line was the pricing was too much to buy for fifteen hundred or two thousand salons.  And we're talking about a machine that was priced at, at that time, the one that we call the deluxe model--the one that we were testing in the salon that we had David Walls' [ph.] engineering firm put together--that piece was like fifty-nine hundred dollars.  And we eventually ended up making some smaller models.  But those small models, the one that was a single unit station, that model was called the Quick Dispensary 950.  And we had the Quick Dispensary 850, and those models was actually--I mean they was running between fifteen hundred and two thousand dollars just for the single station smaller units.  And so, we still was out of reach still with our market.  And that pricing for the machine, we found that out it really needed to be about $399 or $499, something like that.  And anything under $500, we would have been within range.  But to build a machine of that caliber to do what it was doing, you couldn't build it for that price, not here in the states you couldn't.  Today you probably, perhaps you can.  But you can't do it--you, you couldn't do it at that time.
Story_ID: 402650
Speaker 1: So what, what happened to, did you give up on the idea of trying to market it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we got to a point where the money ran out.  We knew from a market standpoint what we were dealing with.  We had the big boys' interest, but their thing was that they would try to do one themselves, that eventually they would come out with their own piece.  And so, eventually we just walked away from it, and just began to use it as a learning tool, as a lot of knowledge that we gained.  And we spent a ton of money developing that machine [Quick Dispensary 2000].  But it was, I think all of it was within God's plan, and it led up to some of the things that we eventually ended up doing.  And my wife [Raquel Lett-Anderson], who pretty much, here again, started at the beginning of my developing products, she walked it all the through to some of the stuff that we're doing currently.
Story_ID: 402651
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the next thing after this project?  What did it lead to?
Speaker 2: Well, we got into a, I got into a thing where I said, well, why can't I just--I began to look at how stylists put their relaxers on, when they were getting ready to put it on the countertops.  I mean they'd put it on the station, and the relaxer and the gel and everything is all over the place.  And I began to look at that, and I said, why don't we have an organized command center, command console station, a small compact piece that can hold the big four-pound buckets and everything that we use on a 24/7 basis that we can put this relaxer on, and that we can put the base on, and we can put the gel on?  And we came out with what we call a relaxer caddy.  And my wife [Raquel Lett-Anderson] was instrumental as far as putting the name together.
Speaker 1: What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: It was called the relaxer caddy.  And what it was designed to do was hold all the major chemicals that we use 24/7 in the salon all day.  And, because technically when you go into a salon today, you don't have a specific place.  You take a big four-pound relaxer and they will set it on top of a station with a tower up under it to keep it from moving.  Or, some stylists would put it inside their drawer.  So you can go into a salon right now, and you will not see an organized place to put that relaxer caddy at all.  And so we developed that, and began to make those in my mother's [Linda Johnson] garage, my father [Anderson's stepfather, Herman Johnson] and I.  And we set up a paint shop; we made everything.  We went to Home Depot Expo to make the tops and the legs that we got from different places.  And so, we actually set up an assembly shop in my mother's garage, my father and I.  And so we would take those pieces and I would go to different--and during the evening, the early part of the day, I turned into a salesman.  So I would go from salon to salon introducing them to the caddies.  And we would sell them; we sold very well.  We would go to various trade shows and we would sell very well.  But the issue with that was we just could not get, we didn't have enough production.  And we, here again, we ran into a money thing, whereas we had put a lot of money into the Quick Dispensary 2000, and now we're dealing with the relaxer caddies.  And that was something that was so easy and so simple that someone could take off the market; somebody could come in and easily copy you.  And so once we got to a situation where the money was beginning to be a challenge, and we felt like it was something that was easy to be duplicated, we decided to walk away from it.  And we wanted to make it cheaper, too.  And we just couldn't find an engineering firm to put it into a mold, a cavity mold or what have you, to make it cheaper and inexpensive. And so we kind of eventually ended up putting that on the backburner.
Story_ID: 402652
Speaker 1: And then bef- prior to that, we worked on a project that I designed for--it's a trash can dispenser.  It's a trash can bag dispenser.  And my poor wife [Raquel Lett-Anderson], she had been with me with all of these ideas.  I don't know how she does it, but she has.  But anyway, we worked on that trash can dispenser.  And what it was, normally when you go and get your trash bag and you're getting ready to put another trash bag in the trash bag, you always had to go back to the cabinet to get a trash bag.  So I came up with an idea that, you know, it would be a cabinet underneath the cabinet, up under the trash can, that was really compact, really designed very nicely.  And it had a dispenser, just like pulling your tissue from your box.  Well, when you pulled up one bag and laid it over, once that bag was full of trash and you began to pull out that bag, another bag would be coming up behind that bag.  And so you always had, you never had to go back to the cabinet until you were fully out in that particular box.  You'd just take a standup box and slide it in, and just pull right up.  And what probably happened with that was we just didn't have enough knowledge on that.  We took that and we sent it to Rubbermaid.  And Rubbermaid actually, they--we actually saw the product on television a few years later, not specifically by Rubbermaid, but I watching Channel 17 [WPCH-TV, Atlanta, Georgia] one day and my brother said, "Here's your idea right here, man," and there it was.  And we walked away from that piece.  And so now we're still in the hair care business.
Story_ID: 402653
Speaker 1: Did you have patents for the relaxer caddy and the trash bag dispenser?
Speaker 2: No.  One thing about the law, the patent law, it gives you, it allows you one year's rights to a product.  So, we knew that when we were dealing with the relaxer caddy and the Rubbermaid piece that we could market, we could put it out there on the market, and you've got one year rights to it.  Meaning that you can go and market it and whatever, but if you publicly expose that product, then you're on your own.  You have one year's right to get a patent to it, and--which is good.  Because the patent office [U.S. Patent and Trademark Office] was finding out that people had these great ideas, and they were running to the patent office and they were spending all this money but they could never get them off the ground.  So, now you have a grace period.  You have one year rights to that idea, and you can try to get it going.  But you don't want that year to lapse around to the date that you came with it or when you put it on the market, because now you have public exposure through either trade shows or publications, and things of that nature.  So it's public knowledge, and if you let that date expires and come back around again, then it's anybody's game at that point.
Story_ID: 402654
Speaker 1: Okay, so you still have the salon [Styles by San Antonio, Decatur, Georgia], though, while you're doing this?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm still in the hair care business.
Speaker 1: Okay, the hair care business.
Speaker 2: And we told everybody to keep your day job.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: Don't let your day job go (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, what year are we now?  What's, what's coming next?
Speaker 2: We're probably in the late, we're in the '90s [1990s], '98 [1998], '99 [1999].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We're around that time.
Speaker 1: And so now what's going on?
Speaker 2: Let's see, in 1999 we wanted to, we tried to revamp the Quick Dispensary 2000, I went back to that.  And so we had a, I brought in a graphics designer.  I brought in a new design team, and they actually designed it into a look.  It's amazing how, what over ten years can do as far as the design group can come in.  And they took that machine and they made, they designed--we actually had drawings, we didn't do it with the actual build the machine.  Because what happened was we had got word that a particular bank here in Atlanta [Georgia] was looking to do some funding.  And so we got a tip-off that we were able to get a behind-the-scenes meeting with some of these high level people.  And so Raquel [Raquel Lett-Anderson], with her background in marketing and business, she revamped the business plan, and we revamped the whole name of the machine and we called it the Globe Tech 850 [ph.].
Speaker 1: The Globe what?
Speaker 2: The Globe Tech 850.  We changed the whole name of the thing, I mean we went to a whole 'nother level.  We did the, we did everything.  Because it was a whole new season, new breed, and were sitting down with some big people who had the money.  And we knew that we wasn't going to go in building no new machines.  We just wanted to try to flatter them with some drawings and perhaps a new business plan.  And that didn't work, because they still wanted a little bit more meat.  They wanted to lend out money to get things started, but they wanted a little bit more.  They wanted to see how much collateral we could put down on the table, too.  And so it actually fanned out being something that we didn't think--it turned out to be something that--it really wasn't much at all.
Story_ID: 402655
Speaker 1: And so now, we, we're approaching, we're getting into perhaps around about 2000.  And so now, we're still in the hair care business (laughter).  So now, we're in a position where we're--from a spiritual side, I'm really beginning to, I'm really just changing my life.  And I'm really beginning to see things different, beginning to--I got saved.  I began to have some trouble health-wise.  And so we're, you know, we went through all this stuff here.  And so right around '99 [1999], I think, I'm not really sure--'98 [1998] I think--still in that area somewhere, I began to have a lot of heart palpitations.  And so, I was going in and out to the emergency room here and there.  And you know, I find out that the doctor, he couldn't find anything wrong.  But it was just things that, I just couldn't understand what was happening at the time.  And so, I really began to look toward the Lord.  I began to just change my life.  My focus was leaning past the products and all the development and the things I was trying to get going, and trying to make it, hit it big, and all that stuff.  And so I began to get an understanding that--I'll never forget one day I came in, and I was being, having heart palpitations and going to emergency rooms here and there.  And I could not understand what was going on.  And I told my wife, "I just know the Lord's with me.  Ain't nobody went through nothing like this."  And that's when she said, "You may want to read about Job in the Bible."  I began to read about Job and his life, and I began to see things totally different.  I was like, wow.  And during that time, now we, I'll never forget.  We were living here [Conyers, Georgia] at the time, and I went upstairs and I began to pray.  And I said, "Lord, I--," and the Lord began to show me.  He said, "Well, I did not call you to preach, but I called you to give your testimony."  And that was about seven years ago, and I was saying, "Testimony?  We don't got a testimony. What we got to--? Testimony?  We don't have anything."  And I heard that like it wasn't nothing.  He said, "I called you to give your testimony, I didn't call you to preach."  He said, "I called you and your wife to give your testimony."  Wasn't nothing happening at the time, so I couldn't understand that.  And so during that time, my thir- my second child is--Blaire [Blaire Anderson] my second child is here, my girl. And so Christian [Christian Anderson], in 2000, was born.  And his name is Christian Gabriel.  And prior to him being born, we was attending a church, and they was having a building program.  And one of the things that was happening was that the roof was about to fall in; they were having trouble with the church.  And prior to that, Raquel [Raquel Lett-Anderson], once Raquel found out she was pregnant with Christian, which is really the branch to this whole thing, she said that we found out that he was going to have Down syndromes [Down syndrome].  And I was like, "How is he going to have Downs syndrome?"  Raquel called me all upset that day, and I couldn't understand it.  I said, "All the other kids are fine.  What in the world could be wrong with him?"  And she said, "He's going to have Downs syndrome."  She was all upset, she was crying.  And I said, "What in the world is going on here, Lord?"  And so she said she was going to go to church.  So she went to church and they prayed for her.  And the way the Lord came to one of the pastors there, they had to tell them that they didn't think nothing was really wrong with this baby.  So Raquel, eventually once she found that she was going to have a baby that was going to be mentally retarded, they send you to a different doctor; she had to go to a specialist at that time.  And she started going to a specialist, and he began to tell her, "Are you willing to--what is your mindset?  Are you willing to abort the baby or are you going to go ahead and have the baby?  Which one do you want to do?"  Raquel said, "We're going to have the baby."  He said, "I don't have to go any further then.  Because now I know what your mindset is."  And so they decided to run some more tests on Christian.  And they ran some more tests, and we began to pray and everything.  Those tests came back that he was fine, that he was healthy, and that he was strong, nothing wrong with him.
Story_ID: 402656
Speaker 1: And so, going back to the building program, I was--during that time I was just, we were just so happy and everything that we were going to have a healthy baby and everything.  And I just, the Lord just laid on my heart to--we were trying to raise money to rebuild the roof and things of that nature.  So I began to--I told her, "I guess I want to sow this seed."  I went up and sowed a seed, and from there--in August, Christian [Christian Anderson] was born in 2000.  Two or three weeks later the Lord gave me the idea of the Gabriel Feeding Pad.  And we decided to name it, I decided to name it after him.  And the product is on the market, we have it on the market today, and it's called the Gabriel Feeding Pad.  And his first name is, his middle name is Gabriel.  And that's when the idea came to me.  And I- I'm convinced that as long as this world exists, it's going to be seed time and harvests.
Speaker 2: Tell me, how did it come to you?  What was going on that would make you think that you needed this Gabriel Feeding Pad?  I mean how did you come up with the idea?
Speaker 1: Well, a funny thing happened.  I was sitting actually right here in this living room.  And I was watching, it was about five minutes to one.  And I'm a big football fan of the Atlanta Falcons.  And Raquel [Raquel Lett-Anderson] had said she was going to bed, she was going to take a nap, and that she was going to leave all the kids with me, and gave me Christian.  And he was about three weeks old.  And I was like, "What in the world?"  So, I began to feed him and have a good time with him.  And then I noticed, I said, "Oh, my God, the Falcon game is getting ready to come on."   And so at that time I had my, I, I was trying, I was bottle feeding him, and I wanted to continue to bottle feed him; I didn't want to pour the bottle out.  And so I wanted to continue to bottle feed him, and you know, caress him and have a good time with him.  But I was trying to reach the remote control at the same time.  And I was getting all excited and nervous, because I was trying to grab the remote control.  And I wanted to turn the football game on, and I couldn't.  And so I ended up putting the bottle under my chin, and I finally got the remote control on.  And once I got it on and started watching the game, Raquel came through.  And she began to look at me, and I was looking at her, and I said, "I have another idea."  And she was like, "Oh, Lord."  And I told her, I said, "I can't believe that--how you manage to do the things that you do."  Because she was still, at that time she was at home.  She was doing some things from the house, a little bit of working from the house and working with the children, and teaching the children and educating them at the house, and homeschooling my youngest daughter [Blaire Anderson], my young daughter, my only daughter.  And we could not figure out, I could not figure out she could multitask with all the kids.  I mean, how did she do all that and still be able to work with the other kids, bottle feed, eat, and this and that?  And I just couldn't, it just didn't, I said it's got to be something better than that.
Story_ID: 402657
Speaker 1: We were talking about the Gabriel [Gabriel Feeding Pad]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so basically, you know, at this point I'm trying to figure out exactly how to, how can we, how Raquel [Raquel Lett-Anderson] is multitasking, how she's doing all the things that she's doing in the house.  She's able to multitask, she's able to work with the other children, eat while the baby is eating.  It was just, you know, I'm always gone all the time, I'm in the salon [Styles by San Antonio, Decatur, Georgia] all day.  So I wasn't able to work with my kids myself.  But to me, that innovative side came up.  Well, why can't we come up with a way that we can bottle feed, and then we can still multitask; we can still get on the computer, we can still eat while the baby is eating, and we can still be intimate with the baby.  We're not putting the baby down or propping up a bottle.  So, we can hold the baby and then we can still bottle feed, and the actual pad will be holding the bottle itself.  And I couldn't understand why we couldn't develop a product like that.  So, what I began to do is work on a prototype.  And I began to look at some of the things that I had on.  I had a burp cloth over my shoulder, and I said, "Well, why can't we just use a burp cloth, and take the bottle itself and take some Velcro and wrap it around the bottle."  It was just that simple; it was the simplest prototype.  And to think that it was--you know, we were kind of nervous about it, because it was just so simple.  And so I'll never forget, one day after we made the prototype, the first prototype, Raquel called me at the salon.  And she said, "My God," she said, "We need to figure out a way that we can get this on the market."  She said, "This thing really works."  She said, "I'm able to walk around the house and feed Christian [Christian Anderson].  If I'm in the midst of trying to eat, he can eat.  If I need to get on the computer--if I need to do some things and need that free hand, I can do that."  And that's one of the things--that was the popular thing that the product allowed you to do; it allows you to have a free hand.  So that way, you wouldn't have to hold the bottle and hold the baby at the same time.  Or, you didn't have to what doctors don't like for you to do, and that is prop the bottle up and put the baby off to the side.  So we came up with a product that will allow you to still hold and caress the baby, but the apparatus itself held the bottle, and you could do whatever you had to do.  And so, at that time I called my mother [Linda Johnson] over.  So, she's coming back in the picture again.  And I called her over one night, and I told her that we had a great idea.  And you know, everybody said, "Oh, Lord, here we go again."  So she came over, she was a good sport about it.  And she could sew very well.  And I'll never forget, she stayed until three o'clock in the morning.  We were working out patterns, and how it could work and how it could look.  And so we came up with a pattern over the shoulder that draped over the back and came back over the front.  And that was curving across the neck, and that held the bottle with the Velcro pieces.  And Raquel came up with a lot of new great ideas that allowed the elastic to hold the bottle on the inside, and the pocket to hold the bottle cap.  At that time we had a musical module on the inside that you could press that played, I think it was 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.'  So, it was a very nice piece.  And so from there, my mother began to make several different generations of the product itself.  I mean we went from a little bitty burp cloth to some really nice elaborate pieces.  And we had it weighted on the back, so that way if you had to walk around, it stayed balanced on your shoulder.
Story_ID: 402658
Speaker 1: I'll never forget, we was at the Piccadilly one day.  And we was eating, and this was pretty much what got us going here.  Sometimes you have to see if your idea really is good outside the marketplace, outside of the household.  And so, Christian [Christian Anderson] began to cry, and I took the latest version that my mother [Linda Johnson] had made.  And I put it over my shoulder, grabbed him and began to bottle feed him, and I went back to eating my food.  And this lady came over and she was like, "My God," she said, "I have never seen anything like that."  She said, "Can I, I need to get two of those.  Did you get those at the nearest Walmart?"  And when she said that, I said, "We're on, we're in business now."  (Laughter) And so from there, we--where are we?  We knew we had a product [Gabriel Feeding Pad].  We knew that we had a long way to go to get it on the marketplace, because with all the knowledge that we had gained over the years with the other innovations, we knew what to do and what not to do.  We knew how to raise money, we knew how to assemble a team together.  And with my wife's [Raquel Lett-Anderson] background, she knew how to market a product.
Story_ID: 402659
Speaker 1: So, what we ended up doing, we knew we needed to get the product [Gabriel Feeding Pad] in a more professional manner.  So we needed to find a manufacturer for the product, someone that could make it and make it on a mass level.  And so we went on the Internet, we accessed the Internet and we actually put in contract source.  So we were looking for some people that could sew, but that could sew on a massive level, maybe five or six hundred a mo- we thought that was a lot, five or six hundred pieces a month.  And so we had about five people that actually came up during that time.  But we chose one guy that was out of Colorado.  And the reason why we chose him was because he had a background in developing baby products.  And so I had one of my clients who, her name was Alicia Watson [ph.], who flew out to meet with this guy.  And she went out and she volunteered to go out to talk with him.  And so she went out there and began to talk with him, because I knew she could handle the business for me.  It was a little early for me to go out there.  We needed to make sure that it was someone we felt like could do the job.  And so from there, he began to share some of the things that he could do, some of the products that he had developed over the years.  And he told Alicia that he would make a production piece for us, and he made it and he mailed it back to us.  And it was very nice, a nice pattern.  And he took our prototype pieces, all the different generations that my mother [Linda Johnson] made, he took that and put it into like more of a commercialized, store-bought piece that would look like something coming from Babies "R" Us, or something like that.
Story_ID: 402660
Speaker 1: And so from there, we knew we ha- we knew we had a good product [Gabriel Feeding Pad].  We knew we had something, and so we needed to go back, we needed money.  And so we went to some of the old things that we knew; we knew how to raise money.  My wife [Raquel Lett-Anderson] knows how to raise money; that was her background.  And so we called in some friends, some clients, and some family members, and had everybody meet at my shop.  And when we did that, we actually--I got with my graphics guy, and we put together a professional package.  We put together all the numbers and whatever it would take to make the money.  And I will never forget, I'll never forget this day.  We actually had all these people come up there.  Well, we planned for all of these people to come up there.  They had a storm that broke out on Candler Road, I mean in the DeKalb County [Georgia] area.  And I knew, I told my wife, I said, "This ain't nothing but the devil here."  And actually, on the news they said specifically on Candler Road it was a storm that was extremely bad.  So we get up there, and all the people are supposed to come in at six o'clock.  And the lights was out, the power was out, doors were flying open, and it was just a bad storm.  And I was like, "Oh, my God," you know, and that's the devil talking to you now.  "Yeah, you done spent all this money, and you get all these folks and you put this thing together."  And I'm saying, "My God, what are we going to do here?"  And it's about 6:30, and nobody's coming in.  And I said, "My God."  And so, I began to drop my head a little bit.  And we had all this food and all this stuff together, because we really needed to raise this money, because we're out there in the deep now.  And so we had, two people came, that actually walked into my shop, two of my clients.  And they came in and they was all excited still, and they began to talk.  And the lights are out at this time still.  And then we began to talk, and then we had, two more people came in, two come in.  And we began to talk with them, and we're still in the dark.  And they said, "Well, let's just go ahead and do the presentation."  And I was like, "Wow, look at their face."  And I said, "You know what, I'll do this presentation in the dark."  And we did that presentation in the dark, and the lights popped back on.  And we got a few more stragglers come in, but we had nowhere near the number that we had anticipated to come in.  And my wife's brother is an attorney, so he was on the legal side of the business.  And after we finished the meeting, the different people who wanted to invest their money, they went into another room.  And I'll never forget J [J. Lett], that's his name, my wife's brother who is an attorney, he came out of the room.  And he looked like he had seen a ghost or something.  I said, "What's wrong with you?  You all right, man?"  And he said, "Man, you won't believe this."  I said, "What's wrong?"  He said, "We'll down, low a little bit, but I can tell you this.  We raised more money than we anticipated with all the people that we were looking to come."  I said, "Boy, look at God, look at the Lord work."  The Lord, He worked that thing out, where we were in a situation with the power--it was hopeless.  We raised more money with that group of small people than we anticipated with all of them.
Story_ID: 402661
Speaker 1: We got a little money, and so now we're trying to--we got our prototype, we've got our production piece.  And so Raquel [Raquel Lett-Anderson] said, "Now we've got to, we need to take this product on the road."  And so we found a show that travels, called American Baby Faire.  And so her suggestion was to take it on the road and try to find out who our market--find out who's our market potential, our price points, price positioning--things that we needed to adjust on the product before we began to hit the big boys, the big stores.  So we went--well, actually before that we tried to hit some of the big guys, but it wasn't, the timing wasn't good.  So, we went ahead and started doing the American Baby Faire trade shows.  And we was attending--I think they had about ten or those, or eight of those, and we attended at six or seven of those.  And this show is a, the American Baby Faire is a trade show that travels from Miami [Florida] to Flor- Miami to Chicago [Illinois], Boston [Massachusetts], New Jersey, Dallas [Texas], all over.  And it brings in about twenty thousand people--pregnant moms, moms to be, grandparents--everybody comes in to see the latest in the baby products.  So I went from doing hair to the baby business.  And so we began to travel, and we took the product on the road.  And we would get on the airplane and we had a nice, elaborate setup.  But we had everything on the airplane.  I mean we had all of our--we had a hundred and fifty pads that we had packed all night long here in this room here.  So we're packing the pads, putting them inside the insertables, and getting ready, because we were getting ready to do a show the next day.  And so we would take all that product and put it in these big bags.  So we had, we would carry about three hundred and something pounds of luggage through the airport, big bags, everything, because we couldn't afford to ship it forward or have big crates and somebody to do stuff.  So we had, we had to find out ways on how to cut corners.  And so we got all this stuff on the airplane, and we began to travel to different shows.  And now, at that time, I was taking a lot of time out from the shop [Styles by San Antonio, Decatur, Georgia].  And so, we actually did a show in Dallas, we did a show in Miami, Boston, New Jersey.  And a good, high percentage of the shows, we sold out everything that we had.  I mean, the Gabriel Feeding Pad was selling very well.
Story_ID: 402662
Speaker 1: And so, when we got back we decided, we said, "Well, you know, it's time for us to try to introduce it to the stores.  Let's make our shot at the stores."  So we began to really concentrate heavily on Babies "R" Us, because we knew that if you got a baby product, you needed to try to get it into Babies "R" Us stores.  And for some reason when we sent our first prototype, I mean our first packaging layout to the buyer, she just, they shot us down.  And I tried to talk to her over the telephone and tell her that we were doing these shows.  And she said, "Well, this is not an item that we would probably want to carry."  And I said, "Okay."  And so I said, "My God, we're back at square one again.  Here we are, we've sold the product all over, and we get to the buyer and the buyer shoots us down."  And I just said, I was just telling her, "I just can't believe it.  I just can't believe that the buyer would shoot us down like that."  And we tried to convince her, and this and that.  And so from there, after the buyer shot us down, we began to--we were stagnant at that point.  Because we had a lot of production in my shop, we had a lot of pieces, and Gabriel Feeding Pads all over my downstairs.  Because we were using the bottom part of my salon [Styles by San Antonio, Decatur, Georgia] as the office; my wife [Raquel Lett-Anderson] was using the salon as her office space.  And we were packed there, we were packed here at the house.  And so we could not figure out why we could not get the buyer--why that buyer would not take our product, specifically with Babies "R" Us.  And so from there we began to really try to figure out, what we, where are we right now?  And so we got in a slump, and the buyer said they weren't interested at all.  They were saying that they weren't interested at all.  So pretty much that's it, you know.  We did all this for this--to get to this point and the store's not going to take you in.  So I'll never forget, I was in my salon and I was doing hair.  And I have this--in the waiting room at that time, I had a big presentation piece that showed how the product was feeding.  And I was looking at that product, and the Lord showed me another thing.  He showed me something.  I kept looking at it, I kept looking at it, and I said "Okay," said, "Okay, Lord."  He said, "Make it a breakaway.  Make the product a breakaway."  And I said, "Now, what in the world, a breakaway?"  So we knew that if we had to introduce--Raquel that if we had to get the buyer's interest, we needed to have a product that would service 100 percent of the market, because you had mothers that was nursing and bottle feeding.  See, but our product that we had, we were just bottle feeding.  So the buyers did not want an item that was just bottle feeding.  They needed something that was going to be a little bit more creative I guess at that time.  So I began to look at it, and I said, "Why can't we--," and I said, "Why don't we make the product--?"  So the Lord showed me how to take that product and make the front piece breakaway with Velcro at the top--make a breakaway from the back piece.  So you still have that back piece, and you can change out the panels.  In other words, if you're a bottle feeding mom, you use the bottle feeding portion of it.  If you're a nursing mom, you had a nursing cover that connects to the front of it.  And that covers you up if you were out in the public, or if you were out in the mall, if you were at church or whatever.  And if you just needed some privacy, if you needed to nurse right where you are, you could cover up at that particular point.  And it had pockets on it.  We designed it where it has a reversible side, where it has a burping side on it that absorbs if the baby, when the baby begins to spit up, or what have you.  And so, we began to really take the product to a whole other level.  So we changed it, we took- we called it the Gabriel Feeding Pad Break-Away.
Story_ID: 402663
Speaker 1: So now, we've got a product [Gabriel Feeding Pad Break-Away] that is servicing 100 percent of the market.  So, Raquel [Raquel Lett-Anderson] said, "We got to go back and test the market again."  So we go back and we get a few shows, and we sell out of everything that we got.  And I'll never forget one show that we were at in New Jersey.  And Babies "R" Us is in New Jersey.  And we're selling the product, boom, boom, I mean we're really moving a lot of product.  And the lady that was next door to us in her booth, she used to work for Babies "R" Us stores as an assistant buyer.  And so we get, we get word that Marcia Costello, who is the top buyer for Babies "R" Us, who controls a huge million doll- multimillion dollar purse string--we did not know she was there.  But we was told that sometimes she floats these particular shows.  This is the same buyer that turned us down the first time.  So we get there, and after the show we get back home and we decide that we needed to do a buyer's show.  And this is different from a consumer show.  And so I called Marcia Costello up, and I told her that we were going to be at the JPMA show [Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association], which is a buyers show, and that I'd like to get a meeting with her and try to show her our product.  And she said, "Fine, that's okay."  And come to find out, we found out that she was standing there watching us sell our product during that time.  So she saw the actual product sell.  So she saw the product selling, and then once before, prior to that, we did a show in Miami [Florida], that's where Raquel had us do a test show.  I mean, not in Miami, but--yeah, we were in Miami, we did a test show in Miami.  And what happened was we found out that the president of Toys "R" Us, which owns Babies "R" Us, was floating this show, and that he was--we had a girl that ran up to Raquel and said, "He is coming down your way.  He's a very distinguished guy, a white guy.  And you will know him when you see him.  And he's walking with a partner."  And, so this is the president of Toys "R" Us, this is the big guy and assis- one of the VPs.  And the only reason why he was there is because he was there for a golf tournament.  So, he decided he would float one of the baby shows.  So he came around our booth, and Raquel goes up to him.  For some reason he just slowed down at our booth there, and Raquel ran up to him and began to tell him about our product.  And she began to nail him.  She was telling him everything about how it works, what it can do, and blah, blah, blah, all the things that we were trying to do to get it into the stores.  And he was just nodding his head, that's all I could see, because I was working with another customer.  And so, she gave him a brochure of our product and everything, and he nodded his head and walked off.  And the president of Toys "R" Us took that product, took that brochure from Miami back to New Jersey, and hand-delivered it to Marcia Costello, back to Marcia Costello.  And at that point, I called Marcia Costello up and said, "We need a meeting."  And she said, "Okay, it's my understanding you met with the president," and blah, blah, blah.  And so we met with the president, that she had met with the president. And so she said, "Okay, we'll give you a meeting at the JPMA show."
Story_ID: 402664
Speaker 1: So, mind you that we're working with the new product that we have, the breakaway [Gabriel Feeding Pad Break-Away] at this point that serves the entire market.  We went all over the country, we were selling the product, and we got a new version that we have out.  So we get there at the JPMA show [Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association] in Dallas [Texas].  And we meet with Marcia Costello, and she said, "Okay, it's possible, okay."  She didn't give us no word that we were going to get in, but you know, she'll consider it.  And I'm like, "Man, well, at least we got a consider."  It looked, at that point it really looked good.  So we were thinking that once they do their line reviews--and a line review is something that a buyer does each year to determine what products are going to go out, and what new products are going to go in.  And so, from there she said, "We're going to put you in the line review."  And the line review went on and on.  I mean, this is July, August, September, October.  And we just pretty much said, you know, we just thought that was it.  I mean didn't understand what in the world was going on.  Now here we are, we've met the president of the company.  And the line reviews were basically about over with; they were over.  And we had went over and we had sold the product all over the country.  The buyer saw us, you know, and she was able to see the product sell.  And we couldn't understand why they could not, they could not end this line review, and why she was not going to consider us to go into the Babies "R" Us stores.  So what happened then, at my shop [Styles by San Antonio, Decatur, Georgia] I was doing hair, and actually I was doing my wife's hair.  And Raquel [Raquel Lett-Anderson] said, "That's it."  She said, "We've got to walk away from this thing."  She said, "We have, we've did it all.  We've been all over the market, we've revamped the product, we've met the president of the company, and the buyer is still just, just, they're not going to take it.  It seems as though they're not going to take this particular item."  She said, "We just--that's it."  And I agreed, I said we need to walk away. And I'll never forget, my mother [Linda Johnson] to this day, she can't remember.  That's when she was, she's retired now but that's when she was working at my shop, she was running the nail salon.  So I went over to the nail side, and I told her, I said, "Mama, we're walking away, we're going to quit the product."  And to this day, she can't remember.  And so at that time I went downstairs in my office that Raquel was using down in the basement, and I began to pray.  And I was, I didn't say anything fancy, I was very candid with the Lord.  And I said, "Lord, I need to know today if it's for us to continue with this project.  And I need to know today what you want us to do.  If we're to continue, please just let me know."  So I get home, I come in and Raquel is sitting on the sofa.  And she's crying, I could tell she had been crying, because you know, we--that's it, you know, we walked away.  And we spent a ton of money at that time.  And so I began to come into the kitchen and I began to eat.  And after that, I began to do the dishes.  And the Holy Spirit told me to hit the answering service.  So I hit the answering service, and it said, "This is 'The Oprah Winfrey Show.'  We want to fly you guys out to be on the show."  And that's when this house--it's about twelve o'clock at night, but this house exploded.  I mean we were running around the house and jumping up and down, because we knew we were back on at that point.  And so, from there we ended up going on her show.  And it was amazing how when we got up there--it was really amazing.  Because we got there, and we found out that ten thousand people had applied to get on that show, that same show.
Story_ID: 402665
Speaker 1: Had you actually applied for the show?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened was we had--and we had no faith in it.  To show you how much faith we had in it--because we had a friend of ours who was on her website who said that Oprah [Oprah Winfrey] was doing a show called "The Million Dollar Mom" [sic. "The Million Dollar Idea Challenge"].  And she said, "Raquel [Raquel Lett-Anderson], you're the millionaire mom, you can make this thing."  She said, "Please just do a tape for me."  Because she wanted to, Janice [ph.] at that time was doing our PR [public relations], and Janice is a great person, a great person.  And she said, "Raquel, you guys can do this."  And we--she called the next day, then the next day.  And we still haven't made that--she wanted us to make a little videotape.  And so, we actually made this little videotape for Raque- I mean for Janice, to satisfy her.  And once we made it, we went ahead and mailed it up to 'The Oprah Winfrey Show.'  But the next day, we quit.  That was the same day Raquel and I had the discussion that we were going to walk away from this thing [Gabriel Feeding Pad Break-Away].  And so we quit the same day we sent the tape off.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was it.  And then, so that night we got word that 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' had called.  And then we went up and we found out that ten thousand people applied to get on that show, and they flew up thirty.  So I said, "My God, the stress level is still here."  So it's thirty people up there that they flew up.  Only seven can make the show. Seven (unclear) final number.  So I told Raquel, I said, "Oh my, I mean we got to compete."  And then we get up here and find out that it's great to be up here, but now we find out that we got to compete against these thirty people to get on her show.  I was like, "Oh, God."  And so we began to do the presentation and everything.  And then the judges came back.  They had the president of QVC and some of Oprah's top producers.  And they came out to let everybody know who was the top--who was going to be the seven people that were going to meet Oprah and actually appear on the stage.  And they called, they got to number three, and they got to number four and that was us, and we jumped up and down.  And so we knew we was there.  And then about, I think the end of that month, that show aired.  And the buyer for Babies "R" Us called us twenty minutes before the show was getting ready to air, and said "Antonio [HistoryMaker Antonio Anderson], we're looking for your product.  Could you send it to us?  We're trying to figure out what we're going to do with it."  So, it's twenty minutes before the show aired that we got the call, after we had done all that--that we got the call to be on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show.'  And it was a great show.  And Raquel did her job.  She went up there and she did a fabulous job as far as doing the presentation and showing how the product works, because that's what she do, she's good at that.
Story_ID: 402666
Speaker 1: And so from there we was into a situation where now we are getting ready to go into the major store.
Speaker 2: Did you tell the buyer that you were on 'The Oprah Show' ['The Oprah Winfrey Show'] with the product [Gabriel Feeding Pad Break-Away]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually when we were in Chicago [Illinois], we called the buyer to let her know, but we couldn't get in contact with her.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I left a message to let her know, "Marcia [Marcia Costello], we're going to be on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show.'"  But see, a lot of things--a buyer knows that people will call and tell them all kinds of stuff to try to get them to make a decision with their products, and sometimes things never take place.  And so we never did hear back from Marcia that day.  And we called her, and so we left a message to let her know that we were going to be on the show.  And so twenty minutes before, here again, twenty minutes before the show aired, she called us to let us know that they're looking, they're considering putting our product into the store [Babies "R" Us].  And so, they actually gave us the PO, not the PO, but the VIN number.  The VIN number in the retail business is like a contract.  If you get a VIN number, you're in.  And so we got the VIN number the latter part of that year.  But then our biggest challenge at that time was how are you going to supply all these stores?  So we had to figure (laughter)--so now we're in a situation of how are we going to finance--we've got to bring over a container.  So now we're getting into doing stuff overseas now.  And so the good thing about the manufacturer that we had in Colorado, Bill Patterson [ph.], who was a great guy, he had the capability to go overseas to price our product, to get price points on our product overseas to see if it could, to try to get the best points for it, to get the best pricing for the product itself.  And so, Bill did that.  But the problem was we had to come up with quite a bit of money, about eighty or ninety-something thousand dollars to bring in our first container.  Because you just can't bring, you just can't bring over six hundred pieces.  You've got to bring in container loads of product.  So now, you're really dealing with the big boys at this point.  And (laughter) so we didn't, we just didn't know.  We scraped up some money.  I came with some, and Herman [Anderson's stepfather, Herman Johnson] came up with some, and we scraped up probably half of it, a little over half of that.  And I'll never forget, Bill called me and said, "Antonio [HistoryMaker Antonio Anderson], do you have the rest of the money?  Do you have the other twenty-one, twenty-something thousand--right at twenty thousand dollars?"  And I didn't want to disappoint him, and I said, "Yeah, we got it, Bill, okay."  And I was working on a client's head while I was talking to Bill, and she overheard what I said.  And when I got off the phone she said, "Well, how much money do you need?"  And I said, I'm saying to myself, "I don't think you got that kind of money."  And she said, "How much money do you need?"  And I said, "We need about twenty-something thousand dollars."  She said, "Have your attorney meet us.  And we will, we will meet you at your attorney's office, and I'll give you the money that you need."
Story_ID: 402667
Speaker 1: You were just telling me about your client that agreed to give you the money so that you can get the product [Gabriel Feeding Pad Break-Away] manufactured.  But, just go back a second and just explain the idea of 'The Oprah Winfrey Show.'  It was, what was the name of the show changed to?  And what was the prize supposed to be?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the actual show, the original show, was going to be called "The  Million Dolla- Millionaire Mom" [sic. "The Million Dollar Idea Challenge"], and they changed the show once we got up there to the Inventio- I mean the "The Million Dollar Invention Challenge" [sic.].  Okay, and then from there the whole nature of the show was designed to bring in some inventors so they can explore their idea, show their idea off to the market, to the various audience, and the audience would make a decision.  And the prize would be for that individual to go to QVC to sell their product on there for about twenty or thirty minutes, which is a pretty good prize--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and have exposure on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show.'
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the exposure really did help you launch the product?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Story_ID: 402668
Speaker 1: So tell me what happened after you received the money to get the product [Gabriel Feeding Pad Break-Away] manufactured.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so one of our biggest challenges at that time was to try--we're now trying to bring the product from overseas.  And so, we had to make sure the manufacturer knew how to make our product correctly, because now we're dealing with different cultures now.  And so, we had to send various samples over to China, so that China can duplicate exactly what we had.  And so from there, they was able to send us different samples to show us exactly what they had duplicated, before they're getting ready to make the mass--the ten to fifteen thousand pieces.  And so the unbelievable thing is that they actually can, they duplicate stuff unbelievable, the exac- I mean unbelievable.  So, they did just that.  And so we were able to bring our first container load over and supply all of, probably at that time, two hundred and about twenty-something stores, Babies "R" Us stores across the country.  And so from there, we put a call in to the producers at 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' to let them know that because of us appearing on her show, that we had so many people that called us, so many people who e-mailed us and wanted to know exactly how to get their ideas going, and how to get their products on the marketplace, and because of that we're now in Babies "R" Us stores because of being on her show.  We have the buyer and now we're in all 220 stores; we're getting ready to roll into all 220 stores.  So that was probably in January, and we had done the show in October.
Speaker 1: Now this is now 2003, or 2004?
Speaker 2: This is now 2004.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we, we just wanted to let the producers know that we were thanking 'The Oprah Winfrey Show,' and to let them know that because of all the, because of the exposure that we had on our product, we are now prepared to go into all the Babies "R" Us stores.  And the producers got so excited about that, and they called us back about a month later and they asked us, "It's our understanding that you guys are getting ready to go into all the Babies "R" Us stores."  And we told them that's correct.  And they said, "We want you guys to come back to let the people know across the country about the great success that took place here."  And so they told us the name of show was "Quirky Ways of How People Have Gotten Rich."  And I told the producer, I said, "Well, we haven't gotten rich.  I just want to let you know,"  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Not yet anyway (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And--that's exactly what she said.  She said, "Not yet."  But I said--she said, "Well, we want you guys to come on the show, because now you're getting ready to go into Babies "R" Us stores, and that is what we want to hear.  And we want you guys to come tell everybody."  And so, we went on that show at the end of February.
Story_ID: 402669
Speaker 1: Raquel [Raquel Lett-Anderson] got a chance to, she got a chance to tell everybody about the great success and all the e-mails--we got hundreds and hundreds of e-mails from all over the country, all over the world.  I mean we got e-mails from England to Australia, parts of Africa, all over the world.  People wanted to know exactly how to get their products on the market, and how did we get on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show,' or thanking us and telling us how they're so proud of us, and they really like the concept of the product of the Gabriel Feeding Pad [Gabriel Feeding Pad Break-Away], and they really think it's a great idea.  And I have never in my life seen so many e-mails come in like that, it was unbelievable.  And even after we, when the show aired on the Oprah Winfrey--once that show aired, on our website we had so many hits it was unbelievable to see the numbers grow like that.  And so if you, (laughter) if a person has a product and they get it on her show, it can make a huge difference.
Speaker 2: Did you get any e-mails from people wanting your product in any other countries?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  We got products, here again, from people from Australia who wanted to sell our product.  It's so complicated when you start talking about shipping it back from one country--made in one country and back to another country.  There's ways it has to be done.  So we had so many people call us to let us know that they wanted to sell our product.  They wanted to know how can they buy it.  They saw it on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show,' and can they get it in their country?  And then we had people in the States here who wanted to know exactly how did we got on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show,' and that they have a great idea and what can they do to get their product on the marketplace?  But we had more calls from that end.  Because when we went on the second time, we were letting people know exactly where you can get the product from, where you could get it.  You would be able to get it in the spring, this spring of 2004, and you'll be able to get it in all Babies "R" Us stores.  People knew exactly where to get the item.  We had more people call us on the second show to let us know exactly how--I have an idea, what can I do, how do I--what are the steps to get my product from my head to the marketplace?  Or how do I do the patent process?  Or how do I do this?  Or how--or the prototype stage, and things of that nature.  People wanted to know how to get their ideas to the marketplace, because they could tell that we were just simple everyday people.  And they wanted to get an understanding of how to do that.
Story_ID: 402670
Speaker 1: So your product [Gabriel Feeding Pad Break-Away] hits Babies "R" Us?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And, and what happens?  Does it begin to sell well?  Do you go into other stores?
Speaker 2: Yes.  When the product--we--here again, when we aired on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show,' once the product hit their distribution centers, the product sold so well.  The Babies "R" Us carries seven DCs [distribution centers] across this country, and they're huge.  But we cleaned out their DCs the first week that the product aired.  We cleaned out all of the product that was in their distribution centers.  So that was letting us know that it was doing extremely well, and the buyers knew that it was doing extremely well.  And that first four or five months, I mean we probably did over 250,000 dollars in sales just within that range of time.  And so on that road, and going and looking at those projections, we knew that it was very easy to make this product a multimillion dollar project; it wasn't going to be a problem at all.  And so we had various people begin to, various different brokers began to call us to try to get us into other stores.  And from there, we had one broker who called us, especially from the second show, "Quirky Ways People Have Gotten Rich."  We had one of the brokers from Target [Target Corporation], and he said "Well, I'll try."  Target is one of the hardest places to get into, to crack.  And so, he was able to introduce me to the buyer, and the buyer actually put it on target.com, which pretty much is the same thing.  They consider it a store, but it's just that they're testing the product to see if they want to put it in all fifteen hundred stores, which is a little bit different from Babies "R" Us stores.  And so, we got Target, which was good.  Because at that time we just didn't have the inventory to handle a Target, and so it was best for us to handle a target.com, because we knew that, you know, eventually the stores would come.
Story_ID: 402671
Speaker 1: And then from there we had another buyer who called us, I mean another broker called us fro- for Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.].  And he called us and said he could get a meeting with one of the buyers, which is very hard to get a meeting with one of the buyers at Walmart too.  And so he set everything up for us, and we went down, flew down to Bentonville, Arkansas and we met with the buyer for that particular category.  And he thought the timing was perfect for us to try to look at perhaps getting it to Walmart stores.  And so months went by, because you have to go through their line reviews.  And so, he decided that he wanted to do a test with the item [Gabriel Feeding Pad Break-Away].  And that's when he went ahead and put it on walmart.com.  And they--from there, the product itself has just been selling extremely well.  And so, now we're in a position now where we're trying to figure out--we know that the stores are getting ready to come, and you're talking about four to five thousand stores.  And when you're talking about that amount of stores, with that amount of inventory--just applying that, you'd have to start out with sixty thousand pieces just to supply Walmart alone.  And you need a million dollars just to supply Walmart by itself.  And so we know that the potential right here is unbelievable.  And so we are in a position now where we're trying to evaluate how we're going to roll into--from, from two thousand--how we're gonna roll into 2007.

Speaker 1: But at the same time we got a little bit more exposure the following year after 2004 to 2005, where we had People magazine to call us.  And I didn't know who it was when they called at the salon [Styles by San Antonio, Decatur, Georgia].  I didn't really take it that serious.  And when they called she said she was the editor, but I didn't believe it, because you know, it just didn't seem right.  And so I told her to give me her name and all her information, and I would call her back.  And so I went downstairs and Googled her right quick, and I found out that she was the top person (laughter).  And so they came out and we did a big shoot.  But they wanted to focus it more from Raquel's [Raquel Lett-Anderson] standpoint, because she had a huge part in developing the Gabriel Feeding Pad [Gabriel Feeding Pad Break-Away] also.  And so they wanted to develop this, they wanted to shoot this from the mom's standpoint.  And so they did a very nice shot, they photographed the entire family.  And I think the funny part about it is they actually put my youngest son Christian [Christian Anderson], who the product is named after, they put him on top of the console that we have in our office area.  And they shot him up there, and it just really made it look really, really, really, exciting how they did that.

Speaker 1: So the other part of the business, you were saying that people were sending you e-mails wanting to know how to get in the business.  You and your wife then developed a marketing plan and wrote a book.  Tell us about the book, and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and how you, about the seminars that you do, teaching people.
Speaker 2: Yeah, one of the--well, we decided we had so many people who called in from 'The Oprah Winfrey Show,' and from all the--People magazine.  I mean, people were just--we get e-mails, tons of e-mails today.
Speaker 1: Right. Right.
Speaker 2: And from there we, and from the recommendation from the Op- from one of the producers of 'The Oprah Winfrey Show,' they said why don't you guys just do a book?  So I told Raquel [Raquel Lett-Anderson], I said, "Okay, let's do this thing.  Let's just--."  So Raquel nailed herself down for quite a few months, and she took away from work and what have you, and she wrote the book called 'Take it to the Market! The Invention Process Made Easy' [Antonio Anderson and Raquel Lett-Anderson] because we wanted to break down seven key steps that would show an independent inventor how to get their product to the marketplace, from having an idea in their head all the way to getting it onto store shelves.  And that's where the book came from.  And from out of book, we spinned off a take to the market, the invention process workshops.  And we had our first workshop test presentation that we did back in February of last year.  And we had people that came from all over the country that attended the workshop.  And so, we're getting ready to gear up for a lot of those, starting in 2007.  And so that's where we are really right now.  We're doing, we're preparing for the 2007 Take it to the Market! workshops as well as the 'Take it To the Market!' book, and trying to ready ourselves for a lot of, for the big stores and what we're getting ready to get into.
Story_ID: 402674
Speaker 1: So, are you excited about (laughter) going into, going to the next level with your product?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  And we're excited about it, because we have, I have other things that are waiting on the backburner that are spin-offs of the same product.  We actually have the patents on them already.  We've tested the prototypes, and so we have other items that are spin-offs of the Gabriel Feeding Pads.  And those are some of the things that we're going to be looking at perhaps in the upcoming year, as well as some of the other things that we want to do with the company itself.
Speaker 1: So, the producer that--when you, you told her you weren't rich then.  Do you believe that your product now will make you rich, or has made you rich?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, no doubt about it.  We are in a situation now where, here again, I'm having to have to move away--in 2007 I'm going to have to move away from--make some decisions from the salon [Styles by San Antonio, Decatur, Georgia], because there's two things happening at the same time.  And even though I'm going to do a gradual rollout with that, with the salon--with the Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.] account and the Target [Target Corporation]--all the other major--because we have all the big boys that's sitting out there--the product is easily, it's going to do well over--I mean we have projections of well over $20-something million.  And it's really not that hard at all when you start looking at the fact that when Walmart came in--and Walmart's a very hard store to get into also.  It's not as easy as a lot of people think it is.  And most buyers want you to be somewhere before they--no one wants to test--no one wants to test your product--no one wants to be the guinea pig or the testing sample.
Story_ID: 402675
Speaker 1: Well, it's been a real interesting (laughter) road for you.  What message or lessons do you have for your children?  Just listening to you talk about starting your invention process at such a young age, what message do you have for your children?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I go back to that one passage that I have in the Bible.  And it's Philippians, here again, it's Philippians 1:6.  And that is, "Being confident is one thing, but he that has begun a good work in you shall perform it to the day of Christ."  And so, I let my kids know that the Lord has begun a good work, and be confident that he has begun a good work in you, and know that he's going to perform it.  And there are going to be some valleys and some high places and some low places, but know that he is going to, he is going to perform what he started.  And there's also a scripture that I talk about, and that is the blessing of the Lord, "The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he adds no sorrow to it" [Proverbs 10:22].  And that word rich, the Bible definition for rich is wholeness.  And that's what a lot of people don't understand, is wholeness.  You want to be whole in every area of your life.
Speaker 1: Through this process, has this made your faith stronger?
Speaker 2: Extremely stronger.  Right now, my fellowship with the Lord is daily.  And I know that He is, He is my guidance, and I know that I rely on Him to lead me in all, to lead me in all truth.  And I rely on the Holy Spirit to guide me daily.
Story_ID: 402676
Speaker 1: Tell me, what do you want your legacy to be?  I know you're young and you might not think about it, but--have, really have not had a lot of thought.  But if you think about it right now, what do you think you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I want my, I want to be remembered as someone who really began to think about--it turned out not to be about myself.  It turned out to be about others, and it's just what, it's just not about you.  And going through the entire process, I was able to find out that the Lord set everything up and positioned us the way he positioned us so that we can begin to help other people in what they're doing.  So, it's not about you.  Once you come out of the framework of understanding that it's not all about you. So I want to be remembered as thinking about other people, and that it, that my focus began to move and to gravitate toward other people, and what can I do for them and how can I help them?  That's what I want to be remembered by.
Speaker 1: Okay. Is there anything that we, that you might want to talk about that we haven't talked about?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think I covered quite a bit (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think that we covered quite a bit.  And it's exciting.  It's exciting to be, you know, to be a part of The HistoryMakers.  I think it's a great honor, and to be recognized with some of the other great people that I've been able to see from The HistoryMakers.  And it's exciting, and it's a great honor.  And I'm very, very elated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, with that, we want to thank you for taking the time to share your story with us.  And know that it has found a place in history, and that the future generations will get, will draw strength from, from your story.
