Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --interview.
Story_ID: 667309
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I am going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side [Wilson Copeland, Sr.], but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Yes, Gwendolyn, G-W-E-N-D-O-L-Y-N, Juanita, J-U-A-N-I-T-A, Charleston, C-H-A-R-L-E-S-T-O-N, Copeland, C-O-P-E-L-A-N-D [Gwendolyn Charleston Copeland].
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: May--you asked me, because I have a lot of May birthdays--May 24, 1917 and I hope I get my father's right.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family, how, how far back can you trace them?  What were they doing you know, in Ann Arbor?
Speaker 2: My mother was the only daughter at that time, only child of her parents and my grandfather [James Charleston] was an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] minister, so he was pastor of Bethel A.M.E. Church in Ann Arbor, had been transferred there from the Ohio area having graduated from Wilberforce college [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and seminary in that area and had been transferred to Michigan with his very new wife [Nora Charleston].  They married and nine months later had my mother and their roots were in Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay so your, your mother's side of the family has roots in Georgia, do you know what part of Georgia?
Speaker 2: Yes, starting off first in Shack, Georgia which is, which no longer exist but was part of the greater Columbus, Muscogee County area in southwest Georgia.  That piece of area, that particular area my grandmother, my great-grandmother, Sarah Ann Gaines [Sarah Gaines Charleston], who's part of the Gaines family owned six hundred acres of land in Shack, Georgia after the Civil War by eminent domain the U.S. government took the land, paid them for the land and that became Fort Benning, Georgia.  So their land was transformed into what is now a [U.S.] military base and there is actually a sign on the base, a street sign called Gaines Circle in commemoration for my family, so those--that's the roots, those are the roots of my mother's father's side of the family.
Speaker 1: Now let me just ask, is there a story about how that much land was acquired by black folks after the Civil War?  This is, there's got to be a story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I don't know the extent of that story but I have a, a cousin in my family who lives in Chicago [Illinois] who's been doing a lot of research, we have a family reunion every other year and I would imagine they for whatever reason were able to parcel together money, perhaps there was some land given to them, maybe part of the forty acres and a mule deal and they were able to leverage that money, but they actually ended up with six hundred acres of land; obviously not six hundred at the end of the Civil War, they probably started off with a very small parcel.  There were fourteen children in that family and many of the family members just stayed on the land and they probably just leveraged it, bought more land, but by the end of the 1800s when Fort Benning was going to be built they actually had to sell the land by eminent domain and took that money and put kids through college, right.
Speaker 1: Gee (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So that's my mother's mother side of the family--my mother's, my mother's father's side of the family.
Story_ID: 667310
Speaker 1: My mother's mother's [Nora Charleston] side of the family, that is the Branch [ph.] family.  I don't know as much about them and I'll go back and give you some information about the Gaines side of the family, but the Branch side of the family also from Georgia, including the Savannah, Georgia area, other parts of, of Georgia.  My grandmother, my great-grandmother who I did not know because she had passed away on my mother's side was biracial and grew up in Hamilton, Georgia.  Her father was the plantation owner and her mother was a slave woman and this man had two sets of families from what I have been told and my grandmother was the black side of the family and he probably had white children also, so that's the lineage I know.  I don't know much about that side of the family, but that's the Branch side of the family.  One of the Branch members though, the Batchelor-Branch family, one of my distant cousins on the same side of that family who now lives in Detroit [Michigan], was the first African American admitted into the Daughters of the American Revolution because her mother's side of the family, she is related to me on her father's side, her mother's could trace their roots back to the Revolutionary time and the Pilgrims time and that constituted her being allowed to be part of the DAR.  She was the first black member probably in the late '70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: So she had roots that (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Karen, Karen Batchelor [Karen Batchelor Farmer] is her name.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Her name is Karen Batchelor, so--
Speaker 2: Karen Batchelor had roots that went all the way back to--
Speaker 1: To the--
Speaker 2: --to the settlement of Massachusetts--
Speaker 1: Correct.
Speaker 2: --to the Pilgrims or Puritans--
Speaker 1: Correct.
Speaker 2: --of the 1600s?
Speaker 1: Correct, yes, yeah.
Speaker 2: So here we are in Massachusetts, here we are full circle--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 2: --too.
Speaker 1: Yes, in a way, yeah you can say that.
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: So she, that's the Batchelor side of the family and that was her mother's mother's side of the family, this is my grandmother, my again, maternal.
Speaker 2: This is all of your father's of your father's side.
Speaker 1: No, this is all on my mother's [Gwendolyn Charleston Copeland] side of the family.
Speaker 2: Your--okay, okay.
Speaker 1: All on my mother's side.
Speaker 2: The maternal side of your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 1: Now I'm talking about the maternal side of my mother's side.  The paternal side is the, the family that had the six hundred acres of land--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --the Gaines family, G-A-I-N-E-S.
Speaker 2: Okay, understood.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's the paternal side, okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  One aspect of the Gaines family, there are lots of things, with the Gaines family were sort of connected to the Thurgood Marshall family because we have roots in Baltimore [Maryland], that's another story.  We, our family owned a bank in Baltimore that just closed about five years ago, five or six years ago, one of those little small community banks, Ideal Savings Bank [Ideal Federal Savings Bank], I believe that was the name of it and in 1865, I believe that's the year, January, 1865 as Sherman [William Tecumseh Sherman] was burning down Georgia and he decided not to burn Savannah, my, one of my ancestors, Reverend William Gaines was actually in a meeting that was recorded with other leading black people in Savannah and they met with General Sherman to discuss the outcome of blacks once they were going to be freed.  I can pull that up online and show it to you, so it's, it's, it's Google searchable.  But there were about nineteen leaders and he was one of them, he represented the ministerial community, the minister in the community, in Savannah and that was--
Speaker 2: Was he A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] as well or--?
Speaker 1: He was not--he was part of the Methodist church because the A.M.E. church didn't get to the South until after the Civil War, for obvious reasons.  So it started--the A.M.E. church was started in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] by freed blacks and did not and then affiliated with the Methodist Episcopal churches in the South after the Civil War.
Speaker 2: The southern Methodists--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because they had split off because of slavery, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So that group lined up with the A.M.E. church after the Civil War, so Reverend Gaines was part of the Methodist Episcopal church I believe which ultimately became the, the A.M.E. church.
Story_ID: 667311
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I could go on and on (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, but it's great that you can, I mean there are so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --many people can't, they don't know nothing about what their, there is some block or some veer off where they don't, you know we, we all have the same amount of history--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --we just don't know it.
Speaker 1: Don't know it, don't know it, yeah; two, I have two bishops in the A.M.E. church [African Methodist Episcopal] who were my ancestors.  One was Wesley John Gaines, born around 1840 or so, use to hide his books so that the slave master wouldn't get them and had to hide them during the Civil War to make sure that they weren't taken away, but he eventually became a bishop in the A.M.E. church and was one of the co-founders of Morris Brown College in Atlanta [Georgia] and he's one of the anchor pinnings of our family and the reunion always honors him and then his nephew became a bishop, Abraham Lincoln Gaines in the early 20th century and I, when I go to Mother Bethel Church [Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] I see their pictures on the wall.
Speaker 2: So Abraham Lincoln Gaines was born maybe in the 1860s?
Speaker 1: No, let me see if I can pull it up on here, I may have it here on my, my phone, let's see.
Speaker 2: Well I don't want you to do that, to, to take the time to do that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but that's a, but that's--we've got his name.
Speaker 1: Sure, I can give that to you later, give you their--
Speaker 2: Sure, yeah, so they were both bishops of the A.M.E. church?
Speaker 1: They were both bishops in the A.M.E. church, right, right.
Speaker 2: So, now these were--
Speaker 1: And behind me on the wall are ancestral pictures too and I'll have other pictures on the wall that I'll share with you.  Yeah, I, I don't have the, the dates; I can get that to you later, right.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, so this is your, this is the maternal side of--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --you mother's [Gwendolyn Charleston Copeland] family?
Speaker 1: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 2: And yet her father [James Charleston] was an A.M.E. minister too?
Speaker 1: Yes, um-hm, right.
Speaker 2: So okay, on that side were they, was your grandfather following in the footsteps of other A.M.E. ministers on that side too, or--
Speaker 1: So my grandfather was because his father was the presiding elder.  He, I think he became a presiding elder, he was a minister, Reverend Charleston was his name and he was pretty sure he was a presiding elder, I'm not certain but he was an A.M.E. minister and he married Sarah Gaines [Sarah Gaines Charleston] and Sarah Gaines was the lineage with the six hundred acres of land and the Gaines family, right.  I, I'm not very certain of his roots, Reverend Charleston, but that, that part I do know.
Speaker 2: Okay, now did your grandparents meet at Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] or did they?
Speaker 1: No, they met at Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia].  My grandfather originally was doing his studies at Morris Brown and my grandmother [Nora Charleston] was a student there also.  I remember she use to play tennis and they met and fell in love.  He was a bit of a rebel and was upset that the president of Morris Brown didn't have a doctorate or something like that and got upset and left and transferred and went to Wilberforce, so that's how he ended up in Ohio.  She stayed, finished her schooling and became a teacher and they had a five year courtship and I have their letters.  I can't find them, but I do have, I have them here; but I have letters that they wrote each other between roughly 1912 or so and they married 1916.
Speaker 2: So he was at Wilberforce during this time and--
Speaker 1: He was--
Speaker 2: --and she was still in Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 1: And she was still in Atlanta, right.  And so when she graduated then she became a teacher and stayed in the Atlanta area--
Speaker 2: That's interesting, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and then he was in Ohio finishing his degree as--a seminary degree and started pastoring.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was in Payne Theological Seminary [Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, um-hm.  He actually became a trustee at Wilberforce in his adult life.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, so they, they I guess transferred by the Episcopal body to Ann Arbor--
Speaker 1: By the A.M.E. church--
Speaker 2: Yeah, A.M.E. church, yeah.
Speaker 1: So yeah, he was then transferred from the, which is the Third District [Third Episcopal District], Ohio was the Third District, to Michigan, that's the Fourth District [Fourth Episcopal District] in the A.M.E. church.  So he was transferred from the Zanesville, Xenia, Ohio area to Ann Arbor, Michigan to Bethel A.M.E. Church in Ann Arbor.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, okay.
Speaker 1: So they then married and nine months later my mother was born.
Story_ID: 667312
Speaker 1: So your mother [Gwendolyn Charleston Copeland], she grew, did she grow up in Ann Arbor [Michigan] (unclear) (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well they started off in Ann Arbor.  They then went to Fort Wayne, Indiana.  He [Copeland Thomas' maternal grandfather, James Charleston] was transferred to a church in Fort Wayne, Indiana (clears throat) and then in 1931 he was transferred to St. Paul A.M.E. Church in Detroit [Michigan]--
Speaker 1: Okay, St. Paul A.M.E. all right?
Speaker 2: --which is on the east side of Detroit. It used to be in Jay [Street] and Hastings Street.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He stayed there for a number of years and then had the vision to build a new church on Hunt [Street] and Chene [Street] on the east side in Detroit, this was in the very early 1950s because of a political dispute, which happens in the A.M.E. church [African Methodist Episcopal].  He was moved after building this church, this large, one block church, which still stands, he was then moved to Ebenezer A.M.E. Church in Detroit around 19--I, I, I was born in '53 [1953], so this happened--my brother [Wilson Copeland II] would know, in that same time period.  Reverend Carlyle Stewart [Carlyle Fielding Stewart] was the pastor of Ebenezer Church and they were switched.  So Carlyle Stewart moved to St. Paul, this was a political punishment almost and he was moved to Ebenezer.  Reverend Carlyle Stewart because of that left the A.M.E. church and started his own independent church and was a very successful pastor from that point on.  My grandfather stayed at Ebenezer for eighteen months, ended up buying a pipe organ, paying that off and then was moved back to St. Paul and remained at St. Paul until he died in the pulpit in June of 1961.  He had a heart attack and died.  I, I was there.  I saw it. I was what, six, seven years old.
Speaker 1: In the pulpit--
Speaker 2: In the pulpit--he had finished preaching and he died.  It was the first Sunday.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that, I mean that's, that had to be--
Speaker 2: That's traumatic, yeah, very traumatic.  I was a child, I just remember him reaching and he was a big man, six foot tall and this was a very large church too, they probably had over a thousand members, you know, he had done extremely well there, it was a community, grassroots congregation.  He was beloved because he'd been there from '31 [1931] to '61 [1961], with this eighteen month interruption.  People had gotten married there, you know, he had, he was pastoring the grandkids at this point and had done a lot in terms of helping them with economic development issues in the community.  He was a fairly savvy businessman, had several pieces of property he had purchased.  His wife [Nora Charleston] did not work and she was the first lady and so you know, he by all standards had done very well for himself but also passed that on to the congregation.  So he was well respected and you probably have been interviewing him had he lived, so he had diabetes and you know, health challenges during that time and had a heart attack.  He preached very hard and preached and, and fell over and died.  And so I remember running up to the pulpit and someone stopping me you know, and pulling me back, took him to the hospital and he passed away unfortunately.
Speaker 1: You were about eight?
Speaker 2: I was seven, this was '61 [1961] so I was about seven going on eight in June and it was the, the death was announced at Tiger Stadium [Detroit, Michigan], they had a ballgame going on, so they, they made a public announcement that he had passed away, he was that beloved.  My grandfather had been on the Michigan draft board before World War II [WWII] and literally was one of the deciding people to keep people in and out of the war, so he had pretty prominent roles in the City of Detroit; was a courageous race man; believed in racial pride, but you know, believed obviously in, in segregation ending, it needed to end so he was a very forthright man.  I pulled up some information that he had written.  This was in the '20s [1920s], no this was during, in World--this was in, at the, the end of World War I [WWI] when he was a very young minister and he was pastoring probably at that time in Ann Arbor and he made some statements about blacks don't be fooled by the Germans, that their, their propaganda shouldn't be listened to, so he was trying to help the community to understand what the Americans were doing, why they were getting in the war and what the Germans were doing that was counter to what we believe in terms of freedom and those kind of things--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) so that's also--I've, I've Googled that and gotten that information online.
Story_ID: 667313
Speaker 1: Yeah he would have been a prominent pastor during the time of the Detroit race riot in--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Eighteen, I mean 1943 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen forty-three [1943], yes--
Speaker 1: There was a big--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at Belle Isle [Belle Isle Park, Detroit, Michigan] and all that on the east side--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, yep, that was, that was--he, he was a leader in that community.
Speaker 1: Dr. Sweet--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and that case--
Speaker 2: That's right--
Speaker 1: --the Dr. Sweet case.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Another Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] graduate who was a, whose case is now famous--
Speaker 2: Yep, yes. I remember my parents talking about Dr. Sweet, yes.
Speaker 1: Dr. Ossian Sweet--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: So this is a--yeah, so this is--you've got big history on that side.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: We haven't even gotten to your father's [Wilson Copeland, Sr.] side.
Speaker 2: He's on that wall.  He's on--yeah, all these pictures there is a story behind all these pictures.
Speaker 1: We've got history all around us here.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, and you, you had mentioned Hastings, that's where they put the expressway [Edsel Ford Freeway] so I guess they had to move--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep, yes--
Speaker 1: --you know, off of Hastings Street.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, let's see, okay, so, and I imagine your [maternal] grandmother [Nora Charleston] was a, a central figure in a lot of the activities that her husband [James Charleston] was involved in, or in the you know, the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in, in, in a, in a wifely, first lady role.  Again, she, once they married she didn't work any more, which is, you know, unheard of.  That's why this country needs to know this.  I'm glad we're doing this because they look at all black people the same way, that we all came from the same route and we didn't.  My grandparents had lived a, a good life.  They didn't squander money, they lived comfortably, but he was able to make enough money as a pastor, as an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] pastor, but he had property that he invested wisely in and so that allowed her to stay home and take care of her child.  She had another child who unfortunately died, Alethea [ph.] was her name.  She died as an infant when my mother [Gwendolyn Charleston Copeland] was five years old.  So my mother grew up pretty much as an only child and so my grandmother was busy with church work so she did all the volunteer work and you know, worked with the ladies in the church.  She was a musician.  This is their, this is her piano.
Speaker 1: Oh, the one in the living room here with us.
Speaker 2: And this is ancestors' furniture, all in here.  And so she did all of those things that helped to support her husband and, and his ministry.  And, so they were, you know, they were married a long time, from 1916 until he died in 1961.  So he--
Speaker 1: Now did they live on, on the east side or near the church?
Speaker 2: They lived near the church and then he purchased their homes so they lived in their own homes which became the parsonage, so I'm not sure where they lived when he pastored on Jay [Street] and Chene [Street], but at one point they lived on, they lived on Philadelphia Street in Detroit [Michigan] and then other places in Detroit.  When he was the pastor of Ebenezer [Ebenezer A.M.E. Church, Detroit, Michigan], I believe he lived in the parsonage that Ebenezer had and, and then but ultimately lived in his own home on Chicago Boulevard--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that's the home I ultimately would graduate from high school [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] from, so he was a homeowner for many years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 667314
Speaker 1: Now well, let me go to your father's side of the family for a minute and we'll put them together.
Speaker 2: Sure and I'm gonna--
Speaker 1: Can, can you give us--oh, do you need to do something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I'm, I need to--'cause my grandfather and my father were born two days apart and I get their dates mixed up, so I have put it in my calendar so that I won't get the dates mixed up.  There we go.  Okay, yes--
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure, Wilson Albert Copeland [Wilson Copeland, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: August 27th, 1917 and he was born in Clinton, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, Clinton, I have interviewed people from Clinton--
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: --although I can't think of who right now; Clinton, South Carolina, so what do you know about your father's side?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Not as far. My dad's father was a farmer in Clinton, Bradley Copeland was his name and he married Carrie Young Copeland [Carrie Brown].  They had two children.  My father, Wilson Copeland and his brother Eugene Copeland, born after my dad, probably two years apart, roughly.  The, my grandparents did not stay married long.  They divorced and she moved to Bel Air, Maryland to be closer to her sister and other relatives, brother in the Bel Air, Maryland area.  My father's side of the family is very different from my mom's [Gwendolyn Charleston Copeland], lot of struggle there and my grandmother, a, a courageous woman could not read or write, but knew how to count money and knew how to save money and so I look at her in terms of her financial fortitude even though she had no education.  She worked, this is Carrie Young Copeland, she worked as a, as a maid, as a domestic making maybe five dollars a week for many years up in Bel Air, Maryland which was a very racially segregated town and ultimately made enough money to buy, purchase a home, so she became a homeowner and ultimately remarried when my dad and my uncle were adults and had moved on and she married John Brown, who was a World War II [WWII] veteran and they lived, had a wonderful life together.  They lived--he did all of her writings, so when I would receive letters from my grandmother, he had written them, I didn't know when I was a kid because she couldn't write and so he wrote the letters and you know, one thing lead to another so they were married until both of them, she passed away first and then he passed away, but they all stayed in Bel Air, Maryland, so I had an aunt who lived there, an uncle, my grandmother, my step-grandfather and other cousins and relatives to this day who I cherish quite a bit.
Speaker 1: Now where is Bel, Bel Air?
Speaker 2: Bel Air is about twenty-five, thirty, forty miles north of Baltimore [Maryland].
Story_ID: 667315
Speaker 1: So, your mother [Gwendolyn Charleston Copeland] has a lot of relatives in Bel Air, Maryland?
Speaker 2: Father [Wilson Copeland, Sr.]--
Speaker 1: Father.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh your father (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --yeah, your father's mother, right--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --right, Carole Young was there--
Speaker 2: Carrie, C-A-R--
Speaker 1: --Carrie Young [Carrie Brown], right.
Speaker 2: C-A-R-R-I-E, Carrie, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Thank you, so Carrie, and so, so your, was your, was your dad raised in Bel Air too?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, segregated Bel Air.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So this is, this is what happened in that town, when you were a black person and you reached the ninth grade you had a couple of choices.  You could leave school and go to work, 'cause you couldn't go to the high school in that town; you could go to the [U.S.] Army, or you could leave the town and go to school elsewhere.  So the decision was made that my father was pretty smart, that his brother [Eugene Copeland] would go to work, which he did, and he married and then had a child and stayed married until he passed away; he went into the [U.S.] military.  My father hitchhiked to Bel Air every week to go to Douglass High School [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland].  He boarded with a black family in Baltimore [Maryland].  He would then return home on the weekends hitch hiking and he did that until he graduated from high school.
Speaker 1: So that's a trip of you were saying about how many miles?
Speaker 2: Twenty to forty miles roughly, I, I forget the actual distance.
Speaker 1: Yeah I guess like thirty-five miles, so yeah.
Speaker 2: And this you're talking in the '30s [1930s].  And so then he graduated from high school.  He was able to get a scholarship and went to Virginia State College for Negroes [Virginia State University]. That was the original name for that school in Petersburg--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --Virginia--
Speaker 1: State College for Negroes--
Speaker 2: Virginia State College for Negroes, and then graduated from college.  He pledged Kappa.  He was a member of Kappa Alpha Psi [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], then worked, he graduated in '41 [1941]; worked for a short while and then was recruited in the U.S. Army Air Corps [U.S. Air Force].  He was then--
Speaker 1: This was World War--?
Speaker 2: This is World War II [WWII], the beginning of World War II.  He was then stationed in, at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], did his training down there.
Speaker 1: Did he train as a pilot?
Speaker 2: He did, but he washed out of pilot--he was a Tuskegee Airman, he washed out of pilot school because he had ulcers, but remained an officer, he was a second lieutenant and I actually have his papers upstairs, I recently received his papers; had a military--I had a military luncheon--breakfast, my company did back in March and I honored my dad and as a result of that I got some of his papers.  So he was on the base with Benjamin, Benjamin Mays, Chappie James [Daniel "Chappie" James, Jr.], those are familiar names to him and so he remained on that base and then other bases, ultimately ended up at Selfridge Air Force Base [Selfridge Army Air Base; Selfridge Air National Guard Base] in Michigan.
Story_ID: 667316
Speaker 1: Now this is where a lot of history goes down--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at Selfridge field [Selfridge Army Air Base; Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, so--going--continue with this story.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And again he was a second lieutenant so he had men that he was responsible for--one-story, my brother [Wilson Copeland II] knows this much more accurately than I, but on Selfridge they were, they were state side, they didn't take off and leave, but you know, they still had responsibility for I think the B-25 bombers [North American B-25 Mitchell] and the others.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were training--well, well the story that I've heard from the Tuskegee Airmen is that they, of course the government was hesitant to send them anywhere--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --so they, they committed themselves to training them--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so when they finally--some were sent, but in the interim a lot of people were made trainers so the black pilots became--that's why the pilots were so good because they trained--
Speaker 2: They were trained.
Speaker 1: --over and over again--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --so instead of being sent right into battle they were trained again and again and retrained--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so they were training other people--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --they knew the planes inside out.
Speaker 2: So my father [Wilson Copeland, Sr.] was part of that whole brigade and at one point horseplay, you know they would, they would take the planes out and you know, have fun and all that stuff and get caught and get in trouble (laughter) and so he was, he was part of that operation.  There was a colleague of his, my brother tells this story, who was so enraged by the racism he had encountered as a child, this was a town either in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] or Ohio, somewhere in that area, that when he was, during an operational detail from one base to the next, he was flying this, his plane, he deliberately hovered over that town and buzzed it and just came as low as he possibly could, people thought they were being bombed, they said, "Who is," you know, "what is going on? Who is this plane," and he's just laughing his head off and he just buzzed them and went on and never got caught (laughter), never got caught.  So there's, there's there're those kinds of stories about how they kept their dignity, but let the society know that they were men too.
Speaker 1: Now was he part of the--there was an action in Selfridge field I think by the Tuskegee Airmen, they all got court marshaled but not--they, it really wasn't, it didn't stick--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --they, they refused to bow down to the segregationist rules on the base--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --going on.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, I know what you're talking about and again, I have to verify that, but he was more than likely on the base at that time.
Speaker 1: There were over a hundred of them were on, who signed a petition--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --yeah--
Speaker 2: I've, I've heard of it and again, my brother is the verifier so I would have to check with him on that one.
Speaker 1: The black officers weren't allowed to use the same facilities as the white officers--
Speaker 2: The same facilities, exactly--
Speaker 1: --and they did a petition.
Speaker 2: Right, and you know my dad had a lot of those kinds of experiences growing up in Bel Air [Maryland].  The experiences on the base, there was another experience when he was going from, had so military detail, he had his squadron with him and they were on a train in the South going from one military base to the other.  On the same train were German POWs.  They had made arrangements with various restaurants along the route to feed the soldiers, so they stopped at this particular restaurant somewhere in the South and brought in cold lunch for all the black soldiers, cold box lunches.  They ate on the train, they went to the car with the German POWs who then were escorted off the train and went in the restaurant and had a hot meal and then got on the train and they continued on, true story.
Speaker 1: Yes, Yeah, yeah I've--we, we have a collection of these kinds of stories where the German prisoners of war were treated better than the black soldiers (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Better than the black soldiers, including my father.
Story_ID: 667317
Speaker 1: Okay, so your dad now [Wilson Copeland, Sr.] he at some point now I guess after the war he goes to Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio], or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, so my dad, so my father had graduated from Virginia State College [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] and with a business degree and so again, he enters into World War II [WWII], becomes a Tuskegee Airmen, U.S. Army, Army Air Corps [U.S. Army Air Corps; U.S. Air Force], by the end of the war he is honorably discharged from Selfridge [Selfridge Army Air Base; Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Michigan] and then gets a job in the Detroit [Michigan] area, rents a room in Detroit, I believe on Philadelphia Street and the landlord lives next door, who owns both houses.  The landlord was my grandfather [James Charleston] and so he meets the landlord's daughter, who is at that point teaching, my mother [Gwendolyn Charleston Copeland], haven't really talked about her, she is graduated, she started off at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee], went there for two years, pledged Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] at Fisk, and was having a lot of fun at Fisk (laughter), singing in a band, cut her hair off, you know, shortened her skirts.
Speaker 1: She was singing in a band, really? Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know one of these nightclub bands, whatever (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now this is a, this is a preacher's daughter, now a PK [preacher's kid]--
Speaker 2: --now she's a preacher's daughter (laughter) yep, so my grandfather surprised her and came down to visit her and was horrified to find this out and wanted to immediately take her out of school and my grandmother [Nora Charleston] convinced him, "No let her finish the year out, then you can move her." So then she was transferred to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] and (laughter) stayed in the dormitory and finished there; graduated in 1939 and 1941 received her master's degree, she had an undergraduate degree in romance languages, spoke about four languages and then became a teacher; so she's living back at home at this point, around 1945, '46 [1946], meets the boy next door who has finished his Army duty and is working and one thing lead to another and they fell in love and got married.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Against my father's--my grandfather's wishes (laughter).  They married nonetheless.
Story_ID: 667318
Speaker 1: Now what was your dad's [Wilson Copeland, Sr.], what was, what were, what were his aspirations at this point?  Now, he's somebody, he's had, he's been a second lieutenant in the Army [U.S. Army Air Corps; U.S. Air Force] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: He's a--he's got his veteran benefits.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: He's in Detroit [Michigan]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --so what was he trying to do?
Speaker 2: Ultimately start a business--he was very business focused and business minded.  In those early days he started dabbling in business ventures with others.  He ultimately collaborated with some other men and owned an oil truck, so he was a part of what was called Blue Flame Oil Company and funny story, I remember going to church one--I must have been four, three or four, going to church--went to church every Sunday, my [maternal] grandfather [James Charleston]. And my dad was driving my brother [Wilson Copeland II] and me to church, my mother [Gwendolyn Charleston Copeland], was she in the car, she may not have been, she may have been at home, coming later, and they--we passed his oil company and there were some boys, one or two boys, black boys playing on the train tracks and he became so outraged, this is when parents, you were everybody's parent, if there were children doing wrong things everybody parented you, so he was concerned about these kids getting hurt if a train came by, so he--I remember him stopping the car, getting out that car and just totally reprimanding these kids, "Don't you ever play on this train track again, you can get hurt and seriously hurt." And they're scared to death and he gets back in the car, he drives us to church (laughter), so I, I remember that. I was three, four, five years old, no more than that.  So he was very civically focused, he was very active in the church.  My parents married in December of 1946, I have those pictures too.  Again, my grandfather was very business minded so the first home that they lived in, my father--my grandfather bought that home for them and paid cash and that was their wedding gift and I think he bought another house that they lived in and paid cash and that was another gift to them, so didn't have much early debt on their part, so he was a businessman so he owned these businesses, Blue Flame was one of them, never worked in a, in a company per se, my mother was, was a teacher, she taught romance languages at Greusel Junior High School [Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: How do you spell Greusel?
Speaker 2: G-R-E-U-S-E-L, or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, like a German name.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, Greusel, it's, it's some kind of spelling like that.  About ten years later my mother was in, at, in, during the late '50s [1950s], my mother was encouraged to take the high school counselor's test.  She never taught at an elementary school and this is important point because typically no matter where you had gone to school, my mother graduated from U of M  [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] and, but most black teachers, like most blacks who graduated from college went to the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] because that was the only job you could get, black teachers, you taught in elementary school because that's the only job you could get in teaching because of my grandfather's influence, he said, "No, no, no, she has a master's degree, she's going to teach at another level." And so he made a way for her to apply and get accepted to teaching in the junior high school level.  She then went and was encouraged to take the high school counselor's exam and that was also rigorous tests, no blacks had really passed it before, she was discouraged at one point and he said, "No, you take it and, and let's see how well you do"; this was the force of her father.  And she took the exam and she passed it and so she then became ultimately a high school counselor at what was then called Eastern High School on the east side of Detroit.  The name was ultimately changed to the Martin Luther King Senior High School [Martin Luther King, Jr. Senior High School] and it's still in existence today.
Story_ID: 667319
Speaker 1: Right, right, right, King High School [Eastern High School; Martin Luther King, Jr. Senior High School, Detroit, Michigan] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So that's her, her route educationally.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My dad [Wilson Copeland, Sr.] continued to operate in business [Blue Flame Oil Company], but became restless saw what was going on in Africa, 1957, when Ghana became independent and saw a future for himself in Ghana, so collaborated with several other businessmen in the late 1950s including Albert Cleage [Albert B. Cleage, Jr.]--
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: --who was Pearl Cleage's father and several other men and they created what was called Ghanita Enterprises [Ghanita Enterprises, Inc.], G-H-A-N-A, G-H-A-N-I-T-A, I believe that was the name, which was going to be some business enterprise operating out of Ghana.  So he flew over, established himself in Ghana and that particular business failed, but he remained on in business.  My--by that time, this is the late '50s [1950s], my parents' marriage fell apart and so by 1960 they had, were divorcing and were fully divorced by you know, the early '60s [1960s].  He remained in Africa, in Ghana, my mother [Gwendolyn Charleston Copeland] remained in Detroit [Michigan] and my dad was sought out by the government and he worked for the state department [U.S. Department of State] for the remainder of his career.
Speaker 1: He was in Ghana during the time when you had the community of black expatriates in Ghana, [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou was there and there were quite a few others you know, that came through there--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah he was there from '59 [1959]--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Alice Windom, I can't think of some of the others, but yeah.
Speaker 2: He knew them, '59 [1959] to '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Curtis Morrow [HistoryMaker Curtis "Kojo" Morrow] from Chicago [Illinois]; I've interviewed a lot of people who lived in Ghana--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --during that time.  They had like a black community--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and, okay--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right--
Speaker 1: Okay, and so this is from, from when?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-nine [1959] to 1969.  He was then transferred in '69 [1969] to Nairobi, Kenya.
Speaker 1: Now he was in Ghana when Malcolm X came through there--
Speaker 2: I, yeah--
Speaker 1: --in '64 [1964] or late, or early '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a famous picture of Malcolm in the Ghana airport--that Alice Windom shot, they viewed her in St. Louis [Missouri] so they, I don't know, does, does, does he mention meeting Malcolm X or--
Speaker 2: No (laughter), no--
Speaker 1: Does he ever talk about Nkrumah?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did he ever mention how Nkrumah--
Speaker 2: Yes, Kwame Nkrumah, yes and Franklin [Franklin Williams], geez--other names that escape me because I was a child at that point, but he was, he, he lived there.  He, he lived in Accra [Ghana].
Speaker 1: So with him being involved--did he come back and forth in those ten years--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he came back and forth.  He worked for the, the government.  Yeah, he, he worked for the state department, did a lot of security related work (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay and you know, when we look back on those days I mean, the U.S. intentions in Africa were not all, weren't always the best.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So did he have any--did he talk about what the state department was actually doing there?
Speaker 2: No, (laughter) no, he wouldn't--when he would leave he would go from Accra straight to Washington, D.C. and then he would come to Detroit to see us.  So he always debriefed in D.C. and then came here, came to, to Detroit.
Speaker 1: Now you were saying in '69 [1969] he goes to Nairobi?
Speaker 2: To Nairobi and he lives in Nairobi--right, and had an import, export business but still worked for the government.
Speaker 1: Okay, well the president of Kenya in those days was--
Speaker 2: Jomo Kenyatta.
Speaker 1: Jomo Kenyatta, yeah. So that's on the other side of Africa a long way. I mean most people here can't even contemplate how far that is away. They think Africa is all one neighborhood, but it's a long way.
Speaker 2: Hundreds of miles away, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, thousands--
Speaker 2: Thousands of miles away, right.
Speaker 1: So, so what, so he had an import?
Speaker 2: Import, export business and also worked for the government.
Speaker 1: Well what kinds of things did he import and export?
Speaker 2: Probably you know, artifacts and you know, artwork and items that consumers would purchase, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay, a lot of the tourist related items that we get over here come from Kenya, for some reason, Kenya and--
Speaker 2: I've been to Kenya, yeah they have a lot of those items there, either--I'm not sure where they're made, they have small factories and small shops that are made, where items are made in, in those areas, right.
Speaker 1: I think it has to do with the safari business (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, safari--
Speaker 1: I mean the going--you know the tourism--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in, in Kenya because of the big game--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and all that.
Speaker 2: I've been there twice (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, so did your father--so how long did he stay in Nairobi?
Speaker 2: Ten years--
Speaker 1: Okay, another ten years, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm. Sixty-nine [1969] to '79 [1979] and then he retired in '79 [1979].
Story_ID: 667320
Speaker 1: Okay, well he had a unique career--
Speaker 2: Very (laughter)--
Speaker 1: --amongst African Americans in those days--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because there were--as people started waking up to the reality of our kinship with Africa, he was already doing business there--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, he was already there, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --in Africa, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: He was one of the few though there were others that did it he was one of the few, of the few, okay, so, so then did, is he still here, is he--?
Speaker 2: No, he passed away in 1991, right, so my dad [Wilson Copeland, Sr.] married again in '72-ish [1972], I married in--no, he married in '73-ish [1973]; I married in '73 [1973].  He married in, around that same time briefly to a woman, I think she was from Connecticut originally that he had met her--African American, met her in Kenya, she was also working for the state department [U.S. Department of State].  Their marriage was very brief, probably a year or two and then he remained single the rest of his life.  In many ways he and my mother [Gwendolyn Charleston Copeland]--he never got over my mother.  They are buried next to each other now, yep.
Speaker 1: Did, did she ever remarry?
Speaker 2: She never remarried, no, she had friends, but she, she never married again, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, now when you think about their, their talents, their personalities--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the way they looked, the way they walked, talked, sense of humor, who do you think that you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I, I, since they're both gone, probably the poise and everything, my mother and the outreach to other people, my mother, curiosity, my mother, business drive, global focus, definitely my father; even what I'm doing now, I mean I look at what I'm doing now, I just started the travel related part of my business three years ago, it's my dad and so it's a combination of both and it's interesting because my brother [Wilson Copeland II] has my father's status trait, entertainment personality trait, but also the compassion of my mother, so we're both a combination--I only have one brother and no other siblings as far as we know, so it's, it's interesting how it's divided up.  I just--I have an Internet based radio program and I just had my brother on when Donald Trump [President Donald John Trump] made those, oh, made those atrocious remarks--I'm going to have to go in a minute.  My dad made those--Donald Trump made those atrocious remarks about Detroit [Michigan] and went there, so I interviewed my brother on my radio show and we were so much in sync, I mean he had his friends listening, they said, "Gosh you guys are really brother and sister and you all love each other," and it was really interesting, yeah.
Story_ID: 667321
Speaker 1: For the record, what, what's your brother's full name and--
Speaker 2: Wilson Albert Copeland [Wilson Copeland II].
Speaker 1: Okay, is he a junior (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He's a, he's a second.
Speaker 1: Second.
Speaker 2: They didn't want to name him, they didn't want him to be a second--a junior, so they named him Wilson Albert Copeland II.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and when was he born?  Is he older than you?
Speaker 2: He's older, March 19th, 1949.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and, and he is now--what profession is he in?
Speaker 2: He's an attorney.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: In Detroit, okay.
Story_ID: 667322
Speaker 1: Let's talk about growing up. So, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: (Pause) It's interesting that you would say that because I watch a lot of Westerns now, I've tried to figure out why and I know because it's connected with my childhood and I remember 'Wagon Train' and 'Cheyenne' and a lot of those shows and movies that came out and that I connect with my childhood.  I had a relatively comfortable childhood, relatively safe childhood, it was the kind literally where you went out to play on the weekends and in the summertime, not necessarily during school time, but definitely on the weekends and you stayed out until the street lights came on and when the street lights came on that was your cue to go back home.  So there were no dynamics about shootings or heavy duty robberies or those kinds of things.  I lived in a black neighborhood, grew up in a black neighborhood.  I, I was born in a black hospital, black, Burton Mercy Hospital [Detroit, Michigan], so my world was very African American centered from blue collar up to the pillars of our society, that was the world that I lived in and grew up in until I was probably in the seventh or eighth grade--sixth, sixth grade, that's when I started going to an integrated public school.  My mother [Gwendolyn Charleston Copeland] at that point was divorced; my brother [Wilson Copeland II] was entering high school.  I was getting ready to enter junior high school, or middle school, sixth grade [at Vandenberg Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan], almost middle school, junior, they use to call it junior high school at that time and that's when my world expanded and I was in school with white students.
Story_ID: 667323
Speaker 1: What neighborhood in Detroit [Michigan] did you grow up in up to that point, where, where were you?
Speaker 2: I grew up on the West Side--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --on Atkinson [Atkinson Street], so it was the, the west side, homeowners principally, some renters, in single family homes, brick homes in Detroit.  I went to Brady Elementary School [George N. Brady Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan] until I was in fifth grade I believe and then was transferred to Vanderbilt, Vandenberg, pardon me, Vandenberg School, V-A-N-D-E-N-B-U-R-G [sic.], Elementary School [Vandenberg Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan] because the school system at that point was beginning to change and a group of parents got together and said we want better for our kids, we didn't have--in this area [of Massachusetts], they have a program called METCO [Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity] where kids are bused outside to suburban schools for, to better their education.  We didn't have that back then; parents got together and shipped their kids to near suburban schools, they were in the Detroit public school system [Detroit Public Schools; Detroit Public Schools Community District], but they were not in our neighborhoods, so I used to take the bus with my friends to Vandenberg and--
Speaker 1: Okay was that out near the proverbial Eight Mile Road?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was right, right near Eight Mile (laughter), right near Northland [Drive] and Eight Mile.
Speaker 1: That, that being the big demarcation between the white and black neighborhoods for years--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: --okay, it's not now--
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: --so much, but--
Speaker 2: --but definitely then.
Speaker 1: --Eight Mile Road, yeah--
Speaker 2: Very Jewish, very Jewish--I remember having Yom Kippur off and Rosh Hashanah and loving it (laughter).  It was a holiday 'cause you, you went to school but you did no work 'cause there were no kids there and I don't think we had the day off, but we definitely went to school and you did no work because it was Yom Kippur (laughter) 'cause there were no kids there.
Story_ID: 667324
Speaker 1: Okay so, we talk--talking about Vandenberg Elementary School [Detroit, Michigan] I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now did you have favorite teachers when you were in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, yes, Ms. Porter [ph.] (laughter) definitely--early favorite.  She was beautiful, pretty and just an inspiration, that was at Brady Elementary School [George N. Brady Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan] by the way--
Speaker 1: Oh, at Brady? Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm at Brady.
Speaker 1: All right, and was she, she just a homeroom teacher, I mean the, the--a regular classroom teacher?
Speaker 2: I think she probably, she was maybe my homeroom teacher.  I, I was very young, so first grade or so.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, and the teacher takes care of the whole thing, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, yeah and then later on, this was also at Brady, I think it was Brady, I have to get my thoughts together was a Ms., Mrs. Tumer [ph.] who just passed away recently I think.  She was tough and strict and just a figure of strength to look up too.  She and my mother [Gwendolyn Charleston Copeland] were also friends and I remember one day I got into trouble on day, it was tough when your mother's a teacher; the teachers call your mother.  I got in, it was, it was awful and I, and I didn't tend to get in trouble, but it was very embarrassing when the teacher who knows you mother would call your mother and let your mother know that Carole [HistoryMaker Carole Copeland Thomas] has not done, she's not behaved well and that's when they paddled students, so at Brady I got paddled by Mrs. Tumer, I remember that.  My, maybe my one time I got paddled.
Speaker 1: So you never went to the--attended the school your mother taught at?
Speaker 2: No, no, she was on the east side teaching; I was on the west side and then near Eight Mile Road.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember what you did to get in trouble?
Speaker 2: I was bad (laughter).  I was goofing around and I think we were in auditorium so it was part of the day's activities and I was goofing around with the kids and got, got caught and got paddled, so that was at Brady, that was at Brady.
Speaker 1: Now when you--early in school did you have, were you recognized as a public speaker?  I mean did you, did you get a chance to make presentations?
Speaker 2: No more than the average students.  I think that skill developed later on.  I ultimately went to Beaubien Junior High School, middle school, Beaubien middle school [Beaubien Junior High School, Detroit, Michigan] after finishing Vandenberg [Vandenberg Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan], so ninth grade I was at Beaubien, that was a new school, again, and out in that same area on Wyoming [Avenue], same area, and then applied and got accepted to go to Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] that was an exam school so you had to apply to get in and so I went there.  So probably at Cass I--originally you had to almost major in a particular track and I was on a, I wanted to become a doctor, so I took a lot of sciences, didn't do that necessarily that well (laughter) and was also taking music classes and so I tried out and was accepted into a group called Harp and Vocal [Harp and Vocal Ensemble] which was a very well known musical group within Cass Tech, lead by Velma Froude, F-R-O-U-D-E , I believe it was how she spells her name, spelled her name.  She was a tough taskmaster, so I think leaving the sciences, moving into music was the performance component of me coming out and so we performed around the city.  We went to Chicago [Illinois] one time to perform and it was--I got hooked on it and enjoyed that part of my life.
Speaker 1: So Cass Tech, you have to test to get into Cass?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, you grades and then you, you maybe take and exam at that time, not a heavy duty exam, but it was part of the admissions process.  So Cass Tech is on the east side so you had to take a bus over or, I, I took a bus from my home, yeah, at that point my parents had divorced and I was living in my [maternal] grandparents' house.  My parents had divorced, my grandfather [James Charleston] died in 1961 then we moved from our house on Atkinson [Street], four blocks away to my grandmother's [Nora Charleston] house on Chicago Boulevard and so I lived there until I graduated from high school.  So I would take a bus from that location to my various schools, Beaubien and then Cass Tech.
Story_ID: 667325
Speaker 1: Did church provide opportunities for public speaking and leadership (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, oh yes, yeah, very, very much.  Be, being almost a PK [preacher's kid] per se, I mean grandparent you know, my mother [Gwendolyn Charleston Copeland] was a PK and I was the granddaughter of the PK. There were lots of activities and again, during that time you were in church all Sunday, so you'd go to Sunday school and then regular service started 10:45 or so, there was typically an afternoon program and dinner in between.  So you'd leave your house at eight or nine in the morning, go to Sunday School and then church and then you'd have dinner all growing up at the church and then an afternoon tea, some kind of program that went on during the afternoon, so that's again where the performance, speaking in front of the public was nurtured.  When I was fourteen years old, I was always starting things, so even as a kid I started a--I remember I started a circus (laughter) at my [maternal] grandparents' [Nora Charleston and James Charleston] house.  They had a big, very large house and had a big lot next--they had a side lot and I said, let me get my friends together and we, we had a circus and so we started a circus, I--
Speaker 1: What kind of acts did you--?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't know (laughter), just--
Speaker 1: Did somebody do something--
Speaker 2: --just--
Speaker 1: --I mean--
Speaker 2: --just fun things, you know, just the neighborhood kids would get together and I would sell potholders and so I was always innovated, that's probably the dad [Wilson Copeland, Sr.] in me coming, so I would make these loom potholders and, and sell them and it's interesting because my older granddaughter is very creative and talented now and I think about myself when I see her making things, so you sort of pass it down the line.
Story_ID: 667326
Speaker 1: So yeah it was, it was, it was a fun childhood, you know there were episodes that to be remembered, the 1967 riots, remember it vividly; remember it starting (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you were about fifteen then? Yeah.
Speaker 1: I was, '67 [1967], so I was about--this was June-ish or so, so I was about fourteen, fourteen or so, thirteen, fourteen and I was visiting my cousin up the street, Inell Lewis [ph.], was playing with her up the street and my brother [Wilson Copeland II] and go me and said, "It's, it's time for you to come home, the trouble is starting, so I have to bring you home." And then we get home and then the whole city erupts.  Now we lived on the corner of Chicago Boulevard and Linwood [Street].  There were stores, there was my [maternal] grandparents' [Nora Charleston and James Charleston] house that we lived in, their side lot and then a vacant lot next door and then stores across the street, a small convenience store owned by Chaldeans, a very large ethnic group in the area, a dry cleaners, a drugstore, I remember them; all looted, the dry cleaners was burned to the ground.  I had clothes in them.  I remember losing my clothes.  The drugstore was burned and the, the grocery store was, survived, I think it was Imperial Market, it survived because they had a sign in the window that said, soul brother and so those kinds of stores tended to survive the looting that took place.  And so they may have lost some things but their stores were not burned at all.  I remember just the drugstore and the dry cleaners were burned.  It was a very scary time.
Speaker 2: Do you remember what was said about the cause of the riot?
Speaker 1: It, this, now this was before King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] died so this was '67 [1967] and it was a very volatile time around the country, so civil rights reactions, the feedback that was going on not just in the South, but northern cities and the inequalities in the northern cities, all of that just came to a head in cities like Detroit [Michigan].  It was avoided here in Boston [Massachusetts], principally because there was a concert by James Brown and they asked him to settle and quite the, the crowd.  I'm not sure the year, '67 [1967], '66 [1966], I'm not sure around, '68 [1968], it was in that time period and that--he was able to keep the crowd calm and manageable and it literally avoided a lot of disruption that took place, that could have taken place in Boston, I was obviously not here, but I, I've heard stories about that, but getting back to Detroit, it, it was a tough time.  I remember the National Guard being stationed in the vacant lot next to our house.  I remember the snipers, the fact that we had to cut our lights off and sit very quietly so that no harm would come our way.  And the, there was a Catholic monastery is probably not the right word, but a Catholic school training for priests across the street from my home, diagonally across the street and a statue of the Virgin Mary that then was painted black as a result of the riot and they just, they left it black during that time.
Speaker 2: I remember that, it was in Jet magazine, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yes, so I remember that pretty vividly, so those kinds of times I remember and that--the background of that, the backdrop of that, the years before were the years on that same corner, that same neighborhood where you didn't necessarily lock your doors when it, when we didn't have air conditioning, it was hot and you'd take your blanket and your pillow and you'd go out on the front porch and you'd sleep out there and then you'd go in the house at about three in the morning, so you, you slept until it was cool and then you'd go back in the house.  I did that, just like my mother [Gwendolyn Charleston Copeland] had gone with her parents to Belle Isle [Belle Isle Park, Detroit, Michigan] to sleep in Belle Isle when it was really hot until daybreak or whatever, and that was common that people would do those kinds of things, unheard of nowadays.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they talk about that in Chicago [Illinois] too, going to Washington Park and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and everybody would just go to sleep--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --people just laying out and they'd go to sleep.
Speaker 1: That's right, right, right, yep, that, that was done--
Speaker 2: Nobody got bothered and nobody was robbed.
Speaker 1: No, no, that was a common thing in, in these communities and for us sleeping on the front porch or your back porch, or sleeping outside when it was hot outside, that was the thing that you did and you just didn't lock your doors because nobody would come in and bother you, right.
Speaker 2: Interesting.
Story_ID: 667327
Speaker 1: This is, days before the Detroit [Michigan] street gangs started up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yeah, these, see these were, this was the late '60s [1960s], mid to late '60s [1960s], obviously the Vietnam War was escalating, that was going up but in our communities the communities were still relatively stable.  Drugs had not infiltrated the neighborhoods.  Then things began to change in the--very late '60s [1960s] and early '70s [1970s], it was a combination of the economy going south, the auto industry beginning to have their exodus from Flint [Michigan] and Detroit and taking manufacturing elsewhere, all of those things contributed to the escalation of drug activity, um-hm.
Speaker 1: I know we interviewed Judge Mathis [HistoryMaker Gregory Mathis] who was a bit younger, who came along when gangs were big--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Errol Flynns and other black gangs.
Speaker 2: So by the time I left Detroit in '71 [1971], I graduated in '71 [1971], that's when things were really escalating quite a bit with the crime activities and drug activities.  My mother--my [maternal] grandmother [Nora Charleston] died in 1968.  We stayed in our home until I graduated from high school [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] in '71 [1971], then my mother [Gwendolyn Charleston Copeland] sold that house and moved into a townhouse in downtown Detroit, that area was being redeveloped and so the Renaissance Center [Detroit, Michigan] and a lot of other areas came into being in the early '70s [1970s] and so my mom took advantage of that, moved into a cooperative townhouse and I at that point was in high--I was in college [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia] so travelling back and forth and then married in 1973.
Story_ID: 667328
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so now Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan], all right, so now you're in the, you're in the musical program, the--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the Harp and Vocal [Harp and Vocal Ensemble]--
Speaker 2: Harp and Vocal, yeah.
Speaker 1: --now what did you play, the harp or the, did you sing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I was, I was a voice major (laughter), yes, so I was the vocal (laughter), right--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --played the piano a little bit, but I was primarily the vocal person, yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is--but you took this seriously, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yes, I--
Speaker 1: This was something that you--?
Speaker 2: I, I was looking at very seriously, yeah.  I majored in music in college [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia], so, this was an aspiration, an interest that then developed and grew and I, I'd say the discipline that I have today is a combination of, of parents, a mom [Gwendolyn Charleston Copeland] and dad [Wilson Copeland, Sr.], but definitely it started in high school just with the amount of discipline that was required to sing in that particular group and other groups and to get through that rigorous program, so I had other classes I took in addition to music, but all of that sort of came into being during that time.  I remember in Harp and Vocal we had to sing either on a holiday or we definitely had to rehearse on Veterans Day, you'd get half a day and you'd go home--we didn't get a half a day, we had to perform and rehearse and so a lot of those qualities I probably have today in terms of just, you go with the flow, you move on, you got, you have a job to do.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a, yeah, Cass Tech is known to have a very strong musical program. We've interviewed other people that attended Cass--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I mean, Cass has a strong program anyway--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and lots of Cass Tech alums are in The HistoryMakers archives.
Speaker 2: Interesting, go CT.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a serious, serious matter in Detroit [Michigan] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so--
Speaker 2: And people think of New York [New York], you know the arts, arts and sciences schools, but yeah, we had Cass that could compete with them head on head.
Speaker 1: And then the other special arts school outside of the city, what--what's the one the, you know what I'm talking about the--?
Speaker 2: Cranbrook [Cranbrook Academy of Art, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]--
Speaker 1: Cranbrook, right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: --that Woodie King [HistoryMaker Woodie King, Jr.] attended and other
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --artists, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 667329
Speaker 1: At any rate, so, so at Cass [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] is your--now did you run for office or anything or, or a class office?
Speaker 2: (Clears throat) No, I didn't.  I wanted to be a cheerleader and didn't make it (laughter) I remember that.  And it's funny because Amy Hilliard, Amy Hilliard-Jones [HistoryMaker Amy S. Hilliard] is her name, was a year ahead of me and she was a cheerleader.  I sort of looked up to her and some of the others.  I think she's in Chicago [Illinois] now.  She's had a very successful cookie business [sic. Comfort Cake Company, LLC, Chicago, Illinois].  She worked at Gillette [The Gillette Company].  I worked at Gillette at one point and time.  She's done very well for herself.  I think she's maybe on the inside now as a senior executive for one of the large companies or whatever, but she is a Cass Tech grad.  Her younger sister, Gloria Hilliard Mayfield Banks [Gloria Hilliard Banks], who I really didn't know, I think she went to another school is now one of the top Mary Kay [Mary Kay Inc.] directors in the entire world and so these are people who I knew and, but Amy in particular was a cheerleader and I wanted to be a cheerleader like Amy (laughter).
Speaker 1: Who else was at Cass Tech that you remember, that you remember that, from those days?
Speaker 2: Denise Gray Felder is her name; we were best friends growing up and she has a lead a very successful--she worked at the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] for a number of years, worked for AT&T [AT&T Inc.] and she and her husband have had a very successful life in the New Jersey, East Orange, South Orange, New Jersey area.  She led and probably continues to lead a non-profit organization that has taken her literally all over the world but now she is the director of communications for the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]. And so her alma mater (laughter), and so she's back there, very, she's very, she been very successful.
Story_ID: 667330
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduation you know, what were your aspirations? Did you see yourself as a professional singer or a music teacher, or what, what did you see?
Speaker 2: Saw myself probably as a professional singer of some kind.  I had really had thoughts of going into opera as a result of college training, but got railroaded.
Speaker 1: This was at high--Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] before you graduated?
Speaker 2: At, at Cass, yeah; saw some kind of aspirations in terms of performance, didn't quite totally abandon the, the, the, the medical track, but didn't really see a path forward from that point, so music was a, was a strong interest of mine.
Speaker 1: Did, did you know any doctors that you were like, as role models, yeah--
Speaker 2: I knew lots of doctors, yeah.
Speaker 1: --for you--
Speaker 2: My parents' [Gwendolyn Charleston Copeland and Wilson Copeland, Sr.] friends, I lived in the black neighborhood where we all lived together and so again, from the high to the low, the doctors who delivered me, doctors who took care of me, they were all black, so I, I lived in a black world (laughter)--
Speaker 1: But did--?
Speaker 2: --and so it was nothing for me, A to think about going to college, that was expected and these kinds of professionals were available to me because I saw them growing up; doctors, lawyers, undertakers, people who worked in the post office.
Speaker 1: We interviewed [HistoryMaker] Dr. Rachel Keith in Detroit [Michigan], a doctor--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that would have been your mother's age I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Waldo Cain was my doctor.  Dr. Tanner [Natalia Tanner Cain] was his wife; I think she's still living.  I think Waldo Cain is passed away.  So these were people, they were just, they were part of my world.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what kind of counseling did you get about college?
Speaker 2: That--from my high, from high school or from college counselors?
Speaker 1: Yeah, because you end up going to Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia], but was that the reason, the counselors or did you, or, or did it come, come from some other place?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Because it wasn't just a regular destination for black high school graduates--
Speaker 2: No, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in those days, Emory wasn't.
Speaker 2: I, I was, I was in love (laughter) and I had met a young minister (laughter) when I was sixteen years old, we started dating when I was in college and he was in, in--I was in high school and he was in college.  He went to Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] and had plans to finish Wayne and then go to the Interdenominational Theological Center, ITC, which is part of the AU Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium] in Atlanta [Georgia].  So I went on my own version of the black college tour, looked at you know, lots of schools, applied to Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] and University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], got in, Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], got in, but ended up going to Emory because it was in Atlanta.
Story_ID: 667331
Speaker 1: Now Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia] didn't have a lot of black students at that--in those days, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No (laughter), no.
Speaker 1: So were they, I mean, I would expect--now you had good grades and were, you know--
Speaker 2: National Honor Society, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you're, you're the kind of student, so if you weren't going to have that many black students, cause you'd want the best ones at least, right--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, I think so, right.
Speaker 1: --so, so how did you like Emory?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I liked it.  It was a great experience for me.  I'm the kind of person where I just charge forward and then I say, "Oh, end of the Civil War, enter the civil rights era, oh, white roommate as a freshman," (laughter), "is she going to accept me?"  Gail Parks [ph.] was her name and I remember meeting her and meeting her parents and then having second thoughts, oh my god, this is 1971, I have a white roommate at Emory University, they've had problems in this area (laughter), you know, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is dead, oh my goodness. And she perfectly accepted me.  There, there, we never had any problems; we lived together for the entire freshman year.  My second year I had a black roommate on campus and she was great and then my third year my husband [Mickarl Thomas, Sr.] was my roommate.  I had gotten married to the boyfriend by that time, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And he was at ITC [Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia]--
Speaker 2: He was at ITC, right, right.
Speaker 1: Right, so, now, so you're a music major at Emory?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: You're taking voice--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, voice training, voice, taking voice coaching lessons by voice coaches and taking classes, other classes as well that I took, but, yep, I'm fully engaged in work at Emory.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a chance to, to do any international travel when you're in college?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  Again, because I married when I was nineteen, that sort of put me on a different track, and, and even at that point had I really pursued music in the early '70s [1970s], particularly from a classical point of view that would have taken me to, to Europe and would have disrupted the marriage at that point, so I went another route and, and did not pursue the music when I graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, so you got married, was, was it your, your, your junior year?
Speaker 2: Right it was in junior year, yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right, all right, and, and he had, had he finished his studies?
Speaker 2: No, he was still at ITC; so we married in August, August 18, 1973 and he was still at ITC, which was a three year program.  I was a rising junior.  We both graduated in 1975.  We both graduated in 1975, he with his master's degree and me with my bachelor's degree.  I, I did graduate with honors and so we did finish at the same time and then the children started coming the next year.
Story_ID: 667332
Speaker 1: Now anything about Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia] you want to share with us, about teachers or, or activities (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, and this is important for your audience to know because at that time my freshman year, the freshmen met all of the black students, you know, all twenty of them (laughter) there weren't that many, upperclassmen as well; and we went to a, we went on a picnic to a place called Stone Mountain, Georgia, now I'm from Michigan, I don't know anything about Stone Mountain, so we're on this picnic and having a great time meeting each other, all those kinds of things and then it's announced we have to leave, it's dusk, it's time, we have to leave, okay, we have to leave.  Little did I realize that that area was still very active for the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] to have their rallies and other activities so we were gone before any event stuff got started. That I remember vividly.
Speaker 1: Where they burned crosses and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  I also remember being on the bus going downtown the 6 Emory Clairmont bus, gosh, I remember that one and seeing Lester Maddox's signs on the bus when he was running for governor or one of the offices, the N word visually used, you know, we want to get rid of the Ns, keep them in their place, just hate speech, that's horribly now being replicated with the election cycle that we have this year, but I remember that back in 1971 during the time that he was running for office and just being afraid, just being concerned about that kind of person getting in office.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Atlanta [Georgia] had to be, I mean it was a place in stark contrast right in those days.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Lester Maddox who passed out axe handles--
Speaker 2: Lester "Axe Handle" Maddox, yes.
Speaker 1: --to keep blacks customers out of his restaurant [Pickrick Cafeteria, Atlanta, Georgia]--
Speaker 2: Out of his--that's right, right.
Speaker 1: --and ran for governor and won.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, yeah, yep, so.
Speaker 1: So you got like--
Speaker 2: But then you have Maynard Jackson who came in, first black mayor--
Speaker 1: Yeah, first black mayor of--
Speaker 2: --so you had that stark contrast, so you had the, the glory days of the segregationists and the Dixiecrats on top of that, you have the Maynard Jacksons and the Andrew--
Speaker 1: Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young]--
Speaker 2: --Youngs and the, Ralph David Abernathy [Ralph Abernathy], those individuals operating in the same space, which was amazing.
Speaker 1: Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] becomes president.
Speaker 2: Jimmy Carter becomes president yeah, (laughter), right, right.
Story_ID: 667333
Speaker 1: And during my time at Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia], speaking of that, I needed to make some extra money and became introduced to Mary Kay Cosmetics [Mary Kay Inc.] and became a Mary Kay beauty consultant under the direction of Ruell Cone who being the first national sales director in Mary Kay and I became a director in the company, this was all when I was in college and graduating from college and one of my dear friends was another budding beauty consultant to become a director, Juanita Abernathy [Juanita Jones Abernathy] and so I've known her you know, forty years (laughter) and we--
Speaker 2: Now this is the wife of--?
Speaker 1: This is the wife of Ralph David Abernathy [Ralph Abernathy] and we are friends to this--our families are friends to this day; so her husband and my ex-husband [Mickarl Thomas, Sr.] are very good friends, they're both Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity].  I've stayed at her house many a year, sadly this year I went down to bury her son who passed away and she was here to help me bury my son [Mickarl Thomas, Jr.], so we're just, we're kindred spirits.  We've known each other a long time, the whole, our families.
Speaker 2: This is like post Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and--?
Speaker 1: Yes, this was, I met her in 1972, 1972 when she and I were both becoming directors in the company and we became fast friends and we've been friends ever since.  So I've been to her home and seen pictures of Dr. King.  I've, I've met Coretta Scott King as a result of being in her home and Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] and others.  I went to her husband's funeral in 1990, 1990 and so we just, we go a long way back.  I've brought her up here to speak to my events, so that, that is a result of Emory and result of working for a direct selling company that offered me some opportunities to meet some incredible people.
Speaker 2: Now was Mrs. Abernathy and Mrs. King close?
Speaker 1: They were in their own way, obviously soldiers in this struggle, their husbands you know, were, were buddies, best friends and Dr. Abernathy was Dr. King's closest associate in the movement, was a prolific writer and a different personality, obviously, but still same, on the same mission, so they, they shared that commonality, both of them had four children, so that was in keeping with that, you know, they were at home taking care of the kids while their husbands were either in jail or marching or walking and so that was something that they shared together.
Story_ID: 667334
Speaker 1: You were saying off camera that you were the--
Speaker 2: I, I'm the only one in my immediate family who did not go to a historically black college [HBCU].  My mother [Gwendolyn Charleston Copeland] went to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] for two years then transferred to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  My dad [Wilson Copeland, Sr.] graduated from Virginia State College for Negroes, which now is known as Virginia State University [Petersburg, Virginia].  My brother [Wilson Copeland II] graduated from Fisk University then went to Vanderbilt law school [Vanderbilt University Law School, Nashville, Tennessee].  My sister-in-law, his wife, went to Fisk and my children went to historically black colleges, Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], Tuskegee [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], my son [Mickarl Thomas, Jr.] had he lived, would have gone to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], had a full academic scholarship to go to Morehouse.  I'm the outlier and I went to Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, now Mary Kay Cosmetics [Mary Kay Inc.]-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is significant in your life it's, it's like Avon [Avon Products Inc.] it's a, where you do door to door sales and--
Speaker 2: Direct selling--
Speaker 1: --direct selling cosmetics--
Speaker 2: --direct selling, yeah.
Speaker 1: --of cosmetics--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to, mainly to women I guess?
Speaker 2: Mostly, yeah.
Speaker 1: Mostly women, yeah--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and now I don't think of Mary Kay, does, they don't make anything for men do, do they at all?
Speaker 2: They do, yeah they have--
Speaker 1: Do they--
Speaker 2: --they have a men's line as far as I know, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Actually they had a men's line when I was still in the business.  It's now expanded so I'm sure it's probably pretty robust.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is something that, I was kind of, I said, it's kind of unusual for a college woman to be in, in, involved with Mary Kay sales.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: I know that you had even won a pink Cadillac?
Speaker 2: I won a pink Regal [Buick Regal] (laughter).
Speaker 1: A Regal, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, I, I know a woman [HistoryMaker Charlene Jordan], we, we interviewed a woman in Denver [Colorado], a bunch older than you who won the Cadillac.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: She had a beauty shop in Five Points in Denver.
Speaker 2: Okay, I know Five Points, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: She owned a whole block of Five Points.  She was largely uneducated--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --came out of Arkansas--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --she did, she, she had a beauty shop--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --expanded and she just methodically--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --and the thing, I guess the common denominator with anybody, any Mary Kay salesperson who wins a car--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --is hard work.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a lot of hard work, it certainly is, and team building, so you become a team leader.  You don't win it on your own, you win it because of the people who you motivate to sell and so you work together, but I think the point for me going back to my heritage was I saw and knew other black women who were successful.  It's important to know that Ruell Cone recruited me as a young nineteen year old, eighteen, nineteen year old wanting to make something in that business even though I was in college.  So I saw her as a role model and she was doing very well at that time.  I met Juanita Abernathy [Juanita Jones Abernathy].  I met other women and I guess the common denominator for us, even though I was quite young and they were older than I, is that we were all ministers' wives.  So these were ministers' wives going in this business so that you obviously had your duties and responsibilities and at that time my former husband [Mickarl Thomas, Sr.] began pastoring a church, he was like an assistant pastor at one A.M.E. church [African Methodist Episcopal] in Atlanta [Georgia] and then got his own church in Columbus, Georgia [Allen Temple A.M.E. Church] where we would commute back and forth, but for me the world of Mary Kay was beyond Mary Kay herself, who I had met several times.  It was knowing that there were black woman who I could look up to who were doing very well in that business and they happened to be ministers' wives, that was the thread.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, you, actually you tapped into kind of a network?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, so yeah, the church, you've got your, your friends that you're meeting elsewhere.  You've got school friends, so you have that, that whole combination.  I use to give facials to my classmates (laughter) and you know to other people.  I'd go into beauty shops and, and give facials.  I would go into the housing developments otherwise known as projects in Atlanta, you know, thought of, perceived to be rough neighborhoods, would go in there, they were great people.  I'd make a little bit of money; they would escort me back to my car.  I never had anything happen to me, never anything--so, so I've never had a fear of, of my own people because I know my people.  I know when they know that you're working hard and you're trying to make a living that they will do what they can to support you.

Speaker 1: So you're married and living in--this is in the mid-'70s [1970s] I guess?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, married in 1973, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, living in Atlanta [Georgia]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and Atlanta is becoming the, has become the mecca for black America I guess at that point (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simulataneous) (Laughter) Right, and then we left, my husband [Copeland Thomas' ex-husband, Mickarl Thomas, Sr.] was transferred to another church in Pennsylvania, so in 1976 I, at that point had just given birth to my, my child in June of 1976, then in November around that time he was transferred to a church in Pennsylvania, in Norristown, Pennsylvania, Mt. Zion A.M.E. Church and--
Speaker 1: Now Norristown has a lot of history, the Underground Railroad history and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, lot of South Carolinians, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and the A.M.E. church [African Methodist Episcopal] has to be historic you know--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, been there a while, yes, yeah there have been lots of people from South Carolina in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], in the Philadelphia, Norristown area, right.
Speaker 1: That's where, that's where [HistoryMaker] Charles Blockson grew up, the Underground Railroad historian.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: When we first started hearing about William Still--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and the Underground Railroad out of Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: Wow, yes, yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so at any rate so, how was Norristown?
Speaker 2: It was wonderful.  It, we were there from 1976 until 1981 when we moved to Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of the church in Norristown?
Speaker 2: Mount Zion A.M.E. Church--
Speaker 1: Was that the original church there or--?
Speaker 2: I think it is, I'm not sure of its age but yeah it's been there for quite a while, a wonderful family church and good people.  I remember the food (laughter) and that, that, actually in that, at that church that was the place where I really--I'd had a taste of it in Columbus [Georgia], but I really had a taste of it in, in Norristown that hasn't been replicated up here where people would really invite you over for dinner on Sunday. Now part of it was because the pastor was the pastor and obviously I was invited for that purpose, but even in Columbus we had friends who would--there was a big deal about having Sunday dinner and, and inviting your friends over for Sunday dinner or family members, that, that was a tradition hopefully that continues on in Columbus and it definitely was in play in, in Norristown in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of the church in Columbus just--I shouldn't skip over them--
Speaker 2: Allen, sure, Allen Temple--
Speaker 1: Allen Temple, right.
Speaker 2: --A.M.E. Church [Allen Temple A.M.E. Church, Columbus, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Named after the great Richard Allen--
Speaker 2: Yes, yep, where Brother Johnnie Walker would line the hymns (laughter) and start us off in prayer, yes, I remember him deeply (laughter), right.
Speaker 1: So, okay, all right, okay, so okay, so--
Speaker 2: And I, I also remember Allen Temple, I give them full credit because they gave me a church baby shower and you know, bought many of the things I needed for the church, yeah.  I've, I've had wonderful people to come my way and to help out.  In Pennsylvania where we lived in the parsonage my next door neighbor was a pharmaceutical salesman, so he would truckload--in a little wagon he'd bring over the Enfamil, or the milk that I needed for my, at that point I had twins, so for the kids that I had brought into this world, so just always, I just always had wonderful people to help out along the way, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now Norristown, what did you do, you're, you're still selling Mary Kay?
Speaker 2: I was in Mary Kay [Mary Kay Inc.], I was doing Mary Kay full time, so I had three children, my twins were born in August, August 7th, 1979 and so at that point in Norristown I had three kids (laughter), three little kids--
Speaker 1: Wow, okay--
Speaker 2: --and--
Speaker 1: --that's, that's a full time job in itself--
Speaker 2: --that's, that's full time; I was working Mary Kay and as a director and taking care of kids and juggling (laughter), doing a lot of juggling, right.
Speaker 1: Now were you doing anything with your vocal training?
Speaker 2: No, singing in church (laughter) in the pews and a little solo work, I'd do that, but didn't really pursue that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite song that you sung?
Speaker 2: 'How Tedious and Tasteless the Hours' (laughter).
Speaker 1: 'How Tedious and Tasteless the Hours' (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'And Tasteless the Hours,' that was one of them; that just came to mind (laughter).  I had others, but that was one I sang a lot in Norristown.
Story_ID: 667336
Speaker 1: Now from Norristown [Pennsylvania] where, where did you go?
Speaker 2: So in Norristown we were there from 1981, I'm sorry, 1976 until 1981, then my husband at that time was transferred to Charles Street A.M.E. Church in Boston [Massachusetts]; so we moved here in 1981, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So that's a very different kind of a move?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was a big move for him.
Speaker 1: From Norristown to Boston, so is Charles Street a big church?
Speaker 2: It's a big church; yeah it was a very historic church had been pastored by Reverend Walter C. Davis who was a very well known, prominent minister in the area.  He had been pastor for many years, followed by Donald Luster, Reverend Donald Luster, who was the pastor for a shorter period of time, it's kind of hard to follow a legend like Walter C. Davis and then following Reverend Luster was my ex-husband, Mickarl Thomas, Sr., um-hm, M-I-C-K-A-R-L, D. Thomas, D period Thomas, Sr.
Speaker 1: All right, so Charles Street A.M.E.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now is that, where is that located in Boston?
Speaker 2: It's on Warren [Street] and Elm Hill Street [sic. Elm Hill Avenue], in the Dorchester section of Boston, in the black Dorchester section of Boston.  The church goes back to 1833, so it is an historic church. This is--
Speaker 1: Yeah that is the Boston A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church.
Speaker 2: Right, right, it's second location they used to be on Charles Street and they actually grew out of the African Meeting House [Boston, Massachusetts], so that, that's, their origins are in the African Meeting House; they set up shop on Charles Street and then moved to the present location at Warren and Elm Hill, but their origins go back to 1833.
Speaker 1: Up on Beacon Hill [Boston, Massachusetts], yeah--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Geez, okay, so this is--so you said you had--now at some point you started going to North- Northeastern [Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts] right to work on an M.B.A.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, I, I was working actively with Mary Kay [Mary Kay Inc.] (cough), excuse me, my children were entering kindergarten and preschool and Boston was still smoldering from desegregation and a lot of racial tension.  You were advised, when we moved here not to go into South Boston [Boston, Massachusetts] because of the rancorous attitudes and behaviors towards blacks at that time.  The sad part is that years before and I have friends here in the city who said, we use to go to Carson Beach, that's in South Boston, we use to go there and, and swim, but now we can't even go there because the racial tension was so high and that was because of the busing that took place in Boston, so that's what I moved into.  I have a child going into kindergarten, I've got two little kids coming afterwards, so we've got to make decisions about where we're going to live and where my kids are gonna go to school.
Speaker 1: See this is something that people were confused at I think nationally looking at Boston because we, we always associated Boston with the Kennedys and you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --it being Massachusetts liberal and that sort of thing and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --it seemed like Boston started going backwards from what people perceived it to be anyway.
Speaker 2: Right, well, it was because of the desegregation--the court ordered busing that was administered and enforced and the reaction of some of the communities in Boston including those in South Boston probably Charlestown [Boston, Massachusetts] as well and probably parts of Dorchester that did not want blacks going to school there, so you had a smaller population in Boston that had always been here, but not to the large numbers that we'd seen in Detroit [Michigan] and Chicago [Illinois]; so when you move that population school wise and, and bus them into communities that are not use to black kids and you have problems and they had big problems where the famous picture that we have of the, the, the, the flag pole--
Speaker 1: With Ted Landsmark [HistoryMaker Theodore C. Landsmark]--
Speaker 2: --with Ted Landsmark, yeah, being almost stabbed with a--he wasn't stabbed, but almost stabbed, but hurt with that, those kinds of things bubble up.  So that was in my head when we moved here.  That was--all those scenes were all in my head and as a result we first moved outside of the city, we lived in a townhouse, rental townhouse in Norwood, Massachusetts for about eleven months.
Story_ID: 667337
Speaker 1: We looked around, I remember looking at a--these were going to be parsonages that, a parsonage that the church would purchase and looking at a parsonage, a possible parsonage in West Roxbury, Massachusetts [West Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts], predominately white neighborhood, it was a lovely home, there were some lovely homes there and the church absolutely panicking, "Oh no, no," because of their recent history and not wanting to, to be subject to, to that kind of behavior, or me being, or my kids being subject to that kind of behavior, so we ended up moving to Middleton [Massachusetts] because the schools were decent and the housing inventory was plentiful and we, the church purchased a home in Middleton and that's where my children grew up, in Middleton, Mass and my older--my daughter started off at an independent school, The Park School [Brookline, Massachusetts] and ultimately went to, after five years there, went to public school in Middleton.  My twins always went to public school in Middleton and ironically now my daughter Michelle [Michelle Thomas Monteiro], Jerome's--Junior's wife, Junior who you've met, is a teacher's assistant in Middleton and her colleagues, some of them, are her former teachers.
Story_ID: 667338
Speaker 1: Now you pursued an M.B.A. from Northeastern [Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts] and you entered the program in 1983, what prompted that--?
Speaker 2: I was still in Mary Kay [Mary Kay Inc.], but I was looking beyond Mary Kay.  I didn't have the kind of success that some of my colleagues had had, certainly didn't have the success that Juanita Abernathy [Juanita Jones Abernathy] had had or Lenny Woods [ph.], or some of the other great black directors and then national sales directors, and, and I wanted to go back to school and business was an area that I wanted to pursue.  I just didn't have the money to go back to school.  Dr. Virgil Wood [Virgil A. Wood], I don't know if you've interviewed him, another great civil rights leader, minister, Baptist preacher, still living, was a friend of my husband's [Copeland Thomas' ex-husband, Mickarl Thomas, Sr.] at that time and was also the dean of the African American Institute [John D. O'Bryant African-American Institute] at Northeastern, I talked with him and, and said I'd love to go back to school, Northeastern is a school I would certainly like to look at, I don't have the money (laughter) tuition wise to go to school and he said, "You, you know there are opportunities to get a scholarship, so apply," which I did.  I did not do well on my GMAT [Graduate Management Admission Test] exams and they recommended I take them over again.  I did not take them over again, but I was accepted to Northeastern and I won a full scholarship, so I won a Martin Luther King scholarship [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Graduate Fellowship Program] to pay for everything except my books at Northeastern and that's how I was able to go back to school in 1983.
Speaker 1: Okay and at, at this juncture you're, you've really switched gears, you've gone into business right and not pursuing voice any longer--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --singing career?
Speaker 2: No, no, I'm, I'm fully engaged in the business world (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well who were some of your professors at Northeastern and what did you learn there?
Speaker 2: It was a two year rigorous program and I guess one professor who comes to mind is Jonathan Pond who was one of my accounting professors I believe, very colorful person, but a very enthusiastic person, one-- somebody I could relate to.  He also did a little bit of TV work.  He does TV work now if he's still--I'm sure he's still in the area, he would do little segments about saving money or you know, building your wealth, or those kinds of things and that I think as a result of the work he did at Northeastern, but he was just a very encouraging person and I, I had some tough classes.  I had, I, I, I failed two classes.  My first year, my first semester, I failed a statistics class and an accounting class, failed them flat and remember I'd been a very good student.  I'd never failed anything before, this was the first time I had ever failed in life and that drew me closer to the black students who were on that campus, other graduate students in the program; Willie Shellman who is a friend to this day, he is president of the Tuskegee Airmen New England Chapter [New England Chapter Tuskegee Airmen, Inc.] and others who took me under their wing and they said, "You're doing it wrong," (laughter). "First you all have to collaborate, you need to take this teacher, don't take that one, he's racist, take this one." So they schooled me in terms of who to take.  There was a loose affiliation of the black students and they didn't really have an association per se, but it was like the forerunner of the I guess, the student version of the National Black MBA Association of which I became a part of immediately after college, after graduate school, but these students and African students who were my classmates from Mali, I had two African students who I was in school with and I used to bring them to my house, cook for them and we'd sit at the dining room table in Middleton [Massachusetts] and study.  So I learned how to collaborate and work with others so that I could move ahead.  As I moved ahead they moved ahead also and I didn't have to do that in college because I was, it was more of an independent thrust and work that I did independently, but in graduate school is where I really learned how to work as a team and work in a team and realize that my success was not necessarily based on just me, it was based on me collaborating with other people.  So between the African students, the Jamaican students, a Seventh-day Adventists, I remember--oh he was brilliant.  He was actually one time teaching, I can't think of his name right now, but he was teaching the class and the teacher was mesmerized and said, "Wait, wait a minute, I'm teaching this class," (laughter). So I had some brilliant people, a lot of guys, who were my friends and we helped each other to get through.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Also, Dr. Bill Tita [William Tiga Tita], T-I-T-A, an African American from Africa originally, he is still living and he was my advisor in grad school and so I also give him credit.
Story_ID: 667339
Speaker 1: Was there anything special about graduation? Did you receive any honors [from Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, It was--
Speaker 1: Or anything--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, but I guess one thing I should mention, in 1984 in order for me to graduate on time in 1985--and one thing I did during that time, again, I was juggling, I was still doing Mary Kay [Mary Kay Inc.], I've got little kids, my husband [Copeland Thomas' ex-husband, Mickarl Thomas, Sr.] at that time was hosting annual conference one year, I remember vividly going to two classes, no, two church services, this is one day, two church services, I had my hat on, I would scoot off and go to class, kept the hat on, walk in class with this church hat, people are sort of looking and then two papers I had to turn in and I did them all in one day, so that tested how far I could do--go, and what I could do in the midst of a twenty-four hour time period.  The thing that really helped out tremendously were my church members.  They were my backbone.  They took care of my kids.  They babysat for me.  They said, "We know what you're doing, we know you're trying to pursue this degree, you go off and do what you have to do, we'll take care of the kids." And so it was really that kind of support that really got me through that process.  Also, the summer of 1984, my mother and father-in-law were in Detroit [Michigan] and realized that I had to go to summer school.  I had to go to summer school to graduate to make up for those classes I had failed and they said, "We'll take--," my mother-in-law--and they're from Alabama, these are Alabama black people and just the salt of the earth and they said, "We'll take the kids, we'll drive them back to Detroit so that you will have the summer to study and do what you have to do." That's why I graduate, graduated on time and I will--and they're both gone now, but I will always honor and respect them and my mother and father-in-law for seeing what I wanted to do and providing that opportunity for me and I say that because this past summer I took care of my grandkids and people said, "Wow, you kept them all summer?" "Yes, because my mother-in-law did the same thing for me and (simultaneous)"--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, you're paying it forward.
Speaker 2: I'm paying it forward, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I truly believe in that.
Story_ID: 667340
Speaker 1: Following your graduation in 1985, it says here and correct me if I'm wrong, you joined The Gillette Company?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so graduation was fun because my parents [Gwendolyn Charleston Copeland and Wilson Copeland, Sr.] were both here, they came and, came and celebrated me.  I don't know, no, my kids pictures are on the wall, I, my picture is somewhere else, where I was graduating, but my parents were here, my favorite uncle came up, my grandfather's brother, who was a high school principal, a celebrated high school principal in Columbus, Georgia, so much so they have a new building of that high school and we were there for family reunion this summer and they have a big bust of him in the lobby of the school.  It's heartrending, just heart full to see that--heartfelt to see that.  So they were all up for my graduation, my kids were there.  It was just, really a fun time.  I had interviewed, I wanted to go into the corporate world, so I interviewed and had a tough, rigorous interview process at The Gillette Company, there were about six hundred people for a handful of assistant product manager jobs at Gillette; they typically went to Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] and the top business schools to get their candidates and we were considered a B school, a B rated school; so I interviewed, I remember going to dinner with one of the officials from Gillette at one point and time.  My husband [Copeland Thomas' ex-husband, Mickarl Thomas, Sr.] was with me and I knew that was a test to see how I eat (laughter).  It was at Maison Robert [Boston, Massachusetts], which is an upscale restaurant, it's now a Ruth's Chris restaurant [Ruth's Chris Steak House] and so I guess I passed that test because I got the job.
Speaker 1: Now who would have thought that you know, I guess I'm, I didn't go; I don't have a M.B.A., but that, that's, I'm surprised to hear that.
Speaker 2: Oh that's a test.
Speaker 1: The test was to see how you eat?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  How, how does, how does she interact, you know, how does she get along with the people at the table, that was, I knew that was all a part of it, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's part of doing big business.  You have to--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --wine and dine people if you don't know where your (laughter) items are on the table--
Speaker 2: Which fork to pick up or whatever, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, it's you--yeah.
Speaker 2: So I knew immediately that's what it was all about and you know what kind of food to order and all that, so it's, it's something that they're not gonna admit to, but you know that's part of the process, yeah.
Speaker 1: So a, a clod like me would sit there and eat with the wrong fork and would be immediately, you know, a line would be drawn through his name you know, right, he can't handle--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Next, (laughter).
Speaker 1: --clients, you know.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Get that form letter (laughter), right.
Speaker 1: So Gillette, this is the famous Gillette Company that makes razor blades?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Based here in Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Right.  So I worked for their personal care division and I was on one of their lower brands, not their high brands, but some of their lower brands working at the bottom as an assistant product manager, so that was my first foray, foray into Corporate America.  It was a mixed blessing.  I didn't last that long.  I was there maybe a year or so, probably had been an entrepreneur or in the Mary Kay [Mary Kay Inc.] space too long.  I challenged authority.  I challenged my boss (laughter), you don't do that in 1985 (laughter) and so I didn't last, I was fired (laughter) in 1986.
Speaker 1: Now was there, was there a specific incident that, well I know, or, or well was it just in general--?
Speaker 2: Well they get you on performance you know, they'll, they'll start writing you up on missing your deadlines or missing goals, we had, we had lots of paperwork to turn in, meetings to attend, goals to meet, personal goals to meet, so they, they, there's a way that you know, that can be positioned where you're, you're not a good fit for the, for the organization.
Story_ID: 667341
Speaker 1: Now what does--I guess I, I should have asked this question a little earlier but, what does an M.B.A. do for a businessperson that experience wouldn't do for instance, you know, or, or how does it boost your capacity to conduct business because there was a time, I remember a time when there were no M.B.A.'s.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You never heard about them.
Speaker 2: Right, right
Speaker 1: And then all of a sudden maybe in the--
Speaker 2: Seventies [1970s]--
Speaker 1: --mid-'70s [1970s]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: the '70s [1970s]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the '70s [1970s] just everybody's you know, now it seems--
Speaker 2: Flocking--
Speaker 1: --everybody's flocking to get an M.B.A.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  I, I think it gives you maybe the, the, the, the confidence and the intellectual underwear to, to assess business deals (laughter) and, and to make business decisions that will help your business to go forward; but if you look at Steve Jobs and you look at a lot of the incredible individuals they don't even have college degrees, let alone a business degree, so for me because I had been in music, you know I had been doing Mary Kay [Mary Kay Inc.], so I was doing all the ground work in terms of business, but I didn't have the, the educational preparation as a business person from my perspective to succeed in business, so the M.B.A. degree [from Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts] gave me that, it gave me that underpinning.  Now I'm grateful to, to Mary Kay, even though I didn't make thousands and millions of dollars, but I did have that business foundation that I needed to success.  I had the music foundation from Velma Froude, where the show must go on regardless, you have to perform no matter how, how badly you feel, so all of that, I had my parents  you know, their teachings.  "You have a heritage," my mother [Gwendolyn Charleston Copeland] telling me that all the time and my father [Wilson Copeland, Sr.], "You only got a B, what, not an A?" So I had all of that behind me so this was like finishing school, this was a way for me to bring it all together and hopefully, I thought, to succeed in Corporate America, that was what I thought.  I'm not cut out for Corporate America even though corporations are my clients, so I'm interfacing with corporations like I did this today all the time, but I'm doing it as an outsider.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
