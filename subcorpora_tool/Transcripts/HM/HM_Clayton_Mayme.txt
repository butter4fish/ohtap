Speaker 2: Oh yes, around the latter part of 1800s.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1890s?
Speaker 2: Yeah, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what do you know about her side of the family?  How far back can you trace your ancestors on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see.  My mother was born in Van Buren, well, Van Buren, Arkansas and her father, John Knight, was born in Texas, and he was the son of a plantation owner in Texas.  And my grandmother is a Creek Indian [Native American] and she was born--she lived in Oklahoma, but I think she came from somewhere down in Texas and then settled in Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there, are there any stories from that side of the family about, about your, your grandfather and the plantation, or about your grandmother that was the Creek Indian?
Speaker 2: Well, they just--my grandfather, he looked like a white man and my grandmother was this Creek Indian.  And they, they said that he--the, the white people in the town told him that he'd better hurry up and marry somebody because they didn't, you know, they didn't--couldn't tell him from the white people there in town.  So he went to Oklahoma and found my grandmother and married her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, any stories--did he tell any stories about slavery, or anything like that, or any of those kind of stories come down through the family?
Speaker 2: I don't remember anything about slavery.  I just remember that he used to--he had this farm.  He was a farmer himself and he had this huge farm and we used to go and help him pick strawberries and, on the farm and I would--I saw the other kids going to his farm and working and I wanted to do that.  So, he let me go and pick strawberries for him and I started pulling up the whole vines with, with the strawberries.  And he said, well, I think you better go and help your grandmother.  So he took me inside to work with her because I had never picked strawberries before and that was my first experience on a farm.  And he used to sell cotton.  They had cotton pickers and he had a regular farm and he would stack the cotton up on a wagon and take it uptown, you know, to sell all the cotton.  And I remember seeing this man sitting way up high on all this cotton going to town and it was very interesting to see him.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your grandfather's farm was in Arkansas, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you know why he moved from Texas to Arkansas?  Is there any story behind that?
Speaker 2: The only thing I know is that he had another brother and he came to Arkansas first and then, then my grandfather followed him and came to Arkansas and they both were farmers.
Story_ID: 218955
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Mary Knight Agnew] talk about growing up in Arkansas?  Did she talk about what kind of life she had growing up?
Speaker 2: Well she just went to--they had a little school, a very small school and she, she did--I think she finished the ninth or tenth grade in school.  But she was a very intelligent person and I remember her when she was talking about her--she used to sing in the choir, I remember that.  And we had a Baptist church in Van Buren [Arkansas] and she attended that all of the time.  And I remember she used to write poetry and it was some beautiful poetry that she, you know, she wrote.  But she mostly--after she married my father [Jerry Agnew, Sr.] she worked in the store with him.  We had a grocery store.

Speaker 1: Okay.  So is Van Buren close to Fort Smith?
Speaker 2: Five miles.
Speaker 1: And this is the "wild west" part of Arkansas, right?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I guess you might say so because it was--they had some very I guess wild stories about Arkansas at that time.  But my father was the only black to have a store.  It was general merchandise.  It was a huge store.  On one side of the store he had a big warehouse, and he would store things in there and when he got ready to use them.  And the part where he had the groceries and the meat and everything, it was really huge, and people all over Van Buren and Alma, Arkansas, a lot of people in surrounding cities would come there to buy groceries.  And a lot of people worked on the railroad there.  And they had an ice plant and everybody would come and they'd charge whatever he'd get.  You know, he just took care of the whole community there with his store.

Speaker 2: How'd they what?
Speaker 1: How did your mother and father meet?  Is there, is there a story about, about that?

And they had a nice big home in Van Buren.  It was on the hill.  And they raised chickens and they had their, you know, hogs, and just had all kinds of things that, you know, to survive on.  But he went to school, as a matter-of-fact, he went to college at Arkansas Baptist College [Little Rock, Arkansas].  And when he came out of college he opened up this grocery store in Van Buren.

And she met my grandfather and they married and they mostly were entrepreneurs.  You know, they always had, always had some kind of business.  And when my father went to Arkansas Baptist College [Little Rock, Arkansas] he really came and built, put up this fabulous building in Van Buren [Arkansas] and the store that he had in Fort Smith [Arkansas], he bought this--the building from, I think I want to say Joshenberger [ph.].  He bought the building from him.  And my uncle would run the store in Fort Smith and my father ran the store in Van Buren.

Story_ID: 218960
Speaker 1: Do you have a earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, I remember that I went to school with--the grocery store [in Van Buren, Arkansas] was right across the street from the school and my house was next to the grocery store and we had, there was a big lot and then we had our house next to that.  And I used to slip off and go to school and my parents [Mary Knight Agnew and Jerry Agnew, Sr.] would be out looking for me and I was away in the school.  They would knock on all the schoolrooms and see what room I was in.  They always knew where to find me because I loved to watch the kids when they come out for recess, I would slip over there, walk over there.  I was small I must have been about four or five years old.
Speaker 1: So you wanted to get to school early.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess so (laughter).  But, they'd always know where to find me because I would always go (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember when I was in school that we didn't have like a library of books.  We never had anything, any black books in the libraries, all about whites, you know.  And the history of Arkansas, and some of the wonderful people that came from Arkansas, they would have books about them, but they never did have anything hardly about blacks.  I think they might have had maybe Booker T. Washington and they might have had, you know, Frederick Douglass, but other than that, we didn't have a lot of black books in our library for us to read, you know.  And they--we had a marching band and when I was in high school [Frederick Douglas High School; Frederick Douglass School, Van Buren, Arkansas] I used to play the saxophone in the band and I remember Bob Burns came to Van Buren [Arkansas] and he had just made a film out here in California, and the picture was going to be shown in Little Rock, Arkansas, so what he did, he got a whole bus and took us all down to Little Rock to see the picture and I think they had like a parade that day and the band played in his parade, but Bob Burns was a, he was a very, well he was a comic, you know, he did, he used to do a lot of comedy and he made several pictures and he kind of put Van Buren on the map, you know, because nobody ever heard of Van Buren until he came to Hollywood to start making pictures and (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay, now what's his name again?
Speaker 2: Bob Burns.
Speaker 1: Bob Burns.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Story_ID: 218961
Speaker 1: What were the sights, and sounds and smells of growing up [in Van Buren, Arkansas]?
Speaker 2: The sights and sounds in Arkansas, you're saying?
Speaker 1: In your neighborhood, the sights and sounds and smells of growing up.
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see, well we had a movie house.  We'd go to movies every Saturday and spend the day in the movies and I remember one very funny incident that happened.  My sister [Sarah Agnew Davis] had gone to the movies and somehow, you know, my father [Jerry Agnew, Sr.] he'd just bought these brand new shoes for her and she put her foot upon the banister and her shoe fell down on the whites.  You know whites were all downstairs and we were up in the balcony.  And she lost her shoe and my father went back up to the theater and looked for the shoe and she was afraid to go in there and ask for assistance because her shoe slipped off and she might have hit somebody on the head, you know, she didn't know.  So, anyway, he went up there and he got the shoe because he said he just paid for those shoes, he wasn't going to let her lose those shoes.  It was really a very brave thing for him to do up there to go and ask a white manager, you know, to get her shoe.  But I remember that was a very funny incident to happen.
Speaker 1: Were you in the balcony with her when she dropped it?
Speaker 2: No, she was--she had gone to the movies that day with some other friends and I guess she was just trying to be cute, you know, and put that foot up there (laughter) and her shoe slipped off her foot.
Speaker 1: Now, any other sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, you know we use to have barbeques and we had--we used to do minstrel shows and we had a little tent and people would go in there and they'd put on some acts.  It was very, very funny, you know.  Because I do remember those people, they would come in with their makeup on and with the dancing clothes on and it was very exciting.  Of course we had carnivals that use to come and they would rent my father's lot and have a carnival.  He had a lot across the street from the store and it was huge, a very big lot.  We had a lot of carnivals and they used to have like midnight rambles.  It was a very wonderful time--experiencing.
Story_ID: 218962
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was a midnight ramble?
Speaker 2: Well that's when they have a show at midnight and we would have all the dances out there and singers and then we had a wonderful--it was just like a vaudeville, you know, they would have all kinds of people, comics, so they would have that at twelve o'clock at night, that's the reason they called it midnight ramble.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the performers that performed there, do you remember any of people that came through?
Speaker 2: Well, they traveled with the carnival, so, you know, I didn't remember their names, I know, but all these people were part of the carnival.  And they had their own band and they had their own musicians and that, they just had, you know, a group singers and dancers, just entertained.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, I was just asking about the performers because I just wondered if any of the big name black performers came through, you know, (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: No, you know they were just (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Bessie Smith or maybe somebody like that, or Clarence Smith [Pinetop Smith] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: They were carnival people and I wouldn't, I wouldn't remember their names.  I just know that they were great performers.  And so I reached age I wasn't permitted to go to the midnight rambles, you know.  My parents [Mary Knight Agnew and Jerry Agnew, Sr.] wouldn't let us go until--because in the first place you had to stay up until midnight to see the show (laughter), and that wasn't permitted at that time.  But when I did get old enough to go, they put on some very interesting shows (laughter).
Speaker 1: So these--there were groups of black performers that would just travel around the South to different towns and do shows?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well they would travel with the carnival.  That was just part of that, that, of the carnival and (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: How many times a year would they show up?
Speaker 2: Probably about three times, three for four times a year they would come and rent my father's land and have a carnival there, so probably about three or four times a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What other things would be in the carnival besides performers?
Speaker 2: Let's see, they had people that would, had people would, they would have snakes and animals like monkeys and things of that nature and they would perform with those, with snakes and things.  And, let's see what else did they have, they had, well of course they had dogs that jumped through hoops, just a lot of different things they would have.  And of course they had the Ferris wheel and the--all kinds of different little rides that you could pay, you paid to ride in.  And that was very entertaining for kids you know, because--and of course they had food, you know, like snow cones and they had popcorn and they had ice cream and hot dogs.  You know kids wanted to eat something while they were at the carnival and they had it.  And people would shoot guns trying to win a prize.  It was entertaining.  It didn't cost a whole lot of money (laughter).
Story_ID: 218963
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a little girl?  What kind of little girl were you?
Speaker 2: I was a tomboy.  I used to play baseball with the boys and I was just kind of, I was the kind that had to have a pair of shoes every two weeks.  But the first, the first two weeks had soles and then after that threw them away because (laughter) I was just kind of a rough kid.  I like to, I like to play ball and basketball, whatever; whatever they were playing I would like to--I was very athletic.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  (Off-camera noise) That's interesting (laughter).  Okay, so what else did you like?  Did you, you said you liked to sneak off to school when you were real little.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that was when I was real young.  I was about five years old.  And they had this, this lady use to watch me, her name was Mayme Zachery [ph.], and she was kind of like somebody that was supposed to keep up with us, you know, while my mother [Mary Knight Agnew] and father [Jerry Agnew, Sr.] worked in the store; she was at the house to see after us.  And I would slip off from her and go across the street.  I remember my father--my mother told me one time that I was I guess I, I must have been about three or four months old and my mother had me in bed and she had me all wrapped up and I kept crying she said.  And so they finally called the doctor.  So the doctor just came and took off all my clothes and, and ran--put me in a dishpan and put me under the hydrant and just ran cold water on me.  And I stopped crying after that because they had me too hot (laughter).  I guess some of those, you know, that's the way some of the older people, they always liked to keep you warm.  But I remember her telling me that's what happened to me when I was a baby.
Speaker 1: Yeah, people still do that.  They cover babies up too much.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They put too much on them (laughter).  But if you know somebody going to come and snatch your clothes off and put you in a dishpan and, and put you up under the hydrant and just let the hydrant run over you--cold water (laughter).  But it cooled me down.  So I, you know, they didn't do that anymore (laughter).

Speaker 2: Yeah, it served as everything.  We only had four, I think it was four rooms.  We had four rooms and it was elementary and high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: I loved math.  I did, I did all right in math.  And then I liked story, you know, reading.  I loved English too.  So I guess those two were my favorite subjects.  Of course I always loved recess, you know.  So you could play.
Speaker 1: Right, so you, you really liked to ball and all that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, stuff like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did, did they have any organized athletic activities for girls then?
Speaker 2: No, you just go out on the playground and if you wanted to play ball you could play ball, if you wanted to play--they didn't, they didn't have any organized games.  They would, you know, little games, everybody would hold hands and go around in a circle and just sing those songs you, you would sing as kids you know.  But they never had any organized, nothing; they--we didn't even have a girls' baseball, girls' softball team.  So we just played, you know, wherever you wanted to.  They had, had football for the boys and they had baseball for the boys, but nothing special for the girls.
Speaker 1: Okay.  No basketball?
Speaker 2: No.  I played basketball when I went to Arkansas Baptist College [Little Rock, Arkansas] the first year.  I went there for one year and I played on the basketball, basketball team, but I had had no training so I, I, I didn't know that the girls had to just dribble up half court and I, I'd be dribbling all the way down to the, you know, down the court, but didn't, you know, they taught me how to really play girls' basketball, because I'd been playing with the boys, you know.
Speaker 1: So you didn't know you weren't supposed to do that?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).  No.  I, I had no idea.  I just I felt I was supposed to do like you do when you're playing with the boys, you know, but they had certain rules for girls and certain rules for boys.
Speaker 1: At the time did you think that that was, those rules were necessary, or did you think it was just (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: No, I thought, I thought if you wanted to play basketball, just go ahead and go all the way the court, why stop at half court.  And then we had to pass the ball or do something like that to people in the other court, you know, you had to pass the ball.  But anyway, that was, that was the rules at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I guess it's changed now, because I watch these athletes playing basketball now and they go all the way down the court, these ladies.
Story_ID: 218965
Speaker 1: Tell me about your teachers at [Frederick] Douglass [School; Frederick Douglass High School, Van Buren, Arkansas]?
Speaker 2: My teachers--when I was in the first grade, we had a lady named Rosie Mac [ph.], Mrs. Rosie Mac was my first grade teacher.  She was the first teacher that I had.  And then I went when I got out of that room I went to Mrs. Wade, Josephine Wade [ph.].  And when I got out of that room I was like in junior high and I had--the principal's name was Torrence [ph.], Professor Torrence.  And we had another room for music, you know, the last room was with Mr. Rice [ph.] and he, he was a music teacher and he's the one that taught band and for the band, people who wanted to play in the band, and also it was a Mr. Brewer [ph.] that helped with the band and, you know, I just went through four, four rooms (laughter).  And I guess some of it stuck with me because (laughter) I find that a lot of the things that I learned how to do in the grocery store, like I would wait on the kids when they'd come in, that most of the kids just had a nickel to spend for lunch, so, you know, a nickel's worth of bologna and crackers.  So we'd, I'd go slice them off a couple slices of bologna and threw in some crackers (laughter), and that was their lunch.  But they just never did have any formal, like a cafeteria or anything like that in the school where I went.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who, who was the principal when you were there, or did it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Oh, well we had two at one time.  One was named Professor Torrence was one of the principals and another was Professor Wiley [ph.].  And they were the two that, that were principals when I was there at Douglass.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any other activities at Douglass to get involved in for, for the students?  Did they have like clubs and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Let me see, clubs, no they just had, they, they had band practice and then they had--we used to have, let's see, no they never did have any organized clubs while I was there.  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Because you said you had like four classrooms, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, four, four rooms in the, in the building, in the school.  And the first building [sic.] was elementary school, you know, like first grade through the, I guess it was the fourth grade, third grade.  And then you'd go to the next room that was with Mrs. Josephine Wade.  You learned--that was from the third, fourth grade on up to got to sixth grade.  And then we'd get into professor--the principal's room, that would be Professor Torrence, you're learning algebra, let's see, that's when I took algebra and I took advanced English and Latin and it was--so that's the way they had it broken down so that you could get your sixteen units in, for, for high school.

Speaker 2: Not too many.  My dad [Jerry Agnew, Sr.] wouldn't let me do it too much, you know.  Sometimes, you know, somebody would have a party and maybe we, you know, they would drop us off there and pick us up, but we didn't have too many activities, mostly thing we'd go to church and we were there Sunday morning for Sunday school and then we'd stay for the morning service.  If there was anything in the afternoon we had to be back for that.  And then BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union of America] and then we had a service at night.  So we were at church all day on Sundays and because you know, there was always something.  We never did get to attend like a movie on Sundays.  They, they didn't believe us in going to movies on Sundays, so.  Everything was just around the church on Sundays.  Then of course, they had choir rehearsal on, on Thursday nights and then, you know, it, it was just so much activity going on around the church that was about the only thing we were able to do.  Now they would, they would have socials at the, at the church in the basement and I remember one time they had a dinner in the basement and everybody would bring food, like potluck.  And so my father was eating, eating his food and, and he say, hey--he was talking to my mother [Mary Knight Agnew], he said, "Mary, this is some good cornbread."  She said, "Shut up, that's Mrs. Johnson's [ph.] cake." (Laughter) He called it cornbread (laughter).  She, she had to hunch him and tell him to shut up (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  What, what, what was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: It was New Hope, New Hope Baptist Church [Van Buren, Arkansas].
Speaker 1: Okay, New Hope Baptist; did you like church?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--it was okay, you know, sometimes you get tired of doing the same thing, you know.  Other kids were going to the movies and other kids are doing other things on, on Sundays and we had to go to church, you know, but it was okay, you know.  It didn't hurt me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.

Speaker 1: Now when did you graduate from [Frederick Douglass] High School [Frederick Douglass School, Van Buren, Arkansas]?
Speaker 2: I graduated, I finished high school when I was sixteen.  And I went to Arkansas Baptist College [Little Rock, Arkansas].  My birthday was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Some that was like 1939 I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you went to Arkansas Baptist College?
Speaker 2: I went to Arkansas Baptist College when I was sixteen years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 2: --father went to.  Yeah, that was the only reason I went there because (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Is that still in existence?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Arkansas Baptist College.
Speaker 2: Yes, as far as I know it's still there on 16th [Street] and Bishop [Street].  I remember Mr., Mr. (unclear) Cobb [ph.] was the president of the Arkansas Baptist College and I lived in his home because he knew my father and I couldn't stay in the dormitory.  I stayed in his home and I know that he, he would always tell the girls, you're bound to lose your self-respect with dirt on your, with dirt on your--let's see what did he say, bound to lose your self-respect with rouge on your cheeks and dirt on your neck (laughter). He'd say--he told the girls that all the time.
Speaker 1: Rouge on your cheeks and dirt on your neck, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  With rouge on your cheeks and dirt on your neck, because it was a Baptist college and I guess he thought that was something.  But I stayed in the home and what we would do, we had to get up and prepare breakfast and, and then we'd help with dinner after school and after my classes and then (unclear) we'd go and do our homework.  But, but they were very nice to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you stayed there a year (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well what happened, why didn't you finish there?
Speaker 2: Well, my sister [Sarah Agnew Davis] went to Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri, so I had wait for her to, to finish and then I went to Lincoln University after that.  I guess I was about eighteen when I went to Lincoln University.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now how--did you like that better than Arkansas?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, at least they won't so strict.  I mean you could--they would have dances.  They would have a, a lot of little--more social activities they would have at Lincoln, because I knew they, the [U.S.] Army would send a band over there, their jazz band and some of the soldiers would come over there to dance with the, the students, with the girls.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is about 1941?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is after the start of the war [World War II, WWII] I guess--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --or around the time the war started.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 218968
Speaker 1: Most of the male students disappear during the war [World War II, WWII], or did--?
Speaker 2: No, they--yeah, yeah because a lot of them--they would just come to college [Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Missouri] to take courses, you know, and then they had to go back to the, to the [U.S.] Army, I mean they would, they would let them off to come and take some of the college courses and, but they didn't get to stay on campus.  They had to go to, I think it was Fort Lindenwood [sic. Fort Leonard Wood].  It was in Missouri.  They had a, a couple of big camps around there.  I know Jackie Robinson was in one of them.  He use to come over there all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you get, get a chance to meet him?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Well tell us about it, what happened and what was he like?
Speaker 2: Well, he was, he was, at that time he was in the Army, you know, and he would come over to the dances and he would dance with the girls.  He was very friendly, very nice guy.
Speaker 1: This is before he was real famous, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was just Jackie Robinson in the Army.  Of course, I think he had made, he had went to school at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] and played football and everybody had actually heard his name and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right
Speaker 2: --and knew of his reputation with playing, playing football and baseball, what--he hadn't you know, until he got out of the Army, he never did really join the [Brooklyn] Dodgers [Los Angeles Dodgers].  He wasn't a Dodger at that time.

Speaker 1: Did you end up graduation--graduating from Lincoln University [Jefferson City, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: No, I went there and, let's see, I was there three years and then I went to New York [New York] and I had a job in the photographic studio and I stayed in New York for a, a couple of years and then I met my husband, their father, Andrew Lee Clayton and we married and I came to California (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now, now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --in 1946.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Why did you leave Lincoln to go to New York, I mean, how did you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, it was just, just seemed to be where--actually I went to Baltimore, Maryland first--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: --Baltimore, Maryland and I worked over on, on Pennsylvania Avenue taking photographs.
Speaker 1: Now, now wait a minute, when did--tell us about when you learned how to take pictures?
Speaker 2: Okay, that was in probably '42 [1942], 1941, '42 [1942].
Speaker 1: Did you learn at Lincoln?  Is that where you learned?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't learn to take photographs at Lincoln, that was taught to me by Sterling Paige [ph.].  When I got to Baltimore he gave me a job in his studio.  And I worked in the (unclear) Studio.  They had one across the street from Small's Paradise [New York, New York], and they had a photographic studio and they taught me a lot about taking photographs and I worked in their studio a long time, about a year or more.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you still didn't tell us, now how did you end up leaving Lincoln though and going to Baltimore?
Speaker 2: Well, well I just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: What was the reason?
Speaker 2: --I went there because I, I went to Baltimore on a visit and when I got there, well, I ran into Sterling Paige and these, these other people around Baltimore and they wanted to teach me how to do photography.  And I just stayed there, just stayed in Baltimore (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now what, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --I just never did go back.
Speaker 1: --now what did your parents [Mary Knight Agnew and Jerry Agnew, Sr.] think about you not coming back?
Speaker 2: Well they--I was eight--almost, no I wasn't eighteen, but still they said if that's what I, you know, they didn't like it, they wanted me to finish college, but I didn't finish at that time.  I finished later (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But they didn't necessarily want you to be that far away?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, not by myself, no.  They thought that I should come home or either I should get back in school at that time, but, I guess, I guess I was just experimenting, you know, how certain things you want to experiment with and then--and I was very successful as a photographer.  I did pretty good.
Story_ID: 218970
Speaker 1: --Okay, so you started in Baltimore [Maryland] helping (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And then I went to New York [New York] and I worked in the studio, photographic studio.
Speaker 1: Now which one did you work in?
Speaker 2: In the (unclear) Studio.  It was--they had a, they had a photographic studio across the street from Small's Paradise [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, that's in Harlem [New York, New York], right, yeah?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so they taught me how to take still photos and everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you know, did you ever meet James Van Der Zee, or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: No, I never did meet him, but, you know, I had heard about him and I was in New York when Bill Robinson, we use to see him tap dancing all up and down Seventh Avenue (laughter).  He was quite an exciting guy.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he would just show up and dance sometimes?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just show up.  He use to come to Small's Paradise and I use to work across the street from Small's and when he'd come to town he was showing off, you know, tap dancing all over, maybe two or three blocks, tap dancing up and down the street, so.
Speaker 1: Now, did, did you know the Smith Brothers [Morgan Smith and Marvin Smith]?  They were photographers and artists too in Harlem.
Speaker 2: No, no I never knew them.
Speaker 1: Yeah, two twin brothers, black.
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't know them.  I never did meet them.
Story_ID: 218971
Speaker 1: Did you go over to the library in, in Harlem [New York, New York]?  Did you ever?
Speaker 2: We used to, let's see, you mean the Schomburg [Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't Schomburg then I don't think, yes, yes it was.  It was Schomburg then (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: I went there.  And also, yeah, I use to go there and I use to go to the basement and see all these books in the basement and just looked like they were kind of deteriorating.  They didn't look very good to me.  And later on that's when the Schomburg was taken over by the New York Public Library [NYPL] and they started getting those books up out of the basement at that time.  And I use to go to the Y [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Association].  They use to have a Y right on, right on the corner from the (unclear) Studio.  And, and they had a lot of activities.  And a lot of times we'd take the meals at the Y, YWCA and meet a lot of people there.
Speaker 1: Okay, now during all this period of time, you know, before you went to New York [New York] and after that, did you know very much about black history?  I mean did you, did, were you exposed to any?
Speaker 2: Not at that time I wasn't really focusing on black history, you know, I just knew there were certain people that I, I would love to meet because when we were small my father [Jerry Agnew, Sr.] and mother [Mary Knight Agnew] use to take us to Little Rock [Arkansas], which was about 100 miles from Van Buren [Arkansas] and to see Marian Anderson and you know, we would see Mary [McLeod] Bethune, you know, any person who, that would appear back in Little Rock or Fort Smith [Arkansas].  They would always take us to, to meet those people and to see them perform.  So we just kind of grew up, you know, in--I, I was just, I was always familiar with these different people and I knew one day I would like to, to meet them and read more about them and find out more about them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you know very much at that time about, did they teach about the history of the black cowboys or the (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: No, they didn't teach that when I went to the school.  They didn't teach--we just had the regular, you just take your English, your math, your geography, whatever your--you know, they never did have like black studies programs at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in Harlem, I know in the '40s [1940s] there, there were--Charles Sifford was there and I think John Henrik Clarke was a young man then in the army, I think at that point, when you were at Harlem.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But were there any, any black activities around history and culture there that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --participated in?
Speaker 2: --I used to hear them talking about Paul Robeson and Langston Hughes, you know, people like that, but I never had a chance to meet them because I didn't--I wasn't in that circuit, you know, I was just there doing my photography (laughter).
Story_ID: 218972
Speaker 1: You're in Harlem [New York, New York]--this--in Harlem in 1942, I guess, or so (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: It was about '44 [1944].
Speaker 1: Forty-four [1944] oh, okay.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: About '44 [1944] (unclear).
Speaker 1: So you're like towards the end of the war [World War II, WWII] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --So, you know, this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: About '44 [1944] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --Because the man that I married [Andrew Lee Clayton], he was just getting out of the [U.S.] Army (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was about '44 [1944].  And then--but I didn't meet him until about '40 [1940], the end of '45 [1945].  And we married in 1946 and came out here to California.
Speaker 1: Okay, now why did you come out to California?
Speaker 2: Well, he was a barber, he was inducted from here and he was, he was a barber and he had, you know, he worked in one of the barber shops over on Central Avenue and so that's why we, you know--that's, that's where he made his living.  So I came out here and we lived in a room across from Wrigley Fields [Wrigley Field, Los Angeles, California].  It was over on the east side.  And we stayed there until, I guess, we bought this house in 1946 and this is the first house we bought out here.
Speaker 1: The one we're in right now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this one here.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  You've been here all--the whole time, in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: I've been here since '46 [1946], um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So he was a barber?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a barber.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he worked in, he worked in a, a barbershop over on Central Avenue and then he finally opened up his own barbershop over on Avalon.  It was called Advanced Barbershop and he hired people to work for him.  He would rent them chairs and, so he, he did pretty good, yeah.
Story_ID: 218973
Speaker 1: When did you decide to go back to school then?
Speaker 2: I guess I had been--when I started working--I came here and I started working at USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] in the, in the library.  I went there for a job and I--they said--the man that was going to hire, was doing the hiring, he said, "I was looking for a man to hire.  I wanted to have a man, but you seem like you're so very well versed," and he said, "I think we can just hire you," (laughter).  And I worked in the bohemian library first at USC and then later after maybe about a year or so I was transferred to the engineering library and I worked there and then in 1959, I went to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] and worked in the law library for fifteen years.
Speaker 1: Okay, wow that's (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And then (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Well, let me go back a little bit here now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: --to, now, so you went to the University of California--let me--where you worked in the library at USC first, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, USC was the first library that I worked at.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you were there for (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I was there about, let's see, I guess about two or three years something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then that's in 19, was that in '46 [1946]?  When did you start, in '46 [1946]?
Speaker 2: Well no, when I came here it was in '46 [1946] and I started, I started working probably in '49 [1949] or '50 [1950], let's say 1950.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I had my children you know, and I didn't do any work.  I stayed here at home with them.  And then when I did take a job it was at USC and it was around '50 [1950].  And I stayed around--I worked there several years and then in the [Edward L.] Doheny [Jr. Memorial] Library [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] a couple of years and then went to Doheny, and then in '59 [1959] I went to UCLA at the law library.
Story_ID: 218974
Speaker 1: Now when did you become interested in, in black history and books?
Speaker 2: Well, I had already, I had--I was interested in 'em because of the way that our parents [Mary Knight Agnew and Jerry Agnew, Sr.] used to take us, you know, to see these different people and I always wanted to know more about them.  I said there must be something else I'm missing.  But, when I went to school, to high school [Frederick Douglass High School; Frederick Douglass School, Van Buren, Arkansas] they just didn't have any books for, that I could read about them, so, I started buying little paperbacks, I didn't have much money at that time, I was just buying--I bought a few paperbacks.  I tried to read upon people.  And when I went to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], I guess in the '60s [1960s] I transferred over to the Afro-American studies Center Library.  That was after they had the [Watts] riots here.  They decided they were going to have an Afro-American studies center at UCLA.  So, I was in charge of purchasing the books for the library, for the Afro-American center library [Center for Afro-American Studies; Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies].  And when I purchased one for them, I would get one for myself (laughter), so that's how I really became interested really.  But I was interested, years, I mean before that, but I never did you know, start collecting any of the books that I have now, just never did start.
Speaker 1: Now were you a part of an organization, or a group at that time?
Speaker 2: Let me see, I was in a, I think I was in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], I probably had joined at that time and a few years later I joined the, a club that was called Iota Phi Lambda [Sorority Inc]. It was business and professional women. (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course, I was very interested--I had started building up my collection at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I mean, what, what made you do that, I mean you know, I mean its one thing to be interested, but (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Actually, you know, I always had a desire to want to know more about my people and more about certain people.  I was, I was very, very excited about Mary [McLeod] Bethune.  I wanted to know more about her, so I use to buy her stuff and read about her.  And I just kept you know--just, then I would hear about another person, so I would go and try to find some books about that one.  And then it just snowballed, it just kept growing until, you know, I had, I had a--when I, when I knew anything I had purchased quite a few books and then by the time I retired from UCLA, I retired in order to take a job at a book store in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], where they did special, where they had a lot of black books.  They use to put out a catalog every year.  And I became very interested in what they had on the catalog, so I went there and they gave me a job.
Speaker 1: Well what was the name of that store?
Speaker 2: Oh let me see, that was called the, I think it was called Universal Book Store.
Speaker 1: Universal Book Store?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Universal Book Store [sic. Universal Books, Los Angeles, California].  And they would put out a catalog of all the, the black books they had and they would, you know, they had other things that they would sell in the store.  But I only went there because I was very interested in finding out more about the black books.
Speaker 1: Now the name is intriguing, Universal Book Store.  This is the black book store?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It's not?  Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, it wasn't owned by blacks, it was owned by whites.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But that was the name of the bookstore (laughter).
Story_ID: 218975
Speaker 1: During all this period of time though, you're not a member of any organization or anything that does any study of history or--
Speaker 2: Oh I, yeah, I was in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and I used to study with Our Authors Study Club.
Speaker 1: What's it called, the (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Our, O, O-U-R, Authors, A-U-T- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Our Authors Study Club (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --And they would talk, you know, we would talk about different authors and books that they had written and things that--books that's were coming out--you know, new books that's coming out, by black authors.  So, yeah, that's, that's one way that I started learning more about what I would like to buy.
Speaker 1: About what year was it when you got involved in Our Authors?
Speaker 2: It was maybe about '60 [1960], about '63 [1963], '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay, who was the president of that group?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Who was the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --or the leader, I guess?
Speaker 2: --let me see, the, her name was, what was that lady's name.  I have to think about it.  I can't remember right this minute, but I'll think about that.  She was the organizer--Bessie Wright [ph.], that's what it is.  Bessie Wright was the organizer of Our Authors Study Club here.
Speaker 1: Okay, Bessie Wright, all right.  And so you would meet like so many times a month or something like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well yeah, you know, we would have our meeting about every, well, I want to say month.  And we would learn about different--and they would have a big, like for Black History Month, they would really go all out by having big programs at different schools and at different churches and people would, the whole community would kind of get involved with Our Authors Study Club, because they were trying to advance people's minds about black authors.
Story_ID: 218976
Speaker 1: You went to--you took further study at--was it University of California?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went to, I went to school--after I left Lincoln [University, Jefferson City, Missouri] I went to, took some classes at USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] and after that I went to--well, I actually got one of my degrees, the, the first one from [University of California] Berkeley [Berkeley, California], and (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: About, about what year was that when you got the Bachelor of Arts?
Speaker 2: It was in the '70s [1970s].  I have it in there, I have to look on my wall to see.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then you got a degree (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: And then I got the master's degree from Goddard College in [Plainfield] Vermont.  And then (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: But did you have to go to Vermont?
Speaker 2: No, they had a campus here and I studied under some very great people here and I got, received a Master's in Library Science from there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  About what year was that?
Speaker 2: It was probably in the late '70s [1970s], maybe '79 [1979], '80 [1980], somewhere along there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I got the Ph.D. from--oh wow, what's the name of that school.
Speaker 1: It says here Sierra University [Santa Monica, California]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was here, here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was in Santa Monica.  They had a campus here, in Santa Monica.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what year was that?
Speaker 2: It was in the '80s [1980s], maybe about '83 [1983], '84 [1984].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now what was your Ph.D. dissertation on, or what did you--?
Speaker 2: In humanities--
Story_ID: 218977
Speaker 1: You've got this huge collection of books, now.  Now when did it start becoming a large collection of books?
Speaker 2: Actually when I left UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], when I retired from UCLA and started working in this bookstore, Universal Book Store [sic. Universal Books, Los Angeles, California], where they had all these black books.  I started really purchasing a lot of things because they had so many things there that I wanted and so it just started growing from there.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me about now how did you, you purchased most of these new, because I saw some old ones out there too (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, half of them were used, you know.  Universal was a used bookstore and I remember I purchased quite a few things from them, then I got on the antiquarian book dealer's list.  I became a member of that organization.  And people would send me a list of things that they had for sale and you know, then I would order those things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is the days when people weren't collecting a lot of black books I guess, right.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: So were they, were they fairly cheap to acquire?
Speaker 2: Not--well, it was cheaper than they are now (laughter).  I mean, but the average book I guess, was, maybe we paid about 10, 12, or 15 dollars.  And some--I knew I went to, I went to swap meets and a lot times I would find books out there.  For instance, I found a book written by Walter White, who was over the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] years ago.  And the guy, I said--picked up the book, and I said, "How much is this book?"  He said, oh, that's just a little bitty book you can have it for a dime.  So, but he didn't have any idea of what, what the book was about (laughter).  So a lot of times, you know, I would luck up on things like that.  People would--I had a couple of ladies to call me and say, "I want you to come over and get all this stuff out of my garage.  I'm getting ready--I want, need the space in the garage."  And one time I went and I found volume one, number one of the Ebony magazine and a whole series of, of Ebony magazines and, and some other black magazines that started around that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did, did you go to, I mean did you go to I guess, antique dealers, and used, I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, we use to go to the bookstores.
Speaker 1: --rummage sales and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I use to go to the bookstores and, and when the, some of the sales people would see me coming in and they kind of followed me around to see what I was looking at, what books I was interested in and if I didn't show a lot of interest in a book, well, they, after I left they would mark the books up if I was really interested in them.  When I'd go back to get the book the price had gone up on the book, they had marked it up, because they figured that must have been a really great book if I was, you know, kept the book out and, and looked at it.  But, some of the other books, you know, if I didn't--I got so that I wouldn't even spend much time, I'd just look at the book and the title and, and not ask him how much is the book, you know, and it would be normal price (laughter).
Story_ID: 218978
Speaker 1: What's the most valuable book you've ever collected?
Speaker 2: Let's see, Phillis Wheatley book ['Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral,' Phillis Wheatley], it was written in 1776 [sic. 1773] and it's a signed copy of Phillis Wheatley.  She, she wrote the book and signed it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --back in 1776.
Speaker 1: Where did you find that?
Speaker 2: I found it in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  It was some store that wrote and you know, told me, sent me a whole list of books and that just happened to be one that I selected to buy because I, you know, I knew about Phillis Wheatley and I just wanted to have her first edition in, in my collection, so.  It was kind of expensive because I had to make them a couple of payments you know, before I could pay and pay for it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What's, what's the book you've been most excited about finding that you didn't think, think that you would find?
Speaker 2: I have some signed copies of Oscar Micheaux, who was a famous filmmaker.  And I was very excited to get those books you know, but he had signed all of these books.
Speaker 1: Are these his novels, his novels?
Speaker 2: Yeah, some of his novels.
Speaker 1: Yeah, some of his novels, because he wrote some novels (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yes, I have, I have most of the ones that he wrote.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the names of some of them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'The Homesteader[: A Novel,' Oscar Micheaux],' 'The Masquerade,' [Oscar Micheaux] the--let's see what is that one, Win, 'Wingate,' the 'Wingate' [sic. 'The Case of Mrs. Wingate,' Oscar Micheaux] is one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, so you had some Oscar Micheaux books?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have some signed copies of Oscar Micheaux.  And I was very excited to get that because I knew that one-day that those books would be priceless.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have some Langston Hughes, signed copies that I bought.  And I was, I was excited to get those.  I have some Countee Cullen, just, just a whole, just a whole lot of different things that, that I was excited to get (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: -- in the collection.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Paul Robeson, I've got some of his books.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how many do you have altogether?
Speaker 2: Oh wow, I must have over, say about twenty thousand.
Speaker 1: Twenty thousand [20,000], okay.  So does that include tapes and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, no, that's just books.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what about other media?
Speaker 2: Well we have, we have books, we have photographs about seventy-five thousand photographs, we have film and tapes, over 1500 black films and black tapes.  I have about--photographs you know, like Alberta Hunter and Bessie Smith.   We have all of those photographs.  From those and we must have maybe about, about ten thousand of those.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we have, let's see what else we have, mostly anything that you want to do research, (laughter) you know we mostly had it.
Story_ID: 218979
Speaker 1: Now, when did you, when did you form the, the Western States Black Research and Educational Center [sic. Western States Black Research Center; Mayme A. Clayton Library & Museum (MCLM), Culver City, California]?
Speaker 2: That was in '76, [1976] 1976.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was the purpose of the organization?
Speaker 2: Well, we wanted to make a non-profit organization, so, we figured we could get grants and things to continue to purchase books and grants to put on different programs and let everybody know about the, about the books that we had.  If we could--that was just another way of advertising for us.  So we were able to receive different grants, you know, in order to purchase more books and do things.
Speaker 1: Okay, now are they, are, are your, are your books accessible to the public in any kind of way, or scholars, or writers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but they have to use them here.  We don't let them go out because we found that most people won't return a book, especially if it's valuable, and we just--they just have to read here and do the research here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We decided not to sign them out to anybody.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you have a, you have a place here on the premises where they do that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, we usually come, you know I bring the books in here, or either I'll put up a little table out there in the back and so they can sit there and do their research.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  What is, what do you plan for the future for the collection, because it's a huge collection?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, well right now we're working on getting a building and we're working with a lot of different politicians and they have said that they wanted to work with us.  And we, you know, we, we'll be getting some kind of grant and things so that we can get the building.  We'd like to put the building up downtown on Grand Street [sic. Avenue] because I understand that they have a future project coming up on Grand Street downtown near [Walt] Disney [Concert] Hall [Los Angeles, California].  And they want to have a lot of museums and different research programs down there.  So we would like to be right in the middle of that so that you know, people can come by and see what we're doing also.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Have, have you written any books about your collecting?
Speaker 2: No, not, not really, not really.
Story_ID: 218980
Speaker 1: Now, your son [Avery Clayton] is now the director of the project [sic. Western States Black Research Center; Mayme A. Clayton Library & Museum (MCLM), Culver City, California]?
Speaker 2: Yes, my son is the, he's the executive director of the research center.  I am the president.  We have some little board, board of directors and, and--but he's doing a magnificent job.  He's gotten so many people interested in the project and he, he tells a story; you have to listen, you know, because this is something you can't hardly turn down.  And so, I'm pretty sure that in the next four or five years we'll have the brand new building that we've been looking for.  But we--in the meantime we're going to, we; we're going to make a jump.  [HistoryMaker] Bernard Parks, who is one of the city councilmen here has given us the Hyde Park Library, which is on Crenshaw [Boulevard], around 64th [Street] and Crenshaw, as, as a temporary building--he says he going to, you know, until we get into the main building we want to put up.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you haven't moved in yet?
Speaker 2: No, we waiting--they built a brand new Hyde Park Library and we're waiting for them to move out of the building that they're going to donate to us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then when you move in there, you have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, that's just going to be (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --more space for scholars to come and do research?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh for--much more than I have here now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, much more.  It's pretty big.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've forgotten how many square feet it is, but it's pretty big and we can, can catalog and do all the things that we need to do in this new building, in the Hyde Park Library.  And when we get ready to move to the brand new building everything will be ready to move and it's going to be really nice--
Story_ID: 218981
Speaker 1: --I organized the Black American Cinema Society [BACS] and we started out giving cash grants to independent student filmmakers.  We were giving three thousand dollars for a first prize, second prize, two thousand [dollars], one thousand [dollars] for the third prize and three honorable mentions at $250.00 each.  And we would do that each year.  And it was--the students would make the films and we would have filmmakers, film critics to come and look at the films and decide who's going to win the prize, who had the best film.  And we did that for sixteen years.  We had sponsors to donate the money.
Speaker 2: What facilities would you use to show the films?
Speaker 1: Well, we'd have it in--we've had them in some of the big auditoriums, hotels, you know, big hotels, along with a dinner, you know, and a big event. So, we would, we would treat them royally you know (laughter).  Plus we would give a, the Phoenix Award, which is the highest award you know, you could get.  Then we would give a Paul Robeson [Pioneer] Award.  Then we had one called The Star Bright Award.  And all these people were selected, you know, like some big celebrity would come and receive these awards from us each year.
Speaker 2: Okay.  When, when did you start giving the awards out?
Speaker 1: That was in, I guess that was in the '80s [1980s].  We did it for sixteen years.  And then what happened is that the sponsors, when they had the Seven-Eleven, I think, I think it was in 1998 was the last one we gave out because people were donating money for other things and the sponsor, sponsorship kind of dried up.  But we're planning to do it over again.  It was--we had a film festival every year.  It was called Black Talkies on Parade Film Festival.  And we do that along with the, right after we give out the awards.  The next week we would have a Black Talkies on Parade Film Festival.  And we had that at the Four Star Theater [Los Angeles, California], we might have it at the, let's see where else.  Oh, we had it at the (unclear), they had a big huge film auditorium, you know, just different places we would have the films.  And people would, used to come out in busloads you know, to see the films.
Story_ID: 218982
Speaker 1: --As an archivist you're a collector, an archivist you're sort of--you're following in the footsteps of Arthur Schomburg [Arturo Alfonso Schomburg] and Alfred Ligon and a lot of other people that, that have collected, John Henrik Clarke had a huge collection of books.  Kwesi Adebisi in Columbus, Ohio had a huge collection of books and materials.  Charles [L.] Blockson in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] has got a huge collection.
Speaker 2: I remember him. He came--he saw my collection and it was another guy in New York.  His name was (unclear), let's see--that had a big collection.  But anyway, I think that we're going to get some of these collections when we move into our building because people want to donate their collections to us.  Now we're going to get the Ligon, we're going to get Mr. Alfred's collection.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's going to be added to ours.
Speaker 1: And you know his sister too, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, Jeni--
Speaker 1: --Jeni Ligon.
Speaker 2: Yes, Jeni, um-hm. And we're going to get the, Virginia Capers collection.  We're getting--a man just donated me twenty boxes of books (laughter).  And that's waiting to be gone through.  See, this collection is going to draw other collections because people, they want to see their collections saved.  They want, want to unite with us, with what we're doing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the plan is to just make this a huge archive?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Just to increase it and (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Are you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: And one day we hope to have like an African institution, you know.  Where people can come here and study and get degrees.  I mean that's way in the future, but still that's what we have in the back of our minds. That people can come here [Western States Black Research Center; Mayme A. Clayton Library & Museum (MCLM), Culver City, California] and get a degree in African American studies.
Story_ID: 218983
Speaker 1: --We always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: For the African American what?
Speaker 1: Community.
Speaker 2: Oh, I just hope that one of these days that the, the future generations will be a little more stabilized and that they will take their heritage at heart and want to learn more about who they are and about themselves, and how they can help others in the community.  I am just hoping that one day that, you know, the crime and the things that youngsters are doing, shootings, and that we will have that under control and try to give them something else to look forward to.  We don't need those gangs and all those things.
Story_ID: 218984
Speaker 1: When you look back at all of the things that you've done so far, is there anything major that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see, I, well I would go about trying to connect with the, with the community so we can get more support from, from the people in this community and from all over the world.  This going to be like an international collection pretty soon because we had--people from Germany came over here.  They wanted to buy my collection (laughter).  And I said, you know, no.  And then people at [University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana] wanted to buy it.  And people in South Dakota.  I've had so many people that's so interested in buying this collection, but we need the collection right here.  And I didn't want to sell it.  I wanted to keep it for our people.  That's what I really wanted to do.
Story_ID: 218985
Speaker 1: How did you, I didn't ask you this, but how did you come to accumulate so many films?  I mean where do you find black films to buy? I mean how do you--
Speaker 2: Well you know I'm on a list and we have magazines and things that we can order from.  We have a different way of communicating with filmmakers and they tell me about films that they know about, and that I should buy this (laughter), I should buy that, you know.  I just bought one from CBS and Walter Cronkite was interviewing black people over on Crenshaw [Boulevard, Los Angeles, California] and I thought that was very interesting, you know.  And I have that copy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean how did you get it?  I mean who'd you get from a catalog or did you get it--
Speaker 2: --No, I--
Speaker 1: --from, from someone?
Speaker 2: One of the, film collector, sold his film and he called me and told me that he think it's something I should look at and try to buy.  So, he told me what the film was all about.  And so I went on and, and sent them money to get it.  But I just have people to call me to say, you know, tell me something that they saw and they wanted to know if I was interested in it, or, or they have it on a list and I get a list of films from different collectors that's selling their films and I'm just on the list of, you know, that list, on a lot of people's lists.
Story_ID: 218986
Speaker 1: Now when you look back at the things that you've done so far, what at this point would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I just wanted to leave something here for generations to come.  And I think that if I could leave them with all these books and everything that I have collected that they would have a better future and they would realize that it's other things in this world that they need to be doing in order to help other children.  And that this collection if they come and start reading some of the books that I have, they can see that there was a path made for them and all they have to do is read and follow and that great things will happen to them too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your parents [Mary Knight Agnew and Jerry Agnew, Sr.] get a chance to see you become successful and graduate from school and study?
Speaker 2: No, my mother and father died, they died years ago.  So, my sister [Sarah Agnew Davis] lived to see part of it, but she didn't have long enough, I mean she passed on, but anyway I guess I'm just so happy to have my children.  I have three boys and I have two grandsons and three great grandsons, all boys (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm just so happy that I'm able to pass this on down to them.
Speaker 1: Now is there anything that we haven't asked you that you want, want to talk about?
Speaker 2: Let's see, [Black American] Cinema Society [BACS], we have (unclear)--
Speaker 1: I've been very fortunate you know, that I've been able to receive from--lots of awards and, and things from people all over the country, you know, that seem to recognize what I'm doing.  It, it gives me a great feeling to know that somebody else recognizes what I'm doing and, and want to be supportive of what we're doing here.
Story_ID: 218987
Speaker 1: Well there's one last question.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's similar to legacy, but a little bit different, and that is how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, as a person that tried to leave something in this world for generations and generations.  I would like for them to be able to have a place where they can come and sit down and be inspired by something that they read in this library [Western States Black Research Center; Mayme A. Clayton Library & Museum (MCLM), Culver City, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: I don't know if that answered your question or not.  (Laughter) Did I do okay?
Story_ID: 218988
Speaker 1: A lot of the things that I have gotten, I would get them through other vendors or, you know, like if I'd go in a bookstore and sometimes I would buy things, or either people would send me a list of books and say if you're interested in this, you know, we will save it for you, or either they would, you know--I just had so many different methods of getting books until (laughter).  I would go to swap meets.  I used to go to everything, you know--anybody selling books.  And I would always try to go to that.  But I'll tell you one incident that happened, I mean this may not be important, but I remember I worked at this Universal Book Store [sic. Universal Books] in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] and they had all these books and the owner of the shop, he was a gambler.  He use to go out to the Horse Shoe Den [sic. Tom Bergin's Horseshoe Tavern, Los Angeles, California] out here.  I just--I don't know if it's called Horse Shoe Den, but anyway, they played cards and you know, it was like a gambling place and he was a big gambler and we had put aside some money to buy books with and he took all the money we had put aside and lost it out at the--you know, playing cards of something.  And he calls me up the next morning, he said, I got something good to tell you and I got something bad to tell you (laughter).  So I said, well give me the bad first.  He said, well, I lost the money that we had to buy the books with but I've got somebody that may lend it to me so I can--so we can get them anyway.  So I knew that wasn't right, you know, so anyway, he never did come up with that money.  So, at that time I departed company with him because I could see this could be a pattern and so, I say, well all the money that I have invested, which was my pension, my-- I had retired from UCLA [University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] and of course I had money and I invested in a bookstore--in his bookstore and when he did this that's when I decided well, I'm going to take everything that I invested in here and take it out in books.  So I took every black book he had out of the store and opened up--and brought it out here and put it in the back [Third World Ethnic Books, Los Angeles, California] (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well that's a--
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: That's quite a story there, that's--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 218989
Speaker 1: But anyhow, it's strange, I've been--so many people--you'd be surprised at the people that discourage you, you know, like one lady said, I don't see why she's gathering up all those old relics, nobody wants that, don't nobody wants to see all that.  But, you know, to me I thought I was doing something that was going to inspire somebody one day.  And you know, I didn't see how anybody could call them old relics.
Speaker 2: You've got some ads and--
Speaker 1: --Yeah--
Speaker 2: --I saw in the back you have some ads and some cartoons and things that come from the early part of the century, from the 19th century. A lot of the stuff is, you know, it pokes fun at black people and--
Speaker 1: --Yeah--
Speaker 2: --but it's part of history and people don't know about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's part of our history.  And I wouldn't consider those things relics, its history.  And, but its--you'd be surprised at the people that really don't want to see you do something, you know, like this, you'd, you'd be surprised.  They try to discourage you or try, try to say something, make you feel that you are not doing anything worthwhile with (laughter) your money, your life, you know.  But, anyway I guess that's just the way people are.
Speaker 2: But do you have--you get appreciation too though right, from people (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: Oh yes, yes.  We get those people that really appreciate it they just walk in that, walk in the front out there in the door and they say, (off-camera sound) I can't--it boost (unclear), something that's, that's so exciting about this.  And, and I'm just so thankful that you thought about saving all these things for us. I don't pay any attention to when people try to bad-mouth you and say something negative, you know.  I just don't need that (laughter), because I have invested every dime that I have, everything that I have in books for future generations.  That's what--I'd just like to leave them something, and they say, oh, [HistoryMaker] Mayme Clayton built this [Western States Black Research Center; Mayme A. Clayton Library & Museum (MCLM), Culver City, California] for us, and we have to take advantage of this and change our life.  It may change somebody's life, you can never tell.

Speaker 2: Nineteen twenties [1920s] you think?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Was it before that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it might be before then to me because again, I think, I would think--this is your grandfather?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well if your mother was born, say around 1890 something?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Then I would think, and this is a young man looks like, I would think this has got to be, it's probably in the 1890s, I would think.  Looks kind of young to me there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
