Story_ID: 474243
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family, first. Then, then, your father's [Robert Anderson] side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But we'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your other's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Florence, F-L-O-R-E-N-C-E; Smith is her maiden name, and Anderson [Florence Smith Anderson] is her married name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side of the family?  How, how far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, I know, I can only go back to the Richardsons [ph.], which my grandmother's, my grandmother's mother, her maiden name was Richardson.  But I can't go back any, any further than that because they've never researched it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What's your mother's date of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother's date of birth is April the 7th, 1919 (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm thinking: she probably wouldn't want me to tell that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Columbia, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, Columbia, South Carolina, okay.  Are there any stories from that side of the family, you know, that, that are passed along about--you know, where, where there slaves in the family?  Was, are there stories about Reconstruction?  Or, or what, what's, what are the stories?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, I don't have much information on my mother's side of the family 'cause they never really talked about it that much.  So, I don't think there's, you know, stories that, you know--I haven't, I don't know of any; I'll just say that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what did her people do for a living?
Speaker 2: My, my grandmother [Bettie Preston Garnett] was a day laborer.  And she went to work in people's houses and stuff like that, after they moved to Ann Arbor [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there stories of how the family, you know, decided to move to Ann Arbor, or what brought them to Ann Arbor specifically?
Speaker 2: I think like everybody else, you know, migration was from the, from the South to the North.  And my grandmother chose Ann Arbor to settle right there.  And I don't, I don't know that there's any other story, you know, other than she settled right there.  And I don't know if she was married or if this was between marriages, you know, because she was married to a gentleman named Randolph Smith.  And, and I think it was after she had divorced, divorced him.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so is Randolph Smith your, your grandfather, or is he just a husband of hers that--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) He may be.  Yeah, he's my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.  Now, you know, 'cause usually the pattern is, as we were discussing off camera before we started the interview that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --that, that South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, a lot of them go due north, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to New York [New York] or Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] or someplace like that.  And it's, it's odd that a, somebody from South Carolina would migrate to Ann Arbor of all places--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --'cause nobody's probably heard of Ann Arbor, you know, and from--
Speaker 2: Well, that is very true.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, is there--there's no story that they tell about why they chose Ann Arbor?  Or did they happen to--they go someplace else first and then come to Ann Arbor?
Speaker 2: No, I think she came right from the South Carolina up to, to Ann Arbor.  I don't know of any stories.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there a job offer or something waiting for her here or something.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know that she had three children, and she moved up here.  Well, she had five originally.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And two of them were deceased.  And she moved up to Ann Arbor.  I don't know that she's ever lived anywhere up north other than Ann Arbor.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So did Mr. Smith--I mean that, was she, was she married to him then when she moved up?
Speaker 2: I don't think she was married to him then--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know.  I think she had gotten divorced.
Story_ID: 474244
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Florence Smith Anderson] grow up in, in South Carolina or in Ann Arbor [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Part of her life she grew up in South Carolina, and the other part she grew up in Ann Arbor.
Speaker 1: Do you have a sense for how old she was when she got to Ann Arbor?
Speaker 2: Hm, I think maybe around six or seven.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she was a little girl.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she talk about growing up in South Carolina or in Ann Arbor?
Speaker 2: Sometimes she does.  She talks more about Ann Arbor, because I'm thinking that that may be closer to her memory.  But then again, sometimes she mentioned something about Columbia, South Carolina, and how she used to go visit her grandmother and all like that.  In fact, maybe about twenty years ago my sister [Sharon Anderson] took her back down south.  And she went to visit her grandmother's home and stuff like that, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but see, most of the conversations she does have is about going to school in Ann Arbor and some of the friends that she had there and so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's all the, the--and how hard her mother [Bettie Preston Garnett] worked, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause she's the oldest child.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so was her mother like basically--well, you, you don't know if she was by herself or not at that point, do you?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was by herself (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She was by herself, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that was pretty tough, you know, since you she moved up--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and she had three children and--
Speaker 1: That's during the war [World War I, WWI] I guess, right, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah, or right afterwards--
Speaker 2: --because during the, the Depression [Great Depression] I think.
Speaker 1: Oh, during the Depression, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 474245
Speaker 1: So did your mother [Florence Smith Anderson], what did she do?  Did, did she--before living in Ann Arbor [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Well, after she graduated from school she worked in a factory.  And she worked, before the factory, she worked at a clothing store, and then she went to work at the fact- in the factory.  And after the factory I think she met my dad [Robert Anderson], and they got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: My mother never went into all that; she never really did.  But you pose very interesting questions.  I'm gonna ask about how they got together and all like that.  But she didn't, she never mentioned all that.
Speaker 1: Did they meet in Ann Arbor?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause my dad came up from the South.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they met, yeah, I think in Ann Arbor--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --'cause his brother [James Anderson] moved to Ann Arbor too.
Story_ID: 474246
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Oh, Lord, my father's full name is Robert Timothy Calvin Anderson [Robert Anderson].
Speaker 1: Okay, you know the first question I'm gonna ask is, why so many names?  He has one more than most people.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Maybe because my grandmother thought she was through with them (laughter), but no.  I don't know why she--he had so many names.  And I think some of those siblings that he had after him, they don't have middle names.  So, yeah, his name was Robert Timothy Calvin.  And most of the time people called him T.C.  Well, his brothers and his sisters call him T.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His place of birth is South Carolina, I think around Donalds, South Carolina.  And his birth date is March 16th, 1916.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they're both originally from South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  Yeah, you hardly expect that combination in--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well--
Speaker 1: --in--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Michigan, but that's--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?  Is there any stories?
Speaker 2: I knew, I know more about the ancestors on my father's side than I do my mother's [Florence Smith Anderson] side.  My grandfather, my grandfather's father was a slave.  And he got his freedom.  And then after that, he had been married once before, once before, and then he married again, married a young, a lady named Mary [Mary Anderson] I think.  And from that union my grandfather was born.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what, what was your great-grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: His, his name was Albert [sic.].
Speaker 1: Albert, okay.  Albert Anderson?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so his, his wife was Mary.  All right, and so they got married in, in South Carolina, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what, what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was a farmer.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Do they have any stories about life in South Carolina or, or that have passed down from--
Speaker 2: Well, I know that my, my grandfather used to be a cook.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And sometimes in the offseason of farming he, he would take and cook at some college or another.  I can't think of the name of the college.  But he used to--
Speaker 1: Was it a black college [HBCU] there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Claflin [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] or, what's the one (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know.
Speaker 1: 'Cause it's in Columbia [sic.].  There's one in Columbia.  I can't think of the name of it.
Speaker 2: But see, he stayed--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in Due West [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Bennett College [sic. Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina] I think.
Speaker 2: He stayed in--
Speaker 1: He stayed in Due West?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--well, after he got married, they moved--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to Due West.  And I don't know, you know, what college is around that area or anything like that, you know, 'cause it's not necessarily a black college, you know, that he cooked at.
Speaker 1: Okay, not necess- all right, all right, okay.  Well, did you know your grandfather at all?
Speaker 2: Yes, I knew my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did know him, and, and his wife, which is my grandmother, and her name was Matt T. [Mattie Hawthorne Anderson].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At least that's what they called her.  But then later on in my life, I found that, that it was really Mattie.  And my grandfather used call her Matt T.  So that was his affectionate way of saying Mattie.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your grandfather's name was--did you give--I think we got the great-grandfather's name but not the grandfather.
Speaker 2: No, my grandfather was Albert [Albert Anderson].
Speaker 1: Albert, okay, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And the great-grandfather, his name was George [sic. Calvin Anderson].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  I think I may have it backwards.  Okay, so George is the one that came out of slavery?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 474247
Speaker 1: Your parents met in Ann Arbor [Michigan], right?  Was it Ann--
Speaker 2: I could only surmise that (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause you don't know.  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That's what we'll say, even though I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, often, I mean, you know, some families, when they move to, to the North, just like when they come from Europe, a lot of times people follow--
Speaker 2: Right, migrate (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) people they know.
Speaker 2: --to different areas.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and so--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --if a South Carolina group came up, you know, with, you know, sometimes they follow, you know, people they know.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Did you know if their families knew each other in South Carolina or not, or?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because see, my, my dad [Robert Anderson] was from a small town, and my mother [Florence Smith Anderson] was from a much bigger town.  But she had moved up when she was young, and my, my father moved to Ann Arbor when he was maybe eighteen or twenty.
Story_ID: 474248
Speaker 1: Tell me what their personalities were like.  And, and who do you think you take--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh--
Speaker 1: Yeah, let us know who you think you take after the most of the two of them.
Speaker 2: Now I take a lot after my mother [Florence Smith Anderson], but I have a lot of my dad [Robert Anderson] in me.  But then again, I take a lot after my mother because when it comes to certain things she's a no-foolishness like kind of woman.  And so, and I'm a no-foolishness kind of woman.  And from my dad I take my personality and go-get-it-ness.  Sometimes I have drive that is beyond control.  But then again, sometimes I have a very laidback attitude about a lot of things, and that comes from my mother I think.
Story_ID: 474249
Speaker 1: Now did your father [Robert Anderson], was, was he raised in South Carolina, or did he--
Speaker 2: Yes, he was raised in--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Did he have any stories about--oh, I didn't, I guess I didn't ask you was there--do you know the reason why he moved to Ann Arbor [Michigan]?  Is it, was it, was there--
Speaker 2: Oh, I think that he may have followed his older, one of his older brothers, which was his brother moved up to Ann Arbor, which his name was Jim [James Anderson].  And I think he came up after Jim had, had come to Ann Arbor.  So then that may be the reason that my dad moved up there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know why Jim moved out (laughter) to Ann Arbor?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, I know you got the, you know, the most, I guess the most excited feature about Ann Arbor is the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  So I don't--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that's the only--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --thing just about they had around then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I mean I wondered maybe if the university had any attraction for them or a job (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't--
Speaker 1: --there or--
Speaker 2: I don't--
Speaker 1: Was it--
Speaker 2: --think--
Speaker 1: --the railroad or--I mean I don't, I don't know.  I'm just trying to think of--
Speaker 2: I, I really don't know.  I really don't know.
Story_ID: 474250
Speaker 1: What did your father [Robert Anderson] do for a living?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) My father was a jack of all trade and a master of none.  He worked on cars, but his main job was construction.  Then after the construct- after he had kids, the construction part wasn't nice enough to have because he had three children, and he needed to do something more than seasonal construction.  So then he went to work at a factory.  And, and, and after he went to work at the factory, he died almost as he, after he worked in the factory.
Speaker 1: Was it dangerous work?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't dangerous work.  He died of, you know, he died of cancer, and it's after he had finished working at the factory.
Speaker 1: What kind of factory was it?
Speaker 2: I don't--I think it was making diesel engines.
Speaker 1: Was it related to Ford [Ford Motor Company] or General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] or?
Speaker 2: I think it was part of GM, I think.  It was Detroit Diesel [GM Diesel; Detroit Diesel Corporation]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so then, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So did your father pass away when you were still young, quite young or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He passed away--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when I was much older.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not (laughter)--yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So you were born in Ann Arbor [Michigan].  Did, did you grow up in Ann Arbor?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't grow up in Ann Arbor.  I grew up in Inkster [Michigan].
Speaker 1: In Inkster, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but see, I was born up there in Ann Arbor.  But then again, my mom [Florence Smith Anderson] and dad had moved to Inkster because they had gotten married.  And they moved to Inkster and, but I was born up there in Ann Arbor.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so did--was he still, was he still, like, working in Ann Arbor when he was living in Inkster, or?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So he was working in, in Inkster--I mean in--
Speaker 2: He was working, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) around in, in Dearborn [Michigan]--
Speaker 2: --around in the area--
Speaker 1: --or--
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know Ford [Henry Ford] created Inkster for black employees basically--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) as a way--
Speaker 2: That's exactly, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, so nobody in your family worked for Ford or at that point?
Speaker 2: Not at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, so you were still quite young when they moved to Inkster?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean I hadn't even been born (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, they, they already moved to the--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  I'm sorry.
Story_ID: 474251
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, I do.  But then again, I have three siblings, and needless to say, when you've got siblings under you--more or less, my dad [Robert Anderson] will always say, whenever my siblings would get in trouble, he would always say, "Well, you're the oldest, and I hold you responsible."  And so then a lot of my spankings came for my siblings.  I wasn't the kind of kid that wanted spankings at all, and I would never do anything to get spankings.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: I have one sister [Sharon Anderson] and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --an- and I had two brothers [Albert Anderson and Timothy Anderson].
Story_ID: 474252
Speaker 1: Describe your neighborhood that, the neighborhood you grew up in.  And, and what were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, we grew up in what was known as the Carver Homes district [Inkster, Michigan].  And that was the housing that Henry Ford had developed.  But then again, after I was, got older, I realized that there was a lot of happenings in the neighborhood.  We usually called it--we, after we got grown, we called it the projects.  But there was a lot of happenings back there.  And I remember families taken in, barbecuing outside in the front yard, because the, the, the houses, the kitchens were facing the street, and the, and the living room was facing like your backyard.  And so then we usually took and cooked where the kitchen was, which was naturally in the front.  And so then I remember that there was barbecues and cooking going on.  And I remember that there were some neighbors down the street that were always playing music.  And, and, and the kids were much older than I was, so I recognized that there was a lot of lively music coming from down the street.  And, and that's I think my favorite memory of all of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, the music and the food and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, the Carver Homes, they're like a low-rise projects, or they, they weren't the high-rises, were they or?
Speaker 2: Well, they're low-ri- they were--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --individual homes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they're actually houses, individual houses.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, they were individual--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --houses, and they had duplexes, which is the side-by-side duplexes.  Instead of like an up and down, they were side-by-side duplexes.  And, and the area, you know, it was a lot of activities going on in the area, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean, in the Carver complex itself--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) official activities that they put on, or, or--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh, well, not--
Speaker 1: --like--
Speaker 2: --not necessarily--
Speaker 1: --or just people doing--
Speaker 2: --that they would put on but just people would just in general put on, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was all about having fun, you know, when, when you're growing up it's just all about having fun.  You don't realize that you're poor until after you get grown, and you realize some other things.  But then again, a lot of times you, you don't realize that you're poor.  And then maybe during that time we weren't.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so just always a lot of music you say in the household and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a lot of music and a lot of--
Speaker 1: Was the--
Speaker 2: --activities; people were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) was the radio on a lot?
Speaker 2: --boxes and people riding their bikes.  And, and I, I used to date a fellow that had a motorcycle or a scooter, and, and my sister [Sharon Anderson] usually would go on a ride with him.  And, and there was a lot of activity going on in the neighborhood, playing ball in the street and all that kind of stuff.
Story_ID: 474253
Speaker 1: --How would you describe yourself as a little girl?  I mean what, what, what were you interested in, and what did you like to do?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) My sister [Sharon Anderson] says, I've always been a star (laughter).  My sister always says that.  I don't know how I can describe myself, and I, and you know, and I'm somewhat a bit hesitant in doing it because of the fact I am very honest, but then again, I'm humble.  And so, then a lot of times people ask me about things I don't really like to talk about it or anything like that.  In fact, I'm surprised that (laughter) I, I decided I would go ahead and do this, this taping for The HistoryMakers because--
Speaker 1: Well, I'm glad you did.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I--
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: --I am somewhat private.
Speaker 1: But, but what, what did you like to do when you were growing up?  Did you like to read?  Did you like music more?
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: Did you like sports or--
Speaker 2: Well, I, I, I used to like to read.  I didn't care that much for sports.  I liked to dress.  And I always liked kids, even when I was a little kid myself.  I always took upon somebody else's kids.  And so. Hm, I used to like to play cards and listen to music--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --and, and, and color.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I used to love to color.
Speaker 1: Now did, did, did you have to work yourself when you were growing up at an early age?
Speaker 2: Well, naturally, when kids are growing up, you always try to find like a little babysitting job and all like that, so I did that too.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you did some babysitting.  And, but, but when you were--yeah, I guess, yeah, I guess that's, yeah, babysitting jobs and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, babysitting jobs, because when I was sixteen, that's when I went in--I was officially indoctrine- indoctin- ah, I can't say the word (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Indoctrinated (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Indoctrinated to--
Speaker 1: --or introduced.
Speaker 2: --show business--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when I was sixteen, so.
Story_ID: 474254
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about the music that was on the radio when you were growing up.  We were talking off camera that the first black radio station in Detroit [Michigan] that you remember is WCHB [WCHB Radio].
Speaker 2: Right, and that was owned by I think the name was a Dr. Cox [Wendell Cox] and a Dr. Bell [Haley Bell] (cough).
Speaker 1: Now are these black doctors that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --owned this?  Okay.  This is an AM station?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, and what was their format?  What did they play?
Speaker 2: They played mostly black music (cough).  Can we cut it off?
Speaker 1: Let's stop.
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Okay, we're talk, we were talk, talking about WCHB I guess in the late '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I remember that I loved listening to that station, because it was playing more of our kind of music, you know.  Not saying that all music isn't our kind of music, but I began to realize that they were playing more black artists than white, you know.  And so then I, I, I loved listening to that station because they were playing something quite unusual during that time.
Speaker 1: Who were your favorite artists on WCHB?
Speaker 2: The Shirelles.  I remember hearing The Shirelles.  And I remember--there's another female group.  I can't think of the name of them right now.  But then again, I loved listening to those groups because they re- you know, they were like my kind of people, and then they, they sang more bluesy or more jazzy kind of music than what we had been accustomed to hearing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know you mentioned The Shirelles.  I, when, when you mentioned them, I thought of The Ronettes maybe.  I don't know if they were--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but see, they were--
Speaker 1: --before.  They, were they--
Speaker 2: The Ronettes were--
Speaker 1: --later, much later?
Speaker 2: --far, far.
Speaker 1: Much later, yeah.
Speaker 2: They were after us, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I, I remember The Shirelles, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: The Shirelles and--
Speaker 1: I remember when Patti LaBelles [sic. Patti LaBelle] was the Bluebelles [Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles].  But I don't know when that was.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, and, and they were around the same time as us.  But then again, there was--shoot, what is that?  I'll think of it, and then if, if I holler it out, you (laughter), you'll know.  But then again--
Speaker 1: The Chiffons or--
Speaker 2: No, they came (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, not the--
Speaker 2: --after.
Speaker 1: Did they?  Okay, 'cause I, I, I can see the stack of 45s [45 rpm record] with these names.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 1: But I don't, you know--
Speaker 2: But then again--
Speaker 1: --I'm trying to think of who came first.  But, yeah, I know in the late '50s [1950s] I guess the biggest stars were--
Speaker 2: In like the--
Speaker 1: --what, Fats Domino and Chuck Berry--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --and guys like that?
Speaker 2: --Fats Domino and The Drifters.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You know, you begin to hear The Drifters and The Platters--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --because they were the music icons of that time--
Speaker 1: Yep (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) time era.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: And hm, and--
Speaker 1: Of all the groups that--there weren't that many so-called girl groups then, or were they?
Speaker 2: Well, there were only two that I can recall.  And one of them I can't even call, call the name of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I, I can see the lead singer vividly in my mind, but I call her name or, or their name.  And The Shirelles, because we had a close relationship with The Shirelles, and so, but there were only two during that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you ever listen to the more bluesy kind of stuff from Gallatin, Tennessee?  They used to have this WLAC [WLAC Radio] and, out of Nashville [Tennessee].  They used to play this show from Gallatin, Tennessee, 'Randy's Record Shop' ['Randy's Record Shop Show'], and you could order the records and all that.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You, you, you didn't get that here?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: (JOE SCHAFFNER):  Was the time when you was on the road traveling, that was the only station you could get on the radio at night--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but see, this is before then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're talking about when she was a kid, I guess, growing up.
Story_ID: 474255
Speaker 1: Okay, so Detroit [Michigan] had a black station.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, all right.  Now did you--when did you first, I guess, think about singing?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: I mean (background noise)--
Speaker 2: I never thought about singing, not really.  I used to sing in a choir, 'cause I attended Smith Chapel Church [Smith Chapel A.M.E. Church, Inkster, Michigan].  And I sang with an, an organization, which the, the Roberts [ph.] kids were very--I won't say instrumental, but they were very, they were real good singers.  And--
Speaker 1: These are the Roberts--
Speaker 2: The Roberts family--
Speaker 1: Family, okay.
Speaker 2: --were real good singers, and I joined a group that they had.  But then again, and, and I always sang--well, when I got into high school [Inkster High School, Inkster, Michigan] I sang in the chorus and the glee club.  But I didn't--uh, singing, that was the furthest thing from my mind (laughter).  It was the furthest thing from my mind--
Story_ID: 474256
Speaker 1: I know there are lot of--there's shows on television with pe- with a lot of singing on TV in those days, well, a lot of variety shows and that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Of course, because--
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite variety show by any chance?
Speaker 2: I think everybody more or less, like, sat down and watched 'The Ed Sullivan Show' because he had a variety of guess and stuff like that.  And that's all we had to do pretty much on Sundays because, well, in my house, if you didn't go to church on Sundays, there wasn't doing anything else.  But after church we, sometimes we would go to the show or, and then after the show, we would take--and come home, and we would watch 'Ed Sullivan,' so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite performers on 'The Ed Sullivan Show' in those days?
Speaker 2: I don't know that I did. I, I mean I can't recall that I did.
Story_ID: 474257
Speaker 1: But then again, I was very intrigued after I saw Elvis Presley.  I was very intrigued by that.
Speaker 2: Now this is around '56 [1956] or '57 [1957], right, when he--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh. And I said oh, okay. Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So he was kind of like a new teenage sensation I guess.
Speaker 1: I think that that was more it than anything else, because during that time, you didn't have a lot of blacks on TV at all.  So we had to always, like, watch white because the blacks weren't, you know.  Because, when you did records--I remember when we [The Marvelettes] did our first record, our picture wasn't on the cover or on the jacket of the album.  And I remember hearing something about the reason that our picture wasn't on the cover was because most people didn't know that we were black, you know, or if they knew that we were black or they suspected that we were black, having a picture, having our picture on the cover would more or less let them know that we're black.  And that would keep a lot of white households from--the parents of the kids, from allowing the black to come into their home.  In other words, they didn't want to be invaded bly- by black music.
Story_ID: 474258
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna take, take you back a little further to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, Lord.
Speaker 1: --grade school.  I, I didn't ask you, like, what, now what grade school did you go to?
Speaker 2: I attended Carver Elementary School [Inkster, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have a, a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: I, I, I used to like math, in, in, in grade school and junior high school.  But then in high school [Inkster High School, Inkster, Michigan] math was not my favorite (laughter) subject at, at all (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you--where, where did you go to junior high school?
Speaker 2: I attended Ford Junior High School [Henry Ford Junior High School, Highland Park, Michigan], and then we moved to Fellrath Junior High School [Inkster, Michigan].
Speaker 1: So you, you moved--were you still in Inkster [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But see, they were closing down Ford--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because Ford originally was the high school.  And they made it a junior high school, and they decided to split the grades.  And then I went there for one year, and then the following year I went over to Fellrath.
Speaker 1: How, how do--it's Fel- what is it, Fellrath?
Speaker 2: F-E-L-L-R-A-T-H.
Speaker 1: Okay, Fellrath Junior High School.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 474259
Speaker 1: Had other youth in junior high school or high school tried to form their own groups?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would say so.
Speaker 1: It seems to me, just, just thinking about that time period--I was, I was younger, but thinking about that time period, I know that people would sing under the street (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, he was younger (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, well, people would single under the streetlamps.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And they would do that.  And, and kids would get together at their friend's house in the basement or something.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They'd play the record and sing along.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they would try to get the parts right.  And then, I know a lot of people emerged by just doing that.  I don't know if you--that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What--
Speaker 1: --going on in your--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but see--
Speaker 1: --neighborhood too.
Speaker 2: --they had a lot of under the lamp singing--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and the corner, corner groups and all like that.  I remember the first time I saw The Miracles was at a theater that we had out there in Inkster [Michigan].  And the first time I saw Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson], and Claudette [Claudette Rogers Robinson], and Bobby [HistoryMaker Bobby Rogers], and Ronnie [Ronald White], and Pete [HistoryMaker Pete Moore] were at this theater because they were having a show there.  And as I remember, I had seen Otis [HistoryMaker Otis Clayborn Williams] of The Temptations before I had even seen Smokey, because I think I saw Otis at a cabaret or something like that--
Speaker 1: Okay, this is in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) which I wasn't really--
Speaker 1: --high school [Inkster High School, Detroit, Michigan], right?
Speaker 2: --supposed to be at.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: But then again (laughter), then, but then again, I did.  And so then he wasn't with the, The Temptations because there was no such thing as Temptations.  He was with The Distants.
Story_ID: 474260
Speaker 1: Were you a attentive student in high school [Inkster High School, Inkster, Michigan]?  Did you really like your studies or, or where you distracted?
Speaker 2: I was somewhat attentive.  But I didn't--I thought that instead of being a singer, I always wanted to be a legal secretary, because that was the highlight of, of my dreams, you know.  I never, I never anticipated or had any knowledge about show business or going into show business or anything like that, because the main thing that I wanted to do was be a legal secretary.
Speaker 1: Now, now where did you get that idea?
Speaker 2: I, I don't have a clue where I got that idea.
Speaker 1: Did you know anybody (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I've always liked business.
Speaker 1: But did you know anybody who was a legal secretary?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.  During that time you didn't--you didn't have that many people around--I mean they worked in the hospital, but they weren't necessarily nurses.  Or, they worked, but then again, you know, I never knew a legal secretary or anything like that.  But that's what I've all, I'd always wanted to be.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't know why (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now I have an idea.  I don't know if I should say it, but I know Perry, Perry Mason's secretary in those days, it's a very popular show ['Perry Mason'], especially in the black community.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: His secretary, Della Street, was always--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --real cool.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And I don't know if that's where, because I've heard this a many time, many times, that black women wanted to be legal secretaries--
Speaker 2: Well, maybe that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) as a--and--
Speaker 2: --maybe that's where it count- comes from psychologically.  Maybe that's where it came from.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it just dawned on me that maybe that's the model, 'cause that's the only one I could think of in popular culture, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: --where you, you could get that idea without knowing somebody that actually was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, but then again--
Speaker 1: --one.
Speaker 2: --black people during that time weren't, or not that they weren't, but I wasn't familiar with them being doctors, or I wasn't want familiar with them being dentists.  Or, or anything that calls for higher education, I wasn't familiar with, with any of those people.
Story_ID: 474261
Speaker 1: Now was the commu- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So then--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just wondered if the community in Inkster [Michigan]--not being from around here--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I know if you grew up in Detroit [Michigan], I guess, and you lived on the west side of Detroit in the mid-'60s [1960s], you would be, you'd have Judge Keith [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith] for a neighbor or, or somebody like that.  You know, you could (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --possibly--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, now that's--
Speaker 1: --be in the same neighborhood.
Speaker 2: --very possible.
Speaker 1: But in Inkster--
Speaker 2: But see, in Inkster--
Speaker 1: --could you, could you have that kind of neighbor in Inkster, or is it --
Speaker 2: I think the--
Speaker 1: --possible?
Speaker 2: --the biggest person that you had was a teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think that was the biggest person that you had was a teacher.
Speaker 1: So it's much like, Inkster was much like I guess the black community was after integration happened and everybody, say, left the inner city of Chicago [Illinois] for the suburbs--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --or left the, you know, other big cities, the inner--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --core of the city and started running to the suburbs.  Inkster was a suburb that already had--the, the somebodys hadn't run there.  You know, they had--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but see--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: --a lot of people left Inkster--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because they wanted to branch out, because as they went to high school they began to learn.  And as they began to read more, they began to know that more was available to them, you know.  And by going to college and all like that, they knew that there were many things available to them other than being a teacher or other than being a preacher.  You know, because there's a friend of my brother that's a part of NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], and he's very high up in NASA.  And so, and, and there's a, a, a young lady that I know that's a judge.  And during that time, how many people were judges and stuff like that, especially out there Inkster?
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, I just wondered what the dynamic was in the--so, so, yeah, so you wanted to be a legal secretary.  And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so did, did you have an idea of how to do that?
Speaker 2: Well, (laughter) yes, I did 'cause I was always very good in filing and doing work like that 'cause I used to do that in elementary school [Carver Elementary School, Inkster, Michigan].  Whenever I got in a little bit of trouble, the principal would always have me come in and do filing and alphabetize and all like that.  So then I, I knew somewhat how to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so--
Speaker 2: (JOE SCHAFFNER):  (Unclear) you mentioned some of the other famous people, like Don [ph.]?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Oh, were there some other famous people in school with you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, you know--
Speaker 2: Or--
Speaker 1: --what--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that, this isn't about them, so--
Speaker 2: No, but it is the context though.  If they were there--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but see--
Speaker 2: --it's good to know.
Speaker 1: --that happened long after we did--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and so
Speaker 2: So it's not, this is not part of the story growing up, in other words?
Speaker 1: Well, no, not really.
Speaker 2: Okay, they're not part, okay.  All right, so where, where did you go (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We're the same age, but then again, a lot of it didn't, you know, happen during that time period--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) that we're referring to.
Story_ID: 474262
Speaker 1: Okay, now you went to high school where, at--
Speaker 2: Inkster High School [Inkster, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Inkster High School, okay.  And what was Inkster High School like?
Speaker 2: It was really nice.  I, I remember that I had to go back, I had to go back to the school around 1995, '94 [1994].  And I realized that the school had gotten larger.  They had cut out the parking in the front, and, and you had to park on the side.  And they didn't have the, the sidewalk in the front where you could go in the school.  You had to go into the side entrance.  So, and as I, as I thought about it, I said boy, time brings about a lot of changes.  And, because when, when we were going to school they had parking out there in front.  And kids that drove, they could park their car in the front, or sometimes they would park them on the side.  But then the side wasn't the main parking space, you know.  And so then, and I remember a lot about high school.  But then again, I remember the skirts we used to wear and the petticoats and all that kind of stuff, and as I reflect back.  And--
Speaker 1: What was the style then?  How, what, what length were the skirts in those days?
Speaker 2: The skirts were maybe almost as, you know, like here, (gesture) you know--
Speaker 1: Well, we can't see that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Maybe (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Is it down like mid--
Speaker 2: Well (laughter), okay, well, well--
Speaker 1: --almost ankle length?  Is that (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No, the skirts were--
Speaker 1: Mid--
Speaker 2: --like mid-calf.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And we had petticoats.  And you probably can't even find a petticoat now (laughter).  And, and we used to wear sweaters.  And most of the time I wore my hair in a ponytail.  And we had triangle scarves that we used to wear around our neck.  And that's--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have any, any special teachers or mentors in high school?
Speaker 2: My music director of the chorus, he was a special teacher.  And needless to say, I had another one.  I had several.  There was a Mrs. Cobb [Anita Cobb], and she--I don't, I don't remember what she taught.  And there was a Mrs. Sharpley [Shirley Sharpley], which was a counselor.
Speaker 1: Did you get good counseling in school you think (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't need counseling (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: Now we hear these horror stories often of black teenagers, you know, being discouraged rather than encouraged in school.  I mean I've heard I don't know how many hundreds of stories like that.  But, so you had decent--
Speaker 2: But I, I don't think that the majority of teachers at Inkster High School wanted kids to go to further their education, rather than letting--I think it's an idea of letting you get your college--I'm sorry--letting you get your high school diploma and stop.  I think that they were, they were telling you to go on.  You know what I'm saying?  They would talk to you about higher education.
Speaker 1: So they were encouraging you to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --move on?  Okay.
Speaker 2: They continued, uh-huh.
Story_ID: 474263
Speaker 1: Were there any other mentors in the community when you were a teenager, at church [Smith Chapel A.M.E. Church, Inkster, Michigan] or elsewhere?  I don't know if there are other--I don't know if you went to any, any other recreation centers or anything in, in growing up or--
Speaker 2: Well, there were, there were others, but then again, most of the people that I came in contact were--with were teachers.  And, and all the teachers, you know, when, whenever you had a problem you could go to the teachers.  Or, when I had problems, my dad's [Robert Anderson] theory was, I'm your dad, but I'm your best friend too; so then you could come and talk to me about anything; from A to Z you could talk to me about it.  So, if, if, if, if, if it was not that bad, you could talk to a teacher.  But if it was really bad (laughter), you could go home and talk to your dad.  And, well, I could go home and talk to my dad.  But then again, I wasn't that kind of a person, even though I knew it was available to me.  I knew, you know, I wasn't that kind of a person.
Speaker 1: You're not the kind of person that would seek advice, or you didn't have many problems or--
Speaker 2: I didn't have many problems.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then when I did, I mean, you know.  I (laughter), I remember playing sick a couple of days from school.  And my dad came in, and he said--as I played sick, and I had the worst stomachache--and my dad came in, and he said, "Well, chick, it seems like you're still sick.  Well, what is the problem?"  I said, "Oh, daddy, I don't know."  He said, "You're supposed to have a fight in school, aren't you?" (Laughter) And that really busted my bubble.  And so then he talked with me about it.  And then--
Speaker 1: So you were, you were actually staying home 'cause you didn't want to get, get in a fight?
Speaker 2: I didn't, I didn't like to be in a fight.  I didn't want to be in a fight.  I, I'm, I'm like that now.  I don't like to have confrontations or big arguments and stuff like that.  You know, I, I basically don't have time for it.  And I'm not doing anything, but I don't have time for it.  But anyway, my dad came, and he said that, he said, "Well, you're supposed to have a fight, aren't you?"  And so then I told him, "Well, yeah, daddy," and I went on to explain to him.  He said, "Well, let me tell you this: you have two choices," and he said, "You go to school and have that fight, and do the best you can, or you can stay home and fight me."  Well, my dad was about 6'2", and here I am as a little person.  And I chose to have the fight in school, because I couldn't imagine myself fighting my dad, you know.  And I think that was my dad's way of saying that it's not really that bad, if you just go ahead and, and, and deal with it from the onset.
Speaker 1: So it didn't, didn't seem like you had any alternative other than to be in this fight or--
Speaker 2: Well, no, because a lot of--for some reason or another, a lot of girls didn't like me.  And, and to this day I don't know why and, and stuff like that, because I never thought anything that some of the kids were thinking.  I never thought I was better than any of them.  I never thought I was pretty.  And I never thought I was all that smart.  But then again, I held my own, but I never thought any of that stuff.  And so then I couldn't understand why they would want to fight me.
Speaker 1: Okay, now were, were you a mem- what did you--well, I guess we (laughter) have to ask the question.  Did, did you get out of that fight all right, or did you, did it, you know, did you have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yeah--
Speaker 1: --the fight?
Speaker 2: --I did have the fight.  One of them I ended up beating the girl until she went into a cubby hole, because I remember we were at a, a Brownie meeting and stuff like that.  And we had the meeting in a, a, a kindergarten room.  And you know how the kindergartens have those small spaces--
Speaker 1: To hang your coats (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) to hang your coats up and stuff like that.  And, and, and so then the girl, I just asked her, I said, "Well, go ahead and just leave me alone.  I don't know what this is all about," and, or anything like that.  So, you know, just leave me alone.  She went on; she proceeded to hit me, and then it was on and popping from there (laughter), right.  So yeah, I, I ended up not being expelled from school.  I ended up going to the office and doing some file work.
Speaker 1: Filing (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Story_ID: 474264
Speaker 1: We were talking about high school [Inkster High School, Inkster, Michigan] and--well, school.  You, you mentioned the Brownies, but you said off camera you were a member of the Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America] too at one time--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: --yeah, I was a member of the Girl Scouts, and then much later on when I had children of my own I was co-leader of a Girl Scout troop, a cadet troop and for my oldest daughter [Keisha Schaffner] and a leader for my younger daughter [Kalaine Schaffner]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Girl Scouts, and I love it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was my first experience in camping.
Speaker 1: Okay, in the Girl Scouts when you were, when you in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --grade school [Carver Elementary School, Inkster, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were you a member of any clubs and organizations in high school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: All right.  So what did you, what did you do?  Did you work in your spare time, or did you--what did, what did you do?
Speaker 2: I didn't do much of anything because my mother [Florence Smith Anderson] was out working.  My dad [Robert Anderson] was out working.  So then I was responsible for the, my family, and so then that's what I did, is took care of my brothers and my sisters [sic. sister].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were the oldest one home then?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the oldest one period (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so your day would, in high school, consist of going to school and then coming home and being there for your brothers and sisters.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 474265
Speaker 1: You said you were in a chorus in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  And so you started singing, you said you started singing professionally when you were sixteen, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So how did this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How about that?
Speaker 1: --how did this take place?  Now you didn't have any ambitions to be necessarily a big singer, but what, what happened?
Speaker 2: We, we needed something to do, or we wanted to do something.  And Gladys Horton, which was, she was a junior--not really a junior--a sophomore.  And because when we organized, we weren't a senior yet, so then we're juniors.  And then after we got organized, and we had the talent show and all like that, during that time we became seniors.  So then Gladys Horton said you know, more or less like, let's start a group because of the fact that they were having a talent show at Inkster High [Inkster High School, Inkster, Michigan].  And we didn't have anything else to do.  And so then Juanita [Juanita Cowart] and Georgeanna [Georgeanna Tillman], which stayed right around in a, in a, the corner from me, and we didn't have anything else to do but sit up and play cards or something like that when I wasn't doing housework.  And then Georgia Dobbins--Gladys had gotten Georgia Dobbins to join the group.  And--
Speaker 1: So that's, that's five now?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's, we started out with five, which we ended up with two.  The bottom line is when our career was over we ended up with two original members.
Speaker 1: Okay, so these--you started, you had five girls, and, and you all would meet and, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we would meet and rehearse and all that kind of stuff, and--
Speaker 1: Did you, did you, like, sing the songs of other groups already out--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --then.  Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what we did, because--I'm trying to think of the song that we used to sing.  But then again--I can't recall it now--but then again, we sung songs, and we got dressed for the talent show.  And I think that we had red blouses and white skirts, and you know, anklet like kind of socks and shoes and stuff like that.  And that's what we had to perform in.  We had I think it was a red, a red scarf around our neck.  We had white sweater or something like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we, we performed, and we danced and all like that.  But, and we thought that we were really raising hell, to end up that we didn't win.  And they chose three other people that had been in the talent shows before.  And, and as--when the talent show was over, Mrs. Sharpley [Shirley Sharpley] recognized that we were very good.  And so then she volunteered to take us down to Motown [Motown Records], or she would call Motown and asked us if we can have an audition too because we were the fourth rather than the top three.  And that's what the, the prize was, and that was, the prize was to get a Motown contract.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your group at that point?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) The name of our group was The Casinyets.
Speaker 1: The Casinyets, and that--
Speaker 2: Casinyets.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And basically, Gladys used to always say we couldn't sing yet.  So then that's what we named our group.
Speaker 1: Couldn't--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So (laughter), stood for can't sing yet.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That is what--
Speaker 1: The Casinyets.
Speaker 2: --it's suppo--
Speaker 1: The Ca- the Casinyets.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and so that was--your first performance was this talent show?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you got fourth, fourth place.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was this at Inkster High School or--
Speaker 2: It was at Inkster High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they were having a talent show.
Speaker 1: So this is 1960--
Speaker 2: Nine--around 1960.
Speaker 1: Around 1960, okay.
Story_ID: 474266
Speaker 1: Now at this time, at this juncture, was Motown [Motown Records] well-known at all (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not as well-known, because Motown was an up and coming record company.  And in fact, they were so new that a lot of things that people say now was happening, weren't happening when we came to Motown, like the artist development and the charm school and all that kind of stuff, and the choreography and all that kind--we had to do all of that ourselves.  And then in 1965--
Speaker 1: Now don't get too far.  Now I want to get you all started first.  How--I want to walk you through--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: --how you guys started.  Now, now you, you, so, so--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you win the talent show [at Inkster High School, Inkster, Michigan], come in four (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --no, you come in fourth place--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --fourth place.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And Mrs. Sharpley [Shirley Sharpley]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, promises to take you to Motown anyway, right, and get you an audition, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, now who, who was signed to Motown then and was on--who, who was on the radio from Motown in those days?  Was anybody on the radio then, or--
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson and The Miracles.
Speaker 1: Smokey, okay.
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: And that was--was that--
Speaker 2: --and Mary Wells.
Speaker 1: Mary Wells, okay; Smokey Robinson and Mary Wells, okay.  Okay, so they were known.  People knew that--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and really, like I, I have said that we were quite excited by it, and we thought that our performance was good enough that we could have won a slot.  But then again, the powers that be says well, no, it wasn't that good, so we didn't win.  But overally, as I look back at it, we did win, because we had the opportunity audition for Berry [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] and--
Speaker 1: Did you come to this building here, this house?  Was this, was this the one he was using then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Background noise) Because during the time, this was all--like that partition over there was all--it wasn't even there, really, because when we began to sing, we had to sing, and, and we didn't have a shield, or the drums didn't have a shield so that you couldn't hear it.  And so, yeah, um-hm, and we ended up being so disappointed (laughter).
Speaker 1: What your audition didn't turn out too well?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, our audition turned out okay.  But then again, the effects from them the talent show left us really disappointed because we knew that we were good.  And--
Speaker 1: Well, do you remember--
Speaker 2: --the people did too.
Speaker 1: --do you remember who won the talent show?
Speaker 2: There--I remember two other acts.  There was a Clarence Finch [ph.], which he won, and a Millicent--I think her name was Morrison [Millicent Morrison Sherman].  I don't remember who the third person was.
Speaker 1: And did they go on to fame, or--
Speaker 2: No.  We were the only ones, the people that didn't win that signed with Motown.
Story_ID: 474267
Speaker 1: So Mrs. Sharpley [Shirley Sharpley] brought you all--did she--did, did she come over with you when you had your audition (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I mean how did you feel that day when you were being auditioned?  I mean what was you feel--did you like [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy, or did you like the staff over here?  Did you feel like that they made you feel comfortable, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, see, they didn't have that much of a staff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They had, you know, maybe two or three writers and Berry and stuff like that.  But they didn't have a staff of people as they did much, much later on, because we had to--the first thing we had to do was, after we signed the contract, was to come up with an original song.
Speaker 1: So he signed you just right--he--you had a successful audition.  He just signed right up.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He asked us for an original song.
Speaker 1: Before he would sign a, would sign a contract?
Speaker 2: Um, well, after, you know, simultaneously.  We signed a, we signed a contract, and then he asked us, he said well, we need an original song.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he thought you had a lot of potential then I guess--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --too, and he was willing to take a chance on you--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now who, who sang lead in, in these, on these songs for you?
Speaker 2: I sang lead, and I think Georgia [Georgia Dobbins] sang lead.  I think we auditioned with two songs.
Speaker 1: I think of all the groups that come out of Motown [Motown Records], probably it's--unless you're probably from Detroit [Michigan], you--we wouldn't know who sang lead 'cause The Marvelettes, we, we saw them as The Marvelettes, and we didn't--
Speaker 2: Right, but see-
Speaker 1: But it was Martha and The Vandellas (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but see, you know, what?  Martha--
Speaker 1: The Supremes--
Speaker 2: --and The Vandellas--
Speaker 1: --though, you didn't kind of--
Speaker 2: --weren't Martha and The Vandellas until after The Supremes became Diana Ross and The Supremes.  And Martha [HistoryMaker Martha Reeves] wanted to change her name, and that made it Martha and The Vandellas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we didn't have that kind of a problem.  We didn't have that much--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of a ego, and we liked the way we were because the unique thing about The Marvelettes is that we had two lead singers.  And most of them, like The Supremes, had one, and Martha and The Vandellas had one, so.  And we had two lead singers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so it was the five of you that signed--
Speaker 2: But see--
Speaker 1: --the contract.
Speaker 2: --Georgia didn't sign the contract.  And so then it meant that we needed to find another person.  And that person, Gladys [Gladys Horton] went to a Wanda Young, which was out of high school, and she asked her about singing.  And Wanda said yes, that she would sing.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Wanda Young replaced her.  And--
Speaker 2: Re- replaced Georgia Dobbins (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--okay.
Story_ID: 474268
Speaker 1: Was it difficult trying to come up with your own song?  I mean what, what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think it was really that difficult because of the fact Georgia [Georgia Dobbins] knew someone that wrote songs.  But then again, he wrote bluesy type of songs.  And with that being the case, she asked him (cough) excuse me.  He had a title for 'Please Mr. Postman,' but he did not have a song for 'Please Mr. Postman.'  And Georgia was very talented in her own way.
Speaker 1: She's the one that didn't sign?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's the one that didn't sign.  But then again, as I look at it now, it wasn't meant for her to sign, you know, because she brought Motown [Motown Records] its first million seller record in 'Please Mr. Postman.'
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And she wrote it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She wrote it, and then other people got on the bandwagon.  But (laughter) then again, she wrote the song.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so that's how the song--a friend of hers had a title or--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did, did he have a poem or lyrics or something too?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, no.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: He just had a title.
Speaker 1: Just a title?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And I didn't even find that out until much, much later on.  In fact, I only found it out last year.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so Georgia wrote the song then (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: She wrote the song.
Speaker 2: She wrote the song.
Speaker 1: This is something that--
Speaker 2: But a lot of people--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --got on the bandwagon.  Needless to say, the guy that had the title, she gave him credit, which his name I think was William Garrett.  And she gave him credit for it, and then, which we found out much later on, she didn't even have to do that because he just had a title.  And so both--you know, needless to say, we didn't know.  And a lot of people got on the, the train that didn't do much.  They may have put in a word or two or maybe two words or three words or something like that, and they got credit for writing it, and so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how many songs did you try out before 'Please Mr. Postman' became--I mean, they decided--did they--did Berry [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] decide to record any other songs before then or just that--was that, that the first one?
Speaker 2: That was our first run- that was our first recorded song.  And that was Motown's first million seller.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is 1962, this?
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961].
Speaker 1: Sixty-one [1961].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-one [1961], right.  Okay, 'Please Mr. Postman,' 1961.  And it was Motown's first million seller?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 474269
Speaker 1: Kind of explain the sequence of what happens, 'cause you recorded the record ['Please Mr. Postman'], and it gets--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --distributed.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then, as it starts--did, did you do a lot of personal appearances in the beginning or what?
Speaker 2: Well, we did a lot of record hops, and then, because we were still in school.  And when it came time for us to go out, we had the choice of going out or being replaced by five other girls, because Berry [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] said for us to go- for us to go on out there or replace us because our popularity had gained so.  Nobody knew who we were anyway because there was no picture on a record or anything like that, so.  And so then we, we decided to take and leave school and go on out, because what sense does it make to have somebody else go out there, and we had done all the hard work?  Right, so.
Speaker 1: So actually it was an option (laughter)--yeah, I don't think too many people would decide to let somebody else go out and be them and after they--
Speaker 2: Well, you know what--
Speaker 1: --make a hit.
Speaker 2: --at, at sixteen--Georgeanna [Georgeanna Tillman], and Juanita [Juanita Cowart], and myself, we were sixteen; Gladys [Gladys Horton] was fifteen; Wanda [Wanda Young] was seventeen.  So, as we talked about it and all like that, we didn't feel that it was right for any other girls to be going out there because, as I've said, we had done all of the work.  So why should we have anybody else go out there and promote the record or have a ten-year, a, a ten-year reign of music?
Speaker 1: Well, how did your families feel about that, about your leaving school to go on the road?
Speaker 2: My mother [Florence Smith Anderson] was totally opposed to it; she was totally opposed to it.  But then again, my dad [Robert Anderson] said that opportunity only knocks once, and this may be my opportunity.  And he would not want to be responsible for me missing my opportunity if this is it.  And so then that's, that's when they agreed to go ahead and let me go out there, because my mother said well, she is responsible, you know.  Because being the oldest, you had to have responsi- I--you had to be responsible, and then I had a lot of responsibilities.  So then my mother knew that I wasn't gonna do anything, you know, to disgrace them, them or to disgrace myself.
Speaker 1: Well, how was it?  Now, here, you know, five teenage girls, going out on the road.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, I mean were, were you--was, was any of it frightening?
Speaker 2: No, when, when we first started going out, no.  But we did go out with a chaperone because we were under age.  And we did go out with a chaperone, which Mrs. Edwards [Esther Gordy Edwards] was our first chaperone.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I, I imagine that, you know, you all were more excited than anything else, but--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, naturally.  I mean because the, the point of it is, is that we were getting out of Inkster [Michigan], you know.  Somebody asked: well, what was wrong with Inkster?  And, and I, I, more or less, like, laughed and said well, you know what: there was nothing wrong with Inkster, but there is such a wide world out there that we wanted to explore it, and so.  But we ended up coming back home.
Speaker 1: Well, that's well put.  You know, a lot, lot of people don't phrase it like that.  But yeah, it's a big world out here, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's an awfully big world.  And rather than to sit at home in Inkster, we could explore the world.
Story_ID: 474270
Speaker 1: And the first place that we went to performing, not doing a record hop, was to Washington, D.C.  And we tried doing schoolwork and stuff like that.  But then again, we were doing four and five--four shows through the week, and we were doing five shows on the weekends.  And if the house was really sold out, we would do six shows.  And so I often marvel at the fact that people were talking about--well, the artists today are talking about how they have worked and stuff like that.  I said you know what: they don't even know what work is all about, because the veterans, the pioneers are the ones that really worked and made it available to the artists out there nowadays that they don't have to.  Two shows is probably like their max.
Speaker 2: Per week, you say, or, or what, or per--
Speaker 1: Two shows per perfor- performance.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, two, okay.
Speaker 1: But see, we used to have to do four shows every day until the weekend.  And then we'd five on Saturdays.  And Sundays we would do six if, if the crowd was there we would do six.
Speaker 2: Six shows?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Soon as we get off stage, we take and send somebody to go get us something to eat and stuff like that because before we knew it, it was time to go back on, so yeah.
Story_ID: 474271
Speaker 1: Let me go back, back a little bit to when you first got started.  I mean when, when you, you first signed with Motown [Motown Records].  How did the name Marvelettes [The Marvelettes], how was that chosen?
Speaker 2: Well, needless to say, we couldn't go out with The Casinyets (laughter).  But I, I, I used to always think that Berry [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] gave us the name.  But then after we had done a play, which I'm involved in, I discovered that Georgia helped to pick the name.  So, The Marvelette name came from Georgia, Georgia Dobbins.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she was really the (laughter)--
Speaker 2: She was very instrumental in--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in what we did and, and us having our first hit ['Please Mr. Postman'].
Story_ID: 474272
Speaker 1: And I think that 'Please Mr. Postman' did so well because that was during the era of the Vietnam War.  And a lot of ladies, in particular, and maybe gents too, were waiting on letters from whoever was over there in the war.  And so then I think that that's the reason that it did so well, because it was right--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --during the, the Vietnam War.
Speaker 2: Now, go to the lyrics for us.  It's--
Speaker 1: Uh, please (laughter).  Well, I know that it says something to the effect of--, "Please, Mr. Postman, look and see if there's a letter in your bag for me" because they had been waiting a long, long time to hear from the special person of theirs (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And this boyfriend of mine.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what--
Speaker 1: And so, that's the gist of it.  But ah, I can't repeat all the words to that.  It's been over, how many years (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Can you sing any of it at this--
Speaker 1: Well, you know what: no.
Speaker 2: Did you, now did you sing lead, lead on that one?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't sing--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --lead on any.  Later in our careers, I was going to begin to start singing lead [for The Marvelettes], but I remember there's a song that I think Bobby Womack had.  My voice wasn't commercial enough, because I have--I had first soprano-type voice.  And I could sing second, but it wasn't commercial enough to sing lead on any of the songs, not really.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you sang background, basically, and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had a ball back there (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I had a ball in the background, yeah.
Story_ID: 474273
Speaker 1: When you went on the road, did you, did you go with the 'Motown Revue' [sic. 'Motortown Revue']?  Was it The Miracles and the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --and all of you--
Speaker 2: --sometimes--
Speaker 1: --or what?
Speaker 2: I mean, the first review we did do I think it was in 1962, and that was a 'Motown Revue.'  But then again, we weren't too--like I, like I've said, the first show that we ever did was the Howard Theatre [Washington, D.C.].  And then after the Howard was the Royal Theatre in Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I mean, so when, so were you--but did, did, did you start doing the shows just as The Marvelettes?  I mean without--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, we--
Speaker 1: --without any--
Speaker 2: --began to do shows as a package, you know, because if there was Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson] on a show or Mary on a show, we would be picked to go with them, you know.  But we held our own.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We held our own.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause I think I, I somewhat remember Mary Wells being on shows with The Marvelettes and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now did, did you all every sing background for Mary Wells when she would do her act?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did she just--
Speaker 2: Right, because during that time, we were too busy singing our own songs because they would release them I think every six months or so.  A new song would be released.
Story_ID: 474274
Speaker 1: Now what's some of the others after 'Please Mr. Postman'?  Was that the biggest one, the, the first one?
Speaker 2: That was the first million seller.  But then again, we've had several mediocre sellers.  We've had several that went to the top ten but not to number one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What are some of the ones? Can you give some of the names?
Speaker 2: 'The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game'; 'Danger Heartbreak Dead Ahead'; 'Strange I Know'; 'Tie A String Around'--let's see, 'Tie A String Around Your Finger'; 'Playboy.'
Speaker 1: (JOE SCHAFFNER):  'Beechwood.'
Speaker 2: 'Beechwood 4-45789' [sic. 'Beechwood 4-5789'].
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the, I think, may--was, was that the biggest one?  That sound--you know, it seems like the one you hear the most, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.
Speaker 1: I don't know if was or not; I mean commercially, I don't know.
Speaker 2: No, I don't think it was the biggest one.  'Playboy'--I mean 'Please Mr. Postman' was the biggest one.  And we, we've had quite a few hits, mediocre and big.
Story_ID: 474275
Speaker 1: All right, after 'Please Mr. Postman,' Motown [Motown Records], Motown started to really take off, I guess in '61 [1961] and '62 [1962], with more acts come (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --coming in.  And--
Speaker 2: Well, maybe around '62 [1962] or the later of '61 [1961] they began to get more acts because of the fact that with 'Please Mr. Po-' 'Postman' they were gaining in popularity.  You know, they may have had some popularity because The Miracles had 'Shop Around,' and Mary Wells had 'Bye Bye Baby.'  But then when 'Please Mr. Postman' came along, they got even more popularity because of the fact it broke the, the scale for a crossover music.  And so I think that when 'Please Mr. Postman' came around everything began to change for Motown.
Speaker 1: Now did, did, did Gloria continue to, to write--I mean Georgia [Georgia Dobbins]--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Georgia did not continue to write because she ended up that she was quite depressed over her father not allowing her to sing and sign a contract.  So she ended up being quite depressed about that.  But then again, as time has gone on, a couple of years ago I told her, I said, "Maybe by your father not letting you go there, maybe that what wasn't what you were supposed to do anyway," because I'm a firm believer that everybody's has life cards.  And in her life's cards it wasn't meant for her to go out there, but it was meant for her to write a song for us.
Speaker 1: Now did she get compensated for that song and pretty--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she should have--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, you say she should have.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she should have.
Speaker 1: But do you know if she did (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she didn't write--who wrote 'Beechwood' ['Beechwood 4-5789']?  That sounds like it might have been written by the same person, but it's--I guess not.
Speaker 2: I--'Beechwood,' 'Beechwood.'
Speaker 1: (JOE SCHAFFNER):  Wasn't it Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson] and--(unclear)?
Speaker 2: I don't really remember who wrote 'Beechwood' 'cause I have to look at the covers of the record or something like that 'cause that was a long time ago.  And I was busy performing more so than taking a look at who did what.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, I, I don't really know who did it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We were talking before we started the interview about the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --tendency of some people collect this information and study it and make a--but, but you were in it and not--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but see--
Speaker 1: --trying to do it, which is different.
Speaker 2: --you know what: yeah, it's a whole different thing when you're in it and moving around rather than listening to it, because we have a lot of, an awful lot of fans that can tell you more about what I did than I can tell you about what I did.  And so they, they take a look at you, and if they like you--excuse me--if they like you, they really do take and te- tear you apart somewhat.  They try to find out as much information as they can about you, right.
Story_ID: 474276
Speaker 1: Did you ever, did, did you ever have a time when you, you, it was that you felt you, you might leave the group [The Marvelettes] yourself?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The only time that--when I left the group, the group had disbanded, more or less.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So then I was the final person to leave the group.
Speaker 1: Okay, so well, tell, tell us about some of the comings and goings, because you said Georgia [Georgia Dobbins] couldn't get start--she started with you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She didn't--
Speaker 1: --but she couldn't go to the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but she just--
Speaker 1: --next level with you.
Speaker 2: --she just did the talent show [at Inkster High School, Inkster, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But then again, she didn't record.  And for recording purposes Wanda came in, which her name was Wanda Young.  And then the first person to drop out of the group was Juanita [Juanita Cowart] because she had a nervous breakdown, because traveling on road, a lot of people don't realize, it can be very, very strenuous.  It can be very, very strenuous.  And you sleep in, in guesthouses rather than hotels, because it's not like today, where you've got hotels that you can select to sleep in.  You had to sleep in guesthouses because, needless to say, we were black, and a lot of hotels wouldn't accept black--
Speaker 1: 'Cause of--
Speaker 2: --residences.
Speaker 1: --racial segregation.
Speaker 2: Right.  And so then we ended up having to sleep in guesthouses.  And--
Speaker 1: Meaning, now, now what would a guesthouse be, like a--
Speaker 2: A house that was divided into multi-rooms, and you just sleep there and, and, and get up the next day and go to work.
Speaker 1: A few cities did have some hotels and motels.  But do you remember Roberts [Roberts Motel] in Chicago [Illinois]?  Was that operating when you all were on the road?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Un-huh, and there was a hotel down there in Atlanta [Georgia] that was available to black people.  But not many hotels were available to black people.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the one in Atlanta we're talking about, the, Herman Russell's  place, I guess the, right near Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], right, the--
Speaker 2: Don't start me to lying.
Speaker 1: --Paschal's, Paschal's motor inn [Paschal's Motor Hotel and Restaurant, Atlanta, Georgia], I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Paschal's, that, that had to be it, yeah.  So, no, I don't want you to start lying (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: So, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'd rather not answer then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 474277
Speaker 1: Juanita [Juanita Cowart] dropped out of the group [The Marvelettes].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: She had a nervous--
Speaker 2: Right, and--
Speaker 1: And was, was it a special place or in a situation?  Like, was she overseas, or was she, you know--
Speaker 2: No, fortunately, we were still here, and she had a nervous breakdown on the road.  And for us that saw her go through those kind of changes or antics, it was quite frightening.  Because if you, if you've never seen anybody have a nervous breakdown, you know, it's frightening to you.  Even if you have seen it, you know, you, you don't expect it.
Speaker 1: So what did--did you bring you bring somebody else in, or did--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You just went on with the four?
Speaker 2: We went on with four.  And we stayed out there maybe about two years, and then one--Georgeanna [Georgeanna Tillman] had sickle cell, and later she found out she had lupus.  And so then that meant that she had to come off the road because of health reasons, and so she did.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's really a terrible--that lupus--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --is bad, yeah.
Speaker 2: So I've heard, because the medicine that she was taking for the lupus counter- counteracted the medicine that she was taking for the sickle cell.  So then the doctor (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that the--
Speaker 2: --suggested that she come off the road.
Speaker 1: Now, many people, many, especially even in the black community, had not been aware of sickle cell anemia prior to the early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you, did you, did you all, were, were you all aware of it in those days, or is it in retrospect, or--
Speaker 2: Well, I think that many people didn't know about, but then again, it was something like sort of kind of new in the '60s [1960s].  And it busted open more because they found that more and more black people had the sickle cell.  And then they began to talk about it a lot more in the late '60s [1960s] or the early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay, so that brings you down to three.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now where are we now?  What, what, what year is this?
Speaker 2: Ooh, don't, I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Is this '63 [1963], '64 [1964]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966] I think.
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966], okay.  So you had a pretty, a pretty good run with, with most of the people, right--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --until '66 [1966].  And then, did--now--
Speaker 2: And then Gladys [Gladys Horton] dropped out--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because she had gotten married.  Well, she was expecting.  She had gotten married and stuff like that.  And her, she had began to start showing.  And needless to say, Motown [Motown Records] didn't want that to be happening, and so then she dropped out.  And then that left only Wanda [Wanda Young] and myself.
Story_ID: 474278
Speaker 1: So when you look back on those years, is there any special show or special moment that really stands out as the, as the most, as the pinnacle of your career [with The Marvelettes]?
Speaker 2: I don't know that there was a special show or anything like that.  I think it's more the people that we met along the way, and we met some fantastic people, artists.  We met some fantastic fans, but then again, if they didn't stay, stay with us, we lost them as we went along.  But then again, we met some fantastic people that were artists.  And I think that overally, that's probably--if somebody asked me what did I miss the most, I would think that that would be it.
Speaker 1: Well, who, who, who are some of the artists and the people that you really liked the most?
Speaker 2: Shirley [Shirley Owens] of The Shirelles, Tommy Hunt, which was like my brother, Chuck Jackson, needless to say Gladys Knight and the Pips, The Drifters.  And, and you know, I could probably go on and on, but then again, I would rather not (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, is there, is there a low moment out there?  I mean is there a moment when nothing seemed to work or, or, or something disastrous happened (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think--
Speaker 1: --in the show, or--
Speaker 2: --I think close or near the end of our reign things began to happen because Wanda [Wanda Young] had gotten involved with alcohol and drugs.  And her becoming involved in those two combinations of things, it began to turn chaotic, because oftentimes she would take and blow up at one of our musicians or the girl that was going out with us that was helping us get dressed.  She would blow up at them, and they would take and say well, you know, I'm tired of this, and this, that, and the other, and I quit.  And I'd have to sit down and talk with them and say well, don't quit it, because if you quit you'll leave me here all alone to fight this battle, and, and somebody else needs to be here.  And so, because of Wanda's thing, her involvement with drugs and alcohol, turned to be chaotic.
Story_ID: 474279
Speaker 1: Now how did it feel coming back to Inkster [Michigan] after you've made a hit, a million dollar record, and you know, being on the road?  I mean, how did your neighbors react to you?  And how did the people that you already knew, I mean did they, they act a little different, or where they pretty much the same?
Speaker 2: Well, they acted different when we, when we first began to start singing.  But then again, I lived downtown because I had gotten married to Joe [Joe Schaffner].  And I lived downtown for quite a while, and then I moved out to Nevada for about three years.  So then when we moved from Nevada--in fact, we moved from Nevada because my [maternal] grandmother [Bettie Preston Garnett] was real sick and, and all, and I was pregnant.  And so then that forced us, more or less, to move because I wanted to be with my grandmother and spend time with my grandther- grandmother before she passed.  And we decided around that time that we needed to move back because there were too many things that were going on here in Michigan where we needed to be home, because my sister [Sharon Anderson] was the only one that was available to help my mom [Florence Smith Anderson] because my dad [Robert Anderson] had died maybe about two and a half years before--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my grandmother had gotten sick.
Speaker 1: About what year is this that you came back to Inkster?
Speaker 2: (JOE SCHAFFNER): Seventy-seven [1977].
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was around '77 [1977].
Story_ID: 474280
Speaker 1: And by that time was the, was the group [The Marvelettes], like, the group then was, was over (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Had been over.
Speaker 1: --with, right?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did, did it end in, what, shortly after '66 [1966], or was it--
Speaker 2: It ended around 1970.  Well, Wanda [Wanda Young]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --continued to try to sing.  But then again, since I wouldn't cooperate with them, that didn't happen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so then I will say around '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: All right, so, so you had one member still trying to keep the group going or, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but see, she was causing problems for the group, so then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, I know the--when we interviewed Martha [HistoryMaker Martha Reeves] of Martha and The Vandellas, she said there was a certain juncture in which [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy just didn't offer them a contract anymore.  And did--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --did, did that happen to you all, or, or did you just, or did the group dissipate out before that happened?
Speaker 2: I think that we may have dissipated out before that happened, because often when there were contracts to be, needed to be signed, we were available to sign them, and we would sign them.  But then again, we had so much internal problem that nobody would, you know, look at it or take a listen to, to me or anybody else.  And so then we more or less, like, dissipated, and then it was all through with.
Story_ID: 474281
Speaker 1: I think people have to, you know, when they, they look at this, they probably will realize on some level that all of this was really new at the time, at the start of Motown [Motown Records], a black-run record company--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in the North--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, here, these young people coming in singing a, a kind of a new kind of music.  It's not--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the blues and so forth, but it's a little different--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --a different sound.  Did, when you look back on all that, do you have any reflections on how things were managed, or could they have been done differently, or, or what did you do right?  I mean, those, those are--you know.
Speaker 2: I don't know that things could have been done differently because it was a new venture for the majority of us.  And Motown was the first black record company in, in all of that, so.  And they had to go through their trials and errors too.  So then, I don't know that it could have been done any differently.  And I wouldn't expect that it would have been done any differently, because everything is learning--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as they go along; they learn as they were going along.
Story_ID: 474282
Speaker 1: Now did you have your own personal philosophy of performing as a--now you, you said you sang mostly backup [for The Marvelettes].  I mean did you have like a, kind of a code of--I mean to, to, to, to get along with people on the road for that long and to do it for that long, did you have a certain code of conduct that you had for yourself?
Speaker 2: I- you know, I always have gotten along with everybody.  And so then I don't think I had a particular code, you know, because I like most people that I meet.  There may be a few scoundrels in the mix, but then again, I, I, I like people.  And so then I think that people can recognize that I do like them.  And so then I had no problem with that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's nothing that you would say this is my philosophy of performing or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then when I performed, I just tried to do the best that I could all the time, even though there may have been some times that I was acting silly and all like that.  But then, that comes along with the territory.
Speaker 1: Do you think what you learned at home, you know, benefited you on the road?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there any particular thing you think that, that, that stood, stood you well, you know, over the years?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I don't know that my mother [Florence Smith Anderson] or my dad [Robert Anderson] told me how to act.  I think that I was just that kind of a person that acted respectful.  And that's the kind of person I am, because I don't remember that my mother or my dad talked to me about, well, you know how to act and stuff like.  I didn't want to, as I say, let them down.  But first and foremost, I didn't want to let myself down.  And I think that I hold myself to a very high esteem when it comes to doing things that are right against something that is wrong.
Story_ID: 474283
Speaker 1: Now as the other, other groups started to join the Motown [Motown Records] community, when The Supremes come in, then the Four Tops and other groups, I mean did it, did the groups that were already in place, did they say uh-oh, here's some (laughter)--that we're spreading ourselves too thin, or maybe that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know--
Speaker 1: --these are--how did you see the new groups--
Speaker 2: When Motown first started, they used to always say that they were a family.  But then again, they grew so fast that they outgrew being a family.  And, and that's the way I feel about it.  You know, I don't know how anybody else feels.  But, right now, all that matters is how I feel.  But then again, I think that they outgrew being a family, and they began to treat people differently, you know, so, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it started off as more of a family atmosphere, then kind of--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: As it got bigger it became more of a corporate style?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Story_ID: 474284
Speaker 1: Do you remember when you last performed, I mean when The Marvelettes were all together?  I mean, was there--was, was that just be--in, or around 1970?
Speaker 2: I think it was early '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Around--I think that we per- the last place we performed may have been the, the 20 Grand, which was here in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now some of the groups do these retrospective shows and go out and they do, you know, these nostalgia shows and so forth.  There's a lot of that going on now.  Do, do you every participate in those?
Speaker 2: Excuse me a minute (cough).
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay, do you have a good, good road story to tell us?
Speaker 2: Not really, not really, because all the road stories end up being alike through the years, you know.  They fade into one another, so then I don't know if I would be telling you the truth as the way something happened, or I would be fabricating the way something happened, so.
Speaker 1: Either way it's all right (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, well, okay.  Yeah, but I, I, I used to do the announcements at the Apollo Theater [New York, New York].  When they were having another show the following week, I would all--I was nominated to do the announcements the following, for the following week.  And I sometimes did them at the Howard Theatre [Washington, D.C.], so.  And that's the height.  I'm saying well, why me?  And they said well, why not?  You get on (laughter) out there and do it, so.  And that's the, the thing that I have.
Speaker 1: So you'd do the announcements that was coming the next week?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Story_ID: 474285
Speaker 1: What did you do after the, you, you stopped touring with The Marvelettes?
Speaker 2: Well, by then, I was wanting to be a parent.  And we adopted our son [Jason Schaffner], which we adopted him in '69 [1969], and then I had a daughter [Keisha Schaffner] in '70 [1970].  And so then I took to being at home and raising my kids.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you said you were in Las Vegas [Nevada] 'til '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You moved back to Inkster [Michigan].
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 474286
Speaker 1: Had there been any attempts over the years to get The Marvelettes back together again, or?
Speaker 2: Oh, there's been several attempts.  But then again, you know, what: I look at it as the point in fact, that was then; this is now.  And I've worked extremely hard with myself that I don't want to take and go back.  I don't want to take and try to recapture what was because you can't recapture that.  And so I opt to not go back into, into the oldies but goodies groove.  I don't wanna--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know it was a whole public television I think has a whole series of old groups, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --from back, in the--they're performing--
Speaker 2: But see--
Speaker 1: --now.
Speaker 2: --I often think, I said well, what, well, I don't know.  Each person has their own way of thinking, but then I, I choose not to be a oldie but goodie.
Story_ID: 474287
Speaker 1: Now, you group--well, The Marvelettes were kind of formed just in a, in the heart- during the height of the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you--are there any stories from those days that you can tell us that--
Speaker 2: Well, we were on a Motown [Motown Records] tour, and it was during the civil rights days.  And when we went down south, which most of the tour happened down south, but then, as we were traveling down south, they believed that the Motown bus was the Freedom Riders' bus.  And, and, and, and we had a big old sign on the side so the bus just said 'Motown Revue' [sic. 'Motortown Revue'] and stuff like that, but they believed that we were Freedom Riders.  And then one time when we were performing, after we had performed and got our accolades and people, ovations and all like that, we went out to the bus.  And then the next thing we know, there are some white guys out there shaking the bus, and they were trying to turn the bus over with all of us on it and all that kind of foolishness, you know.
Speaker 1: You think they, they resented you because you were from Detroit [Michigan] so much, or, or was it just--
Speaker 2: I think they resented us because we were black.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, and that you were--so they actually did, they, they actually though you were Freedom Riders or some reason--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--
Speaker 1: --thought you had something to do with--
Speaker 2: Yeah, indeed.  And, and we have been shot at and all that kind of stuff.  So then, as I think back over it, I said well, you know, what: that was a part of the avenue that I chose.  And I chose--the reason that I say that I chose it, because I chose to be an entertainer.  But needless to say, I didn't have any idea of how vengeful and how hateful people could be against black people.  I, I, you know, I can't understand it.  I--and during that time I couldn't understand it.  And now, forty-something years later, I still can't understand it, why there is so much hate, and why do people hate black people or Mexican people because they're different.  You can learn something from everybody if you just take the time out to speak to them.
Story_ID: 474288
Speaker 1: Did you perceive any difference between, say, the way Motown [Motown Records] did tours and other groups that were touring in those days?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I didn't have the experience that a lot of people had because a Motown tour was no different in what was happening, you know, than like a Otis Redding tour or a Joe Tex tour.  We were treated almost the same.  Maybe that's because we were ladies, or we always tried to be anyway.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  And those two guys always asked for them to be their co-stars.  That was the good thing about it.  They (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, really?  Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Same thing at the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York].  They would always depend on them for being good, strong co-stars to a lot of bigger stars.
Speaker 2: Yeah, baby, 'cause we had it going on (laughter).
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  They could dance.  I mean, they could dance.  Very few female groups out there danced.  They, they, they sang and the swayed, but these girls actually moved, so which was different.  They were physical.
Speaker 2: And ask me to do that now (shakes head) (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now did, now did you, did you come under the tutelage of Mrs. Powell [HistoryMaker Maxine Powell]?
Speaker 2: Well, we did, but not until '65 [1965], '66 [1966].  We did all of our own choreography in, in, from Play- I mean from 'Please Mr. Postman' down through whatever was the hit at the moment.  We did all of our own routines and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: So, just as you got together as teenagers and made up the, the, your steps and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you did, you all did the same thing as--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --when, when you were professionals (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  And then, I saw an interview with someone, and they were talking about one of the members of my group [The Marvelettes] coming on stage chewing gum.  And they said something about the fact that we didn't know better.  And I want to address that because of the fact nobody at Motown knew better, because we had to go out there.  We had to fend for ourselves; we had to do everything for ourselves.  And we, if we needed guidance or direction, we didn't have it because Motown was so new.  And, and I resented that statement because of what they said because nobody knew.
Story_ID: 474289
Speaker 1: It just occurred to me.  I don't know what kind of question this is, but di- was there ever a group or an individual who was, who came to Motown [Motown Records] that you all were sure was gonna be a big hit that just flopped, that didn't go anywhere?
Speaker 2: No, not really, because Motown was pumping out records and pumping out good records that I don't think any of them have, have been a flop.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They have had a couple of flops in their catalog, but then again, we did too, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause I just wondered 'cause, you know, you think of Motown, you think of the, of the, the so-called girl groups.  You got The Supremes, Martha and The Vandellas, and The Marvelettes.  And I just wondered if there was a, there were some other groups that tried to--who (laughter) got in and tried to make a record and didn't go anywhere.
Speaker 2: No, I think Motown, they did the best as they could by every individual artist.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they really--the selection process was, had to be pretty good then I guess to, to get a group that could sustain--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  And, and then on top of that, Motown was still growing.  And they, they, they got a lot of groups that were singing groups, but then again, they had a lot of writers on staff and you know, all, all that kind of stuff.  And then they got Cholly Atkins and Maurice King; Cholly Atkins, which was the choreographer, Maurice King, which worked with people in the vocals and stuff like that, and Mrs. Powell [HistoryMaker Maxine Powell], which worked with your poise (laughter), so, yeah.  But then--but before then you had to fend for yourself.
Story_ID: 474290
Speaker 1: Who were some of the unsung heroes of Motown [Motown Records] that you--
Speaker 2: Us (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, really. The, the bottom line is we have never gotten credit for the contribution that we have made to Motown.  And I think that is because of the mentality that people had that live in the city in comparisons to people that live in the suburbs.  And what I mean by that is we never got credit for our contribution to help to structure Motown.  And what I mean by structure, we had the first hit, the million seller hit.  And that allowed Motown to add more and more tentacles to their ostriches--I mean their octopus.  And so I think that we've never gotten credit for what we did, and that is because of the fact that we were from the suburbs and not from the City of Detroit [Michigan].  And I think that is the thing that I resent the most.  Not only that, but then again, we had to wait forty-something years, forty-three years to receive our Gold record.
Speaker 1: What, what happened?  I mean what--
Speaker 2: Don't ask me.
Speaker 1: Well, I don't, I don't even understand the process.  Now who gives, who actually gives you the Gold record?  The--
Speaker 2: The record company (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) company, the record does--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --right?  Okay, so though you earned a Gold--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --record, it didn't come--
Speaker 2: We didn't--
Speaker 1: --until--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and see--
Speaker 1: --forty--
Speaker 2: --that was one of the things that I wanted most because of the fact that I didn't want them to give me one, because if I hadn't earned it, I wouldn't expect one.  But then by me earning it, I expected it.  And needless to say, that didn't happen until 2004.  And we were presented our gold records for 'Please Mr. Postman' and 'Don't Mess with Bill' at Inkster High School [Inkster, Michigan].  And that was put on by the Inkster alumni association.  And I'm totally elated by that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's some, there is some recognition coming, but it's been slow coming together (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but forty-three years, hell--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --anybody can't be that slow.  A snail moves faster than that.
Story_ID: 474291
Speaker 1: And then on top of that, I have a play or we have a play that is about Motown [Motown Records] in the early days when Mary Wells was here, and Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson] was here, we were here.  And The Supremes were here but not--they hadn't gotten a record or a record that did anything and stuff like that.  And the play is called 'Now That I Can Dance' ['Now That I Can Dance: Motown 1962'] and--
Speaker 2: The Contours, on The Contours' song, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, and The--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Contours are in it.  And, and I, I am just totally flabbergasted by it because we cor- we correct some truth that--or falsehoods that have been told.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Is there any major one that you can--you, you feel free to share with us?
Speaker 1: Well, no, not really.  You have to come see the play (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) See the play?
Speaker 1: --ha, ha, ha.
Story_ID: 474292
Speaker 1: Now when, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could do it again?
Speaker 2: No, there isn't, not one, thing I would do any different because of the fact: if I had not had the experience of show business--show business developed a lot of our characters, and my character in particular, and I wouldn't change anything about it.  You know, we've had hard times; we've had good times, so.  But then again, that's life.
Story_ID: 474293
Speaker 1: We always ask this question that we've asked of everybody, but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --if there--what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Oh, Lord (laughter).  The hopes that I have are that young black kids would learn more about who they are.  And what I mean by that: they need to go into the African American history to know who they are.  And I would, I would like for them to take and open those books and begin to learn who we are, because the fact of the African American kids calling each other out of their names and, and all like that is unfounded.  And if they knew more about our history, they wouldn't be so apt and so fast or so quick to call each other out of their names, regardless of what they're saying in the name calling (laughter).

Speaker 1: Do you have any reflections on today's music?
Speaker 2: I think today's music is not as good as the music of the '60s [1960s].  And I don't think that it will hold the longevity that the music of the '60s [1960s] holds.  And with, with the language that some of the music, particularly rap, uses, it's uncalled for.  They could do the same thing without using the language that they use.  And I think that that's part of the reason that a lot of kids speak the way they speak and do what they do.

Speaker 1: When you look at everything that you've done up to this point, is there--what would you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I would consider today my legacy to be what my, my New Year's resolution is every year, is that I'm being the best person I can be.  And by me liking people regardless to where they are, who they are, what color they are and stuff like that, I would like to be remembered as the best person that I could be.

Speaker 1: You mentioned your family.  Can you just tell, just maybe tell, tell us who's in your family right now that you consider as your family?

Speaker 1: Is there anything I haven't asked you that you think you ought to address before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I think that you've covered the bases, covered all the bases.
Speaker 1: I'm sure I haven't, but (laughter), but here's the last question anyway.  This is similar to legacy.  But how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I, I, I, I, I really don't know.  I don't know because everybody's interpretation of what they would want or think that they would want will be different.  And, and I'm thinking that mine will be different too.
Speaker 1: (JOE SCHAFFNER):  (Unclear)--your grandson--(unclear)--could say that she was a teacher, that she was consistent, and wanting him to understand and to be somebody and to (clears throat)--I think her legacy would be as a teacher, you know, to teach people.  Experience, life's experience teaches you something, so you try to pass that on, and hopefully that they'll hold on to that and then pass it on to themselves.
Speaker 2: That's certainly how one per- per- person remembers you and--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --and hopefully the way everybody else will.
Speaker 1: That's true.
