Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story behind your name?
Speaker 2: I was named for my father's [Moses Desselle] sister.  Her name was Dolry, D-O-L-R-Y.  My mother [Thelma Tucker Smith] didn't like it. They called her Dolly [Dolly Desselle], so my mother then said, "Okay, we can name it for her, but it'll--it has to be Dolly."  She didn't like the Dolry.  That's how I got that.

Story_ID: 632208
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And we're gonna--I'm gonna ask, ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Moses Desselle], but we'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Thelma, T-H-E-L-M-A, Tucker, T-U-C-K-E-R, Desselle Smith [Thelma Tucker Smith].  When my father died, my mother remarried--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so--last name.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Gotta check that.  Nine, twenty-seven, 'o five [September 27, 1905].
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: Union, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is that near Marksville [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: No, that's near New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's probably about a hundred miles [sic.] from New Orleans, but it's--Marksville is central Louisiana near, near Mississippi.  This is more along the coastline.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about your ancestors on your mother's side and how far back can you trace them, first of all, and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Okay, my mother's father, his name was Albert Tucker, was the son of a white man, planter, and his black maid.  He, however, owned his children from his biracial union and left them property.  He did not send them to school except beyond probably about seventh grade, but he did give them land.  My mother's mother was the union of two black people also from that Union, Louisiana, area.
Speaker 1: Now, what was her, her name?
Speaker 2: Bertha [Bertha Tucker] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your grandmother?  Bertha?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was a homemaker all of her life.  She never worked outside of the home.  She had seven children.  They moved from Louisi- from Union to New Orleans and my grandfather became a Pullman car porter from which he retired. And we like to tease him because when he retired, he had bought a house in the middle of New Orleans, downtown New Orleans, and he had two lots on either side on which he had a farm.  He had, he grew corn and greens and tomatoes, and, and gave them away to neighbors, but we said he was a farmer at heart even though he stayed on the pull- was on the railroad for many, many years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, my mother was an educator.  She believed in going to school.  She had two master's degrees, one from Northwestern University and one from Xavier University [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana].  She was the first dist- distribution ed- distri--distributive education teacher in the Orleans Parish schools [Orleans Parish School Board].  When my daddy died, she married a pharmacist, that was Robert Smith [ph.], and they went to New--to Chicago [Illinois] to live.  When he died, she came back to New Orleans and taught at Dillard University [New Orleans, Louisiana] until she was well in her eighties.  Now, on her ninetieth birthday, we gave her a party.  I tried to get her to come live with me, she wouldn't because she wanted to be independent.  So, she came here to Atlanta [Georgia] where she had two grandchildren, two of my daughters [Jann H. Adams and Madelyn R. Adams] live here, and she went to Wesley Woods [Atlanta, Georgia] to assisted living, and she lived there until she died.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very alert, wrote a family history and all that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Now, was, was she the first one her family to go to college?
Speaker 2: Oh, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Where did she go initially?
Speaker 2: Initially, she went--she went to Southern--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  She got her undergraduate degree from Southern.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then--
Speaker 2: And she--and then she went to Xavier and got the first master's [degree], and then she went to Northwestern in Evanston, Illinois, got the second.
Story_ID: 632209
Speaker 1: Now, let me go to your, your father's side of the family (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: My father--
Speaker 1: Can you--well, well, can you--first, can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Moses John Desselle [Moses Desselle], D-E-S-S-E-L-L-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Nineteen-o-three [1903].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was Marksville, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay, in Marksville.  Now, same question, like, how far back can you trace his side and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Well, I can trace his side particularly to his father, my, my grandfather.  I knew his father and I knew my grandmother's mother.  My grandmother's name was Irene.  My grandfather was Alzide [Alzide Desselle], A-L-Z-I-D-E.
Speaker 1: How--
Speaker 2: My grandmother's--
Speaker 1: Now is, is there a story behind that name, Alzide?
Speaker 2: I don't know it.
Speaker 1: Is, is it biblical or is--
Speaker 2: I--I'll--I know it was a French Canadian name.  He was the product of an interracial family, a very interesting family because as a child, he would take me to visit his sisters who were white and they all acknowledged and valued each other, but they lived, of course, in total separate communities.  Now, he, too, was a land owner and a farmer.  But my grandmother's--was also very interesting.  Her mother was an Indian [Native American] woman.  There was an Indian reservation in Marksville and her mother was an Indian woman.  Her name was Ann [ph.], but she never learned to speak English very well, and I remember we called her Meann [ph.] and we called her that because when you asked her what was her name, she'd say, "Me Ann."  My grandchildren now call me Meann.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: Her--she had children with a, a, a black man.  However--and I'm never, never quite sure because she must've had children with white--a white man as, as well because one of her sons was a city doctor and he was white, yet my grandmother was a black woman and married a black man.  My grandmother was a very--they always said she was very smart and while my grandfather had a lot of personality, she was the business woman in the family and did a very good job of, of acquiring land and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: And she sent her children to school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Irene.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Irene Barbin Desselle.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, what did--are there any other stories on that side of the family about--there's a, a Indian reservation in the town of Marksville?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Marksville now is known--the only people--reason why people know Marksville now is because there's an Indi- Indian reservation and a casino [Paragon Casino Resort]. And as a child, I used to like to go to the reservation because they had a museum and it showed all the Indian artifacts.  There were even teepees at that point.  They, they were actually living on the reservation.  There was a caste system in Marksville, white, coloreds, blacks, Indians, and the bla--the coloreds were Creoles.  They were the French Canadians who had come to Louisiana who had mixed with black women and that was their, their society, as it were.  We still--I still own property in Louisiana in the--Marksville because my daddy was one of those who acquired it--every time he got a chance to buy an acre, he bought it, and he was adamant that you're never supposed to sell it.  I don't know what you're supposed to do with it in perpetuity, but you're never supposed to sell the property, so we ended up with a great deal of property in--still in Marksville.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, what, what Indian nation or tribe are they--are they--is--
Speaker 2: You know, I don't remember the name of them.  I could look that up for you, though.
Speaker 1: Okay, just wondering.
Speaker 2: They're the--it's the tribe that owns it.  But now because the caste system was so great in Marksville, we were not allowed to really get to know our Indian rel- relatives.  In fact, I don't think that the black relatives owned the Indian relatives.  There was almost as though there was a division there.  While they acknowledged the white ones, they did not acknowledge the Indians.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Everybody has to have somebody to look down on.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's an interesting caste system
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) there.
Story_ID: 632210
Speaker 1: What did your father [Moses Desselle] say about growing up?  What was his story?
Speaker 2: My father enjoyed Marksville [Louisiana].  He had two brothers and two sisters, and he was the baby.  They doted on him.  He was the first to go to college in his--in his family.  His brother above him was a mortician.  He went to mortuary school but did not go to college.  I think he went to college maybe a year or so.  He stayed in Marksville until he became ill.  He had tuberculosis and mama [Thelma Tucker Smith] took him to Baton Rouge [Louisiana] where there, there was health--you know, hospital and good doctors that was not available in Marksville.  And at that time, having tuberculosis was a disgrace, so they never told--I didn't find out he had tuberculosis until I was a teenager because they would not tell it.  They would say he has heart trouble even to his, his family because at that time, they would isolate the person if they became--but he did.  He be--he was a businessman.  You had asked me what he did.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He had a cleaning establishment and a nightclub.  He had--when I was born, he was operating a cafe in Monroe, Louisiana.  And then he moved back to Marksville, opened both the, the cafe--I mean, the nightclub and the--a cleaning establishment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, where did your father go to college?
Speaker 2: Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College].
Speaker 1: Southern, okay.  So, he went to Southern, too.  Now, was Southern--at the time he was going to Southern, was it in New Orleans [Louisiana] or in--
Speaker 2: No, it was Baton Rouge.
Speaker 1: Baton Rouge, okay.  I know at one time it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, see, there are two campuses at Southern.  Southern had two or three campuses.  They had a campus in New Orleans and one in Shreveport [Louisiana], but those were opened much later.  The original campus is, is Baton Rouge.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 632211
Speaker 1: I'm tempted to think that your parents met at Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], but is there a story about how they met (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  They met in New Orleans [Louisiana].  Mama [Thelma Tucker Smith] was teaching and Daddy [Moses Desselle] at that point was laying bricks.  He had taken a, a semester off from--or maybe it was in the summer.  He was in college.  And they got married, but they could not announce it because the teachers in the public schools in New Orleans couldn't be married.  So, they did not announce it until Mama got pregnant.  And then, of course, she couldn't hide it anymore, so she left New Orleans and they came back initially to Monroe [Louisiana] and then to Marksville [Louisiana].
Story_ID: 632212
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about your parents' personalities and their, their dispositions, their sense of humor, their hobbies, habits, how they walked, talked, looked--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Probably my mama [Thelma Tucker Smith].  I look like her.  I went into the same profession she went into.  I think that I probably raised my daughters the same way she raised me.  My daddy [Moses Desselle] was much more laid back with a sense of humor and he could be volatile if somebody attacked me.  He was very protective of his family.  But, I've--in fact, I never saw him angry except when somebody said something to me or did something to me that he didn't like, and that could be a teacher, a principal, (laughter) anybody.  Mama used to have to keep him from going to school.  But, he was very laid back, had a lot of humor, and was easy to talk to.  I adored him and he thought I hung the moon.
Speaker 1: Now you have--do you have siblings?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?  Okay.  You're the only child?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's--
Speaker 2: And I wasn't spoiled.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right (laughter).  I didn't say anything (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) If that's an expression.  No, my mother was very diligent to see that that did not happen.
Story_ID: 632213
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory would probably, probably be in Marksville [Louisiana].  We lived in a one bedroom house that had outdoor plumbing and [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young's mama [Daisy Fuller Young] was my mother's [Thelma Tucker Smith] best friend, and Andrew and Walter [HistoryMaker Dr. Walter Young] were like my brothers.  And they would come to see us very often and I tell this story.  He gets embarrassed sometimes, but it's true.  Walter and Andrew were typical little boys and they would run after me and, and when they came to visit, mama always dressed me up, and I remember I had this--at Christmas, I had gotten this black velvet dress and it was just beautiful, and I had on my black velvet dress and my patent leather shoes, and they ran, chased me around the backyard, picked up some dirty water, and threw it on my pretty dress, and I was incensed.  And I was not a tattler, so I wouldn't go tell, so I had to sit up and think about, now, how am I gonna get them back?  Well, they had to go to the bathroom and the bathroom was an outdoor toilet.  They went to the bathroom and I locked the door from the outside.  This is the--one of those bathrooms that have a tin roof and it was summertime and it was hot.  No, it was--win- it was wintertime, but it was hot.  And, of course, they got caught in there.  And the house was some distance from the outdoor toilet.  So, the people didn't--their parents didn't hear them for a while (laughter).  They were in there.  My daddy [Moses Desselle] want- my mama wanted to kill me, my daddy wouldn't let her whenever they--when they finally released them from this outdoor privy.  But, that was one of my, my favorite memories.  They--their memory is not quite so good for that particular instance.  They say they don't remember that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's convenient (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 632214
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  Now, now did you--well, did you grow up in Marksville [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: No, I lived in Marksville until I was in the third grade.  The--my mother [Thelma Tucker Smith] sent me then to my uncle's house in Mark--in, in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] to go to school.  The schools in Marksville had left something to be desired.  They--the high school, my mother was the first teacher in the high school for black kids in Marksville, which was probably somewhere around 1931 when I was born.  And for the fir- first couple of years, I was in the Catholic school, not enrolled because I went to school when I was three years old, but by the time I was four years old, since I was reading, they let me go to first grade.  And I--my--but by the time I got to third grade, I think that the, the Catholic school only went to fourth grade, and so mama and daddy [Moses Desselle] sent me to Baton Rouge to go to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went to school there for two years.  Then, my, my parents moved to Baton Rouge and I went to Southern demonstration school [Southern University Laboratory School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], their high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now what was the name of the Catholic school?
Speaker 2: St. Joseph's [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so in Baton Rouge, you went to the Southern--
Speaker 2: And then I went--yeah, Southern.
Speaker 1: What do they call it, the Southern demonstration school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they called it a demonstration school.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was both elementary and high school.
Story_ID: 632215
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Good food, water, and outdoors.  I had a horse when I was little and the horse's name was Fly [ph.].  And as I said, we had a lot of land and so I got--and, and a lot of, of relatives around, so I was allowed to go anyplace I wanted to on my little horse 'cause they knew somebody would see me if I fell or if anything happened.
Speaker 1: So, this is a little horse.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, this was a pony.
Speaker 1: Pony, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: You know, somebody had to put me on it, but I could ride it.  My grandfather [Alzide Desselle] taught me to ride.  My grandfather was a character.  He said that you should be--a girl was supposed to be able to ride a horse, swim, and cuss, and he taught me how to ride a horse and swim and how to cuss in French because my daddy wouldn't let him teach me how to cuss in English.  He thought that, that the first place I, I--I would use it in the wrong places at the wrong time.  So, but my grandfather said a girl had to be, be able to--there was some things you--shoot a gun and he taught me how to shoot a gun.  But, sights and sounds, good food and lots of it.  There was one thing in the country that I remember enjoying, and that was they had--every year at harvest time in the fall, they would slaughter cows and, and pigs and they would cook pigskins outside and they would make the--a boudin, which is a sausage, and they did a lot of cooking.  And then they didn't have the refrigeration that we have now.  I think that the ice box were probably just coming in then.  So, they had to find other ways.  They salted a lot of that meat, but this was their way of getting--and everybody in the community, there would be maybe, as I remembered, lots of people, so I guess there were twenty, thirty folk out there cooking and cutting up meat and stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they did it all at once sort of--you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on a regular basis.  So, so, so you just ride around on this little horse around (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I could go anyplace I wanted, go all over town.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And everybody knew I was Moses Desselle's daughter, and they--you know, you--I was either kin to them or they knew somebody who was.  And, and it was a small town and easy to live in, and I guess because of the fact that everybody knew everybody.  There wasn't--the population wasn't that big 'cause as I said, I, I think that the--that at that point, the Catholic school probably went up to fourth or fifth grade, and it isn't that much larger now, but they do have a, a full elementary school now, and high school.
Story_ID: 632216
Speaker 1: Now, when you moved to Baton Rouge [Louisiana]--so you, so--well, you lived with your--
Speaker 2: Mama [Thelma Tucker Smith] and daddy [Moses Desselle].
Speaker 1: Yeah, mother, okay.  So, everybody knew--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --everybody--
Speaker 2: This is when my daddy first became ill, so we moved to Baton Rouge.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he opened a nightclub there and mama went back and got her--she had not finished her undergraduate degree.  She had finished her normal before.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so she went back and got an undergraduate degree and I went to Southern elementary and high school [Southern University Laboratory School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  I did, did not graduate from there.  Daddy died in '45 [1945] and I went to--we moved back to New Orleans [Louisiana] where mama's people were and that's when I went to Xavier Prep [Xavier University Preparatory School; St. Katherine Drexel Preparatory School, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, when you were in school, were, were you a good student in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had to be.  You didn't have any choice.  I had to--my grades went home to mama and she didn't take much, not when it came to education.  And it was always not whether you're going to college, it was when and where 'cause that was a given, that you had to do this.  I don't know where this need for education or push came from, but my mother had it very deeply embedded and she never stopped going to school.  She never stopped learning, and she never--and she always pushed me.  There was no question about the--I graduated magna cum laude from college.  And one of the things that happened to me in college was that when I went to college, I went to college at fourteen, and it was the first time I had ever left home.  I went back to Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and I just sort of had a good time.  I discovered little boys and we sat on the park benches and, you know, drank Coca-Colas and didn't do too much studying.  So at the end of the first semester, I got a C in one--in biology.  I remember it.  The man who was the head of the biology department was a--had been a friend of mamas 'cause she had also gone to Southern.  And he said, "Now, I'm gonna change this C to an F and you're coming this--back this summer and you're gonna take this course over."  You know, they don't do that anymore, but they did that.  He called my mama and told her what he'd done, what he was doing. And, of course, she thought it was great I--after she gave me what for for getting that C.  But, I had worked that out.  I had A's, enough A's to balance that C so that I still would've been on the honor roll, but I didn't realize you couldn't be on the honor roll if you had a C.  So--but, she was incensed that I would go up there and make a C.  So, anyway, I went to school that summer, but one of the things that happ- happened, byproduct of that was that I made--I, I took enough other courses that I finished college a semester early, and so I went back then, back to New Orleans, and did substitute teaching for a semester before I went to graduate school.
Speaker 1: Now, I want to go back to grade school, actually (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We gotta go back to grade school and ask you about grade school.  Are there--were there any particular teachers or mentors in grade school that you remember and at St. Joseph's [ph.] or Southern (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I really don't.  At Southern, I remember particularly Mrs. Boley [Almira Boley] who was our principal and a disciplinarian par excellence.
Speaker 1: Mrs. Boley, huh?
Speaker 2: Boley, B-O-L--
Speaker 1: It's interesting.  Is she related at all to the Boley that they named Boley, Oklahoma, after?  And that's a all-black town of Oklahoma.
Speaker 2: You know, it could've been.  I don't know, though.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.  I know you don't hear that name that much, and I know there's a black town named Boley, Oklahoma.
Speaker 2: I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's--okay.  So--but, she was a--you, you remember her?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I really, really remember her.  Sh--she was the kind of principal who was in the classrooms and made the teachers teach.  She didn't play.  And so when you finished Southern high, you, you had a degree that was worth something and you could go anyplace you wanted.  Now, I really wanted to go to Xavier [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana], but my mama felt that if I went to Xavier, I'd play 'cause I knew everybody in New Orleans by that time, and so she sent me back to Southern.  And, of course, I stilled played that first year--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you--
Speaker 2: --but that was only that, only that first year.
Story_ID: 632217
Speaker 1: Now, you were at Southern University [Southern University Laboratory School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] going to grade school in the 1940s, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, who was--what was going on at Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana]?  Felton Clark, Sr. [sic. Joseph Samuel Clark], was the president, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was president.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I think by that time, Felt--Felton, Jr. [Felton Grandison Clark], had come in. Felton (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Had he?  Okay.
Speaker 2: --Sr., was president when my mother [Thelma Tucker Smith] was there.  Felton, Jr. was president when I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And the--it's such a rich cultural environment.  I mean, it's just a rich environment.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, so, what, what was it--what was going on on campus that you remember from a standpoint of a grade school kid?
Speaker 2: Southern was a--the high school was a very rich cultural intellectual environment.  I remember--the thing that I remember most, most were oratorical contest, musical, excellent concerts, opportunities for all sorts of sports, although I was not involved or, or very good at any of the, the sports, but I did participate in the--in the oratorical contest.  We were given--taken to, to art galleries and, as I said, excellent musical concerts and that kind of thing.  It was a, a rich cultural environment.
Speaker 1: Do, do you remember any of the--any lecturers that came to campus to speak that were famous in those days?  I know school was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You, you, you should've asked me this earlier so I thought about that.  I, I can't remember, not off the top of my head.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just wondered if anybody like Marian Anderson or--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, Marion Anderson did.
Speaker 1: Did she come?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, um-hm.  There were writers who came.
Speaker 1: Like, Richard Wright?  Did he ever?  Or--
Speaker 2: No.  Paul Laurence Dunbar?  No.
Speaker 1: No, he would've been (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We used his--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --his work.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I think that--
Speaker 2: I'll have to go back and get those for you.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think James Weldon Johnson was gone by then.  He had--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) passed by then.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I'm--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We were--
Speaker 1: I'm trying to think of who might--
Speaker 2: --using his, his music, though.
Speaker 1: What about Jean Toomer?  Would--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I know he was a Louisiana--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: --person, so wondered if--okay.  But, there was always something going on on--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --campus life.
Speaker 2: There was a--there was a cultural series and once a month they--now, one of the things that I enjoyed at college at, at Southern was the vesper series.  Bennie Mays [Benjamin Mays] came, Howard Thurman, all those kind of people, and they would speak and then they would come into the dormitories and sit and talk to us, and so that we could have personal chats.  I fell in love with Bennie Mays.  I just thought he was the most marvelous thing in the world.  I finally asked him one day, "Well, why is it, Mr.--Dr. Mays that all the men who go to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] are so arrogant?"  He said--I said, "Do you all teach them to be arrogant?"  He said, "Well, we--I guess we might, but don't you just love it?"  I said (laughter), "Okay."
Speaker 1: That's a great story (laughter).  Okay.  Howard Thurman, now he--I've heard lots of stories about Howard Thurman, you know, talking to students at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], have them come to his home and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Well, he would come to, to Southern every year--this is when I was in college--he would come every year and he always--well, first place, he--is, is, he was one of the few people that kids listened to.  You understood what he was saying, he said it so that you understood it, and he related it to how you were living at that time so that you--it was--it, it had relevance.  And we'd sit down and talk to him and--oh, he'd, he'd answer any kind of crazy questions you asked, asked him.  He, he was a remarkable man.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, do--I know he's from Louisiana, but I don't know if he--but, but do you remember Gardner Taylor?  [HistoryMaker] Reverend Gardner Taylor (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I did not know him.  My husband [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams] knew him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I, I didn't really know him.  I, I heard him speak, but I didn't know him.  And I don't--and I think he, he probably came to Southern, but I didn't get to, to meet--interact personally with him.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause he's from right around Baton Rouge [Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 632218
Speaker 1: You went to grade school and high school there.  Any, any other teachers that were special in high school, at Southern [Southern University Laboratory School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] before you moved to New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: No.  I, I can't remember any, any of the other teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, after your father [Moses Desselle] passed, your, your mother [Thelma Tucker Smith] and, and you moved back to--
Speaker 2: New Orleans.
Speaker 1: --to New Orleans.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, where my [maternal] grandparents [Bertha Tucker and Albert Tucker] were.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that must've been really a--kind of--you were, what, about thirteen?
Speaker 2: I was thirteen.
Speaker 1: Thirteen, yeah, years old.  So, you went to Xavier [Xavier University Preparatory School; St. Katherine Drexel Preparatory School]--
Speaker 2: Prep.
Speaker 1: --Prep, okay.  It was on the campus of Xavier University [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: No, no, the sep- separate campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On, on Magazine Street--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in New Orleans.  It's still there.  I did not like it.  When my mother went to enroll me, the nun who was the head mother said, "Now, what is your name?"  And I told her.  She said, "Dolly [HistoryMaker Dolly Adams] is not a name.  We will call you Jacqueline."  That was my middle name.  And so the entire time I was there, the two years I was there, everybody called me Jackie.  And, so I had the transition of losing my father, going to a new city, getting all new friends, new school, and a new name.
Speaker 1: And being renamed by the nuns?
Speaker 2: Being renamed.
Speaker 1: That's, that's interesting.  What did your mother think of that, that the nuns just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother was not pleased at all, but she, she thought this was the best school in town and as I said, education was very important to her, and so she--it was more important to her that I be there.  One of the men teachers there, I remember here again, it was an algebra class and he gave me a--I had been in the class like maybe about two or three weeks and teacher student conference, and he said, "Are you sure that you--I'm not too sure that you can do this."  I said, "Well, I think I can do it."  He said, "I'm, I'm not too sure about that, now.  We'll--I need to talk to your mother about it."  That was really a mistake because Mama went to see him and she raked the man over the co- coals.  "You mean to say, you implying that my daughter is too dumb to learn algebra?"  I made an A in algebra in his class.  I want you to know she taught me algebra every night.  I was--there was no way that prophecy was gonna be fulfilled.  She was not gonna let that happen.  But, his, his, his--he looked at people and decided whether or not you can learn and I was one of the little black kids in that class, and it was just--no, she--she's doing the best she can, but she's--this is above her.  But, I--as I said, I had to kind of--after Mama got him told, she laid with me and every day we, we--I like the algebra now and (laughter) I think I remember some of it, too (laughter).

Speaker 1: So, you were there until you were fourteen.  So, you, you, you were saying you accumulated enough credits to graduate early--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  Now, we're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not, not from--
Speaker 2: --talking about from college [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], now?
Speaker 1: From Xaiver Prep--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: --high school [Xavier University Preparatory School; St. Katherine Drexel Preparatory School, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was--accumulated those co- those, those--I'm sorry, that, that was in college.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: When I went to college, I said, I did an extra semester, the summer--went, went to school in the summer--
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: --and accumulated enough credits.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Now--but, no, I was in, in--two years at Xavier Prep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I graduated when I was fourteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Okay, okay 'cause--is that because you started school early?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Started school at three years old, okay.
Speaker 2: Well, you see at that time, they didn't care when kids went to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you graduate with, with honors when you graduated from Xavier Prep?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  I graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, Lordy and thank you, Lordy.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).  All right.
Speaker 2: No, I had not been there the four years and you had--needed to have the four years to have honors.
Speaker 1: There's lots of rules that--
Speaker 2: Didn't they, though?
Speaker 1: Yeah, lots of rules.
Speaker 2: There were lots of ways to keep you out.
Story_ID: 632220
Speaker 1: So you went back up to Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] to college--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and--okay.
Speaker 2: Which I loved.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  Now, are there any--at, at the college level then, are there any particular teachers or mentors that you--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Julia Brogdon Purnell [HistoryMaker Julia Purnell].  Well, to finish that little story I was telling you about, messing up, up that first semester and going back that summer, the man, the, the head of that biology department who changed the grade was a Dr. Lee [ph.], and he also was one of my favorites.  I didn't like him then, though.  But, he said--he--I wanted to be a social worker and my mother [Thelma Tucker Smith] said there were no black social workers at that time.  I wouldn't get a job, so I needed to get--be in education.  I'm sure I could get a job getting that, so I said, "Okay."  So, Dr. Lee said, "Okay, I'm gonna give her to Julia Purnell."  She's a--her name--her name was Julia Brogdon at that time.  She hadn't married.  "She's a young teacher here and she will mentor her." And absolutely, Julia Brogdon Purnell did, and she laid on me through four years of college.  She was an excellent teacher 'cause she--I was--I was no exception.  She laid on everybody.
Speaker 1: And what was her subject area?
Speaker 2: She was--she was head of elementary education--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --department.  She was from South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, tell us something about her 'cause I've heard her name before and--
Speaker 2: Okay, Julia was a graduate of Allen University in South Carolina, Columbia [South Carolina].  She was the daughter of an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] preacher [Richard E. Brogdon], lived all over South Carolina as he was moved, you know, but she went primarily to schools in Orangeburg [South Carolina] because she had an aunt who lived there and they would send--even, even then, they would send their children to the city that had a school, and Orangeburg probably had better elementary schools for black kids than they--than any of the other towns in the surrounding areas.  So, she--most of her elementary days, I think, in high school was in Orangeburg.  She still lives in Baton Rouge [Louisiana].  She's ninety-seven, I think.  That's somebody for you to interview.
Speaker 1: Yes, right, right, right.
Speaker 2: She's a remarkable lady.
Speaker 1: Right.  Yeah, we've interviewed Dr. Gloria Blackwell [HistoryMaker Gloria Rackley Blackwell] who is from Orangeburg, you know.  Yeah.  And she taught in Atlanta [Georgia] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You need to--you need to interview her.  I--I'll put her name down.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Is she--do you know if she's related to Silas Purnell in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Her husband was Purnell and he was the coach at Southern in Baton Rouge in--first in the public schools and then at the college level.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Clifton Purnell [Clifton Purnell, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just think there's gotta be some relationship, Silas Purnell (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Probably so.  P-U-R-N-E-L-L?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably so.
Speaker 1: Silas Purnell, what, what he does in Chicago is organize high school students to do college tours.
Speaker 2: Sounds like--
Speaker 1: That's what he does.  And they go to Southern and Atlanta and all of the other schools.  So, yeah, okay.  All right.  So--yeah, so, so she was a--yeah.
Speaker 2: She was a very--throughout--through my life, we--I talked to her a couple days ago.  We still are very much--she was also the sponsor for AKA's [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] and I went into AKA sorority.  I was in the honor society and she sponsored the honor society.  Now, she kept me on the straight and narrow, to be perfectly frank about it.  She would send us to the library and she'd give you so many assignments that you didn't have time to play.  You left your class and you went to straight to the library because whatever the assignment was, you had to have it in the next day, and, and it had to be in full and it had to be right, which was very good as I look back (laughter).
Story_ID: 632221
Speaker 1: You're at Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] near the end of World War II [WWII], I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Towards the--yeah, as it--as it comes to a close.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --the thing that happened, I think in that biology class that I was talking about, the young men were coming back from the [U.S.] Army then, and they were in our--in the--in the class.  These were older boys than we were and they sort of babied us and were very nice to us and, of course, the, the, the pecking order then was the veterans first and then the rest of us sort of fell in.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, it was good to have a mentor in that environment, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in any environment.  Young chil- people going to college, especially that young and first time away from mama [Thelma Tucker Smith] and I'm--you know, I, I wanna be grown so bad I can taste it.  And, you know, this is an opportunity to really mess up if you don't have good mentors.
Story_ID: 632222
Speaker 1: Well, we can't leave Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] without talking about the music.  Was, was the Southern band--had, had they--
Speaker 2: The Southern band--
Speaker 1: --started to (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) was fantastic.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was fighting with Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and was better than Florida A and M, and I'm not just being prejudiced.  The people--the band director at Southern and the band director at Florida A and M both went to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] and neither one of them will admit it, but the steps that they brought back were generally based on what they--what the University of Michigan's marching band did.  Our marching band--our clothes were blue and gold as was Michigan, so when they came back, he really had no problems translating.  But, no, the marching band was excellent.  There was always the battle of the bands with Florida A and M and they still to, to this day--well, Florida A and M has little problems now, but they, they--it's a healthy competition because they really wanted to do--wanted it to be special, and we were proud of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They did an excellent job.  But, now, while there was not a great deal of, of publicity about it, we also had a, a, a--an orchestra, which played for concerts and I don't think any of our--I don't know whether any of our people ever got into any of the symphony orchestras in the cities, but the--you know, we had violinists and, and people who were trained in classical music at Southern.  We had an excellent music department.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right.  That's what I keep hearing.  Everybody says is.  People arrive early in the football season, in the summer so they can hear the band practice (laughter).
Speaker 2: Practice.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And see them.  They put on a show.
Story_ID: 632223
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you graduated from Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] in--what was that, nineteen--
Speaker 2: Fifty-one [1951].
Speaker 1: --fifty-one [1951], okay, 1951.  And, and you went on to graduate school, right?
Speaker 2: I went home.
Speaker 1: You went home first?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh and, and--no, I take that back.  I had been home the semester before, that semester I was off.  I told you I finished in January?  I went back and did substitute work in the public schools and in September, I went to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Now, this is--it's gotta be tough to be a sub when you are the same age or younger than some of the students.
Speaker 2: Well, I was nineteen and the--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went to elementary and I, I, I, I learned early that I didn't wanna teach anybody who's any larger than I 'cause those little boys even back then could, could get you, you know, and, and high school, I didn't want, so I was elementary and it was no great problem with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: But, I'll tell you another, another interesting story about that.  When I went to the superintendent--there was a superintendent for black education at that point, and I went to see him and--to tell him--to thank him for giving me the, the short term job 'cause they had offered me a job as a permanent teacher when I graduated and I declined it and told him I was going to graduate school.  He said, "Why?"  I said, "Because I wanna go get a master's degree."  He said, "You don't need a master's degree."  Their expectations for us were so low until it did not matter, and for him to tell me that I was--I was insulted, but I never went back to--I, I take that back, I did go back and teach in, in New Orleans public schools [Orleans Parish School Board] a couple years--
Speaker 1: Now, this is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) when I got out of--out of Michigan.
Speaker 1: This director of--he was in charge of colored education in, in Louisiana.
Speaker 2: There was a superintendent for white schools and a superintendent for black schools.
Speaker 1: Now, the superintendent for black schools, was, was he white?
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: That's what I thought.  I just wanted you--to make sure you said it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yes.
Speaker 1: --so we all understand.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, he was very much so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.  So, they were both white.
Speaker 2: Well, there were no black administrators.  There were--there may have been one or two black principals in the whole system.  I'm not sure.  I don't really, really not positive about that.
Speaker 1: So, even the colored schools had--usually had a white--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --principal.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 632224
Speaker 1: Graduate school.  Now, you went to--
Speaker 2: University of Michigan--
Speaker 1: Okay, University of Michigan (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Ann Arbor [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, there's a--it seems from what I've heard from everybody that's gone, there's some kind of relationship between University of Michigan and, and Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  I don't know if that's true or we--I don't know.
Speaker 2: Well, maybe a lot of us went there.  The same woman that I mentioned, [HistoryMaker] Julia Purnell, had gone there, and I don't think she got her master's [degree] but she did go to school there.  And she--in fact, she was the one who influenced me to go to Michigan and I--that, too, is a--an interesting story.  About the time that I was about ready to go to school, a man named A.P. Tureaud from New Orleans [Louisiana] filed suit against the State of Louisiana for admission, black students into LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  They, of course, fought the--fought vigorously to keep this from happening, but in the interim, they gave me a full scholarship--no, they gave me a scholarship to the university of my choice, any place I wanted to go outside of the State of Louisiana.  They paid my transportation and all the fees above what it would have cost had I gone to Louisiana, to LSU plus housing.  They didn't ask me to come back to Louisiana.  They didn't need anything back, just get out of here.
Speaker 1: Now this, this is the one of the most--strange features of southern desegregation 'cause you--I mean segregation 'cause you, you hear this from not only Louisiana but Alabama it happened and South Carolina, other places, they would give you money--
Speaker 2: To go someplace else (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to go to--someplace else to graduate school, you know, so--and--
Speaker 2: And they didn't--there was no requirement you come back and give back to us as our children.
Speaker 1: So, you were tempted to think they just wanted to spin you off to some other--
Speaker 2: That's--yeah, that's right, go someplace else.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Don't come back with those ideas here.
Speaker 1: Don't come back here with a graduate degree trying to improve life in Louisiana.  Just move on.  That's a story.  So, that's--yeah, that's interesting.  You know, I've heard the story a lot (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I had had--while I was in graduate--in undergraduate school, I had had a scholarship.  It was in--it was a--an academic scholarship.  If you stayed on, on the honor roll, they gave you--it was something like a thousand dollars a year or something.  It wasn't that--a great big scholarship, but in those days, it helped a great deal.  But--so, I was--and I guess that was one of the reasons why I was eligible, but I, I didn't even know that.  This was that, that out of state grant. Go someplace else, anyplace you wanna go that you can get into (laughter).
Story_ID: 632225
Speaker 1: When I got to Michigan, another int- int- interesting thing, I could not live in the dormitories.  They were, they were segregated.  So, I was put--so, I was--there was one dormitory, one lady who had a house and she ren- rented rooms to undergraduates.  She didn't have enough room for graduates, so I was directed to co-ops and the co-ops were houses where--that students owned independent of the--of the university and they were integrated, and so I was able to live in, in co-ops.  This was the first time I had a white roommate.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I could not do this in the housing, student--in student housing.
Speaker 2: Now, this is--this is 1951 and University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] is still segregated.  Even though you can go to school there, you can't, can't live in the dorms (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not the dormitories.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 632226
Speaker 1: Now, you were pursuing a, a, a graduate degree in education.
Speaker 2: Educational administration.
Speaker 1: Educational administration.  So, were there any teachers who were a mentor or, or--you know--
Speaker 2: Not really.  It was very difficult to get to know the teachers at University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  They were nice, they were professional, but they were aloof and they didn't have the time to--they weren't interested in mentoring students.  I, I got lucky, there was one young woman who was teaching at the Neuropsychiatric Institute [Ann Arbor, Michigan] at the University of Michigan, and I was taking courses in special education and she taught a special education course, and I cannot remember the lady's name at this point.  But, she recommended me for a job at NPI, and when I got my--in fact, the year before I finished my degree--no, the year I finished my degree, I spent that first year at N--NPI, Neuropsychiatric Institute, teaching.  And the--they--I guess the reason why they gave me the job was because they had a lot of black kids in NPI, kids who ca--who were referred from the Detroit Public Schools [Detroit Public Schools Community District] who came from the ghetto and were having emotional problems and they needed a black teacher.  They had--they had one and she was leaving and they--and they always had to have one, and so I was the one.  I--but I enjoyed teaching there and--now, that was a place where I felt very warm and wanted.  The director, Dr. Rabinovitch- Rabinovitz was--I don't think that man had a prejudiced bone in his body.  He was really above--long before his time in terms of, of race relations.  He was--his, his handling of the kids, his handling of the staff was such that you felt totally evaluated on your capabilities, not the color of your skin.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think I, I interviewed one other person that knew him, I think, yeah.
Speaker 2: Ralph Rabinovitch.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Okay.
Story_ID: 632227
Speaker 1: So, you were there for a year, you said?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, so what did you decide to do after a year?  And what?
Speaker 2: Well, I was doing volunteer work in--at a center in Ann Arbor [Michigan] and the man who was the director of the center was a black man who had graduated from Wilberforce and was on their board, and he found out that the lady who was the head of the education department at Wilberforce was leaving.  She was going someplace.  Her husband was in the [U.S.] Army and she was leaving in December, at the end of the first semester, and he asked me if I'd like to have the job.  Well, I always wanted to teach in a college, but I was not--I didn't know Wilberforce and I'd never been to Ohio really.  So, (cough) so he said, "Would you like to do this?"  And I talked it over with my mama [Thelma Tucker Smith] and decided, you know, I'm not gonna be at NPI [Neuropsychiatric Institute, Ann Arbor, Michigan] the rest of my life.  This is a nice little job for right now, but this is not where I wanna be permanently.  Let me try this.  So, I went to Wilberforce and loved it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, Wilberforce University in southern Ohio [Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Xenia, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Near--right outside of Xenia (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Well, no, I think Wilberforce has a--is a--is a na- is a town now, doesn't--
Speaker 1: Well, it is.
Speaker 2: --isn't--Wilberforce?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's considered a town with a little post office and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in Green County, Ohio.
Story_ID: 632228
Speaker 1: Wilberforce University [Wilberforce, Ohio], 1951, we had just had a trauma about five years before where the--
Speaker 2: Well, this--about--this was about '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: This is '53 [1953].  Okay, by now, '53 [1953], okay.  So, within the--we'll say within the past decade--I guess, 1946 [sic.] is when the--Wilberforce split the school and (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, the split had been--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the year before I came.  Let me see if I've got that.  No, she doesn't have that there.  It's not there.  The split was--had been the year, year or two before I got there.  I lived in Shorter Hall.  You, you mentioned Shorter Hall earlier.  I lived in Shorter Hall in a single teacher's apartment with a lady named Helene Taylor [ph.].  Across the hall from me was the president's suite, and it was Dr. Hill.
Speaker 1: Doctor?
Speaker 2: Hill.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Do I have his name?  It'll come to me.  His wife's name was Rosalie [Rosalie Young Hill].  He was one of the smartest men I have ever seen in my life.
Speaker 1: This is Leander Hill, something--Leander-yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Leander Hill.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right.  You got it.
Speaker 1: Leander Hill, right, right.  He was a--
Speaker 2: A brilliant man.
Speaker 1: --great scholar, yeah.
Speaker 2: I was scared to death of him.
Speaker 1: Charles Leander Hill.
Speaker 2: Charles Leander Hill.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: That's right.  It took me a minute (laughter).
Speaker 2: It took me--it was gonna take me a little longer.  I was--I was frightened of him, he was so smart.  His wife was just as nice and down to earth, and I loved her.  And I--you know, we'd go shopping and stuff, but I sort of had to stay my distance from him.  He was just--he was one smart man.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he--I mean, that's what they say, yeah.
Speaker 2: Nice as he could be, but he was--he was above--I remember we, we drove to Ann Arbor [Michigan].  He had a speaking engagement in Ann Arbor and I--he asked if I wanted to drive back with him and I went.  And I sat in that car, I don't think I said two words the whole way (laughter).  I just--and his wife said--Rosalie said, "What's the matter, Dolly [HistoryMaker Dolly Adams]?  Why won't you talk?"  I said, "I'm scared of your husband" (laughter).  It was just something very intimidating about him.  And he was not mean.  It wasn't that he was mean.  It was just that you just felt--you knew you were in the--in the presence of greatness.
Speaker 1: Now, what, what did he talk about when he--when he talked?
Speaker 2: Oh, he would talk about what happened in Germany and he might talk, say a little of it in German.  He would talk about--and he, he was a, a minister, but he didn't do a lot of scriptural talking, but he was just very profound.  Now, when he--when he dissected the government, he said stuff you never--you--it never would've occurred to me to even think about, but I, I was intimidated by--that, that I know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know he's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I wasn't intimidated by many people.
Speaker 1: It's interesting that he, he was born in Springfield [Ohio] and--where Wittenberg University in, in Ohio, you know, but he studied at Wittenberg University in Germany [Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany] and came--it's really a strange kind of a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you remember him.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he, he was a, a philosopher, a deep philosopher--
Speaker 2: Oh, a deep philosopher.
Speaker 1: --and, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: He had been my husband's [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams] pastor in Columbia, South Carolina, at Bethel [Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Columbia, South Carolina], and then he was the president there.
Story_ID: 632229
Speaker 1: When you were teaching at Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio], you met your husband [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams], right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Now, he was a--he was a student at Payne Theological Seminary [Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 2: He was teaching at Payne.
Speaker 1: Teaching at Payne.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: He was teaching at Payne and I was teaching at Wilberforce, but the population of the two put together was probably no more than about three hundred people, if that many.  So, everybody knew everybody that the student union building was a community center for the, the two colleges and--I mean, for, for the seminary and the college, and everybody congregated in there every morning.  And I went in one morning and somebody introduced me to this redhead whom I did not like either, and we just--took us a little while, but not long, and we--next year, we got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so, you went from not liking him very much (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, two years later to be married (laughter), changed that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, what was it about him that you liked?
Speaker 2: That I liked?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I liked his intellect, but I also--but, I liked his humor I think better. But, he, he had an acid tongue and he enjoyed cutting through stuff.  And I guess he sort of intimidated me a little bit in the beginning.  And I said, "I don't know whether I like him or not," but it, it, it worked out.
Story_ID: 632230
Speaker 1: Now, I think we--I failed to point out in the beginning that Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] is the oldest black university (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Institution.
Speaker 1: --in the United States.
Speaker 2: In the United States.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And it's operated by the African Methodist Episcopal Church.
Speaker 1: Right and of--the denomination of which your, your husband [HistoryMaker John Hurst Adams] is a--
Speaker 2: A bishop.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a bishop.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, retired.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  So, and Payne Theological Seminary [Wilberforce, Ohio] is named after Daniel Payne--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Alexander Payne--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the founder, the founding president of Wilberforce and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --all that.  So, so, so did you all stay at Wilberforce very long after you--
Speaker 2: No, we left immediately.  As a matter of fact, we were married August 25, 1956, and he had been named president of Paul Quinn College in Waco [Texas] the week before.  So, the day after we married, we moved--we got on a plane the next morning and went to Waco.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is Paul--Paul Quinn is still in operation, isn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's in Baton--in Dallas [Texas] now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It moved to Dallas, all right.  All right.  So, now--okay.  So, what, what, what was it like in Waco?
Speaker 2: A cut above Marksville [Louisiana] (laughter).  It was a small town.  Waco is divided by the Brazos River and our section was east Waco.  Paul Quinn had--at that time was probably about three city blocks large.  We lived right on campus--well, not--well, across the street from the campus.  No, I'm getting it wrong.  We lived on campus when we first--the first time we went there.  We lived on campus.  The dormitory was next to us and--the men's dormitory was next to us, but there were four or five other buildings on campus.  It's a nice, small campus.  I enjoyed it.
Story_ID: 632231
Speaker 1: Waco [Texas] was a nice, very segregated country town, but here again, we had our own system of, of survival.  When, when Waco dec- dec- well, when we decided--when integration came, one of the first places that was picketed was across the street from the campus [Paul Quinn College, Waco, Texas; Dallas, Texas].  It was a little store, a little--one of those 7-Eleven stores, which would not employ any of our students, but nobody bought anything in there except black folk, kids from the campus or people who lived around the campus.  So, we--I was on the picket line and, of course, they picket--our kids picketed downtown.  I remember they called my husband [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams] and said--the mayor called and told him, "Come get your, your students.  They're sitting out here at one of these lunch counters."  He said, "Well, if you fed them--they probably can't even afford to pay for the Coke, so if you, you offer to them, you would--you would be able to get rid of them.  Otherwise, they can stay there until you decide, you know, what you're gonna do."  And he said, "Well, we'll put them in jail."  He said, "And I'll come get them out of jail and they'll be back there tomorrow."  So, they--Waco was one of those towns that was very pragmatic and they really did not want all of that.  So, they asked my husband to come down and talk with them and they ended by fiat, the may--the mayor integrated all of the downtown eating facilities the next day.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now, I've heard a few stories like this where segregation seems like it's hard, a hard line until somebody challenges it and it fades.
Speaker 1: Well, the truth of the matter was we lived in separate enclaves anyway.  We weren't all over town, but to say--it's--it was stupid to say here is a store in the middle, next door to your house and you can go in and buy in that store, you can keep him in business, but you cannot--they will not employ--they bring in people to employ, won't employ any of your kids.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, now, now were you or your husband a member of NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or the--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was very active in the NA--NAACP.  I was the secretary at that time and that's another interesting story.  I had teachers in the public schools of, of Waco who would give me their dues, but I was--they would tell me, "You cannot report my name.  You can--I will give you the money, but don't ever tell them who gave it to you."
Speaker 2: Okay, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, I, I, I collected a whole lot of money from people.  They were afraid of their jobs.  They didn't know what was gonna happen if they found out they were NAACP.  But, because we worked for a black church, there was nothing they could do to us.
Story_ID: 632232
Speaker 1: I failed to ask you this, but, but, was your family involved in--what was the organizational involvement of your family when you were growing up because you've been involved in so many organizations and doing so many things and I just wondered, was there a strong organizational base there with your mother growing up?
Speaker 2: My mother [Thelma Tucker Smith] was involved in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and PTA [Parent Teacher Association] and that kind of thing, but further than that, I don't think--not a great deal more.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, was she a member of a sorority or anything?
Speaker 2: No, she wasn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She didn't join a sorority.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So--all right, so--well, well--okay, so, the City of Waco [Texas], you know, capitulates.  This is 1956?
Speaker 2: About '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven [1957]?
Speaker 2: About, about--
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven [1957].
Speaker 2: --fifty-seven [1957].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  This is a time when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King], the Montgomery Bus Boycott's in '56 [1956]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and then a lot of people are challenging--so, so, you all demonstrated outside of the--this convenience store?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This little store?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: We had two or three little young men on the campus who were very militant and I was really afraid for them but I liked them.  And when I was talking with them, they said, "Well, you wanna come with us?"  I said, "Sure."  "You're not scared?"  "Unh-uh."  So, we went on and they, they took (laughter) pictures of the--they thought that was the funniest thing in the world, that I was out there, but I went out every day with them.  I really didn't think that anybody would bother them if I was there, and they didn't, so I was sort of their, their protection for--protection just for that--those particular times.  But, they, they went on to, to get involved in several other things.
Speaker 1: What were their, their names?
Speaker 2: There was a young man named Dunn [Albert Dunn] who--okay, here in Atlanta [Georgia], there was a picture of Lester Maddox, became governor here, with a, a axe running after a boy, chased him out of his restaurant.  It became a, a very almost symbolic picture that was used around.  Dunn was the young man that he was chasing 'cause when Dunn left Paul Quinn [Paul Quinn College, Waco, Texas; Dallas, Texas], he came here to go to ITC [Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia] and was involved in the, the integration of, of the facilities here in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And encountered the famous Lester Maddox--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --with the axe handles and--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and the other one?  You said, said it was two.  Can--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you remember their--
Speaker 2: I don't remember the other boy's name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did Dunn become a reverend?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he was a reverend.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A rebel reverend (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).  Okay.
Story_ID: 632233
Speaker 1: Now, did you teach at Paul Quinn [Paul Quinn College, Waco, Texas; Dallas, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My first job at Paul Quinn, (laughter) they didn't--when we got there, they didn't have a dean of students, and while I had absolutely no qualifications for being dean of students, my husband [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams] gave me a job and I always said he gave me an allowance 'cause the finances at the school were such that he had to borrow the first payroll, the--which was due I guess about fifteen days after we got there, he had to borrow it from his father [Eugene Avery Adams, Sr.].  His father was, was on the board of a bank in, in Columbia [South Carolina], and he loaned him the money so that he could, could p- meet his payroll.  When he got to know the people in, in the banks in, in Waco [Texas], this was no longer a problem and then when of course he got the finances in, in shape, it became no problem, but initially, initially it was.
Speaker 1: That's, that's interesting.  So, kind of--it was more a notion being a president of a--of a black college in those days--
Speaker 2: Most--well, I, I think today, too.  It's, it's, it's a fundraiser, a president of a college has to run--has to raise funds.  Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] is about to have a, a $20 million fundraiser next year, and then, then the president is the person who is really--there's a development officer, but the president has to make the contacts to get that kind of money.
Story_ID: 632234
Speaker 1: A school the size of Paul Quinn [Paul Quinn College, Waco, Texas; Dallas, Texas]--now, now Paul Quinn is an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] school--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --too, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Like Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How many A.M.E. schools are, are in the United States now?
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: I mean--or then even?
Speaker 2: Well, now there's Allen University in Columbia, South Carolina, Morr--well, Morris Brown [Morris Brown College] is on its way out.  It used to be one of the starships here in Atlanta [Georgia].  Edward Waters [Edward Waters College] in Jacksonville, Florida, Wilberforce, and the--was--there's one [Shorter College] in Little Rock [sic. North Little Rock, Arkansas].  Oh, what's the college there?
Speaker 1: Is that--is that Philander Smith [Philander Smith College, Little Rock, Arkansas] or?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Philander Smith is United Methodist [United Methodist Church].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'll come--it'll come to me.
Speaker 1: No, I think I know.  I, I can't think of it right now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I can't either.  It'll come to me.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It almost--yeah.
Story_ID: 632235
Speaker 1: How long was your family at Paul Quinn [Paul Quinn College, Waco, Texas; Dallas, Texas]?
Speaker 2: We were at Paul Quinn for six years.  While there, I became a mother twice.  Gaye [Gaye Adams Massey] was born in '57 [1957] and Jann [Jann H. Adams] was born in '61 [1961], I think, '62 [1962].  I have--that's--you have--no, I took it back, didn't I?  Yeah, Jann was born in '61 [1961] because we moved to Seattle [Washington] in '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, Seattle--all right.  So, was this--
Speaker 2: My last child was born in '64 [1964].  That was Madelyn [Madelyn R. Adams].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, your husband [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams] went to--did, did he have a position in Seattle as a--
Speaker 2: He was pastor of First A.M.E. [First African Methodist Episcopal Church, Seattle, Washington]--
Speaker 1: Okay, was First A.M.E.
Speaker 2: --which was one of the downtown churches, lovely old congregation, rather large congregation, in Seattle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And here again, he became involved in the Civil Rights Movement, but he was much more direct in terms of leadership because he--they--we--they did marches for open housing and for civil rights.  Now, there was not the overt segregation in Seattle that we experienced in, in other places in the South, but at that time, there were no, for instance, sales people who were black in any of the public--in any of the downtown stores.  They--some of--you could be a seamstress or you could work in the, the lunch room, that kind of thing, or clean up in the janitorial services, but you couldn't wait on customers.  Our church was a middleclass church of which we had the one black principal, the one black teacher in the whole system.
Speaker 1: Just one?
Speaker 2: One (laughter), one.
Speaker 1: Now, was it--
Speaker 2: I became the second (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, now, was the church located in what they call the CD [Central District] in Seattle?
Speaker 2: No, it was downtown.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: King Street, down--downtown Seattle. Nice, half a block, very centrally located, very intelligent people, very uninvolved initially.  We had one judge in the--in the--named Charles Johnson [Charles V. Johnson] who was also very involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  And in the time that we were there, I did not--as I said, I didn't work at the public schools initially.  I started a daycare center in the, the church that we--that my husband pastored, and I did that for--we were there for six years.  I did that for three years.  The last--the third--the fourth year I was there, I was director of Head Start and be--became a vice principal in the public schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was the first one there.
Speaker 1: Now, you all got there in '62 [1962]?  Is that what--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we got there--
Speaker 1: Sixty-two [1962], okay.
Speaker 2: --in '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: All right.  So--
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: So, you were '62 [1962] to '68 [1968], I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, operation Head Start, that was one of the Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson]--
Speaker 1: It had just started.
Speaker 2: --administration--yeah.
Speaker 1: And the girl who was the--who was the director was a member of our church, and she asked me to come work as a homeschool coordinator and I did that for a few months, and then they asked me to, to interview--because they were gonna--they wanted to, to bring in black administrators and I went in as vice principal.  I did not serve--I was--I was elected principal, but I didn't serve as principal because the announcement was made in July while we were at the general conference.  At that same general conference, my husband was moved from Seattle, so I was never able to serve as a principal.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, when, when an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] minister, like other--like other Methodist ministers can be moved, you know, at a--
Speaker 1: Very definitely.  In fact, A.M.E. minister moves at the--at the pleasure of the bishop.  And, of course, the bishop moves either every four years or every eight years.  He can only stay one place a limited amount of time.
Speaker 2: Is there a philosophy behind the A.M.E.s--their, their moving around of--
Speaker 1: Well, I think it--I, I, I think the--that the, the philosophy was they did not wish to have bishops create a fiefdom.  You know, you get there, you stay forever, and it's all yours.  We felt--and, and, of course, the other thing is, you--there are different levels of intelligence even among the bishops, and so they wanted other districts to have the, the benefit of the wisdom or the insight of, of bishops.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, they moved them.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: And the fit is better with some in some places than it is in others.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  I just wanted to hear what the--what it was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 632236
Speaker 1: In '68 [1968]--now, you were in Seattle [Washington] when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed, right?
Speaker 2: We were in Seattle.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Absolutely. And I remember--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --the day.
Speaker 1: Now, did, did your husband [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams] or your family know Dr. King?
Speaker 2: My husband was in school with Dr. King.  He knew him very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was he at--
Speaker 2: Boston.
Speaker 1: Bo- at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Of course, I didn't ask--well, you should probably tell us a little bit about your husband's education before he got to Payne [Payne Theological Seminary, Wilberforce, Ohio] so we can--
Speaker 2: Okay.  He--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --went to Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University].  He went--he was educated in public schools in Columbia, South Carolina.  He went to Johnson C. Smith in Charlotte [North Carolina], and then went to Boston University.  Subsequent to that, he went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] for a couple semesters, I think, and then came to--had a pastorate in Lynn, Massachusetts, while he was in Boston [Massachusetts], and then came to Payne.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 632237
Speaker 1: Back to our time in Seattle [Washington].  Our time in Seattle was marvelous, but it was also tumultuous because those marches, while they didn't make the kind of publicity that, that King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] did down here, they were life changing there.  As a matter of fact, my, my children were in school and we became targets.  There was a racist who used to call me every night.  He seemed to know when my husband [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams] was gone.  He'd be at church or at some meeting, and he would call and make threats and, you know, "What do you niggers want?"  And, "Why, why are you doing this?"  And I was trying very hard to be conciliatory and I would speak to him very nicely until one Sunday night he called and he said, "Yeah, you've got two daughters, three daughters, one is Gaye [Gaye Adams Massey] and one is Jann [Jann H. Adams] and they're at McGilvra [McGilvra Elementary School, Seattle, Washington]," it was a elementary school, "and Madelyn [Madelyn R. Adams] is in a Montessori school," and our telephone was tapped.  We knew this.  The police put a tap on the telephone because they knew they'd been calling and stuff, and I lost it.  I promised all sorts of things I was gonna do to that man if he--if he touched my children.  So, the next morning, the police came to see me and said, "Ms. Adams [HistoryMaker Dolly Adams], do you have a gun?"  I said, "No."  The man said, "Well, you need one.  After what you told him, he just may come after you."  So, they took me down to the police department, they gave me a gun, took me to the firing range and taught me how to use it, gave me the ammunition and told me if he comes up those stairs or gets anyplace near your children, feel free to shoot him and I promised I would.  I never had to, praise the Lord, but I had every intention of doing so.
Story_ID: 632238
Speaker 1: It, it was so--and it--I got to the point when if I went to a meeting, the members of the black cauc- Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] who then were only about eight or ten in Seattle [Washington] at the time, were my escorts.  They took care of me (laughter).  But, now, my chil- I took my children to school and, and--every morning and I was at that time teaching.  So, it was really--it was--it was frightening.  It was exciting but it was frightening.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we've, we've interviewed some of the Panthers there.  Larry [HistoryMaker Larry Gossett], the county supervisor, Larry--oh, god, what is his name?  Guy--Guy--no.  It's not Guydon.
Speaker 1: Juiton?  Guydon?  J-U-I-T-O-N, the Juitons?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we interviewed them, but we interviewed Larry--he was one of the Panthers.  He was the county supervisor there in, in--
Speaker 1: Those were lovely young men.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: One of them was an artist and I remember I had him to do a--an art display for The Links [The Links, Incorporated] 'cause we had, had an art component to our work.  And the--half of the women were scared of them.  They didn't know what, what, what he was gonna do.  "You're gonna bring Black Panthers in here?"  I said, "These are our children."  And he was a lovely young man.  And, of course, two or three of them came in with him, but they were--they were simply kids who had a cause and they got the--I think H. Rap Brown [Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin] and them sounded too militant for some people and they, they branded it, but they were not bad kids.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  In fact, the--we're talking about 1968, when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed, at that time, King County [Washington] was named for Rufus King [William R. King] the slave master from Virginia [sic. Alabama] I think in the--now, it's named for Dr. Martin Luther King (laughter).
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: You didn't know that?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  That's one of those--
Speaker 1: Oh, I really didn't.
Speaker 2: The ex-Panthers did that, actually (laughter)--
Speaker 1: I gotta tell my husband [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams].
Speaker 2: (Unclear) sponsored that legislation (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I don't think he knew that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's fantastic.
Speaker 2: And the logo is a--is a silhouette of Dr. King.  So--
Speaker 1: Well, now that's--I remember we had Coretta [Coretta Scott King] to come up while we were there to sing.  She did a concert for us.  No, I, I really did not know that, unh-uh.
Speaker 2: That's true.  Yeah, that's--I--gosh, I can't think of his--his first name is Larry, though, and his last name is the same as an actor we interviewed--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, several of the kids who were in there were members of our church [First African Methodist Episcopal Church, Seattle, Washington], so we knew them.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But they, they were--they had gone to school down in the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California] and got into the Black Panthers.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly, they went to--
Speaker 1: And then they came back.
Speaker 2: --a, a conference down there.  They, they drove down to the Bay Area and they came back up as Panthers.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: That's right (laughter).
Story_ID: 632239
Speaker 1: Can you remember what you all were doing when you heard about Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination?
Speaker 2: No, but I do remember that that same night, we had a, a prayer service and I remember the tears and the--really the anguish as a result of it.  I, I, I--we felt it very personally not just because we knew him but because he was such a symbol.  My husband [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams] was, was--the leader of the, the--well, he had helped to organize the Central Area motivational group [Central Area Motivation Program], which was a--the--we got the first war on poverty grant.  And, you know, we were doing the same things, kinds of things in Seattle [Washington] that he was doing down here.  And while we--and, of course, Andrew [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] was work--working with him, so we felt very close to him, too.  And it was really like as though a member of the family had died and it--and, and the possibility of assassination I don't think had ever--we knew it was dangerous, but I guess I--we never really dealt with the, the possibility that he might be assassinated, so it--that, that really floored us.
Story_ID: 632240
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just wanted to say that it was [HistoryMaker] Larry Gossett (simultaneous)--

Speaker 1: --who was the county supervisor--
Speaker 2: I'm so glad (unclear)--
Speaker 1: --in King County, Washington, that put forward the bill by which they changed the name of the county to Dr. Martin Luther King County [sic. King County].  The Kingdome [King County Multipurpose Domed Stadium, Seattle, Washington], all that stuff is related to Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] now.  So--
Speaker 2: That is cute (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: There's a--we have a building out here, the Lucas building [Randolph-Lucas House, Atlanta, Georgia], and the historical society [Atlanta History Center, Atlanta, Georgia] has been giving us a hard time because we wanted to remove it.  It's old and you, you cannot use it and we don't really want to invest a whole lot of money into it.  But, they gave us a real hard time, I mean for the last eight or ten years.  So finally somebody found out that Mr. Lucas [Arthur Lucas] was a wizard of the Ku Klux Klan [KKK], and they backed off.  Now, they, they--just this year, and in fact two or three weeks ago, gave us clearance.  Nobody knew--nobody had any idea about it or at least had not uncovered it.  That changed everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's interesting, they've changed King County to King County (laughter).  I like that.

Speaker 1: So you were there until '68 [1968] and you all left Seattle [Washington] in '68 [1968] when your husband [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams] was, was moved--
Speaker 2: To--
Speaker 1: --now--
Speaker 2: --to Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: --to Los Angeles, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To Grant [Grant African Methodist Episcopal Church].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: In Watts [Los Angeles, California].  This was a week after the Watts riots were over and they sent him to a church at 103rd [Street] and, and--I've forgotten the name of the street, but it's right in the middle of, of--across the street from the, the park [Will Rogers Park; Ted Watkins Park] where the riots started.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my husband joked--you know, he's very fair skinned and he said, he said--told the bishop, "You're gonna send a man of my color to Watts now?"  He said, "Oh, you can handle it." (Laughter) Well, his way of handling it is--was he went down to the pool hall and got to know all the people down there, he went to--got to know all of the little gangs on the street and they were all in our neighborhood.  And they, they were employed to help take care--police the area.  We could leave our cars open.  They took care of me.  But, but, they didn't let anybody else do it at--while we were there.  I'm sure they did it to everybody else's cars, but they, they were very ni- because he really made a--made an effort.  He ma- got him out of jail, went to the hospital to see them when they were there, that kind of stuff.  So, we--they--
Speaker 1: Right.  So, he was really involved (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) were big buddies, yeah.
Speaker 1: Pastor was--sounds like he had some community organizing and training.
Speaker 2: Oh, he passed--that's right.  He--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Well, he acted like it anyhow.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: He acted like he was anyway.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And what, what was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: Grant.
Speaker 1: Grant, okay.
Speaker 2: G-R-A-N-T.
Speaker 1: Grant A.M.E.  I know the, the one I always hear about the most is FAME [First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], you know, the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's First A.M.E.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: But Grant is in, in Watts.  It had about, oh, I guess two thousand members when we were there.  Lovely church, nice people, very much involved.  We had an ethnic school on Saturdays, every Saturday morning where we had eighty to ninety kids.  They were neighborhood kids.  We taught them reading, writing, math, and black history.  And it was--it was not the most popular thing with the members of the church in the beginning because they thought all these kids are coming to our church on, on, on Saturday morning, they're gonna tear it up.  We fed them and taught them, and the parents ended up coming and joining the church.  But we--and the, the ethnic school went on for, oh, I guess, ten or fifteen years after we left.
Speaker 1: So, it's called the ethnic school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's interesting you all were teaching black history in, in church, which is something that--
Speaker 2: Well, we--
Speaker 1: --you would think people would--
Speaker 2: What we did was we said, "We wanna teach you to love yourselves, black love without white hate."  We did not want the, the--at that point, you know, there was a great deal of hostility where white people were concerned and we didn't want our kids to grow up with that.  We wanted them to be proud of who they were, but we didn't want them to hate other people because they weren't like them.  That's teaching them to do the same thing that other people had done to them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, this is a--okay.  So, so, did--was it--was it hard to find the support within the church for that program?
Speaker 2: Well, when I got there, one of the first things we organized was a group of young women.  I--I've always worked with the missionary society and bishop called them his mini skirted missionaries 'cause that's--min- mini skirts were in style then and these were all the young women, but they were daughters of families in the church.  And it was kind of difficult for the older folk to fight their daughters.  So, you know, you get these eighteen, nineteen, twenty year olds, and twenty or thirty of them, and they're the ones who ran the school.  They were there every Saturday morning.  They made food for them.  They taught the classes.  They did everything.  And we got to the point where the--one of the older groups, missionary groups, started coming and doing lunch for us so that we would not have to do that.  The, the younger women could do the other things as the, the, the group grew, grew as a school group.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Did you have like support from the local politicians and--
Speaker 2: No, not really.  There was no animosity, but there was no real support for that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, it sounds--that sounds really interesting.
Story_ID: 632242
Speaker 1: How long were you in Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 2: We were in there for six years.
Speaker 1: Now, I think--I guess before I guess you got to Los Angeles--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I, I passed something by I should not have and that--that's when you joined The Links [The Links, Incorporated].  So--
Speaker 2: Okay, I joined The Links in (pause)--
Speaker 1: We have '65 [1965].  Is that--is that correct?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I--no.  I joined it--yeah, in, in Seattle [Washington], '65 [1965].  Is that what--is that what Madelyn [Adams' daughter, Madelyn R. Adams] has down here?  Oh, she doesn't even have the year down here, no.  Yeah, it was '65 [1965].  It was in--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Seattle.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about--now, what are The Links and what was the--
Speaker 2: Okay.  The Links is a civic minded group.  We started off really as a social--a group of, of--in, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, two teachers decided that one of the things that was not happening with black kids in the ghetto was that while they might be getting the basics, they were not getting any of the finer things, and they wanted to expose them to some of the arts, music and dance and visual arts and that kind of thing.  So, they got together as a group.  Their group was probably about twelve or fourteen women, and those twelve or fourteen women reached out to women in chapters--in the cities to start chapters, the Los--and to--al--along the eastern seaboard to Washington, D.C., to Virginia, to North Carolina. And the, the chapters--the people--chapters began to be formed in cities all across the east--eastern shore down South and then moved to the Midwest.  The Links is really a social service organization, civic, educational and cultural.
Story_ID: 632243
Speaker 1: We are, I guess civil rights and edu- when my--I was president from '82 [1982] to '86 [1986] and I focused and I--The Links [The Links, Incorporated] at that time focused basically on civil rights and education.  We completed a, a gift.  I was privileged to hand the check to the, the director of the UNCF [United Negro College Fund] for a million dollars the last--we completed that gift.  We did the same thing for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, INc.].  Our chapters do the same kind of thing on a smaller level.  They give scholarships to students in coll- in coll- to go to colleges.  They give--they do mentoring, they work with kids af- in after school programs.  For instance, here, the Atlanta [Georgia] chapter here has worked with one school, Coan Middle School [Sammye E. Coan Middle School, Atlanta, Georgia], for over twenty-five years.  They started when I was president.  And they, they take kids from when they get to the middle school to when they get out and they follow them.  Some of them have finished college and they brought them back for--we're having a sixtieth reunion this year.  They're bringing some of those kids back.  They do mentoring.  They do actual going to the classrooms and help teachers.  They do a great number of, of extracurricular activities.  Like, they--this year, they're taking the senior class to Washington [D.C.] on a trip.  But, (cough) the local chapters are free to select from the needs of their community, the projects that they think are most necessary.  Now, some of them do their, their work only with young children, some of them do it with the high school age kids, some of them do with--work with unwed mothers, or the homeless.  They take--they decide what they want to work with.  But now we have five program areas.  We have the arts, national trends, international trends, services to youth, and health.  In international trends, for instance, we started with digging water wells in Africa with a--with a, a partnership with Africare out of Washington.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  Now, that, that started up in what, the early '70s [1970s], around '73 [1972]--'72 [1972], '73 [1973], right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And we were--I was living in Washington at that time Africare was, was going pretty strongly.  It has just got in that building.  But, they were doing a great deal of work in, in Africa.  And we, we funded water wells.  This November, we are going--we have a, a delegation of fifty people who are going--this November--this February, we have a delegation of fifty people who are going to Liberia to look at the two or three programs we have there.  We work with A.M.E. University [African Methodist Episcopal University, Morovia, Liberia].  One of our members is the president of A.M.E. University, Dr. Jean Bell Manning, who incidentally, her husband [Reuben David Joshua Manning] was president of Paul Quinn [Paul Quinn College, Waco, Texas; Dallas, Texas] when we were there.  And she might be somebody you would like to interview, too.  I have to remember that.
Speaker 2: Jean Bell Manning?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: She's still in Liberia, but she's coming home I think at the end of this year.  She will have spent four or five years there as president of the college.  The Links will, will visit that and they will--they--we have a health clinic in the bush country, and a, a couple schools.  In South Africa, we have ten schools that we started.  And what--South Africa was a different kind of thing.  In South Africa, if you started the school, the coun- the government will take it over and they will supply the teachers and take care of the administration, and maintain it, but you do the building.  So, we built ten schools in black communities in South Africa, and they are still going.  Also, in Malawi, we have schools there.  That's--those kinds--and we do other things.  Many of our, our local chapters will send money for goats in, in Haiti.  That was another project.  We've got all sorts of, of interesting projects with, with--in the Caribbean, but we've moved more into Africa and, of course, Haiti.
Speaker 2: Those--yeah, a lot of need in--
Speaker 1: The need is--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --absolutely great.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: Acute.
Speaker 2: So, The Links were founded in the--when, when were they founded?
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-seven [sic. 1946].
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-seven [1947], okay.  And--
Speaker 1: In Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right. All right. So, so you were the first person in your family to be a member of The Links, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right.
Story_ID: 632244
Speaker 1: Now, as the, the wife of a prominent pastor [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams] who becomes a bishop, a lot is expected, you know.  I think that's a traditional view in a black church when they the, the, the wife of the minister is--she has a--like a first lady persona she has to maintain.
Speaker 2: Well, see I came along before the first lady persona.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And, and I perceived myself as a ha- help mate, but I was supposed to be--I felt that I was supposed to do what I did well.  Like in Seattle [Washington], that was the first church that he pastored [First African Methodist Episcopal Church] while--after we got married, I started the daycare center.  This is so they got--knew how to do and I did it--I was a volunteer.  I didn't take salary.  In Los Angeles [Grant African Methodist Episcopal Church, Los Angeles, California], I did the ethnic school.  My niche--I, I define my own niche.  I never quite wanted to be defined as the, the first lady who sits in this corner and, you know, what have you.  Now, as the wife of a bishop, I was assigned a job, the supervisor of the Women's Missionary Society, which I enjoyed because, because even here you could be creative.  How they--how our local societies responded to the needs of their communities was also not dictated.  I did--I enjoyed doing educational workshops and so we had re- retreats.  Every place that I--that my husband served, I set up retreats and we'd do two a year.  We ended up with maybe two thousand women at the retreats.  We would bring in people to talk about how you do the, the things that you're supposed to be doing, where you are to enable and enrich and educate.  But, I'm the--I've never been a sit-down--
Speaker 1: No, I--
Speaker 2: --kind of--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I, I--we've heard the story.  You're, you're more than qualified to do, you know, a lot more than just be at the side of someone, you know.  I, I know that.  So, did, did you have a role model for, for--or, or just is, is it just like your personality or what?
Speaker 2: It's my personality, but I, I had two good role models.  One was Artishia Jordan [Artishia Wilkerson Jordan] who was probably one of the smartest women I've ever known.  She was a mathematician.  She was the wife of Bishop Frederick Jordan, and the other was Mrs. Edith May Primm [Edith Primm].  She was the wife of Bishop Howard Thomas Primm.  Now, both of those were my husband's enablers.  They enabled him.  My--Bishop Primm really sponsored him and Mrs. Primm and Mrs. Jordan mentored me.  They were both--Mrs. Jordan was much more outspoken and much more involved in the community than was Mrs. Primm, but Mrs. Primm was very much involved in the missionary society, and both of them were ladies that I looked up to and sort of emulated, yes.
Story_ID: 632245
Speaker 1: Now, I know there's been a protracted struggle in the A.M.E. church [African Methodist Episcopal] over whether women should be pastors or not over the years I know and I think you were probably around for a lot of the conferences where this was--the struggle was dramatized or whatever.  So, now there is, of course, a, a woman bishop of the A.M.E. church.
Speaker 2: They have three.
Speaker 1: Three, okay.
Speaker 2: No, the A.M.E. church really didn't have a protracted problem with it.  When we went to Texas as my husband [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams] was the bishop, there were women preachers then, way back then.  When we went to the second district, which was the Washington, D.C., North Carolina eastern seaboard area, the Baltimore [Maryland] area had I would say eight or ten women preachers, intelligent young--the first--our first bishop, woman bishop, Vashti McKenzie [HistoryMaker Bishop Vashti McKenzie], came out of that group of women in the eastern seaboard in, in Baltimore.  These were very well educated, attractive, articulate young women, and it just sort of spread.  They got--they began to make alliances and, and enabled each other, and I, I think our, our church has been very warm and inviting with women preachers that the congregations took their time.  They had to be, be converted (laughter), should we say, to a woman pastor.  But, the women seemed to have been sk- skillful enough that they were able to, to accomplish that.  They were able to, to win them over, and they've done very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Especially in the northeast.  Now, there are a few there, too, but northeast, particularly.
Speaker 1: Okay, who's the--you know--okay.  So, where did you get the most resistance to the idea of women being--
Speaker 2: I think the South is more resistant.  We're more traditional down here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That makes sense.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That makes sense.
Story_ID: 632246
Speaker 1: Now, I had left you in the chronology in Los Angeles [California] and then we veered off into The Links [The Links, Incorporated], but--which is okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We, we got that story told on some level.  There's probably more, more, more to it, but--okay.  So, in--so, you were in Los Angeles until what time?
Speaker 2: 'Til '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: To '72 [1972].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was elected bishop in '72 [1972] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, '68 [1968] to '72 [1972] in Los Angeles.  And he--your husband became Bishop Adams [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams] in '72 [1972] at--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so where did--where was he required to go after he became bishop?
Speaker 2: Back to Waco, Texas.  We went to Texas to be the bishop there.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And so we went back to live in Waco.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, was he associated with, with Paul, Paul Quinn [Paul Quinn College, Waco, Texas; Dallas, Texas] then?
Speaker 2: He was then chairman of the board.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The bishop of Texas becomes chairman of the--at that time became chairman of the board of Paul Quinn automatically.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 632247
Speaker 1: Now you at some point, you, you went back to school to, to work on your, your Ph.D., right?
Speaker 2: I went while living in, in Waco [Texas], the year my daughter [Jann H. Adams] graduated from high school, the middle daughter graduated from high school, my older daughter [Gaye Adams Massey] graduated from Wellesley [Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts], I graduated from Baylor [Baylor University, Waco, Texas].  I got a, a doctorate in education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And what was your dissertation about?
Speaker 2: My dissertation was about the, the lack of retention--we, we were dealing with dropouts and the fact that we were not able to retain students in our colleges and universities, and I was dealing with that type of thing, and particularly in black colleges.
Speaker 1: And, now, you can help me out with this, but I, I know at a certain point, there became a lot of money available for colleges to have  mi- to fund minority attendance, but it seems as though, and I know this is true in Chicago [Illinois] at the city college level especially, people would enroll in city college, get a grant of money, and then drop out of school.  And they, they would--actually, there was some money they actually--they could actually spend in this grant, and they would--they would enroll in school just to get money and drop out.  And these were people that would then later regret it and--
Speaker 2: 'Cause they could've done--yeah.  And this is--this is what we were looking at.  It was happening everywhere.  And I think a part--a, a, a, a part of it was the fact that they came from homes that did not value the educational process and they, their, their homes did not see the value in them being in school for four years and not being in the workforce, and things would happen at home and they would end up deciding it was more important for them to go home and get a job than it was for them to be in school.  And they didn't have the kind of mentors and the kind of support in the schools, which helped them to make the decision, you know, is--my future is more important.  I--or I can do both things.  It's not and/or.  You know, we can do this.
Speaker 1: Okay, was, was that the major problem or, or--in terms of retaining--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was--I think--that was the one--the one that I could, could identify.  The other problem was the fact that, that there were many--that there was no support system in the school itself.  The teachers taught their, their classes, but they did not work with the students.  The, the, the counseling departments were not set up really to deal with student--those kinds of problems.  They were deal--they were set up to deal with disciplinary problems.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, now, you, you described and--yourself being discouraged by an official in the public school system in Louisiana from you pursuing higher education, you know, aloof teachers at, at University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], but you were better prepared to deal with that kind of thing probably.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'd been throughout it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But, a, a student, I guess, entering college for the first time and never really thought about going to school, they had--
Speaker 2: Never saw it as a possibility, and they go home in the summertime and their parents are very pleased that they are in school, but then they get this little job and they start getting a little money and the next thing you know, they don't come back next semester.  And the, the follow through by the college itself was non existent.  Child didn't come back, they just didn't come back.  They made no real effort to, to, to try to get that, that--those students back.  So, retention was a real problem. And I think it still is.
Speaker 1: And, and so, so what did your--did your paper have recommendations for--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We--basically what we--what we recommended was that the schools themselves set up the kind of departments where these, these, these students who had potential problems were identified and that someone be assigned to work with them, that there be a mentor/mentee relationship established so that, that, that when a--when a student felt himself in this kind of position, he felt that there was somebody he could go back to and say, "Look, I, I can't, can't make it back next semester and here's why," and maybe there's somebody--there's--this person can give them another way of looking at this.  "Okay, come back to school and get a job at school or get a job in the city and send the money home rather than--or come back and, and go part-time."  You know, there, there were so many other alternatives, but the students didn't know them and there was nobody to, to point them out to them or to help them reach a, a more sane, what we consider a more sane decision.
Story_ID: 632248
Speaker 1: I know some schools have started university college programs where the students are in a program where they don't even focus on a major for a while, just get them, their self up to speed, I guess.
Speaker 2: Okay, and they also have programs now where they can do it online where they never even have to go to school.  They can come home at night on the computer and do all their work, which is entirely different from what was available in, in the--in the days that I was teaching.  You had to be physically there.  But there, there are a lot of options now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, we laughed at Nova [Nova Southeastern University, Fort Lauderdale, Florida] and, and University of Phoenix when they first started, but they're multimillion dollar institutions now.
Speaker 1: So, do you see that as an alternative to--
Speaker 2: I'm not--I'm not sure 'cause I am not--I'm not conversed enough to say that they are--that the learn--the learning which has occurred is--which is occurring there is comparable to what was occurring in traditional classrooms.  I really don't know.  I do know that when we were at Paul Quinn [Paul Quinn College, Waco, Texas; Dallas, Texas], for instance, we had a man who, who got a master's degree in biology from Nova and Southern--South Central [sic. Southern Association of Colleges and Schools] accrediting agency would not accept it, would not recognize it.  Now, Nova is being accepted everywhere.  So, (cough) so I don't know. (Cough) It could very well be that, that their standards have changed to the point that they are producing--for them to have, have lasted this long, they probably are.
Story_ID: 632249
Speaker 1: You got your Ph.D. in 1979.  Were there--who, who was your advisor at Baylor [Baylor University, Waco, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Bill Lamkin's, Dr. Bill Lamkin.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you generally, you know, have a good relationship with, with the department?
Speaker 2: Good relationships with him.  There were three, two of us, two black women in the program.  Baylor had been very restrictive in terms of, of race until two or three years before I got there, and I was one of the--in one of the first classes.  There were students who were a little hostile, but I was mature enough for it not to bother me.  The only overt thing that happened in a classroom that really annoyed me was we were discussing students' capabilities and I don't know how we got on this, but someone was very cavalier and they--and said, "You know, black students can't swim as well as--there's something physiologically different about them.  They can't swim as good, as well as white folks."  And the, the professor did not challenge it or say anything.  And so I said--I finally, you know, took about as long, I said, "Are you gonna answer him?"  He said, "Would you like to?"  I said, "I'd be delighted to."  I said, "I wanna tell you first, we didn't have swimming pools in our black- backyards and we didn't have access in some places to--even to the beaches 'cause you all wouldn't let us go in there.  So, they had no opportu- our kids didn't have an opportunity to learn how to swim except if we were gonna get them one of these mud pools and you--ponds, and you cannot swim in one of those for any length of time or with any degree of grace.  But, you know, I think it's kind of ignorant in this day and time for you to sit up here and say we--black folk are physiologically different, and this is supposed to be a Christian institution where all men are created equal and the Lord made all of us and all that kind of stuff."  Well, when I got through preaching, the, the pa--the teacher said, "Thank you, Mrs. Adams [HistoryMaker Dolly Adams].  That--that's--that'll, that'll be sufficient."  But I thought it was the most ignorant thing I had heard and it was not challenged.  It was just like, it's a fact, we lay it out here.  You--none of your students have done anything.  They, they don't swim.  I said, "Where are they gonna swim?  They can't even go in the Brazos River and swim."  No opportunities.
Story_ID: 632250
Speaker 1: Graduate stoo- school experience that--that's almost like the experience of [HistoryMaker] Joseph Boyce in grade school, you know, in, in Danville, Illinois, I think it was.  So--okay.  So--now, now did your career path change after you, you got your Ph.D.?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Well, I was not teaching at that point because my husband's [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams] conferences were always in the--started in September and went through November, and it's kind of hard for you to tell people I gotta be away a week, you know, the first part of every week.  So, I--the second semester, I would teach courses at Paul Quinn [Paul Quinn College, Waco, Texas; Dallas, Texas]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but only a couple courses.  And, of course, I had three daughters [Gaye Adams Massey, Jann H. Adams and Madelyn R. Adams] I was raising at the same time and going through their trials and tribulations.  So, I, I was--did not have a full time job there, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: Now, I was working with Planned Parenthood [Planned Parenthood Federation of America] which was not the most popular place to be working either.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It--you know, it was volunteering, though--
Speaker 1: Yeah that--
Speaker 2: --in family services.
Speaker 1: How, how did the A.M.E.--what was the--did, did the A.M.E. church [African Methodist Episcopal] have an official stance around--about, about abortion and or, or Planned Parenthood or?
Speaker 2: No, they had no, no, no, no official stance about Planned Parenthood.  I think that most of us supported it, you know.  If you don't want people to have abortions, then they shouldn't get pregnant and then have to--the--you had to teach them how not to get pregnant, and that basically is what pan--Planned Parenthood was doing.  Now, they got--they got the rap of being abortion clinics, but they were not and they still are not.  They were simply trying to educate people about contraceptions.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was, was that part of Texas would you say is more fundamentalist like--
Speaker 2: Oh, very much so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, very (laughter) much so.
Speaker 1: So that's what it made it a, a risky volunteer position.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Was there any, any stories about--did, did you receive any threats over there at Planned Parenthood--
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.  They didn't--
Speaker 1: --when you were--
Speaker 2: They didn't--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They--there was--Waco [Texas] was a very easy place to live.  This is--I told you they, they integrated by fiat.  My husband went down and sat, sat down with the mayor and the next day was integrated.  They, they--we had--when they first started, the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] came on our--on the campus and burned a cross on our front yard, but that was when we first got there and then we never had any more trouble. (Cough) I don't know exactly who started--who stopped them or what they had heard about what these crazy folk at, at Paul Quinn might do to them if they came back again, but they did not come back again.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But they might have heard something like that.
Speaker 2: They probably heard something. Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 632251
Speaker 1: Now, when did--did you move to Washington [D.C.] in '81 [1981]?  Is that--is that what it was?
Speaker 2: Eighty- yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wait, no--'72 [1972] to '80 [1980].
Speaker 1: Eighty [1980].
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty [1980].
Speaker 1: All right, 1980, okay.  So, was your husband [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams] appointed to a post in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was--yeah, he was the bishop of the--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Washington--that was called the Second Episcopal District, which is the area from Baltimore [Maryland] down to North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Baltimore, Virginia, and North Carolina--Baltimore, Washington, Virginia, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's a big territory with a lot of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --churches.  Okay.  And, now--so, you served as a visiting professor at Howard [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], right?
Speaker 2: School of Law.
Speaker 1: School of Law, okay.  Now--so, what did you teach at the Howard School of Law?  Why the School of Law instead of the school of education?
Speaker 2: 'Cause, 'cause they, they invited me (laughter).  I, I didn't--I didn't apply for a job.  Somebody who worked there asked me.  School of communic--the--I did communication skills.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Taught young lawyers how to write.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were finding out that young people were coming with excellent intellectual capacities but they did not know how to write, and that many of them were not reading well.  They had finished college but I think this was during the time when they were doing a lot of fill in the blanks and true and false and they were not really having, being made to do consistent writings, and so that--those skills were not there.  And, of course, a lawyer has to be able to write.  So, the, the college perceived the fact that, that these kid--these young people needed to be taught.  So, what they did was they gave them an, an exam.  ITC [Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia] did that same thing here with the preachers.  They gave them an, an exam as a part of their entrance exam, and that exam identified those who had those needs, and they were then assigned to communication skills classes, which they resented greatly 'cause they had graduated from college and, "You're gonna put me in a remedial reading class," and--but, they got over it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean, I, I would imagine some would--were grateful when they, they met the real world with--
Speaker 2: I don't think that many of them really realized that they had a, a deficit there.  As one boy--young man told me, I said, "Conjugate the verb to be."  And he said, "I be, you be, he, she, it, bes." And I said--and I didn't want to embarrass him, so I went on and showed him how to do it.  And then after he said, "Mrs. Adams [HistoryMaker Dolly Adams], everybody in the town I live in says I bes."  This is all that he actually had heard and nowhere in his four years in college had anybody identified or, or really dealt with it.  They probably had seen it and heard it, but they did not stop really to deal with it.  But, when a teacher has a class of fifty students or forty students, it's kind of hard to do personal, individual attention.  My classes maybe had sixteen or seventeen and so I could really work with, with where the particular students' needs were.  But, there were many students--and writing was almost a lost art 'cause they really had not had to write, and that's all they did when they got to law school.
Speaker 1: Now, when, when you were in undergraduate school, can you imagine--I mean, did--I mean, were there--would, would you suspect or did you know of a substantial number of students that couldn't really write or?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  For some reason, we had really been taught to read and write.  That was very important with us.  We were not conversant in arts, but--or science, but reading, writing, and math were, were heavy subjects, particularly at the, the coll- the high school I went to.  But, I think that, that--I don't know what, what happened in the, the, the, the, the next generation which caused these. Kids spoke that way, so our teachers had to hear them and it would seems to me somewhere along the way, you know, just as when I hear my grandchildren say something that--and I know they're not supposed to say it, I, I correct them then.  I, I don't understand why they had not been--it had not been noted before, but it hadn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: And it's still being used.  They still have communications skills classes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, so, so you taught at Howard.  You were like a, a visiting lecturer--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and, so, how, how long did you do--you do that, teach communication skills?
Speaker 2: For the eight years that we were there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so from 1980 to '88 [1988]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --basically?  Okay.
Story_ID: 632252
Speaker 1: Was your hu- your husband [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams] moved again in '88 [1988]?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He came to Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And we stayed here until '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And while we were here in Atlanta, I wor- worked at ITC.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's International (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Internat--Inter--Interdenominational--
Speaker 1: Interdenominational, right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Theological--
Speaker 2: Theological Center.
Speaker 1: --Seminary.  Center.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right?  ITC, that's--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Intern--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, you're not from Atlanta.  You're don't supposed--I said that like you're supposed to know what ITC is.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, I, I actually should know, but I'm just--I'm, I'm--I represent everybody now in--
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: --in this seat, you know, so--okay, so, yeah, ITC (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Interdenominational Theological Center [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: This is one of the great centers for learning for theology in the country--
Speaker 2: Right, it's a--
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: --consortium of, of six or seven denominations who support all--one seminary for all of their students.
Story_ID: 632253
Speaker 1: Atlanta [Georgia], like Washington, D.C., has a lot of--now, now--well, let me just go back to D.C. for a minute.  I know D.C. is really a center for black women organizing themselves in the groups and it's highly organized--
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: --and, and, and so is Atlanta, for that matter.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: Same kind of city.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, what were you involved in in Washington--what organizations were you involved in in Washington, D.C., and--
Speaker 2: Well, I was on the board of Howard's [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] television.  I was--
Speaker 1: This is WHUT [WHUT-TV, Washington, D.C.], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I think my, my basic work in--while I was there was probably with The Links [The Links, Incorporated] and with the missionary society [Women's Missionary Society].  One of the things that we did while we--while I was president was buy a building through The Links, and this was a long and arduous process.  We started it when I became president in '82 [1982].  In '83 [1983]--'84 [1984], we bought the building, paid for it completely.  There was no mortgage.  And then I started what was called The Links Foundation, and The Links--the building really belongs to The Links Foundation because it's tax exempt and--but, The Links is--of course, is housed in it.  And we had--we, we did those, those--organized into, into a process so that we could get the money for UNCF [United Negro College Fund] and for National Defense Legal- NAACP Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc.].
Story_ID: 632254
Speaker 1: We also, as a part of our international thing, that was the year of the international year of the woman [International Women's Year], and the conference, the last closing conference was in Nairobi, Kenya, and I led a delegation of 106 women, and there were some men in the delegation, to Nairobi for that convention.  Two things that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, this is 19--that's 19--
Speaker 1: Nairobi was 1985.
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-five [1985].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There was 140 I see here.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was a very interesting situation because when we got there, we went in two groups, one group of fifty and the other group of sixty or seventy.  One group left from the West Coast and one left from the East Coast.  At that same time, I was having meetings in the west, so I came with the West Coast, which came left--la- later.  The first group went in, was settled by the time we got there.  When we got there, the government of Kenya had nationalized the hotels and all of our rooms had been taken, and they told us they were gonna put us in rooms in surrounding villages or beat hotels, wherever they, they could find a place to put us.  And that's not--this is--we had about fifty, sixty people.  [HistoryMaker] Etta Moten Barnett, you remember that name?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: She was our international trends person and she was really the leader of the delegation.  And her--I was just about to panic and her answer was, "Oh no, we'll just act like sisters.  We'll double up."  And so we contacted the first group of, of fifty or sixty who had come over and said, "You're gonna have a roommate," and we re- she reassigned every last one of those people to (laughter)--into somebody's room, existing room.  Bella Abzug was there.  You remember her name?
Speaker 2: Abzug from, from New York?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Congresswoman from New York?
Speaker 1: Con- big hat. Sitting under the tree. And somebody told her who I was and she called me, "Come here, darling.  I hear what happened to you.  Now, we can't have that happen."  I said, "I, I, I said I was irate about it.  It did make me mad."  She said, "Well I tell you what, we're gonna march tomorrow.  I'll get my ladies to come with you and we will march. We're going on to the state house."  I called my husband [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams] that night and I said--told him what Bella had said.  I said, "We're marching in the morning."  He said, "You march yourself to the airport and come home.  If you march in, in Nairobi, they will find you.  They'll put you in jail and I'll never see you again.  Don't you dare march (laughter) in Nair- Nairobi."  So, we called the march off.  We said, "We think we'll be peaceful.  We'll leave this alone."  It was--it was--I thought about it later and when you hear about people disappearing, this was what he thought about.  "You will disappear."  Now, the other thing about that meeting was, when we walked into the fairgrounds where they--all the local people had their, their little kioshes [sic. kiosks], they were selling stuff, a little lady saw us.  We had on something that had insignia of Links [The Links, Incorporated] and she said, "The Links, The Links, it's The Links," and she started jumping up and down, and I realized that she had some of the water wells and they were--I don't know what they were doing them there.  I guess they were showing--they were showing what they were doing in the communities, but she--and she understood that we were the ones who had sent over the money for the--for those water wells.  So, it was--it was a really nice trip.  Now, the other thing I think that, that we did while we were there that was, was really important, was we had a women's consultation, the Lilly Endowment [Lilly Endowment, Inc.] from Cinc- from Indianapolis [Indiana], gave us some money for, for four consultations.  We would--we invited the fourteen largest black women's organizations and we worked on, on international issues during that time, deciding what we could do collectively and deciding--trying to find out what each of these organizations was doing individually and how we could coalesce because we felt that if we could get us working on some of the same projects, the impact would be so much more.  That and building that building, securing the funding for it and all that kind of stuff, that was the focus I think of my time in Washington [D.C.].
Story_ID: 632255
Speaker 1: Well, it seems, seems like it's a time well spent and a lot--
Speaker 2: It was a full time job that--and I was glad that I was living in Washington [D.C.] during that time because I don't think I could've lived someplace else and, and--I certainly wouldn't have been able to do it--the kind of stuff that I did 'cause I--we lived in McLean [Virginia] and I could just drive in.
Speaker 1: So, the building was a--is--was a chapter for the, the, the--
Speaker 2: For the national.
Speaker 1: --national.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 1200 Massachusetts Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, do they call it national now or international?  Is, is--
Speaker 2: National.
Speaker 1: Links [The Links, Incorporated] is still a national organization.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  We have chapters in the Bahamas, in South Africa, and Hawaii.  Hawaii is a state, now, but we're, we're--we have not focused that much on international.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wut we've done works in, in--internationally, but we have not focused on establishing chapters.  It's kind of difficult to do that.
Story_ID: 632256
Speaker 1: Correct me if I'm moving too fast, but in 1990, you published, it says here, 'She in the Glass House'--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --'A Handbook for African, African Methodist Episcopal Church Ministers' Wives and Widows' ['She in the Glass House: A Handbook for African Methodist Episcopal Church Ministers' Wives and Widows,' Dolly Desselle Adams].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was--that, that was while we were in Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: Now, what's the back story on that?  I mean, why such--
Speaker 2: Well, I worked with ministers' wives a great deal.  As I said, I don't like the stereotype of ministers' wives being aloof and I didn't think that I needed to be the assistant pastor and I didn't think ministers' wives needed to be.  And I guess this is my way of indoctrinating.  I had ministers' wives retreats and most of them really did not know.  They knew what they had seen and they knew what people told them and many mini- many ministers' wives go into--I remember the first church I went, went into, the first thing the lady told me was my dress was too short and then another one tells me where to sit and another one, you know, members, really will take over your life if you let them, and I felt that they needed to have some backbone or some--something that they could fall back on and say, "No, I I don't have--that is not what I'm supposed to do."  And while the, the handbook gave them some guidelines, it also emphasized the fact that you have good sense, use it.  You're an intelligent woman before you became here.  You didn't come here to be the assistant pastor, and that is not true in all cases because many of the, the preachers' wives now are preachers themselves, but in those days, they were not.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think Floyd Flake's [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Floyd Flake] wife [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Elaine Flake] now--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --has become a minister.  But, but I, I guess if that's what somebody wants to do, that's all right, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's fine.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But I don't think you ought to be pushed into it.  And many of them were intimidated in it.  And when I first came in, I was a little intimidated by some of the older women because there was always some older woman who was gonna tell you exactly what you're supposed to do, how you're supposed to sit, what you're supposed to dress, what your children are supposed to wear and--you know, that--all that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I didn't work well with that.
Speaker 1: All right.  All right.  So, what was the most important, I guess--I guess bit of information that--I mean--I mean, it's probably all important, but what, what do you think is the most crucial bit of information in the handbook?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that the most crucial information that I tried to im- import was your husband has a profession.  He is your husband.  You are not the assistant pastor.  Your job is family and whatever it is that--and faith, of course.  You need to be a good Christian woman, but you do not need to be a, a, a member of the pulpit to do that, and I think that everybody defines how they implement their lives themselves.  I don't think anybody can, can tell you how to live your life.  And if you're an intell- intelligent woman, you work that out for yourself.  That's between you, your husband, and the Lord.  But, I think that women ought to have the freedom to make those choices and to know that they can, that the, the, the members don't tell you what to do.  You decide that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how, how was your book received?
Speaker 2: Very well received.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I still have people sending for copies.  They have retreats and they, "Send me fifteen copies.  I want--," they, they like it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can imagine it would be like a, a subject of a--of a retreat session--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, and people would actually discuss it.
Speaker 2: Well, the kinds of questions that some of the, the kinds of things some of those, those women go through is, is, is amazing, especially in small congregations in the South.  These people feel sometimes--the, the members feel as though they've been there so long that they--this church belongs to them and they knew how you're supposed to act and "You're supposed to do what I say do."  There are two or three who appoint themselves as in charge, you know.  So, it, it takes a little backbone to deal with, and I try to give that kind of support to the ministers' wives.
Story_ID: 632257
Speaker 1: This was published in 1990.  So, now, you were in, in Washington, D.C., until what time?  When was it?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-eight [1988].
Speaker 1: Eighty-eight [1988], okay.  Oh--okay.  So, when you published the book ['She in the Glass House: A Handbook for African Methodist Episcopal Church Ministers' Wives and Widows,' Dolly Desselle Adams], you, you weren't in D.C. anymore.  You were here in--
Speaker 2: I don't know.  What was the date?
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety [1990].
Speaker 2: Yeah, no--
Speaker 1: --for the book.
Speaker 2: --we were here then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were in Atlanta [Georgia] by then.
Speaker 2: We were in Atlanta then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, so, was your, your husband [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams] appointed the bishop of the--of the southern region of--
Speaker 2: Of, of Georgia.
Speaker 1: Of Georgia, okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: We stayed here for four years and then he was appointed bishop of South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were here in Atlanta for four years and from '88 [1988] to '92 [1992], I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then South Carolina.  Okay, and then South Carolina lasted from '92 [1992] to, was that--
Speaker 2: Eight years, 2000.
Speaker 1: To 2000?  Okay.  Now, now did he retire in 2000 or--
Speaker 2: No, 2004.  We went down to Florida for four years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, Florida.  All right.  So, I don't want to gallop through it, but--so, well, tell us what, what happened in Atlanta?  You, you were here for four years and you were here--well, you were here during the time of the Olympic Games [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia] I guess in Atlanta--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: No, no, the Olympic Games--
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: --were after we were gone.  We were in--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --South Carolina then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  All right.
Speaker 2: We came back for the Olympic Games, though.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: As--in fact, my husband was on the Olympics' committee, the organizing committee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maynard Jackson was pre- was the mayor and he appointed him to the committee, and he enjoyed it.  He had to, to get off of it when we, we moved to South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Now, how is Atlanta different from D.C. in terms of how--
Speaker 2: Very much the same, very, very much the same.  I used to say the only difference is the location.  You can--you can go out every night to some different affair or--there's an invitation to, to a benefit or a concert or--there's always something going on.  There's a lot of interaction in both communities.  There--Atlanta is much more integrated than was Washington, but I, I, I--really, I was surprised when I got to Atlanta.  I didn't, didn't feel at all--very much different.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did, did you take on any additional organizational responsibilities here?
Speaker 2: No, (laughter) I didn't.  I did ITC [Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia] and I learned to work with the--I worked with the, the missionary society [Women's Missionary Society] and, of course, with, with--by that time, my children were all in college.  But, no, I did not.  I had--I, I was lucky enough by that time to have grandchildren, so I was sort of enjoying the new ones.  We were living here and my daughter [Jann H. Adams] who teaches at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] had two boys.  She has three boys now, and I got to play, play grandmother and enjoy them.
Story_ID: 632258
Speaker 1: Now, what about South Carolina?  Was he [Adams' husband, HistoryMaker John Hurst Adams] in Columbia [South Carolina] or--
Speaker 2: Columbia.
Speaker 1: Columbia, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  We lived in Columbia, and if I had known better, I would've lived in Charleston [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Charleston is beautiful.  Ever been to Charleston?
Speaker 1: No, I haven't.
Speaker 2: Oh, you must.  Oh, you have missed half of life.  Charleston is one, one of the most--and you're talking about culture.  The low country of Charlest- of South Carolina, which is Charleston, Beaufort, all that area, and, and, and the islands.  We still go to, to Kiawah [Kiawah Island, South Carolina] once a year.  People came over from West Africa to work in the rice fields and they have kept many of their traditions.  They still--they speak with the same accents.  Their worship services are very much--I love to go to church down there.  They sing very robust, very different.  The, the beat is different.  It's--went to funerals in, in--on Johns Island [South Carolina], which is right out, out of Charleston, and if somebody's on the program, they don't sit in the front.  They sit way in the back and they start singing all the way from the back to the front.  I said you can't be on the program unless you can sing, I guess, 'cause--so I couldn't be on those programs 'cause I sure can't sing.  But, they would start at the back and sing until they got to the front, and the people would sing with them.  It's the most interesting thing, very traditional.  They're very nice.  I enjoyed it.
Story_ID: 632259
Speaker 1: The A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --has a reputation in the black community of being a more staid kind of a church experience.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.  Traditional.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, traditional, staid, I, I guess, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, that's the, the same difference.
Speaker 1: But the tradition that you're describing, the, the Gullah tradition and the--
Speaker 2: That's the Gullah tradition.
Speaker 1: That's a--that's a African--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --derived--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: --traditions of--in, in the churches.  It's a lot--you said it's a lot more robust, I think you said it was and--has there, there ever been any discussion in the A.M.E. church about the, the tone of the church and, and its--
Speaker 2: Well, various, various local churches--well, local churches vary in the way that they do the order of service.  The order of service is the same in all of our churches, but we are evolving as culture evolves.  As younger people come in, they demand a more--a different kind of, of music and service, and so many of those churches are complying.  There are some of the older churches who are struggling and fighting to stay as it has been.  So, there's a--there's a, a discussion, let us say, within the church about it, but I think it, it really, it depends upon the local churches.
Story_ID: 632260
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything else about South Carolina you, you want to mention before we go to Jacksonville [Florida]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I enjoyed South Carolina.  We started a, a--there was a, a building and an institution that the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church ran in Charleston [South Carolina] called the Reid center [Reid House of Christian Services, Charleston, South Carolina], which was a social service entity.  I served on a--the, the McClendon County Health Services [ph.], which was a state agency, and we did funding, which resulted in the first adoption center operated by black people in the State of South Carolina, was operated out of that Reid Center in South Carolina.  I, I was very proud of that, that social adoption agency, and adoption became one of our prime programs.  We ended up having many women in our missionary society who not only did adoptions, they did--they brought kids into their homes on temporary basis, but a lot of them did adoptions.  Families did two or three kids because we found that the--that the placement agencies in South Carolina were really not having a good time--were not able to place black kids, and we made it a, a stellar thing.  We had adoption days and all that kind of stuff, and the agency in, in Columb- in Charleston did an exceptionally good job with that. (Cough) The other thing we did was a health component where we--the senator from South Carolina at that time had cancer and there was a cancer institute at the University of--Medical University of South Carolina [Charleston, South Carolina], and what we had was a mobile unit, which went to communities that were unserved or underserved, rural communities in South Carolina.  They gave free mammograms, lung x-rays, and high blood pressure, those kinds of, of tests to recipients of--and, and they, they congregated at the churches, but anybody who wanted--needed them got them for free.  And this was a mobile unit which was provided really by the, the count- the federal government, but operated by our church.

Speaker 1: You move to Jacksonville [Florida] in 2000, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So--well, tell us about that experience.
Speaker 2: Well, Jacksonville was different.  I'd never been--lived in Florida.  The nicest thing about Jacksonville, it's near the water and I love the water.  The school there was Edward Waters [Edward Waters College, Jacksonville, Florida].  I did not work at, at Edward Waters.  I, I did volunteer work while I was there, but basically--and, and that was simply tutoring.  But, basically, Florida was a large state to cover and from Jacksonville to, to Atlanta--I mean, to Miami [Florida] or from Jacksonville to Pensacola [Florida] was eight to ten--nine hours' drive.  So, I, I basically worked with the missionary societies.  I set up two annual workshops, one for the minis- three, I'm sorry, one with the young people.  We had there what we called a heritage day and all of our young people from across the state came really to, to explore their, their African American heritage and to talk about who they were, where they came from to do competitions, and some of them wrote poems and they brought them there for competitions or they wrote stories or they did dance or music, but it was a--an annual two or three day event, which was really very exceptional.  We also did a retreat with our young people.  These were generally high school and college age young people where we talked about developing college skills, developing--for those who were not going to college, life skills.  We even did, did things on, on the use of contraceptives and family planning.  We had workshops for the minis- for the ministers and their wives, couples workshop, and that one was, was probably the most interesting of all of them, and we--as I said, we had the Women's Missionary Society workshops.  And the one with the ministers was, was funny because we always brought in consultants and then we would have a, a, a session when we worked with--when I worked with them alone, with the women, and afterwards, my husband [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams] and I would work with the whole group together, and one of the ministers was really irate and he stood up and he said, "Bishop, I don't know where you got these consultants from, but one of them told my wife that she needed to have her own bank account."  I said, "I don't know which consultant you're talking about.  It was probably me."  He said, "I don't understand that."  I said, "Well, let me explain it to you.  Your wife's an adult.  She's not a child.  If she does not work out of the home, she's working."  I said, "I think there's something demeaning about a full grown woman, woman having to go to a man and say, 'I wanna buy a pair of stockings.'"  I said, "I think a woman ought to be able to have her own money.  Now, I know that she's not gonna have as much as you have since you're the homeowner, but if this is a partnership, then she ought to be treated as a partner, not as a child."  Well, he was ticked with me (laughter).  I heard about that.  Everybody laughed about it.  They said he was speaking what a lot of folk thought, and I did not realize it, that many of the men felt, since I'm the wage earner, I'm supposed to take care of the money.  I said, "Well, you know, I want my husband to take care of the money but not because he's the man but because he does well with money.  We'd be in--on welfare if I'd been taking care of the money.  I know I don't know how to do that.  But, I don't think that, that--I'm not gonna give him the, the house to run 'cause we also wouldn't have--get--have everything to eat if he was doing it, but I think that everybody has their own strengths but you still respect the fact that this other person is an adult."  But, that was one of our little glitches in the, the system.  Our, our men really had problems with, "I'm in charge."

Speaker 1: You were in Jacksonville [Florida] until 2004, was it?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then what was the next move?
Speaker 2: Here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He, he retired and we came back to Atlanta [Georgia] to live.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, since you've been retired, I, I know you haven't stopped getting involved.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So, so what have you been involved in here?
Speaker 2: Well, two things, The Links [The Links, Incorporated] and the Black Women's Agenda [Black Women's Agenda, Inc.].  I don't think I mentioned that.  I joined it in '83 [1983]--no, I joined it in '86 [1986] when we were leaving Washington [D.C.], and I was president of the Black Women's Agenda for five years and chairman of their luncheon for I think six or seven years.  We have an annual luncheon as a part of the Black Caucus [Congressional Black Caucus] weekend in Washington, and the Friday is the, the Black Women's Agenda luncheon [Black Women's Agenda Symposium Luncheon].  We've had people--well, we, we try to invite black women who are outstanding from Condoleezza Rice to this year, we had [HistoryMaker] Valerie Jarrett, those kinds of folk to be our speakers, and we give awards to women who have excelled in particular areas, health, education, economic development, and to one bright futures, which is generally a high school or college student.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, now, now--well, tell us a little bit about, well, Black Women's Agenda, when, when it was started and, and what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, Black Women's Agenda, it was started as a part of the, the international year of the woman [International Women's Year]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when it was--then, the first meeting in the international year of the--of the woman was in Mexico City [Mexico] and there was no inclusion of black women in the plan of action.  So, the next meeting was in Houston, Texas.  By that time, ten women from the Washington area had gotten together and decided that they were going to present a black women's plan of action.  They did.  I don't know whether you've heard the name Ersa Poston [Ersa H. Poston]?  She was in the--I think she was in the Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] administration.  She was one of the founding members.  Anyway, these women presented their fam- their plan of action at--Coretta Scott King, as a matter of fact, read it for them, read it on the floor, got the floor because, you know, you had to, to be a name or to be recognized, to be recognized in the sessions, and she was recognized, and as a result read the plan, and the plan was accepted.  And from that, the women came back and formed what was called the Black Women's Agenda.  And we have since affiliated with twelve of the largest black women's organizations in America, sororities, AKA's [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], Links, Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.], Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.], Girl Friends [The Girl Friends, Inc.], those kinds of organizations, and church women's organizations.  And we meet once a year with these organizations at--during the black caucus and we have this particular luncheon also as a part of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, what--does Links have an official relationship with [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Height's organization--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --the National Council [National Council of Negro Women]?
Speaker 2: Un-un.  No, we never did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Is there a reason why--for that or it's just--
Speaker 2: I can tell you that but I can't tell you that on the--on the record because it's speculation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think that our founders and Dorothy Height got along very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so they--and they were both coming along about the same time, and for some reason, they just never--we were never a part of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: But, now, we've honored Dorothy Height.  There was no animosity--there has not been any animosity, but they just--we just never had a, a--we never affiliated with her organization.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just wondered.  I just wondered what--yeah--but, there's room for lots of organizations--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and lots of work to be done.
Story_ID: 632263
Speaker 1: What else in Atlanta [Georgia] since you've been--
Speaker 2: Since I've been--?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, basically, now I'm trying to slow down.  My husband [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams] flunked retirement and I still have to follow him, you know, and we, we have gotten to the point neither of us like to fly anymore so we drive and my fas- as I said, my favorite places are Kiawah [Kiawah Island, South Carolina] and Fort Walton Beach [Florida], so every time I get a chance, that's where we're going, but generally, he still goes to a lot of meetings and I go with him to some.  I still go to a lot of Links [The Links, Incorporated] meetings and I'm going to Liberia in--at the end of January with that delegation.  But, I find enough to do, believe me.
Story_ID: 632264
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back over everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you've done that you would--or that happened that you would go back and change?
Speaker 2: That I'd go back and change. I don't know but I'm gonna think about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, if you come--you know.  Well, likewise, I guess, if you look back at everything to this point, what today would you consider or count as your legacy?
Speaker 2: My children.  I have three intelligent, articulate, socially aware, excellent parents- parenting daughters.  My oldest daughter, Gaye [Gaye Adams Massey], is a lawyer with United Healthcare [sic. UnitedHealth Group, Inc.].  She's general counsel.  And she has a dau- a daughter who is in San Francisco [California] and working on a Ph.D.  Her son who just finished Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], he's got a job working for Target [Target Corporation].  And then--and she has an--seven year old whom we adore who has just taken over the family.  She was the surprise in the family.  My middle daughter, Jann [Jann H. Adams], who I mentioned teaches at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], has a son who is a lawyer here--practicing here.  The other one, the second one, finishes University of California at San Francisco [University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California] this summer, and the youngest one is a sophomore at UVA, University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia].  Madelyn [Madelyn R. Adams] is an executive with Kaiser Permanente, and she has two sons, one who will--Avery [Avery Cobb] who will finish high school this year and the other is T.J. [Timothy Cobb, Jr.], and T.J. is in sixth grade, and he takes care of all the electronics for the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Every time my--whatever goes wrong, computer, Kindle [Amazon Kindle], you name it, I, I don't call--I don't have to pay for anybody, I just call T.J.  He comes and takes care of it.  He makes me feel like I'm about two years old, but it's all right (laughter).
Speaker 1: A future engineer, I guess.
Speaker 2: I don't (laughter) know, but he loves to tinker and he d- and he understands them, so it's fine with me.
Story_ID: 632265
Speaker 1: The next question was actually tell us something about your family, but you've already done that now, so (laughter), in the legacy question, but is, is there anything I haven't asked you about that you think we need to cover before I ask my last question?  Oh, there is something else.  There is something else I didn't ask about.  We always ask this.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I am deeply concerned about the violence in the African American community.  I'm, I'm, I'm concerned about the fact that we have children rearing children and you, you look at, at some of the things that have happened and you see tragedies and then you see the age of the mothers and grandmothers, who are hard- hardly old enough to be adults and they've got children that they're trying to raise, and you see young single parents.  The state of the black community in terms of family is what bothers me more than anything else.  I--now, I realize that, that institutional religion, denominational religion is going out.  People are going into all sorts of churches, but I'm not sure that these churches are teaching the kind of values that help our young people to understand how they're supposed to--what they're supposed to be doing with their children, what they're supposed to be teaching their children.  Because I don't think that these are--the children who are getting into trouble are bad children, I think they're children like the kids who were with the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party].  Those were not bad kids, but they also came from middle class homes, most of them, so they were not doing bad things.  They were doing things that society did not improve of or, or perceived as not what they should've been doing.  But, what's happening today, now, the gangs that these kids are getting into are entirely different from the gangs that, that--of the Black Panthers or those kinds of organizations.  And they're destructive, but they're self-destructive 'cause they're killing themselves as well as other people.  The--that bothers me most about the black community.  I think that the other thing that bothers me is the school system.  I think that America is moving toward the point where they don't want to really provide public schools for our children, and they certainly don't want to provide quality public schools 'cause they don't wanna--the general population does not want to finance them.  And I think that if we have poor schools and families who do not--who are not able or do not know how to parent, you--we're, we're heading down a, a very slippery slope and it bothers me.
Story_ID: 632266
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything else we haven't covered that we need to discuss before I ask my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 1: --last question.
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'd like to be remembered as John's [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams] wife and Madelyn [Madelyn R. Adams] and Jann's [Jann H. Adams] mama.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's fine.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Thank you.  Madelyn, Jann, and Gaye [Gaye Adams Massey].  I didn't say Gaye.  Put all three of them in there.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).

Speaker 1: That's my wedding picture.  My husband and I in the center.  His mother [Charity Nash Adams] is next to me and my mother is next to him.
Speaker 2: That picture was taken at Paul Quinn College [Waco, Texas; Dallas, Texas] probably around 1974.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Do you know the occasion?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the girl in the center, Carol Lee [ph.], is the girl we brought from Los Angeles [California] to go to Paul Quinn, and she was Miss Paul Quinn that year.

Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  That's my job now as uncle.
Speaker 1: Is it (laughter)?  Well, I want you to know I don't have to shop anymore (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Simultaneous) (Unclear) spend their money, right?
Speaker 1: They're just happy.  "You just give us a check."
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yep.  That's the most appreciated.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Now, that's the year Gaye graduated from--now, Gaye is the one in the blue to the right.  She had just graduated from Wellesley [Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts], and Jann [Jann H. Adams], the one here in the left in the jeans, had just finished high school.  She was going away to Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio].  My mother is next to Jann, my husband and I, and this is Madelyn [Madelyn R. Adams], the baby, at the front.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, what's your mother's name?
Speaker 1: Her name was Thelma [Thelma Tucker Smith].  That was taken on our patio in Waco, Texas.
Speaker 2: Some people say Wacko (laughter).
Speaker 1: Wacko? Well, that might've been a more--(laughter).
Speaker 2: This is a tough one to shoot.  I don't know how--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I will start with the--I guess, your husband on the left.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  That was taken in San Antonio, Texas, somewhere around '74 [1974].  He had just become a bishop and we were trying to determine what we were supposed to be doing.
Speaker 1: What about this one?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  The one on the right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's me.  I was just--that was--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Same, same occasion.
Speaker 1: --same, same occasion.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's Gaye at graduation from Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], see with that big bush that was in.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Oh, yeah, 1970.
Speaker 1: Yes.

Speaker 1: And that's my husband in, in Waco, probably some--sometime in the '70s [1970s], '74 [1974], '75 [1975].
Speaker 2: That must've been around '86 [1986] because that was at the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution] in Washington [D.C.].  They gave a reception for me when I came out as president of The Links [The Links, Incorporated].  And that is my family who was there.  The, the extreme right is my husband's brother, Avery [Eugene Avery Adams, Jr.], and the son, Avery, Jr. [Eugene Avery Adams, III], and his wife and daughter, and the daughter's husband.  And then my daughter, Gaye, me, my daughter's husband, Harold [ph.], my husband, and Amina.
Speaker 1: And that's the, the portrait I gave my husband when we were engaged.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, got it.
