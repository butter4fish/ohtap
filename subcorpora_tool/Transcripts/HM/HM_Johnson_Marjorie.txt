Speaker 1: Before we get started into any kind of depth, we ask these five lightweight kind of questions as kind of a warm-up.  But the first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  My favorite food is fruits of any kind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  I like rose, pink/rose.  I, I like a combination of rose and blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Oh, as a rule, I like April because it's a little between summer and the finishing off of winter.  But March is, is the, is the year I was born in and so, but that has nothing to do with my favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no vacation excepting right now, I'd give anything to have a vacation in, in the West anywhere, in the far West or the Middle West.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Hmm, I can't think of any at the moment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, if we think of one, we can go back to it, I guess.
Speaker 2: All right.  I guess you can because I think of several phrases (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 361243
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  We'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Pearl Johnson [sic. Pearl Pryor Witt].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, since I'm doing some writing with my daughter, can I refer to her a couple of times to have her fill me in because I've been giving her some of this information that you're asking?
Speaker 1: Well, I'd like for you to tell me as much as you know, and if there's a date or a name that you wanted to chime me in with, she can, you can refer to her.
Speaker 2: Are you nearby, Corri [Corrine Johnson Falope]?
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right, because you know there are a couple of phrases--I've been doing a lot of this thinking that you're giving me with her because she's been wanting some of these things answered.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your mother's name was Pearl Johnson and--
Speaker 2: Mel-, yes.
Speaker 1: Was it--
Speaker 2: Melvina--wasn't that, Corinne?
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Mel-, Melvina Pryor--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  --Pryor.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Pearl Melvina Pryor?  How do you spell Pryor?
Speaker 1: P-R-Y-O-R.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Then she married my, my father, William Witt.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And what is your mother's birthday?
Speaker 1: Her--
Speaker 2: Birthday?
Speaker 1: I don't really know it.  Corrine, do you know it 'cause she's doing--I can't, I couldn't give you the date.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And where was she born, do you know?
Speaker 1: Born in Indiana.
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  What do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How much do you know about them?
Speaker 2: Well, the most I know is that she came from a pretty large family.  And some of its members became famous, famous, and the others were just good strong citizens in, in that part of the country, Terre Haute, Indiana.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Mother, tell them about Uncle Hayes [Hayes Pryor].
Speaker 2: And Uncle Hayes was a part of the Lafayette Player [Lafayette Players] in New York [New York], and he did many Shakespearean plays.  And it's written up, and it's--he chided me with the fact that I might be a good actress, but he didn't think New York was the place for me at the time that I went.  So I didn't get to try for anything, but I get, I did get to see him play in several Shakespearean plays in, at, in New York.  And I got to see the Players, the Lafayette Players, as they was a dramatic group in New York.   They did several plays in, on Broadway.
Speaker 1: Now, what was Uncle Hayes' last name?  Was it Pryor?  Was it--
Speaker 2: Yes, Hayes Pryor.
Speaker 1: Okay, Hayes Pryor, okay.
Speaker 2: P-R-Y-O-R (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hayes Pryor, okay, all right.  Any other information about your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well, I know mostly about him because he would (unclear), but she had two or three brothers.  And she had a sister, Lydia [ph.], who was very fair, and very interested in education.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did you mother talk about growing up at all?
Speaker 2: Yes, she talked a great deal about Hayes, her brother, and what his aspirations were, and how they all envied him because he got the break he got in New York when they were from Indiana.  And, of course, she tried, but he sent her home because he felt that New York was no place for a young woman.  And then she got a job in a department store in New York before she left.  But eventually, she did return back to Indiana, and that's when she met my father when he came out (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 361244
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: Yes, because, apparently, my father [William Witt], and I guess his story comes most clearly to me because she [Johnson's mother, Pearl Pryor Witt] often talked about, when he rode up on a horse, 'cause he was in training at that time.  I've forgotten the year, I can't recall the year.  But he, he had been in a family in Norfolk, Virginia.  And he left it, and we don't know whether the family was intact or not.  I only can tell by the way he, he looked, and the way he talked that he hadn't had much education.  But he was a very good looking, rather medium-size stock man, had blue eyes, and red hair.  And, of course, mother thought that he, he can't, that the family must have been mixed.  But he never talked about the family, and we don't know much about my father--I mean, yes, his, his background.  But she says, "I like him because he, he seems to be steady.  He's got a sense of humor."  But his, but her mother, Melvina Pryor, didn't favor him.  She said, "He looks like a country bumpkin with his fair skin and his blue eye."  And she said, "I still like him," and she said, "Mel, if I, if I do decide to marry him, my kids will, will be a, a rainbow then 'cause, 'cause he, he's got the color, his red hair and his blue eyes, and he was well--he's strongly built."  She seemed to like him because she said, "There's a freshness about him that I like, and, and, and he has a sense of humor."  Mother--his--her mother said, "He's a bumpkin.  And I, I, I don't like him," but he--she decided, in her own mind that, that's the kind of guy she wanted to marry--if she married him.  And he kept coming to visit her, and he always came riding on a horse because he was in training.  And he had a lot of things that he was doing in, for his training, and one of them was the horseback riding.  And he always came in there because she enjoyed seeing him ride up on the horses, on a horse, and said he came to see Pearly.  That's what he called her, Pearly, and eventually, she did marry him.
Story_ID: 361245
Speaker 1: Now, your father's name was William Witt, right?
Speaker 2: William, correct me, because she's done some work to find out if his name was correct.  What was that name that you found, Corrine [Corrine Johnson Falope]?
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Was it Henry?
Speaker 2: Huh, Witt?
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Henry?
Speaker 2: Yes, Henry, that's right, William Henry Brown Witt.
Speaker 1: Henry Brown?
Speaker 2: Yes, and there was a question around that, that Brown, but he was--has--it was William Henry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And like so many of the southerners that came up, and he said he was born in the South.  And mother [Pearl Pryor Witt] said, some, some little, country hick town in, in Virginia, but he never talked about a city or place or town.  And she felt that he had probably had, had run 'cause he hadn't gone further than, I guess, the third or fourth grade.  But she liked him because of the flair--his, his hair being red, his eyes being blue, a sense of humor and, and sounded like a steady-going guy, she thought.  And she did marry him, and he panned out to be just what she thought.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now he was in the--so he didn't talk about his family much or where he came from (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: But he was in the--was he in the 10th Cavalry [10th Cavalry Regiment] or the--
Speaker 2: Yes, he was in the 10th Cavalry, right.
Speaker 1: All right, all right.
Speaker 2: And Corrine has found by looking it up that his name was, was listed there.  And, and, and he was--they gave an extensive history on him.  And he asked for a leave at one time when he was in the [U.S.] Army.  And that's documented and all because we had been looking it up a lot because we wanted to know more about him.
Speaker 1: And the 10th Calvary, they're known--I think the 9th [9th Cavalry Regiment] and the 10th were known as the Buffalo Soldiers.
Speaker 2: That's right.  And he was in--I'm not sure.  Did we ever focus it, Corrine?  Was it the 10th or the 9th I'd--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  I have to check the notes.  We have a friend that actually went on the Internet.
Speaker 2: Okay.  They do have the members listed.  Some of them were listed on the internet, right.
Speaker 1: Oh, he's listed, and he was listed as a cook.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  And he served in the Spanish American War, I've read.  Is that true?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, he did.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  And the Philippines.
Speaker 2: And the Philippines?
Speaker 1: And he fought there, too, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You know, they, the U.S. government was trying to--yeah, he was in the Philippines and the Spanish American War, right.  Did he have any stories about the war that he told?
Speaker 1: Oh, many times.  He used to sit at the table in, in Cheyenne [Wyoming].  He used to talk about the Army, but talked about the Philippines.  And he had learned to speak Spanish and he spoke it fluently.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Did he, did he know, did he ever mention Colonel Charles Young?
Speaker 1: Oh, many times.  In fact, because mother was in a different status than he, educationally, she had gotten, so she could talk with some of the wives of the officers.  And they favored her because she was--had a, had a way of speaking, and a way of talking that interested people.  And she often talked about him and his, his, the way of speaking and, and her way of speaking.  And she got to know many of the, the wives of the, of, of the Army.  And they always deferred to her, "Well, let's have Pearl, Pearl Witt."  And, no, and so, of course, she bridged the gap socially, and, and he was always a steady standby.  And I wondered, I used to often ask her, "Why, if you've been to New York [New York] and all that, why did you want to marry a guy had--didn't have as much education as you?"  She--, "I just liked the way he looked, I liked the way he talked, and I liked his being down to earth."
Speaker 2: Now, how much education did your mother have?  So, she went to school.
Speaker 1: Oh, she, oh, yeah, she went to school, probably went to high school.  We don't know what grade she went to, but I know that she, she had more education than he did.
Speaker 2: Okay, you know, graduated from high school was real good in those days.
Speaker 1: Well, I think that she had that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I remember the members of her family--all of them had, had more education than we ever knew what he had.  We say he had the less, the lesser of the two.  She--he had the least education.
Speaker 2: Now, did he fight in the Spanish American War prior to them getting married or after they got married?  Do you know?
Speaker 1: He was in it at the time, he was in it.
Speaker 2: Oh, about the time that they got married?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It was in time of the--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, they got married in the 1890s (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In that, in that period of time.
Speaker 2: --eighteen ninety-five [1895] or thereabouts?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.  Long enough for him to have picked up the language and he could speak it well.  Apparently, he had gone on and had, had what he needed to have, and we don't know.  There's a cloud around his education.
Story_ID: 361246
Speaker 1: Now, how did the family get to Cheyenne, Wyoming?
Speaker 2: Well, he had--once they, they got married, she had, was on the, on, on target to have to go from place to place because they were, as, as he [Johnson's father, William Witt] was beginning, he was no officer, as he's a part of the [U.S.] Army, he had to go wherever they were stationed.  And as they were going into that part of the country where they were having to fight the Indians [Native Americans] and, and having to be a part of, of the westward ho cavalries that were going on at the time.  And they got the guys in the Army to, to help settle, and help go, as they were assigned to places in the West.  And mother [Pearl Pryor Witt] had--the first child she had became very ill, and they didn't get the kind of treatment he needed, and he died.  And I've forgotten what his name was, but that was the first one.  And she felt that if she's going, if they were going to make it, she--they needed to go to a place where they could be stand and station.  So, from place to place, as he was assigned in the Army, after the death of the first child, and then, then my oldest brother, William Witt [William P. Witt], was born.  She said, "I want to know if we can stay in one of these towns that we are assigned to."  And he said, "All right, Pearly, we will, well, we will start."  And he started working on getting a more stationary place to live.  And then, that's when he discovered Cheyenne.  And he liked that because they had barracks, and it had some buildings and things that he, he thought, if they could have it--well, could, he could get a good home for her.  And the officers, some of those officers that wives who knew her, liked the way she talked, and they liked her airiness.  And, and, and they felt sorry for things that had happened to her with her first-born.  So, when Billy was born, he got a lot--she got a lot of attention and, and built relationships with many of the officers' wives.  And when they got--hit the Cheyenne, she said I--she then told him that was a good place to stop, and, and to start.  And she liked to stay there if it was possible for him to arrange it.  And so, I guess he did.  And he was able to get a place, and he said, they had barracks there.  And he said, "And when, maybe we can get you into one of those good barracks."  And momma, mother, with her way of looking out for herself as well as her own, her own children--in particular, the second child.  And when Billy was born, he, he was born in Cheyenne.  And she decided that's where they were going to stay.  And as time went on, they were, she was able to get into one of the barracks.  I never shall forget the number of it.  It was number 62 and it was a beautiful brick, red building in, in one, in the, the, in the post where they stayed, and she made that her home.  And that's how she got with her relationship with women in liking her, and the wives wanting her to get a better deal than she had previously.  It, it may, it came out that she was able to feel free to try to get a better place to live.  And so, for the first year, they did get a nice place in Cheyenne to live.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was born there.  And that's where Billy and I--well, the two of the younger ones first, and then later on, she had the other two.  And, and all of us were--I was not born there.  I was born in one of the town- one of the townhouses that he was first assigned to.  But the others, when Dorothy [Dorothy Witt King] and Teenie [Christine Witt Gaines] were born, they were born in the barracks of Fort D.A. Russell [Fort David A. Russell; Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming] in, in Cheyenne, and that's where we made our home.
Story_ID: 361247
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the--who the officers were or who some of the other men in--
Speaker 2: Colonel Young [Charles Young], I remember her talking, she [Johnson's mother, Pearl Pryor Witt] talked about Colonel Young--forgetting some of the others which I've heard her speak of them.  As I grew up in Cheyenne [Wyoming], I remember when she talked about her own life in the [U.S.] Army, and, and how she said it was bad at first, but then, it got better.  And daddy [William Witt] was always on the lookout for getting something better.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did they actually have to fight the Indians [Native Americans] out there?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, he fought the Indians.  He was a part of the, of the group that had to go forward, and, and I, I can't remember all of the names.  Sometimes when I think about it, and it in bits, when I, when Mother was living, I remember her talking about Daddy and the Indians, but not about any open com- you know, combat or anything of that sort.  But, but he was a part of the Army that had to put down rebellions of the Indians as they moved west.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any stories about Colonel Charles Young that your mother or father told that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, May Stewart [ph.] said she talked about those, these women, and I had pictures for a while of her being in the company of these women when they came to visit her because of their association in the Army.  And, and because of her background and all, yes, there were times they talked, but I can't recall too much of them, I guess.  I recall most of the relationships when we were established at Fort D.A. Russell [Fort David A. Russell; Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming] because it was there when she had, had the, Dorothy [Dorothy Witt King] and Teenie [Christine Witt Gaines], the two girls.  And, and like she said, they were--we were a rainbow family.  Billy [William P. Witt] was one color, and I was another color, and, and Teenie and Dorothy were very, very fair with blue eyes and brown hair.
Story_ID: 361248
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd say my earliest is at Fort D.A. Russell [Fort David A. Russell; Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming].  I don't remember too much that little place we lived in, in Cheyenne [Wyoming].  When we first, when he [Johnson's father, William Witt] settled in Cheyenne, because he was not an officer, he wasn't assigned a, a place at the fort.  But later on, he did get it, but in the beginning, he didn't.  And the earliest I can recall was in this little house that we lived in, and that was before mother [Pearl Pryor Witt] had the other two children.  But I, I do recall quite a bit of, of, of the living in, in Cheyenne and the place, and he had, and the, the stairs, and the hardwood floors, and the fireplace.  I remember those--those are my earliest recall of really living in a house because the place we came to when he was first settled there, was a, was in the town on the, on the outside of Cheyenne.  And I can't recall much of it, just that it was a house, and that I'd play with the kids around there.  And there were no early stories because Mother was so unhappy that she wasn't in the, in the officers, you know, in--at the fort.  And I, I could guess, I can't remember it because this wasn't too much of a response.  But when she got into the Fort D.A. Russell, many stories I can think of there.  And then, she got to know people who lived in Cheyenne because she'd made friends when we first got there.  So, it was a little bit of the outskirts of Cheyenne, and a whole big bit of the Fort D.A. Russell.
Story_ID: 361249
Speaker 1: Do you remember the sights and sounds and smells of the fort when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I, I remember a lot about that, but I can't remember, nor can I recall too much of the, the house we lived in, in Cheyenne [Wyoming].  It's, it's certain that she was displeased--mother [Pearl Pryor Witt] was, and didn't like it, so I guess I didn't like it because she didn't like it.  But at any rate, I can recall the hardwood floors, the steps, the fireplace, and, and then, there was a place underneath the, the big porch where we used, where I used to dig in the earth there.  And I can remember all of those things, but and, of that house.  But I can't remember the others, the other place that we lived in there.  And I can remember her diffidence to these two little ones who came after we, after she got to Fort D.A. Russell [Fort David A. Russell; Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming].  She had Dorothy [Dorothy Witt King] and Teenie [Christine Witt Gaines].  And I'm, I'm, I'm remembering them and, and the attention she gave them and the care.  And I'm aware of all the--as an early youngster running around, her attention to both Dorothy and Teenie.  And I remember once trying to push one of them down the steps because she was always so busy with either one of them, you know.  And, and there was a lot of cleavage in my mind as I look back when we moved to Fort D.A. Russell, but I dearly loved the single bedroom that I had and, and the little bedroom that they had, and long stairs, and most of all, the fireplace at Christmastime--great memories.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  What about the outdoors?  I think he said sights and sounds and smells.  What about--did you talk about sage brush and those mountains?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes, I was always impressed with that, even when I lived, we lived in downtown.  Whenever we'd go out somewhere, it was seeing the, the mountains in the distance, and I just loved, I just loved the whole big bit of Wyoming, and I could see it.  And, and I hated this, the winters 'cause they were cold and the snow was deep.  But I do, I do recall a great deal of the, of the, the surroundings of the mountains in the distance.  And, and particular with the, the way the, the teachers around this school would talk about this great, great West that we lived in, and, and I just took a great deal of pride in being in the West.
Story_ID: 344205
Speaker 1: Ma'am, you were describing the scenic beauty of Wyoming--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the mountains, and what color were the mountains?
Speaker 2: Oh, the mountains, to me, were always brown, deep brown, and, and they, they, and that because I could always see them in the distance.  And my wish, always was, from a kid up, to get a chance to go to those mountains.  And I was very pleased when I got into high school [Cheyenne High School; Cheyenne Central High School, Cheyenne, Wyoming] that I was able to, to, and graduating from a high school in Cheyenne [Wyoming] that I got a chance to be a, a, a saddle girl in a dude ranch in the mountains.  And I just loved being in the mountains.  It was great because I'd always sit on our porch and, and, and, or sit at, in, what, when we were in Fort D.A. [Fort David A. Russell; Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming], looking in the distance to, to the mountains, wishing I could get there or get up.  And, and, and some of the things I've written, and the things that I've done, I always think of the mountains and the blue, blue skies of Wyoming.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I love that part of the country.
Story_ID: 344206
Speaker 1: What about the other children, you know, that you played with?  Were they all black children or were they mixed or what?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Tell, tell them about the little Indian [Native American] girl.
Speaker 2: The Indian children, when I was young, when I, when we first went to the house in Cheyenne [Wyoming], and before we went to the fort [Fort David A. Russell; Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming], I can't remember too many of the children there, except that they were Chinese.  And they were because we went to Corlett School [Cheyenne, Wyoming] there.  And, and, and mixed groups were there--Chinese, and I remember two or three little Chinese girls, Indian little girls.  And many, many of the children who, of different, of, of black families, that were part of the [U.S.] Army, and they were not officers' wives.  It was mixed there.  And I could, I can recall vaguely some of that.  But when we got to Fort D.A. Russell, it was mostly officers' children.  And it was mostly kids who lived around the barracks there that were, were children that I played with and, and was a part of.  But it was mixed in the beginning, and then it became almost all white with a just a few different nationalities.  But, but sometimes there were different nationalities, who were foreigners, who were like Bohemian, Czechoslovakian, and that kind.  But it was, it, it was a kind of a mixed group all the way up, as I can recall it.  It's not, it was not ever just an all-black or all-Indian, or all anything.  It was always a mixture of different nationalities.
Speaker 1: And everybody went to school together?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they didn't have--was the Army segregated?  I know--well, I know the Army was segregated in those days, but tell us how that worked in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, it, it was segregated because, like he was a 9th [9th Cavalry Regiment]--what did you say, 9th or--
Speaker 1: Ninth or 10th Cavalry [10th Cavalry Regiment].
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was in that, and those were, and their wives, and they stayed together.  That was the part that stayed black 'cause stayed in the family thing.  But for the most part, as I, as I can recall, there were, were different nationalities.  And I can remember Marie Zernovich [ph.], I can remember Marie Belliki [ph.], and they were all Polish, and what-not.  This was mixed in that way, and there were some Indians.  When I had a little friend named Tacoma [ph.], she was a little Indian girl.  And, and that lady had married, that white lady married a, a, a black officer and so, there was mixture there, but the mixture came because of who the parents might be.  And, and, but it was never like an all-black class or an all--I can't ever recall in Cheyenne, from the time I was in the first grade on, on, until the time I graduated in high school [Cheyenne High School; Cheyenne Central High School, Cheyenne, Wyoming] having an, an all-black class.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was always mixed.
Story_ID: 344207
Speaker 1: Can you tell us some more about your friend, the little Indian [Native American] girl that was your friend?
Speaker 2: Well, Tacoma's [ph.] mother was black, and she, she had, she had, had married an Indian man.  And daddy [William Witt] used to always laugh--he says, "We're fighting them and, and, and yet, we're trying to be friends with them too."  He said, "Wow about that?"  And he'd laugh, he'd get tickled about the fact that Tacoma was mixed-Indian and mixed-black, but she claimed more her Indian heritage than she did the black, as I saw it.  But she came in and out of our house, and we played coming up.  And every now and then, there'd be a mixed black child who, who is mixed with the Indian, and you knew from their parents that, that was a mixture in a marriage.  And they tended to move toward or live nearby other people who were mixed parent- parentage, you know.  And it, it was a kind of mixed-up world on account--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Mother, talk about the time with the setting of the fire--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Oh, she asked about the setting of the fire or something, yeah.
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  --with the, with the little Indian girl.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.  Well, she had done said, she was, she, she would live in that community, which was between the City of Cheyenne [Wyoming] and Fort D.A. Russell [Fort David A. Russell; Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming].  When daddy decided he was going to get out of the [U.S.] Army, and get a job in Cheyenne because momma [Pearl Pryor Witt] wanted to settle there, he did--one of the two things, he was able to pick up his language of Spanish with the Spanish guys who were in there, who were working down in the Union Pacific [Union Pacific Railroad].  And, and he became very affluent [sic. fluent] in, in that language.  He could speak it just like any, any Mexican or any other, but he never learned any of the Indian language.  And, and I used to come and said, "Well, why don't you learn to speak the language that Tacoma's folks speak?"  He says, "Well, Tacoma's family is speaking English so, so I can't learn the Indian language."  And, but there was a mixed marriage, and we played together very often.  And as we played, there were times when I would challenge the little girl about fire--how she could make fire with a stone.  And, and, and I said, well, I can do better than that.  And so, I got a box of matches from the, from the kitchen, and I put the two heads together, and they spark.  But without realizing it, they got caught on the sage that was right on the--we lived, we lived on, between--when daddy got out of the Army, we lived in a place that was called Taylorville [Wyoming].  And a black man had established it.  And he had, for his people who lived there, a mixture of Indians married to blacks, and blacks married to whites.  It was a mixed community and--
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Well, we've lost the fire, come on.
Speaker 1: --and while he was going into the--my, my brother, Billy [William P. Witt], I didn't, haven't talked much about him.  Billy played with kids, mostly white, who were scouts, and he was a scout.
Story_ID: 344208
Speaker 1: But, at any rate, 'cause she's--I told that story about the fire, and to Corrine [Corrine Johnson Falope].  And so, I will tell you the piece of that because it was a, a shocking thing for me.  But it was--
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  So, so, the spark caught on fire.
Speaker 1: I took a match and, and, and put the two heads together, and, and I was trying to show off to Tacoma [ph.] that her stone wasn't so hot.  And, but to my dismay, the, the things got caught on the sagebrush, and it just started all over.  And since this place, where we lived in Taylorville [Wyoming], was between the fort [Fort David A. Russell; Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming] and Cheyenne [Wyoming] property, you'd have to see it to know because there is so much land out there.  But when I struck that match, it hit those, that sagebrush and, boy, it took off, and a fire started.  And it just went from one sagebrush to another, and the whole, the whole--
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Prairie.
Speaker 1: --prairie was on fire!  And the people that came from this little place where we lived: "Who has set that, what on earth?"  And then, they were looking at little gophers, and all were running out of their little holes in their yard.  And it was an ugly, ugly sight when that path of that--and they got a, "Who did, how did this happen?"  And then, Billy [William P. Witt] said--that's my brother--said, "Margie [HistoryMaker Marjorie Witt Johnson] did it, and she, she's messing with matches."  And I said, "No, no, it was Tacoma with a stone," but Tacoma said, "No, you're not going to put that on me, it was not me."  And, and, but anyway, they got it off.  And, but it had left a great big track where the sagebrush, when it, you know, with the wind and all, and it was ugly, ugly.  So, daddy [William Witt], when he came home and saw it, he had a fit because he, he enjoyed living in this little village that we had between Cheyenne and fort, where we used to live.  And he said, "I'm going to get my strap, and I'm going," and strap, and the, the man--black woman who had married the Indian [Native American].  He said, "No, don't do that, don't do that."  He said, "Just let it go."  He says, "This young lady, whenever she looks out, is going to see nothing, but a black, black road all the way up to Frontier Park [Cheyenne, Wyoming]."  So we lived in this prairie part, and we lived in a place that was much removed from Cheyenne, the city, and the fort, where we used to live.  And so, in between there, we were and that had black mark.  And he said, "It's going to be there," and he said, "I wouldn't whip her.  Every time she looks out, she is going to see all the black, and how the little gophers, and everybody lost their home and all."  And, and he, he loved the animals who lived underground.  And, and he said, "Just look how many had to be run out because of that fire."  And it was an ugly piece of land, all the way, and, and it blew because the wind took the sagebrush right along, and the fire went along with it.  So I, I can see to this day, I can see that black mark, and I, I think I, I had got my feel of matches anyway.  But that was one of the stories I told Corrine because that was one that I remembered, you know.  And she's urging me to just to mention it, but it, it was, it did happen.  And, and it's--was in this interracial-like little village that we lived in between the fort and, and the, and the, and the town.
Story_ID: 344209
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You said it was founded by a man named Taylor [Merritt L. Taylor]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was just--
Speaker 1: And what was his first name, do you know?
Speaker 2: Will Taylor [sic.], I think, I think it was Will--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but it was Taylorville [Wyoming].  And I've since tried to find it on the Internet, but I've never found it.  Did, did you ever find anything?
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  No, I don't think we tracked that down.
Speaker 2: We didn't trace it down but, but it was a part of the West that I remember.
Speaker 1: And he was black and--
Speaker 2: My father [William Witt] was black.
Speaker 1: No, Will Taylor--
Speaker 2: Oh, Will Taylor was black--
Speaker 1: --Will Taylor was black.
Speaker 2: --but he married a very, very fair-skinned white person.  I mean--
Speaker 1: Indian [Native American].
Speaker 2: --yeah, an Indian.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, the town, most of the people that lived in town were mixed with black and Indian?
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  That's interesting.
Speaker 2: --they did intermarry a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did, did you ever see--I know they called the 9th [9th Cavalry Regiment] and 10th Calvary [10th Cavalry Regiment], the Buffalo Soldiers, but did you ever see a buffalo out there?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes, yes.  And there's a--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE): But tell him how they weren't roaming.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  You know, how they did not roam, like in the story, in the song.
Speaker 2: Yeah, what were the buffalo like?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, I've seen them with that big bushy part of the head and the, the thin legs and, and all.  And, but most of what I remember of them is, when they were at Frontier Park [Cheyenne, Wyoming], when they had the wild west shows, they always had buffalos.  And the men tried to wrestle with them and, and try to use the lasso to, to catch them, and to bring them, you know, to, to the earth with their, their, that big, bushy head.  But if you read any of the stories, they have many, many stories about the buffalo.  It said that, that they looked so much--their, their bushy hair was like the black men who were in the infantries and what-not.
Story_ID: 344210
Speaker 1: When the black men came into town [Taylorville, Wyoming], where Indians [Native Americans] were, they thought some of them were so kind.  As I said, they married, intermarried quite a bit, and it was a mixture.  And if anything, the Buffalo Soldiers represented was kindness and, and, and they said that they will be, be Buffalo Soldiers.  We, we like them, and that's why they did intermarry and what-not.  But for the, for the--I guess, just to share knowledge of living in the West, many of the men took to Indian women or vice versa.  The Indian men were like, with Tacoma [ph.], had, had, was married to, to, he was married to a colored woman, you know.
Speaker 2: Now, I know--I don't know if tribe is the right word to use, but what were some of the Indian groups that were there?  I mean, what group of Indians was present?
Speaker 1: The Sioux.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I, I've forgotten the names of some of them.  In fact, I never even bothered to think of what the names of the groups were.
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  We haven't researched that.
Speaker 1: And I hadn't tried to tell Corrine [Corrine Johnson Falope]--I was telling some of the stories.  I couldn't recall whatever, where they came from or what-not, but I know that there was mixture.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I know Tacoma was the one little Indian.  I remember one other Indian boy, but mostly the, the Indian kids I knew were into their families, and they were close to, to each other in the family.  They didn't hang out, like you say, with us--
Story_ID: 344211
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school you went to?
Speaker 2: Well, when I lived in the place in Cheyenne [Wyoming], before we went to the, before we went out to, before we went out to Taylorville [Wyoming], we lived in town.  I went to Corlett School [Cheyenne, Wyoming] and there--
Speaker 1: Cor-, how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: C-O-R-L-E-T-T.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was a mixture of a school.  It was with kids of every, every, they were from all over the world, were there.  And I remember it, but I was too young to remember very much.  And since mom [Pearl Pryor Witt] was so happy to get out, and to be at the fort [Fort David A. Russell; Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming], I had put most of it then.  Then after the fort, it was Taylorville so we, we moved in three different places.  And the school I went to was Churchill [Churchill Public School, Cheyenne, Wyoming], and it was a yellow brick house, a yellow building, and it was freshly built, and I just know it was new.  And we, we had to walk a long way from Taylorville--I mean, not Taylorville, from the fort to Churchill, and we went there.  It was a long walk and--
Speaker 1: So, you had to walk away from the fort to get to the school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How old were you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, the fort, not the fort.  We, we, we lived in Taylorville, see, we went--
Speaker 1: Oh, so you had to walk to the fort to the school?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the Churchill School was in the fort?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, Churchill School was in, in, near in the part of Cheyenne.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You see itself.  I, I guess I'm jumping around because I was trying to hit at stories.  But, but, but, but the fact that I lived in Corlett-ville [sic.], I can get that straight.  That's when Corlett was the whole mixture of kids.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  No, you've got Taylorville.
Speaker 2: No, I mean when we came to--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  You said Corlett-ville--you mean Taylorville.
Speaker 2: I meant, yeah, that's right, I meant Corlett.  When I came to, when, that momma came to the West, and we got a place to stay, that's where we were.  But then, I now was, like eight or so.  Then I can't, can't, too--remember too much.  But then, we went to the fort, and at the fort, that's when we had to learn to walk from, from that part of the, of, of Wyoming.  You had to get to wide spaces to Churchill School 'cause that's the school we went to.  And, of course, Teenie [Christine Witt Gaines] and Dorothy [Dorothy Witt King] never went to any other school but this one, and that was Churchill.  Did I mix you up?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You see this, so I'm giving you a lot of land.  We have to--I, I--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  He asked for schools, Corlett and Churchill--
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, Corlett and Churchill.  And when did you start going to Churchill?  Well, how old were you when you went to Churchill?
Speaker 2: First grade on up.
Speaker 1: First grade on up?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 344212
Speaker 1: How did you like school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, I loved school until one of the teachers made me, made me mad.  And I had told Corrine [Corrine Johnson Falope] that story about the--she's--we were playing on the, on the playground out there.  And she said--I, I knew I was playing with Dorothy [Dorothy Witt King] and Teenie [Christine Witt Gaines], they're my sisters.  And she said, "Well, she says, how come they're so fair?  Are they, are they your real brothers and sisters?"  And, and I said, "Yes, they're my real brothers and sisters," if you, not, not my, my real sisters, Teenie and Dorothy.  And I told momma [Pearl Pryor Witt] what she, what, what they were, what the teacher said.  And she said, "I'm going up there and talk to her.  I'm going to let that teacher know that we're all family, a rainbow family at that."  And she said, "And I don't want them asking questions like that of Dorothy and Teenie."  And so, when momma, when (laughter) she took her up, went up to school, and saw these two children--they're playing on, on, in the yard, and near the fountain where they--we got a drink all the time.  And she said, "That's the way it should be," but she went up to the principal and said that she didn't like her teacher quizzing the kid that she had a rainbow family.  All had the same family, a same father [William Witt], and she didn't want any more questions raised that way, and make, trying to make a difference because of color.  She said, there's nothing wrong, is there, with having a rainbow family?  And she told it on that.  Mommy was very proud of the fact that Teenie and Dorothy were, were two of, were sisters, but they were very fair.  I was the brown one because I looked just like mother.  And, and my brother [William P. Witt] was in between, and it was a rainbow family.  But she made an issue--they had made an issue at Churchill [Churchill Public School, Cheyenne, Wyoming].  And I always will remember that because they, they sing this little song, white is right, blacks stay back.  And I can't, for me, I can't remember all of the--
Speaker 1: Oh, browns stick around, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.  And I'd, I'd, and I'd get mad when I'll be jumping Double Dutch, Double Dutch, and jump Double Dutch.  And I, I, I finally decided I wasn't going to jump rope anymore because they always said, "Blacks, stay back" or "Blacks stay, and brown."  Brown, I think it, it was--had a different thing than (unclear).  What did you say?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was yellow.  The way I remember it, and I don't remember people jumping rope to it, but old people used to say it to us when we were kids.  They'd say, "If you're white, you're right.  If you're yellow, you're mellow.  If you're brown, stick around.  If you're black, get back."  That was the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, but they didn't--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  And I've heard, "Brown stay down."
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, but--
Speaker 1: And so I--
Speaker 2: --pretty much, expression of, when said by blacks, it's a pretty much expression of self-hate, and maybe a description of the political situation.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yes, it was.  And it, it made me angry and I just, and so I quit.  I said, I'm not going to jump it anymore.  I'm not going to--I'm not black, and I'm not going, and I didn't like it, so I quit jumping.  I told Corrine that story.  But it was a real nasty months, and the principal, she said, "Well, you can't, we can't, I can't solve the race problem.  But I certainly will remind the teachers that, that they're, they're, they're sisters 'cause it has been raised, if they were of the same parentage."  I said, and, and mother told that, "They had the same father, and I don't want to hear anything more about this," and she made a big issue of it.
Speaker 2: You know, that kind of thing can cause a lot of trouble, you know, you would think so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes, it did, yeah.  So, that's, that's the story I'd--one of the stories that I can recall then.  And when you ask about the school, Churchill was the school, and it was my school until I went to junior high [Cheyenne Junior High School, Cheyenne, Wyoming].
Story_ID: 344213
Speaker 1: What junior high did you go to?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to the junior high, which was attended by most all of the kids in, in Cheyenne [Wyoming]--white and black and Indian [Native American], and all.  But the kids tend to sift out, and get in little clusters more when they got to junior high.  And they, blacks would be with blacks and they hang out, and I was starting to hang out with some of the black kids then.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of the junior high school?
Speaker 2: I can't recall.
Speaker 1: Was it Cheyenne Junior High School [Cheyenne, Wyoming]?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was just Cheyenne, just like it was Cheyenne High School [Cheyenne Central High School, Cheyenne, Wyoming].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, because most of the population was so--it wasn't large, but they were, they covered a lot of nationalities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, as people got older, you said they started segregating off more, I guess or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And when, when I was a teenager, I was hanging out with the black kids that went to junior high, and they lived across the street.  And mommy [Pearl Pryor Witt] said, "I don't want you with that riff raff."  And she made a big issue with the teachers to, to watch me, and not, and, and, and she said, "Well, Margie [HistoryMaker Marjorie Witt Johnson] hangs out with them and, and, and they're always together.  I--it's not much I can do about that."  And then, then, she said, "Well, I can do something about it."  So, she kept warning me that she wanted me to not stop at the library, and not, not be hanging out with these kids 'cause they were this, they were that.  They did live across the tracks.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  So, she's making a line of demarcation with the black (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, she's, yeah, it was a--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  --you know, with the black kids.
Speaker 2: --yeah, well, she was concerned that the kids of the black enlisted men were like somehow not a, not as good or they didn't, they weren't as high-class or something as the others.  Was that it?
Speaker 1: I think--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Story_ID: 344214
Speaker 1: There was the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, and I still belong to the A.M.E. church.  And, and, and I was a member at the A.M.E. church.  And these kids, most of them went to the Baptist church, which was just down, down, down the street from the Methodist church.  But it tended to feed into this hanging out business.  And kids were more, more together, and had more relationship with parents and with adults at the A.M.E. than they did at the Baptist.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, the A.M.E. was more of a middle-class church.  And the Baptist church was a rank and file, you know.
Speaker 1: (Nods head) Right, right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  It hadn't changed that much (laughter), it hadn't changed much to the (unclear)--
Speaker 1: I forgot that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) though some of our Baptist friends would probably hit me upside the head now, but that's--
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: Yep, okay.  So, what was the name of the A.M.E. church you attended?
Speaker 1: I, you know, I--
Speaker 2: If you can't remember, it's all right.  I just thought I'd ask to see, you know.
Speaker 1: I can't recall what, it's a, the--it was called the A.M.E. church--I think that's what they called it, the A.M.E. church, because this--
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  (Simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) represented the church of the man who walked out of the church in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], somewhere where they were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Richard Allen.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Richard Allen--
Speaker 2: --Richard Allen, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, this is a story behind that, so that's the church [Allen Chapel A.M.E. Church, Cheyenne, Wyoming].
Story_ID: 342324
Speaker 1: Tell us about high school then.  Now, you were at, you were saying before that your mother [Pearl Pryor Witt] was admonishing you for hanging out with the Baptist kids and with the other black kids.  How were things in high school?
Speaker 2: I was just trying to think--how much did I tell you, Corrine [Corrine Johnson Falope], of Cheyenne [Wyoming], of high school?  I'm kind of lost now.
Speaker 1: Well, you went to Cheyenne High School [Cheyenne High School; Cheyenne Central High School, Cheyenne, Wyoming]?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah, I went from there, and I had a problem with, with, with the whole idea of color because I, I think it, it, it cuts across from early childhood on because I felt the difference of, of, of color early in the, in the time we lived in Wyoming, in, in, and the Fort [Fort David A. Russell; Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming] because of the two girls.  Teenie [Christine Witt Gaines] and Dorothy [Dorothy Witt King] were, come on to the scene, and because they were fair, there was a cleavage.  Now, I can't tell whether it was historically or psychologically or what.  I think that there became a very strong cleavage between how I saw myself in life, with others, with my mother, with friends.  And, and it was a difference between how they saw me, and how they saw Dorothy and Teenie.  And I think this color difference got into my psyche somehow and, and, and it had created problems for me, and for myself as I went along.
Speaker 1: Well, a lot of children that are middle children have, you know, issues anyway with younger brothers and sisters, or the oldest gets attention, and then the youngest get attention, and then you're in the middle.  And you said, you were the darkest one in a family that was very color-conscious, and trying to, class-conscious, so that was a, so that created some issues.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it created (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  (Simultaneous) Yeah, and her brother [William P. Witt] was the only boy.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And he was the only boy, and he was favored by daddy [William Witt] and her, and, and, and I felt I was kind of like a missing link.  And then, mother used to say, which made it worse sometime.  There's this Palmer's Skin Success--put it on your face if you think you're too dark, and it'll brighten you up.  Well, it never brightened me up, as light as Dorothy and Teenie were, 'cause they were, like white.  They both were very fair because daddy was very fair.  So, it was an issue that started riding me from that time on through, through--and then when I got to the school and the teachers re-emphasized it, I really cried out.  And, and momma saw it was an issue, and then she said, and maybe I, I remember telling it to a psychiatrist at one time.  And she--he said that she probably made it worse, but I had, get this Palmer's Skin Success.  And just the other day, I saw a magazine with it being advertised to lighten this up, the brown skin.  And I, and I felt, I had, and they laughed--Teenie and Dorth-, Teenie and Dorothy would laugh, and say, "Why you put that on your face all the time?"  And I said, "None of your (laughter) business."  And, and I, and, and mommy, mommy said, "Just, just don't mind by her putting something on her skin.  Just, just make it smooth and, and nice," and she said, "That's all it is."  And then, she would tell me, "Just lighten your skin up and don't go around here grumbling about I, I'm the darkest one," said, said, "You're, you're just as lovely as, as Dorth-, as Dorothy and Teenie."  And she said, "But you use this Skin Success."  And I just hated it, but I, I, I would go into the bathroom, shut the door, and try to put it on my face, thinking that it would, would lighten my brown skin.
Speaker 1: When you look back on that time, that's really--I mean, have, do you think that we've progressed any as a people in terms of that perception?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) No, I, I don't think that maybe the kids go to the lightening-up business as much as I may have done at that time.  But I think that, that perception is an issue with many things that, socially, are happening with, with groups.  And I, I now have, I see quite, quite a bit of differences made, and who's picked here, and who's picked there and, and who is going to be in this?  And, and, well, let's get her, not just taking the group and just moving on, but making a definite pitch to get a light skinned person, and picking him for a part of the show.  And then, when I got into social work and all, and I was singing as groups, I would work with that.  I'd certainly make, make sure that whether a girl was dark or light, if she could dance, my God, that was going to be her place.  And I, I did that.  And so, it, it seemed like the group that became famous, one of the girls in it--I never let color come in.  And she was a lady in--Roger Mae [Roger Mae Johnson] was a leading dancer, and, and she is today--acknowledges--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Brown, brown.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  She's brown skinned.
Speaker 2: Brown skinned, she was one of the outstanding dancers.
Speaker 1: That's Roger Mae Johnson, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.

Speaker 1: Well, let's go back to high school [Cheyenne High School; Cheyenne Central High School, Cheyenne, Wyoming].  Now, were you a good student in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I--that's, well, I was glad you, you mentioned it.  The color issue was one.  The other issue was my grades.  My grades were not as high as a girl who is very light skinned.  And, and I, and momma [Pearl Pryor Witt] say, well, Dorothy, and Dorothy Forbush [ph.] belong to the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church.  And they were giving prizes out for those who had honored this.  She said, "She's not being honored because she's fair.  She's being honored because she uses her mind.  She's doing something besides something, and she, she is smart."  And, and I begin to realize that I need, needed to study more.  I needed it if I was going to rival, not the color, but the, the, the fact that she was studying more, applying herself more.  And so, I just got out of that little tent I was making for myself.  And, and, and, and, and started--I didn't start hanging out with the kids from the other side of town.  But I did start (speaking Latin), "Agricola, agricola," with, with Latin, begin to get good grades in Latin, and doing good work in, in junior high [Cheyenne Junior High School, Cheyenne, Wyoming] beginning.  And that's when it was pointed out to me that Dorothy Forbush, with her pretty hair and her pretty this, now is, got a pretty head on her.  She's got a good thinking mind, she thinks.  You ain't thinking, Margie Johnson [HistoryMaker Marjorie Witt Johnson].  I wasn't Margie Johnson, but Margie Witt.  That's what I was.  And then, I realized that my grades were low, so I started trying to do more with my grades.  And so, when I graduated from high school, I was in the upper tenth at high school, but I was in the lower tenth when I left junior high from hanging out, and not doing my work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you made a dramatic turnaround then?
Speaker 2: I made, I made a dramatic, a real radical turnaround.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, did you get a chance to--did they do, did they have a prom, and all that sort of thing when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: No, and they did not have that, but they did have--what did I tell you about, Corrine [Corrine Johnson Falope]?  I said, they had something at a high--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  I thought they just had social dances at that--
Speaker 2: They just had--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  --connected with the church thing.
Speaker 2: Oh, as--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  --church socials and so forth.
Speaker 2: The social, the church--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  That's the feeling I had.
Speaker 2: --yeah, well, I think, when I told her most of the activities and hanging out group would have it, if they had a dance, the Masons would have a dance, or the Elks would have a dance, I would go.  And I would be dancing with the guys who, who--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Across the tracks.
Speaker 2: --who were across the tracks.  And they liked to dance with me because they say, "You, you, you, you put there, Jack.  Girl, you really can dance."  And I got accolades about my dancing and, and, and it was, mostly were with these guys who were not so hot in the idea of the, of the church.  And then, socially, I, I had thought I had made, but, see--Dorothy did not, Dorothy Forbush, the girl with the pretty hair and the, and this high grades, had it all, except that she couldn't dance.  And I, I, I did hold that up and, and that made me okay (laughter) at, at the dances, but it tore me to pieces yesterday.  And then, if you could get the picture, I, I'm there dancing and all, but not doing the stuff up here--
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: --but then, then I got with it before they--I graduated from high school because I had realized that, that I could think just like she could.  And so, I began to (speaking Latin), "Agricola, agricola," and, and I, I knew my Latin as well as she.  And I was chosen to be in the upper tenth of, of the graduating now, our high school class.  But I, I made it because I wanted to make it and all.

Speaker 1: When you were a senior in high school [at Cheyenne High School; Cheyenne Central High School, Cheyenne, Wyoming], did you think you were going to college at that point?
Speaker 2: Well, that's the interesting thing.  And I think I, I think I told Corrine [Corrine Johnson Falope] that story, something about the fact that when I got ready to go to graduation, the teacher had wanted me to act--see, I was thinking, I was a good actor.  I could pretend I was somebody and, and do it, and they always thought, gee, Margie [HistoryMaker Marjorie Witt Johnson] is good, and said, well, I said, "I'd like be Ms. Payne [ph.]."  She was the guidance counselor.  And he said, "Well, that's all right."  And so, they let me be the counselor.  I say, they said, aww, I said, "I'll, I'll put some pillows in me."  She was real fat.  And I said, "And, and I'll, I'll be Ms. Payne."  So, I acted her out, and the kids said, "Ooh, she's real good, and they clapped and all."  So, but Mr. Hubbard [Ralph Hubbard], one of the teachers, he looked, and he said, "Look, I'm not going to let you do that on the graduation night," he said, "Because there will be a lot people there who won't be your students.  They won't be these students.  They'll be people, and they're going to laugh at a brown skinned woman, no girl, doing Ms. Payne, when Ms. Payne is white."  And I said, that doesn't--and I, I didn't make the issue.  He made the issue, but he, he didn't say that to the kids.  He just said, "No, I'm not going to let you do that on graduation."  And he said, "I don't want you to be a, I don't you to be the, Ms. Payne, and the guidance counselor."  And, and then, he said, "I don't want that part done.  We'll do something else."  So, I told momma [Pearl Pryor Witt], and she got--I told her, I was going to be in it, and then I, I told that he didn't want me to have the part.  And she said, "Why not?"  And he said, I said, "Because I'm, I'm, I'm a colored, and she's white."  She said, "There's no difference."  She said, "Many--your, your uncle [Hayes Pryor] did many wonderful plays in, on Broadway and, and, and in New York [New York] because he was a good actor.  So, I say," she said, "I don't, I don't like this."  She said, "I think you should have the part."  Well, Mr. Hubbard did better than that.  He came by the house, and that's what they did out in Wyoming--teachers would, would visit.  So, he sat down and told mother that, "I don't want Marjorie to come and act out a part with a hall of people that have come to this high school graduation, and have her acting out somebody white with pillows in her."  And, and, and he said--I said, I don't think--he said he didn't want me to do that.  He just said, "I just think her--class is one thing, but to do that for the community is not good.  I don't want it."  And he said, "You understand?"  He said, and, and mother said, "Why?"  And then, he said, "I'll tell you why, Ms. Witt.  I don't think Marjorie's got a good picture of the feelings that run rampant all over the world about black folks in their slavery days."  And he said, "I don't think they do, and I don't think Marjorie knows enough of what happened in the South."  And that, momma said, "Happened in the South--what does she have to do--?"  He said, "For example, have, have, did it have you and your husband [William Witt] let her read, 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' [Harriet Beecher Stowe]?"  And, and momma said, "Why should she read all that mess, all that junk?"  He said, "It isn't junk, Ms. Witt, it's history.  It really did happen, and she should know it."  So, he said, "I think you're like a lot of black folks are denying the fact that there was a slavery day, and that folks were--blacks were at zero.  Don't you know that?"  And momma paused and she said, "Yes, I know, but I'm not--," mother, besides being as she was that called, he called her, "You deny your own racial background."  He said, he said, "I think, like many blacks, live in, in the, in the clouds, and they don't want to remember who, what happened, and how off they were in the United States."  And he said, "I think she should know every piece of that.  They were not considered as people.  They were like cattle of slavery, in slavery."  And so, momma said, "I don't choose to have their mind all corrupted with all of that, that anger and that mess.  I want them to live above it."  He said, "It can't be done, and it won't be done."  And he said, "I'm going to give you this book."  He said, "I brought it down just for you to look at."  And moth- and mother said, "I did not ever give them a Christmas present of that book, or any kind of book like slavery.  I wanted them to think higher, to think more positively."  And, and I said, "Well, I want to read it, I want to read it."  I had never read it.  So, momma said, "I would prefer you not leave it, Mr. Hubbard."  And I said, "Well, mother, let, let me be--I think I need to know what's, what's happening."  And so, she--he left the book.
Story_ID: 342327
Speaker 1: I've forgotten how old I was at that time, but I knew that I had really defied her [Johnson's mother, Pearl Pryor Witt].  If you don't get it, I'll get it, and read it, you know, kind of thing, so I read the book.  In fact, I started reading that very day when he left.  And when I started reading it, and I read all that stuff in there, I was horrified.  I did not know, I had never learned.  Here, I was a high school graduate, and I had never learned all the awful things because you see in the kind of life, if you see that I lived, I didn't ever live in those places where this was an issue.  So, here I was at high school [Cheyenne High School; Cheyenne Central High School, Cheyenne, Wyoming] being faced with the issue of slavery, and all that it meant.  And the white, salt in wounds, and all, and I could not go to sleep.  I just sat there, and we had a pot belly stove, and I remember, before I finished it, I threw it in the stove.  I was so burnt up.  I, I, I--the picture in my mind was so horrible about how awful we were treated.  And that was people with brown skin like mine and, and, and, and I thought, oh, my gosh.  And I, I just was upset.  I didn't know how to act.  And he [Ralph Hubbard] has really put me into something that I didn't know how to handle, and momma sure didn't know how to handle.  So, I threw, I burnt the book up.  I said, I recall, and then I said, but that's no reason why.  I just said, I don't want the part.  I don't want any, and any part of the, of the high school thing.  If you don't want to be in it, it's a, but mother said, "I think, if she wants to do the part, go ahead and do it."  I said, "I don't want to do the part."  So, I, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  (Simultaneous) Trying to think what he--the point, you told me he was trying to make us, he didn't want her [Ms. Payne (ph.)] held up to ridicule.  So, it's one thing for the classmates, but it's another thing for the--
Speaker 1: Well, the woman, the counselor, yeah.  Yeah, I thought about that, too, that it might not be a good idea, even if you were white (laughter) to portray that woman with the pillows and all that.  That might not have been a good idea.  But (laughter), it was funny to the kids, but I don't think it would have been funny to her.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so, that's the way he said it--just as simply.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, I didn't get to do the part, and but it made an indelible print on my mind about an issue of things that happened in the South.  And I was then aching inside to be a part of the southern scene.  I wanted to get to the South, and see if it was some of that still there.
Story_ID: 342328
Speaker 1: How did you wind up at Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin Ohio]?  I mean, what happened after high school [Cheyenne High School; Cheyenne Central High School, Cheyenne, Wyoming] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, then, it came out of that.  He said, "I want her to go to Oberlin.  I want her to go to the school that has stuck its, its academic head out to invite black women in, and I'd like to see Margie [HistoryMaker Marjorie Witt Johnson] go there."  And mother [Pearl Pryor Witt] said, "Well, I think, anywhere that will make life a little easier for her, and for her to understand better what, what the world is about, and if they'd admit, and it's not too expensive, I think we need to make that as our goal.  I'd, I'd like a school like that."  And so, from then on, Mr. Hubbard, the history teacher, Elbert Hubbard [sic. Ralph Hubbard], helped me a whole year to work it out, so I could get a--I mean, and, and admitted, admittance to the, to the Oberlin College.  And, and, and he said, "In 1835, they opened the doors to blacks, like no other colleges had done.  And, and I think she needs to go there and get a feeling for the history that she has missed."
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So, did you go to--
Speaker 2: --so I stayed out a year, went to work in Cheyenne [Wyoming], and got me a little job and, and him, with him helping me with letters, they admitted me to Oberlin.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What year did you start Oberlin?
Speaker 2: The next year, not that same year that, that it was the year (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Well, what was the year that you graduated from high school?
Speaker 2: I graduated from that in 1929.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember it so well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I got a job downtown, and I worked a whole year.  And Mr. Hubbard just hovered around our house, and called mother, and reread my letters that I wrote to the school, and helped me get into Oberlin.
Speaker 1: Had you ever been far away from home when you went to Oberlin?
Speaker 2: No, I guess, to Indiana, where momma's home was, and to New York [New York] for a brief stay, but not for very long.  I get--went there during the year that I was out in 1929.  I went there to see Uncle Hayes [Hayes Pryor].
Speaker 1: Okay, oh, yeah, that must have been impressive to go to New York City to visit your uncle in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, well, mother and I, we went, we went on a trip.  And daddy [William Witt] could get passes, so he quit the [U.S.] Army when we stayed in Cheyenne.  And he, he quit the Army, and took a job as a machinist at the Union Pacific [Union Pacific Railroad], and he stayed in the Union Pacific until he died.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he had, he, being a railroad man, he could get the passes on the Union Pacific.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he got passes and he said, "You can come back and forth every holiday," and I did.  It was great.  And then, the Cheyenne Women's Club [General Federation of Women's Clubs of Wyoming, Cheyenne, Wyoming] took it up, and they raised money for me to go.  And the Baptist people, momma said, "Well, we just won't bother them.  We'll just go through the Searchlight Club," and they helped me to go to Oberlin.
Speaker 1: It was called the Searchlight Club, huh?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting, Searchlight Club.  Okay, and so they raised the money for you to go to Oberlin and--
Speaker 2: They helped raise it.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And then, daddy's pass.  And I stayed out a year, and I worked downtown, and learned how to type and to, to do reports, and that kind of thing, and I was able to make it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and they gave me a, a scholarship--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --Oberlin did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, so that, that was, that was, that little piece wrapped up and, and I start, and I graduated from Oberlin in eighteen- in 1935.
Story_ID: 342329
Speaker 1: Well, how did you like Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio]?  What, how did you like it?
Speaker 2: Oh, they, that's the part of what the show, you know about the show that they did here, don't you?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Mother, don't do that.  Why don't you go to the dance and how dance was--
Speaker 1: Then I, and but in that school [Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Oberlin, Ohio] in Oberlin, I met this girl named Margery Schneider.  And at that time, Alvin Ailey was just hitting the front, and he was becoming a great dancer in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Unh-uh, unh-uh, not that.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Not that.  It's too far back.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  I, I just think you should tell about your experience dancing.
Speaker 1: Well, I was just going to tell him about it, that, that he was--
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  How you first went down there.  He was not there then, mother.
Speaker 1: Well, what I was going to tell him was how I got started.  I was in Oberlin, and Margery Schneider was a dancer.  And she says, "Marjorie [HistoryMaker Marjorie Witt Johnson], you got a beautiful body, and I just think you'll do fine."  And she started showing me some steps and things.  And, and I, I, I really loved it because dance was something that I'd seen a lot of with the Indians [Native Americans].  And I, and I, I thought, you know, how wonderful and how graceful they were, and wondered why they didn't do more of the Indian dancing in the, in this classroom, but I never said anything to any of the teachers because nobody was dancing.   But in, in Oberlin, Margery Schneider started teaching me these leaps and bounds and stuff, and I, I was able to, to do quite well.  And, and as I danced, I began to think less and less of all of the problems I had had, and, and, and it just seemed to give me a whole new lease on life.  And, and in Oberlin, the professors let you come to their home.  And when you got there, you could talk about, like if it was geology, they talked about the rocks and they, and he talked about what was in the, in the, the West.  And I could chime in there, and tell him about the mountains and, and, and what I knew.  And they enjoyed what I would say about the West.  But when I got in the dance class, and I started leaping, and doing all those things, I began to, to lose a great deal of that feeling of, you'll never make it, 'cause you're too dark.  But there wasn't anything about darkness.  It was something about something else, and that's something else I learned was just the spirit of raising yourself above all the negatives, and moving ahead with something that, that took you into another world of satisfaction and joy.  And, and, and I enjoyed it so much.  And, and when I'd leap, I'd, she'd--, "Go ahead, Marg, go ahead, Marg."  And I just found a new Marjorie there, and I began to try more to be this new Marjorie.
Speaker 2: Now, who was your dance instructor at Oberlin?
Speaker 1: Margery Schneider.
Speaker 2: Oh, Margery Schneider was the dance instructor?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: And, and she had a teacher in Cleveland [Ohio].  Her name, Eleanor Frampton.  And--
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Mother, that, that's a different time.  I think that's a different time, isn't it?
Speaker 1: It may have been.  But I, I--
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, so, Margery Schneider was the dance instructor in Oberlin.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And now, I read that she taught you some Martha Graham techniques and some Ruth--
Speaker 1: St. Denis [Ruth St. Denis]--
Speaker 2: --St. Denis techniques--
Speaker 1: And they were modern dance, um-hm.  Yeah, she, she taught me all of those and told me what they were.  And then, she introduced me to the fact that, that was a good, a whole new world, she said.  And that, at the, at the, on the, on the periphery of it, she was talking about, that black people make it, can make it with dance.  Then, that's Corrine [Corrine Johnson Falope], what I was going to say, that she is telling me about Alvin Ailey who had started and, and Dunham [HistoryMaker Katherine Dunham], who had been abroad and written a book.  She just told me about him.  I didn't know, I didn't see him, or see their dancing, but she just said it was possible that I could--might make a living at it, you know.  And that, and, and might be able to form something, but I had no idea what or where, but I did have an idea that I could move, and that I loved it.  So that was my beginning of, of seeing another Marjorie, and, and that's it.
Story_ID: 342330
Speaker 1: Now what was your major in college [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I, I, I didn't, I got caught up with the conflict in my mind, and with what daddy [William Witt] and momma [Pearl Pryor Witt] thought about it because when I went out there at, at Christmastime, and said to them, "I thought I'd like to, to follow the dance world."  And daddy got, got angry, very angry.  He said, "I thought you wanted to be somebody."  I said, "I will be somebody."  And, and mother said, "We hadn't thought about it--dancing as somebody."  And I was simply disappointed that they did not see what I saw, and, so I said, I don't know.  And then, that's when I began to falter in directions, and not knowing what I was going to do, and, and but I still steadily went on.  And, and it was through meeting Corrine's [Corrine Johnson Falope] father, Bill Johnson, who was an outstanding actor, and, and when I told him about the dancing and my folks' disappointment, he said, "Well, why don't you go ahead and be, be a dancer and, and be good at it?  But I don't know about jobs for it at all."  I said, "No, I'll find them."  I said, "Look at the theatre."  He said, "Well, the theatre is different."  And I knew it was because my uncle [Hayes Pryor] was, and I liked what he had in it, you know.  And then, so, this, the fellow--well, maybe, and I had, was liking him, that maybe by marrying him, and going ahead at, with my, with my life and drama and dance, I could make it.  But I got really confused, and I got lost in the, in the, in the, in the making the decision.  And it was the teachers when you went, met at their homes, and they would say, there are other opportunities, and then, that's when they told me about Karamu--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and the possibility.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  But it wasn't Karamu in those days.  It was Settlement House [sic. Playhouse Settlement; Karamu House, Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 2: It, it was a settlement at that--
Story_ID: 344432
Speaker 1: Now where did you meet Bill Johnson?
Speaker 2: I met Bill Johnson at Karamu, at the Playhouse Settlement [Karamu House, Cleveland, Ohio].  It wasn't Karamu then.
Speaker 1: Oh, at the settlement, okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: And I learned about the settlement from sitting in the professors' homes, and them hearing me cry because I didn't think I could make a life at dance.  And they, they thought, well, there are other places where you can certainly dance, rather than be having a group.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, who were some of the professors at Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio] that you really liked, and who looked after you?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, the first, of course, was the dance lady.  And the second one--I, I had admired the, the, the counselor [Ms. Payne (ph.)], who I was trying to portray because she was, oh, so insightful of some of the things I would tell her.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  That's high school, mother.  He's asking college.
Speaker 2: No, college, yeah, Oberlin, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And then, it was there--
Speaker 2: Who was, what was her name in college, in, or what was the counselor's name at Oberlin?
Speaker 1: I had it a minute ago, and I said it, but I can't recall it at this moment.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What was her name and, oh, dear.  I, I just said it, and it seems to me that my things come and go, as I get into the at, at my--I get into the setting and I recall the people, names come to me.
Speaker 2: Okay, I hear you.  But you said Margery Schneider was the dance instructor--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and the counselor was helpful.  And you said the geology professor even helped you out, you know, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yes, and the geology, 'cause he used to call on me special to tell, tell me.  He said, "Tell them your story about the mountains."  And I would talk to him about what I saw in the mountains and the rocks, and the, and the distance, what color it was, and right up close, what it was like.  All those things were, were very alive with me.  And when I was at camp, when I was a cookie girl or a sandwich girl at the, at the, at the--
Speaker 2: The dude ranch?
Speaker 1: --at the dude ranch in Wyoming.  That was a part of what I had never experienced of the West.  And I lived in it, and I was just tickled to death to be in there where the bears were, and, and where the wolves were, and all those kind of thing.  Just like that Indian [Native American] father told me about looking, I can see today that whole space that I burnt because he, he, he made it so vivid that she'll never forget how she destroyed the homes, and he'd said of our little gophers, and little gophers, and the what-not.  And they ran out of their homes smoked out with this fire I'd set.
Story_ID: 344433
Speaker 1: Now, the summer that you graduated from Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio], you worked at Camp Chippewa [ph.], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, that's what I read, yeah, okay.  So what happened at Camp Chippewa?
Speaker 2: Well, at, at Camp Chippewa, I had, I was given the job of dance counselor.  And when I told them, I'd told them, I'd be the dance counselor, they say, "Well, get to work and show us something."  And these were the little tough girls, you know, from this inner city.  And I said, "Well, to begin with, I'd like to see your dance because you all say you dance every day."  I said--and they said, "Well, for time, for, for, for, for beginners, how about time step?"  And so, they did a little--ta da dee da dee dee da da dee da da.  And they said, "Now, can you time step?"  And I said, "I, I'll, I'll try."  So, I tried and they said (laughter)--they laughed at me.  And then, then, then they said, then, then, "Get to work, and show us something else, if you're the dance counselor."  And I said, "No, I'd rather see you dancing."  So then, they said, "Do you know how to--," I've forgotten the name of the dance now, but I had it when I told Corrine [Corrine Johnson Falope] the story.  I can't think of what it was, but, anyway, "Can, can you, can you shuffle?"   Let's say, let's say, shuffle.  I said, "I'll try."  So, I tried it, and they said, "Aww, that's a good beginning."  I said--they said, "Well, now, let's see what kind of thing can you do?"  I said, all right.  So, I remembered one of the things I learned about Graham [Martha Graham] is one of her falls and leaps, that Schneider [Margery Schneider] had taught me.  So, I leapt up in the air, did a fall to the floor, turned around, and stood up.  And they said, "Wow, what's that?"  I said, "That's modern dance."  "Modern who?"  I said, "Modern dance."  "Well, show us something--let us see it."  So then, I started then, trying to show them.  And, and when they says, "Wow, wow, we, we gotta get that thing down together."  So, that's how I began with those little (unclear) showing me first, and then me showing them second.  And then, they jumped, and they tried, and they couldn't, and they said, "Wow, I hurt myself."  And then, I said, "Well, there's a way you have to do that, had to move a little slower at first, and then, you do this, and then, you can fall."  "Oh, have I got it, have I got it?"  And so, kept working at it, and I said, "Well, another time, not, not--our time is gone."  "Aww, we want, we want to learn that, that--."  Well, they say, that butt-swinging, falling, and getting up thing.  And, I, I said, "Well, we'll have another try at it."  So, from then on, they were at my tent, and ready to, to go.  "Let's, let's do the modern-who dance."  And then, I started with them on that, and we did it.  And then, when, when they got ready to go, they said, "Well, as camp here is over, we can't do this anymore.  Well, we get back to, to Cleveland [Ohio], are you going to be our, our leader?"  And I said, "Well, I don't know about that."  And they said, "Well, we do.  We're--this is going to call our kind of dance.  That's what we're going to do--our kind of dance.  Well, we get back to Cleveland."  So, that, that night around the camp fire, they did one of the things we'd learned.  And the, and the counselors, as well as the girls, were very much moved by what they saw, and what they felt when we did it, of what I had taught them--a few steps of modern dance.  And it became something that they, they really wanted.  And they said, we'll get back, so when we got back to Cleveland, we found out that there wasn't, wasn't any space there for it.  It, it was not made.  The Karamu [Playhouse Settlement; Karamu House, Cleveland, Ohio] was not set up that way, the settlement.
Story_ID: 344434
Speaker 1: It was the Playhouse Settlement [Karamu House, Cleveland, Ohio], they called it then, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Playhouse Settlement?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And these girls had been a part of Playhouse Settlement, but they had never danced like--so now, it became a quest.  And those girls were so serious about it that they came, kept bumping at my door, and bumping at my door to, to have me show them where we could dance, so I, they could learn to do that kind of dancing.  And they were on 40th Street, right down from this, right down from 40th Street, where there was a pool hall.  And they said, "We'd clean it up, and that'll be our place, and we'll practice there."  So, I said, "Sure," so that's what we did.  We cleaned up the, the, up, up, the pool, the pool hall, and they cleaned it up.  And we started there on a Saturday at, at one time.  And that's--at that time, I met Bill Johnson.  You asked me when I, I met him, and he was in the play under Mrs. Jelliffe [Rowena Jelliffe], but they were in the theatre, so I went up.  My vision was, and, and he was liking me that perhaps we could do dance and drama, and all, but there was no place at Playhouse Settlement for dance.  So I opted for that pool hall, and we started there, and worked.  And then, Ms. Schneider [Margery Schneider]--Ms. Frampton [Eleanor Frampton], who is a friend of Schneider's and Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio], came and she was just elated over what she saw.  She says, "Well, you're really doing fine."  So, I begin to work at it more and more.  And then, and then, when Ms. Frampton told the Jelliffes what a group I had developed, they begin to see what they could do for getting space, so I could do the dance--teach dance.  And they moved it, moved to get the little playhouse, children's little thing on that, right on the corner--that space.  And then, on every Saturday afternoon, after we left the pool hall, we, we, we would re- rehearse there.  And that's where I met Bill, who was doing plays there, and, and I thought, together--and he was liking me--that we could develop something like that together.  As, as, as we moved on then, because I liked him, too, and that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so--
Speaker 2: But that's the beginning of the dance group [Karamu Dancers] (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 344435
Speaker 1: You continued to develop the little girls' dances until you all got started doing the shows, right?
Speaker 2: Until we got--the first show was at the, at the high school, where they were going to school.
Speaker 1: What high school was it then?
Speaker 2: It was the Cleveland High School--no, it wasn't--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Central--
Speaker 2: --it was Central High School [Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay, Central High School, okay.
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Tell them about stinky feet.
Speaker 1: Oh, she says, stinky feet.  Is that--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --okay, what is it?
Speaker 2: Well, the--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  I think (unclear)--
Speaker 2: The children, the, the girls, who had come from camp [Camp Chippewa (ph.)], and I was now work-, working with them at Playhouse [Playhouse Settlement; Karamu House, Cleveland, Ohio].  And, and their dream was to, to show the teachers at, at any, you know, I didn't realize this until I was telling the story to Corrine [Corrine Johnson Falope] that, that was her, the first job I had to do where I felt that the teachers were not going to like it 'cause I had not done anything with a teacher, as far as a dance school.  And I felt--my gosh now, what will I do?  But then, the kids said, "Oh, you'll like Miss So and So.  She's this--she'll be with the other, she, she'll, she'll go for what we do."  And others said, "So, I don't know about that, if we could do it for Miss So and So."  And each, one by one, they go by teachers, and I got to thinking, gosh, I don't think we're going, we're going to make it with the teachers--to myself, but since they were so adamant about teachers they liked, they felt, would like.  But this was my first introduction of dance to who I thought--I said, "Well, no, let's start with the principal."  And then, she--so the kids said, "Well, yeah, well, he's, he's a fuddy-duddy.  He, he won't know his foot from his head, but, but let's show him--let's have him come to our rehearsal," and so we did.  And he said, "Oh, I think this is beautiful, I think this is wonderful."  And he, when he said, "I'll talk it over with my assistant principal, and see what she says."  And I've forgotten her name but, anyway, he arranged that they could dance and show their schoolmates.  They were thinking about winning the schoolmates.  But some of the girls were worried about the teachers are not going like it, and, and, and their upset-ness about whether it would be acceptable.  And says--one of the girls said, "Oo, I think that she'll like it because she'll probably tell us, you remember that, that 'Iliad' ['The Iliad', Homer], that, that, that song, that, that poem that we were doing."  She said, "It'd make a beautiful play, and it'd make a beautiful dance.  And so, I think, she'll like it, so, well, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's do it."  But, no, I want the kids to see what we can do--how high we can jump, how wonderful we can turn, and, and then, when I told them about costumes, they were just ecstatic about wanting to show what they could, they had learned.  And, and then, we went to high school.  When we did the first dance, I, with my historical idea, thinking that I, I'd get with history, I, I picked one of the girls who, who's short, but had a shapely body, and I had her put some things around her ankle, and she did put things around her ankle.  So, I said, 'cause that's like the Africans do, and, and we'll do a dance dedicated to Africa.
Story_ID: 344436
Speaker 1: We got our dance together, and I called this lady, Ms. Frampton [Eleanor Frampton], who was a friend of Schneider's [Margery Schneider] in Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio], and had her come out and look at it.  She said, "Oh, you got a beautiful choreography here."  And we went on.  And, the night of the show, Ms. Jelliffe [Rowena Jelliffe] actually came and, to one of the rehearsals, and made a dress.  She says, I, I, and the kids kept saying that, "We don't know whether or not they're going to like us or not.  And they might boo us off of the stage."  And she said, "Oh, no, I'm going to have you in a beautiful costume."  So, she made a costume out of blue and gold and, and it was kind of a shiny material.  And then, she said that they will be caught by this beautiful costume, like they do in the plays.  So, we went for it, and we opened up the curtains.  And they started their first dance with the drums, and the drums begin.  This little girl came out with these shorts on, and bells around her ankles.  And the boys in the front row or in the, all around us in the audience say, "Oooh, stinky feet, stinky feet, stinky feet."  And the other boys laughed and made fun, and they had to pull the curtain.  And I was floored, I said, "Aww"--
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Well, tell them about the festival, the festival--
Speaker 1: --I, but he, he, he got angry about it.  And he said--
Speaker 2: The principal?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And he said, "Listen, these girls are your friends and your playmates, and to have you laugh them off the stage like that--I don't want to have to close this curtain.  But now, I'm telling you teachers, each teacher, that's in the rows there, if you see one other boy acting out, please get him, and we'll have him go.  But we're not going to have these girls laughed at.  Now, we're going to try it one more time, and we're starting over."  And then, he opened the curtains again, and they came out.  There wasn't another hiss.  And they, they came on and the kids clapped.  And, and when they got to that last number, they were just stunned with the beautiful costumes and the beautiful music of Brahms' [Johannes Brahms] 'Rhapsody in G minor.'  They, they just, they just, just were, were won over.  And the claps came loud and long, and whistles, and stomps.  So, she--he says, "You see, it's gone over.  Now, you're--they're your friends.  Now, you all take it from here."  And he was really quite good.  And, and the kids were just ecstatic that, that they had made it.  Then, afterwards, a couple of the girls were asked by their teachers if they would think of a dance to 'Iliad'--one of them Greek plays.  And another one asked them if, if they could come and do this.  So, they begin to feel that the teachers were going to like them as well.  And to be one that the teachers, and, you know Miss So and So said, so and so, and so and so.  And then, then they--it became the talk of what, what, what on earth, you know, had possessed them to go into, to the dance, but they had picked something very beautiful.  And she had, they hoped she'd, they'd go on.  So, they got a lot of praise from the teacher, from the principal of the school, and, and, and that ended that episode.  And it made way for, for them to get into the school again.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So that's, so--
Speaker 1: Not only that school--other schools.
Speaker 2: I heard that they performed at Kentucky State [Kentucky State College for Negroes; Kentucky State University, Frankfort, Kentucky] back in those days?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were in, all around and then, they, they were taken--I mean that was just the beginning.  But from then on, it was, it was schools that opened the doors.  It was principals and teachers who put their arms around those girls.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And one of the girls writes today--she said, "I must have been good."  She said, "I joined it, then opening night at Central High School [Cleveland, Ohio], and I've been dancing ever since."  And she may, and now, she has gotten places in--out in Hollywood as a dancer.
Story_ID: 344437
Speaker 1: How did the invitation to the World's Fair [New York World's Fair, New York, New York] come about in 1940?
Speaker 2: Well, after they made a name, like they did at Central [Central High School, Cleveland, Ohio], then they would bid for all around the city.  They were wanting the Karamu, the Playhouse Settlement [Karamu House, Cleveland, Ohio] dance school.  That's what they were called.  They were not called this, they were not called Karamu until the, the theatre burnt because of some angry, black citizen was tired of the plays that they saw there.  And they felt somebody had set this, the, the, the stage on fire.  So, when it was rebuilt at that time, when they rebuilt the stage, they, they, they built a stage for--they, they opened the doors for the dancers to, to appear on the stage of the, of the players.
Speaker 1: Yeah, when, when was that, when was the theatre rebuilt in--
Speaker 2: That was in the '49 [1949], far up in the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: In the '40s [1940s].  Now, well, tell us about the World's Fair now.  What--
Speaker 2: And, then, then after the, after that, they were just on call here, there, everywhere, and mostly at schools because one principal told another one, and the teachers told another.  And then, I didn't realize it when I was telling the story how open the arms of teachers were, to have them come and, and have, and participate as I am right now, as I tell you this, it, 'cause they did make a big stab to, to have them interpret history, and to do things that they knew.  And they, they really had made a name for themselves in the city.  And with that opening, the Jelliffes [Russell Jelliffe and Rowena Jelliffe] begin to go on target for, for, for, for getting a, a new building and, and to dedicate it to the arts.  And it's in that kind of issue that the Jelliffes, Mr. and Mrs., said they'll be called the Karamu Dancers.  And when they got a name like that, they became a part of their selling lists of, of, of artistic endeavors from Karamu.  And the Karamu Dancers were paid to go to the New York World's Fair.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is in 1940, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '41 [sic.] in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well, were the girls excited?
Speaker 2: Oh, my, gosh, yes.  In fact, they said, you had to participate, like you had all before.  If you want to go to the New York World's Fair, you're going to have to find a way to get to New York [New York].  And once you're there, you will appear on the stage in New York.  And I remember my husband--I had married Bill [Bill Johnson] then.  We were going to get together, and get an old car that we had thought about buying.  And it broke down on the way, but it--we had chicken dinners, and we had all kinds of things to raise money to go to the World's Fair.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And once they got there, that's when dancers of the world, who were interested, and had their own groups, came to see them.  And they, they were then called the Karamu Dancers--
Speaker 1: Now, well--
Speaker 2: --not Playhouse Settlement group.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, I read about the performance at the World's Fair.  And didn't it, it rained or something--it stormed?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and you're right.  And, and there's an article, written a story, written about, because it stormed, the lightning became their lights.  And, and they're on the stage dancing--was pulled them closer to the people, and then, that was, was another plus for them.  And New York--then the, the Frenchman who, Gjon Mili saw them.  And he said, there needed to be photographer for, for Life magazine and there were photog- photographs for, from, from his pictures.  But I don't know if there were some hitch, and when it was showing--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  They didn't, they didn't do it immediately.  They didn't show it until fifteen years later--the pictures--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  --the pictures that he took.
Speaker 2: Oh, so Life magazine shot the photos--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but they didn't show them in the magazine until fifteen years later?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they were still getting praise for the work.
Speaker 2: So, not, until 1955--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I mean, they, they weren't really shown until '55 [1955], I guess.
Speaker 1: By this lot, um-hm.
Story_ID: 344438
Speaker 1: What was the material that you--I've read that the material--the dancers that you came up with were drawn from the lives of the girls?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's, that's, that's the number, number one point--is the fact that I, I, I felt that what they lived every day should be a part of dance.  And when Liz Lerman, who does that kind of dancing, said, "You did that in the, in the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s]?"  I said, "Yes."  And so, she gave me one of your dancers to be choreographing our work.  And the way that they did this, like one of the things that they'd come down the street, and they'd smell on Central Avenue that barbecue from Hot Sauce Williams [Cleveland, Ohio].  And they said, "Boy, but I ain't got no money."  And they talked about what their life was to help that, that kept them from getting what they wanted.  But then, they made up another idea that maybe they'd go there, and they'd ask him if they could just have one bone, and, and because they loved that Hot Sauce Williams.  So, by taking a strip of their lives, of what they thought, what they felt, as a part of the dance, it became increasingly important because if it was a tea party or for whatever it was--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Tell them about the tea party.
Speaker 2: --the, the, the, they, you know, people who rally each other for what dress you had on, or what dress they didn't have on, or guys--I hate to go because I don't have--but whatever they thought about life, whatever they thought about some kind of an incident, became a part of the dance.  And that issue became one of the things that made it, made them very, very sought after.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Well, the tea party--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  --I think you said, it was drawn from some of the mothers who worked in service, and had observed this, these women coming into tea and putting on airs, and so forth.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'll have to repeat kind of the question 'cause we can't hear you from back there.  I mean, not, not on the mic, so that's why I kind of repeat, you know, whatever she, so if you ask, we may or may not be able to hear you, you know, a lot of time so.  Ma'am, can you tell us about how the tea party was developed and how that--
Speaker 1: Well, that was developed by, you know--
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  I was just saying one the girls' mothers, who've been in service, and observed this at homes, at the wealthy homes--wasn't that it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's it, but they would, they would take off those women who, who were so caught up in clothes and dress, and they liked to show, come to the party late, so they'd be looked at.  And I mean, a lot of thoughts that occurred about rivaling clothes and things, and, and then try to out-dress each other and, and come to the party late, so they'd be sure to be noticed.  These girls would, would reenacted in dance, but it gave, it gave, gave, gave the audience a, a show of, of society as, as seen by a housemaid--that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now they did--
Speaker 1: And now, they used it.  Well, they chose the music themselves.  And they liked Duke Ellington's 'Sophisticated Lady,' and, and then, and then, dramatized coming into the party late, and coming, so that they could be seen, and their dress be looked out.  And I mean, they, they just interpreted the high society and the little lady who came trickling in a little bit late, not wanting to be seen, and, but that, that, that was what was called the 'Sophisticated Ladies' [sic. 'Tea Time'] dance.
Story_ID: 344439
Speaker 1: Now, you did one dance to Brahms' [Johannes Brahms] 'Rhapsody'--
Speaker 2: 'In G minor' ['Rhapsody in G Minor'].
Speaker 1: 'In G minor,' okay.
Speaker 2: That came about because the girls, at first, didn't like what they call, high class music.  But the girl who played for them girls, she said, "But have you ever heard Brahms' 'Rhapsody in, in G minor'?"  "No, no other kind of rhapsody, they'd say."  And so, she played it.  And then, they begin to take off on the, the beat--there's got a beat to it.  Oh, and, and they were just mimicking the sounds and how it made them feel.  And I said, "Look, you know, that's the dance."  And, and, slowly and surely, I would get them to see it in choreography.  And as it came more alive to them, they got, so that they would hear what they wanted to hear, and they would move to what make sense to them.  And when I saw that, then I knew I had a real dance.  And so, when the girl [Lois A. Perry] played, she was a great musician, played Brahms' 'Rhapsody in G Minor,' and she came to a part in it where they was emphasizing the base (unclear), that they would do certain movements.  And, and it went on as she played, and the more she played Brahms' 'Rhapsody,' the more they loved it.  And so, it became one of the pieces.  And we didn't change it, give it no name, but just let their movements tell the story of how they felt.
Story_ID: 344223
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about Lois A. Perry.  Now she was your accompanist, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And tell us a little bit about her.
Speaker 2: Well, all I can say is she was taking music.  It was music at the Institute of Music [Cleveland Institute of Music, Cleveland, Ohio]--was well, well-versed and well-rehearsed in, in most of the classical music.  And she brought that dream, that knowledge to the group, and it got them to quote listen to classical music.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You know, one of the, I know one key that most people watching this, may or may not know, is that Cleveland [Ohio] is a home for classical music in the United States.  The Cleveland Symphony [sic. Cleveland Orchestra], at one time, was the best symphony in the United States or considered the best one, especially--I think, in the days that you were teaching dance.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, I mean--
Speaker 2: Make a point of that because that was used by her to say, have you heard the, the so and so orchestra play this, and she would play some piece of music.  But the one that she's famous for, for me, is, is the Brahms [Johannes Brahms] 'Rhapsody in G Minor.'
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And they would listen, and it, it increased their, their efforts to listen, and then later to, to relate to in their own way.
Story_ID: 344224
Speaker 1: We talked about classical music, but when, do you remember when you first watched or was exposed to African dance?
Speaker 2: I think, that's a good question because I haven't thought it through, but I can tell you now, off the top of my head, that I felt, when I was in Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio], and when they brought the orchestra down to, for the whole student body, and I remember, at that time, as they played, I stood up when the man was beating the drums in the orchestra, with some part in it.  And the guy said, "Look, you don't do that in a, in a, in a," and he says, "Please sit down."  But I was so carried away, and when the part, end thing came with drums in it, I just stood up, and just said, "Bravo, bravo," and he made me sit down.  I said, "Why you do that?"  And he said, "Because that's not appropriate in here--here, and he said, you, you wait until everybody respond."  But the drum beat just stirred me so that I could not sit still, and I stood up.  And I was reminded of the Indians [Native Americans] dancing.  I was reminded of, of what I would like to have done with it, with it.  And I had stood up and said, "Bravo."  And the (unclear) student body, and people turned around and looked.  And then, I realize I had done the wrong thing.  But, and he always remembered me, the student that took me, because he said, "Gosh, you would have lost control because you couldn't handle the drum beat in, in, in whatever the piece was."  So, after that, I begin to think, gee whiz, to have a dance group that have the drum in it.  So, when I got to Atlanta [Georgia] and met an African, I told him, "Why don't you go to, back to Africa, and bring one of your drums back?"  And I, I had already developed a dancer who loved that, to, to Atlanta, where I was teaching dance then.  And he did--his name was Olatunji [Babatunde Olatunji].
Speaker 1: Now, this is some time later, now, when is this?  What year is this when--
Speaker 2: That was later, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, Olatunji, yeah.
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  He was at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: He was at--
Speaker 2: Morehouse, right, right.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  (Unclear) tell them about you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was telling you the story of how I got the drum.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.  About what time period was that, do you know?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure about, exactly, but I know I went to, to Atlanta.  And I brought--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  She was teaching at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Was that in the '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 1: Yes, it was in the late '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  That's good (unclear).
Speaker 1: Late '50s [1950s], okay.
Speaker 2: That's good, yeah.  And I, I--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  But tell them you were teaching at Atlanta University School of Social Work [Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: That's right, I had become a social worker, and I was teaching there and--
Speaker 1: In the Atlanta University School of Social Work?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And I brought--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  As group worker.
Speaker 2: And I was working with groups.  I had learned now to use the group in a different way than I had when I first started in the camp [Camp Chippewa (ph.)].  I'd moved from, from a camp counselor to a, to a counselor in, in a college--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --one of the black colleges [HBCUs], and, and was trying to get it in the institute with a real drum with real dancing to, and real dance steps.  And Olatunji was an African student, studying at Morehouse, and he did go back, and he'd brought the drum.  And he, he did it, and he has, he became famous as a drummer.
Speaker 1: Became the most famous African drummer in the United States, yeah--
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  He got it.
Speaker 1: Right, you got--
Speaker 2: --and around the world--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --as an ambassador for African dance.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  And, and this is where it started.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: This is where it started.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  And he did--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Michael Babatunde Olatunji.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  He, Babatunde--and you want to tell him about the time that you went down to Kent [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio].  This is years later.  Maybe we shouldn't do that, but he--
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll wait 'til we get to, maybe wait 'til we get there.

Speaker 1: Tell us--I know I read about Roger Mae Johnson--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and there's another girl named, I think, Royce or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Royce Wallace.
Speaker 1: --Royce Wallace, yeah.  And just tell me about some of the girls and what they did after they danced with you.  I mean, what they were able to do.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think Roger had, they had reached their height, as I told you, and, and what they did in Cleveland [Ohio] when we worked together.  But I went to Atlanta [Georgia], and they were not as a group with me anymore.  But I had picked Roger out to see if she would--she hadn't finished college--come to Clark College [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and get her degree, and while she's getting it, to work with dance with me, with the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association].  And she said she would.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  But didn't Royce go out to be in Hollywood?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  And I think he wants to know, like people who are on Broadway.  Who was on Broadway?
Speaker 2: Well, some of that, but she's doing okay.  Yeah, and if, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, when she came there, I felt that we would do something, but we needed to get a place.  And so, Corrine [Corrine Johnson Falope] was in a school called Oglethorpe [Oglethorpe Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia] where all the professors' daughters went.  And I felt if I could get, I could get that gym and, and maybe interest some of those families in it, I'd have a background of three things--I'd have Roger, I'd have the African [Babatunde Olatunji], and I'd have some parents with kids.  And I could reproduce what I had done in Cleveland.  And that's what I tried to do.  And when we get--when he went to Africa and brought his drum back, that was it.  And Roger began to, to, to dance some of the dances he told her about, and the stories behind them.  That became one of the numbers that we worked on--we, we struggled with, and worked with.  And he would sing and beat the drums.  And actually, that first record that he made was based upon what he and Roger were doing.
Speaker 2: Right, I think it was 'Drums of Passion.'
Speaker 1: Right, 'Drums of Passion.'  You got this--well, you got all of it.
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Yeah.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: You just--well, maybe I've told it to the many people, Corrine.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it trickled down (laughter).
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Well, Olatunji is famous and Olatunji is famous.
Speaker 1: What about Funga now?  I know everybody does all the community groups and African centers and arts group in the '60s [1960s].  They're all the first dance they probably teach their little girls was Funga.  Remember that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Singing) "Funga Alafia, Ashe, Ashe."
Speaker 2: Ashe, you're right.
Speaker 1: (Singing) "Funga Alafia, Ashe, Ashe."
Speaker 2: He made dance live--with what he started.  He brought his African song.  Roger made him famous.  And then, groups everywhere began to take up, and then, he branched off.  He went up to a music place up in Boston [Massachusetts]--I can't think of the name of it.  You probably, in your research, would find it.
Speaker 1: Oh, is it Elma Lewis Playhouse [Elma Lewis Playhouse in the Park, Boston, Massachusetts], right?  Is it Elma Lewis--was it that?
Speaker 2: No, it's another one.  And he went up there, and just stirred up everybody.  I can't think of the name of it now.  It doesn't come to me, but I'm sure if you hit Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], it'll tell you as far as the history and, and where he went.  And the professor there was Williams [sic. Samuel Westerfield], I think, and Williams recommended him to study up there.  And he just went--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Oh, you mean, when he went to New York University [New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, no--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  --NYU [New York University]?  Or Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: No, he went to another place that was famous for music, and they made his African songs live.  I can't think of it now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that, you'd find in his history.  I don't know how they'd handle it 'cause I haven't done the history on Olatunji.  The only thing is, I have his original records that he sent me, 'Drums of Passion' with his "Lovingly to you, Margie [HistoryMaker Marjorie Witt Johnson]."
Speaker 1: Now, when you first met him, was he--you said he didn't even have his drum with him.
Speaker 2: He never have an African drum, not the--no, he had a drum, but it wasn't what he got.  "I'll bring you one made out of a tree."  And he brought the drum and, and started with it.  We thought--and I thought he was going to marry Roger, but it didn't work out that way.  She didn't want to go to Africa.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then, but she, she, she studied that dance to his beat.
Speaker 1: Roger Mae Johnson, she's still living in Cleveland, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, she is.
Speaker 1: She became a librarian, I think, I read?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Outstanding librarian--
Speaker 2: Storytelling.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  --fantastic storyteller.
Speaker 2: Storyteller, okay.  So--
Speaker 1: And Royce made it famous out in Hollywood.  And at the time, I was in touch with her, but she's lost it up here, and I don't know whether she's better or worse.
Story_ID: 344226
Speaker 1: How long did you stay in Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Was it ten years, mother?
Speaker 1: I think it was about ten years.  And then, I decided I wanted to go back to Cleveland [Ohio] because they were working on Desai [ph.].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they, they wanted me to come back.
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  And that's not one that was Desai, mother, unh-uh, but you came back to Cleveland, and then you went to North Carolina.  And when you came to go back to North Carolina, that was Desai.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's right.  It was a year later.  I, I, I devoted myself to the South, and I went to three or four different places.  One of them was, of course, the big one was Atlanta.  And then, the, the other was Charlotte's Spirit Square [Charlotte, North Carolina] for dance.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But you came back to--you were in Atlanta for about ten years.  And when did you, what year did you come back to Cleveland, yeah?
Speaker 1: Like she actually said, I, I went to North Carolina and did--
Speaker 2: First, oh, you went there first?
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Unh-uh.
Speaker 2: Second, after I left Atlanta--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I went to North Carolina to Spirit Square.
Speaker 1: So are we in the '60s [1960s] now?
Speaker 2: Yes, something up in there.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Yeah, I think that was '60 [1960].  Coming back to Cleveland was late '50s [1950s], yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  And then, she was here for quite a while before she went to North Carolina.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So, you came back to--
Speaker 1: Cleveland--
Speaker 2: --Cleveland in the late '50s [1950s]--
Speaker 1: Then I went back to--
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  She was working at Bellefaire [Bellefaire Orphanage; Bellefaire JCB, Cleveland, Ohio], mother, you were working at Bellefaire, weren't you?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was working at a Jewish place.
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  A treatment center--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  --for emotionally disturbed children.
Story_ID: 344227
Speaker 1: Tell me about graduate school [Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio], about getting your master's degree.
Speaker 2: I, I was trying--I'm hesitating because I was so caught up between how I had started, and the role that Ms. Coyle [Grace Coyle] had played.  And, and I felt I didn't do her justice enough.  And I came back, really, and I, I did a--didn't I do a, a--I think I did a tape to bring to life how I had gotten started.  And they did one with me at the Historical Society [Ohio Historical Society; Ohio History Connection].  And I eulogized--I'm  a little bit hazy here, but I, I, I think I eulogized Ms. Coyle because she had gotten--had stood by me so well when I was getting my master's degree in, in, in the arts.  And she was key to telling me, I think, as a group worker, it would be more effective if, if you were not out always showing the girls what to do, but letting it more come from them.  And I--that's when that issue came up, and became an integral part of my work.  And I, I, I wanted to give credit to her as one who had inspired me to allow the group to develop and to express themselves, and build on what they had already had found in the dance.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you spell her name?
Speaker 2: Grace Coyle, C-O-Y-L-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, she wrote a book called 'Democracy and Group Work' [sic. 'Group Experiences and Democratic Values,' Grace Coyle].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I used some of those phrases in her book--that you make your group more democratic if it comes from them, and not from you.
Speaker 1: That's that--okay.
Speaker 2: And there was--I'll always remember that one little girl had thick ankles.  And the girls used to say, she can't dance with those thick ankles.  I said, she can move and, of course, she moves, she reflects dance in her form.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have philosophy of dance--your own philosophy of dance?
Speaker 2: No, but I'm steadily getting one as I move along, trying to explain what it was that I (cough), what it was that I felt when I saw the dancers move at their own pace.
Story_ID: 344228
Speaker 1: You were recently honored in the City of Cleveland [Ohio].  There was a piece of choreography that was created to honor you called, 'Daughter of a Buffalo Soldier?'
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that was created by [HistoryMaker] Dianne McIntyre and some of the dancers at Karamu House [Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Michael, Michael Metcalf.
Speaker 1: Michael Metcalf, okay.  You want to tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  When she, when she came here, like you are here today, and was talking, I was telling her some of the stories that I think I've may have shared with you.  She was interested.  She said, "You know what I see?"  She said, "I think you have a book, a wonderful book."  And I said, "Well, I've been thinking of something like that, and I've been talking to my daughter [Corrine Johnson Falope] about it."  And she says, "Well, I do see a book."  But then, she went on to raise some of the same questions you've raised.  And then, I was eulogizing how we begin and, and how I felt about dance and my life in the West.  And I think that, that kind of ticked her off.  And when I saw the dance, I was just amazed at what they had done to it.  And, in fact, I didn't know they had so much information, excepting that I shared very much, having only one daughter, I felt that if it goes on, and my life goes on, I, I would like for it to go on with her, and our family, as we know it, and as fragmented as it is.  So, with that fragmentation in my, back of my mind, and with the thought of somehow being the daughter of a Buffalo Soldier, gave me a chance to talk about the place I loved, and had never been able to express what it meant to me in growing up.  And that's what I did.  And I think that they caught the mood.  Don't you, Corrine?
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Yes.  I, I think he would like to know--remember how Dianne would come over here, and talk to us?  She played music to make sure it was the right Brahms [Johannes Brahms], telling, you know, she worked hard on that.
Speaker 2: She came and she would ask about the girls and she'd ask about how they did this, and how they did that.  And then, I told her about Roger Mae [Roger Mae Johnson], and she spent a lot time with Roger Mae.  She never got to see Royce [Royce Wallace], but she heard about her.  And as I reviewed the thing, I thought how much courage those girls had in those days when dance was not top priority--not that kind of dance.  And, then, the way that people came to see what the 'Daughter of a Buffalo Soldier' might be like, was amazing.  And the way that people had related to it, and talked about it, had made me share with my daughter some of the early things that she has never heard because she was only one, and she went along with me.  But she wasn't able to go into all the intricacies I was going with what dance meant to me.  But I think she's caught the flavor of some of the stories.  And I've been encouraged to, to share more with her, so that, that whatever comes out, it'll be a part of being who I really am, and that is the daughter of a Buffalo Soldier.  I am a part of Bill [Bill Johnson].  I am a part of my father [William Witt] and, and what he meant to life, and certainly with the whole entourage of my family that I hadn't been close to.  I've been able to look back and kind of catch some of them, like a lasso, and I tell Corrine that often, it's like those lassos that the cowboys throw.  And then, they time themselves quickly to see if they've gotten it tied down.  And then, on top of that, it's, it turned really look at the buffalo to see what was he, that, that buffalo like.  And that's what I learned from one of her friends, the Clinton Cox [ph.], that, that the, that the reason they were called Buffalo Soldiers was because the black soldiers were so, so helpful to the Indians [Native Americans] when the, when the whites came over.  And, and as the book, a man told me about the other day, 'Red Clay and White Lies' [sic. 'Red Earth, White Lies: Native Americans and the Myth of Science Fact,' Vine Deloria, Jr.], and it's about the Red Indians, the soil, and the white lies that have been told about the land that the Indians were taken--was taken from.  And he said, "But tell her that," and he said, "'cause I think so wonderful that she has had Indians in her school and, and, and done, done work with them."  And when I told him how the Indians who have come, said, "We like her because she always tells the truth about our people," because she had, as a teacher, had a--I for-, always called it the wrong thing, but it was, was one of the places they lived in and made for themselves--

Speaker 1: Ma'am, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, what would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think my legacy is just what you're experiencing here, is my desire to reach and preach about the importance of relationships, and how you build on them and come up with something that is beautiful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is--when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any significant thing that you would do differently now?
Speaker 2: I probably would do more of the wraparound, the, the looping ideas that can be tied together and come up like the cowboy's lasso.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: That's an indelible picture in my mind, is this concept that I feel of the lasso, is wrapping it around and getting it together.  That's what I had did when I was in Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio], and then you come up with something that, that lives.  It's the legacy you asked me--I think is that I feel that there is something so beautiful in, in what one thinks and does well that it needs to be wrapped up and tied up in a neat, little, timely piece of art.
Story_ID: 344230
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I would like to feel that there is an acknowledgment of what is going on, and sensitive enough to make it if it's important to live.  If it's important to them, but to make it live in its--in a positive way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  To make what live, mother, to make what live (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I don't know if you've, far--to make the idea that one is seen, or one is feeling, just like this little girl says, "When I, when I come down the street," and she was talking, "And I'm just so hungry and I smell that barbecue."  And when I saw those girls in the dance group [Karamu Dancers] take that and make it live--that's what I'd like to see.  And it, it, through, in my mind, they threw their own feelings in, in this quest for a hungry stomach cry for a piece of their Hot Sauce Williams [Cleveland, Ohio].  And I saw that when Dianne [HistoryMaker Dianne McIntyre] did, had them do a dance around that.  And if she, if one can do that, makes, make the moment live, and that has meaning to someone that is experiencing it.  Do you understand what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah, to try to relate the truth of somebody's experience to the, to an audience, I guess--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --as a piece of art, right?.
Speaker 1: It's the spirit in which it was done.  When I saw it, I was just, I wanted to get up and I, if I hadn't been bed-ridden, been chair-ridden, I would have stood up, like I did in Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio] when I heard that piece of  music that, that brought in the drums in a piece of art music.  Do you follow me?
Speaker 2: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 1: Or am I, I far apart from--
Speaker 2: No, you're on track, you're on target.
Speaker 1: My focus is how do you make it live?  And, and I think many will remember, as 'A Daughter of a Buffalo Soldier' [sic. 'Daughter of a Buffalo Soldier'] the, the piece where, where the girls went down the street and smelled the barbecue, and their desire because their hunger to get it.  I don't know if you--
Speaker 2: I do, I think.
Speaker 1: --I, I don't feel I may, may not have it made clear, but that's the feeling I had.
Speaker 2: All right.  Thank you, thank you very much.
Story_ID: 344231
Speaker 1: Ma'am, let me ask you about--you've been involved in many different phases of the arts as an encouragement to people.  And I want you to talk about William Smith [William E. Smith], Skinny Smith.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What was your interaction with him?
Speaker 2: Well, I think she probably--Corrine [Corrine Johnson Falope] was so impressed by, as an educator, and I, I think that, that is her--her key is her protection of the, of the artistic awareness that the whole field of education provides.  Do you follow me?
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Well, no--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  --would you talk about Skinny?  How did you know him there at Karamu [Playhouse Settlement; Karamu House, Cleveland, Ohio]?  Can you go back there or is that too much?
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  And how you encouraged him?
Speaker 2: --no, all right now.  I'm a little confused as to which is the focus here as you see it.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Oh, I, I was just trying to get your interest in all the arts in, and how you had encouraged him, but that's okay--we don't have to go there.
Speaker 2: You're there?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You're their (unclear)--a question there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just wanted you to talk about your relationship with Skinny Smith, and how you helped him.
Speaker 2: When you say, your relationship, it's a, it's a broad term.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, how did you encourage him, and when did you first meet him and--
Speaker 2: I encouraged him because, first of all, I loved to dance with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And because I loved to dance with him, I learned how devoted he was to, to movement, and, and, and, and then how he used his awareness in, in drawing.  And I think if you look at the book--did she give you the book (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am, we saw the book.
Speaker 2: One of the things was, he saw my husband was Bill Johnson in a play, and the way he caught his face, and how he caught, you know, the contribution of the, the, of the earring and all, as, as a part of, of the picture, showed his sensitivity to, to--in his relationship with him to the arts.  And that art was, was, was in his hands because he could just draw a piece of, of a, a photo of someone who just got a paycheck, and you could get the idea of what that paycheck meant to him by the smile that he drew.  He took an umbrella stave, and he would carve on linoleum what he had in mind.  And I always felt that, that was extraordinary, that he could take a piece of umbrella stave, and carve out the expression of hope, of dejection.  The one I carried for such a long time had to do with a guy who, who couldn't find a job.  And then another one, was, was it a guy who--do you remember that story of Richard Wright, wrote of, of a boy who hacked up somebody and put him in this--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  'Native Son' [Richard Wright].
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'Native Son.'
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  'Native Son.'
Speaker 1: And, and, and, and any--he named the pictures, 'Native Son,' and the way that guy looked, you--long, lanky, never to be forgotten face of a guy, and he did that.  That's one phase of the--and then, there was a whole another series that he did of the, on the, the Underground Railroad, Harriet Tubman, and, and, and how she felt when some of the guys and gals didn't want to travel to leave the South.  And then another one, a white person was reaching down to hire a black fugitive who was hiding.  He could, he could catch the mood of it, and carve it out with his umbrella stave.  And those are a series, and the, the one that I like and, and thinking of using someway, somehow, before it's too late, is of, of, of the merry-go-round and his, his saying, where is a place that a black boy can ride?
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  From the Langston Hughes' poem ['Merry-Go-Round'].
Speaker 1: Well, from Langston Hughes' poem, but he took it from, from the literature and what-not, and that was, that's in (unclear).  You have probably haven't seen it, but to see those and have them brought out, I, I would still like to see something done with those things to make them live longer.

Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, ma'am.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  Weeks before the performance, or maybe a month before, this was the mailer that went out to advertise 'Daughter of a Buffalo Soldier.'  It has a picture of the cast in the background.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: We'll get yours.
Speaker 2: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  I mean--no, what I was going to say is I'll get the front of the program for you.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, ready? Can you tell me what that is?
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  This is the bulletin board that was right in front of the ticket sales desk.  And the picture behind is my mother, Mrs. Marjorie Witt Johnson, dancing on the beach on the shores of the Pacific Ocean years ago.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  They used, they used the same picture as the cover for the program.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right, ready.
Speaker 1: (CORRINE JOHNSON FALOPE):  This is Roger Mae Johnson, and she's one of the original Karamu Dancers.  This is at the reception, opening night at Karamu, and she had worked with the dancers to, you know, coach them into what had been done in the past.  So she was an integral part of the performance.
