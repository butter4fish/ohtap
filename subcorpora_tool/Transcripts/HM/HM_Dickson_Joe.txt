Down where the Grand Hotel [Grand Hotel Marriott Resort, Golf Club and Spa, Point Clear, Alabama] is down there, the grand bay.  I really--I really likes it down there.  I went down there with my wife [Charlie Dickson] once.  She was attending a conference at it and I got a chance to be by myself down there near the water and I really liked that.  But if I really was to take a--take a--spend some money, to really spend some money, I would go to Africa.  And just--I would like to go to Ghana.

Story_ID: 543223
Speaker 1: All right. Let's start with talking about your mother and her side of the family.  How far back in your mother's line can you go?
Speaker 2: Well you know, I can--my mother's mother I can remember her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They called her Ma.  And I can remember my--I guess that's my great-granddad.  His name was Willis, Willis Talley.  And my great-grandmother's name, I think her name was, I think it was Rachel [Rachel Talley].  They--we were living in Montgomery [Alabama] and we went to visit them down in Hopewell, Alabama where my mother was born in Hopewell, Alabama.  And we would go down there, my oldest brother [Robert Dickson, Jr.] and myself would go, we would go--it just wasn't too far from Montgomery.  We'd go down there and stay a week or so and then we would come back.  They were, they were kind of--if I remember she wore a band around her head all set around the head all the time.  Like, like some of the native people of Africa would wear.  And, and my grandfather was a, kind of a short man and I didn't never hear him say too much.  But one of the things that I remember about that they called him Pa and they had a, they had a--it wasn't, wasn't a stove in there it was a fire--something like a fire--fireplace.  And they had a pot that would swing in and out over that thing.  And she would, she would cook there.  And I noticed they had, they had at that time they had a table and when she would cook and they would--I guess they were out in the field or whatever but nobody ate anything 'til Pa came.  Nobody, nobody ate.  They was--it was a strange, as I reflect back now.  It was a strange situation because he was, he was kind of a little, little fella, but they, they it wasn't so much that they were afraid of him but they--he had the respect.  They say, "Well, well, well we gotta wait 'til Pa comes" (laughter).  And she was--she didn't talk too much.  But I noticed, it looked like she--my mother's name was Rachel, Mary Rachel [Rachel Payne Dickson].  That was--that's my mother's name.  And she looked like--looked like--look my mama just--it was her grandchild, look like she just stayed with her.  She just stuck up under her.  I couldn't never understand it.  Then later on I realized that she said that Ma was, was--mama was gone.  That Ma--that mama was gone said Ma they would go to the field and she was too little to go to the field and she would sometimes take water out there to the field, and she said that Ma looked like was--wouldn't let nobody bother her.  So it that's like my great-grandmother.  So that's as much as I can remember about my great-grandmother.  But now my grandfather I don't remember anything about on, on his side.  I got--but his name was, was Lucious Payne.  'Cause my youngest brother [Luther Dickson] is named after my great- I mean after my grandfather.
Story_ID: 543224
Speaker 1: But I do remember my [maternal] grandmother well.  She, she was, she was blind.  She was blind when, when we were--when I was born.  And I, and I know for the, for the most of the children under me she was blind.  But you wouldn't know it that she was blind because she did, she did everything that anybody blind--that was not blind would do.  And if you shook her hand, she would some way she would, she would do--if you shake her hand she'd do like this.  And you'd come back and you'd say, she say, "Who is that?"  And she, she'd shake your hand and she'd say--you say, "Well, this Dora [Dora Dickson]."  She said, "No this not Dora.  What you say your name was?  This is not Dora."  So then you'd tell her a name, she'd say, "Oh, well, yeah well baby I ain't met you," (laughter).  You know, yeah she was very protective of us.  'Cause I know (laughter) she would--my mother had, my mama, my mama had to work, you know.  And we were raised really by my mother's oldest sister and my mother.  Gertrude [Gertrude Payne]. So if when--when Rachel [Rachel Payne Dickson] would whoop somebody Ma Rachel [Rachel Talley Payne] would say, "Joe [HistoryMaker Joe Dickson], Robert [Robert Dickson, Jr.], bring that gal over here.  I told you, you don't, you don't--you can't whoop these children like this."  And so we, we'd go to her Great-grandma Rachel [Rachel Talley].  She wore a long dress too.  She wore a long dress and had a--she would--she had her hair was kind of white like yours and, and what may--the thing that all of us remember about Ma Rachel was this, Ma Rachel was--could--was blind but she cut all of our hair off.  All of it.  And you would, you would the people that see wouldn't know that that would she have it covered up and it was all--it would grow back.  It would all grow back long.  She would--she could--she was doing anything anybody else would do.  Her name was Rachel Payne.  She was, she was the youngest of that, of that--my, my great-great-grandfather's [sic. great-grandfather] children.  She was the youngest.  And her name was Rachel.  My mother was the youngest and her name was Mary Rachel.  She was named after my grandmamma and my great-grandmother.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: All right.  Now, we were talking--you were actually talking about your great-grandmother, right?
Speaker 1: Talking about, first I was talking about my great-grandmother (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then I segued into my grandmother.
Speaker 2: Your grandmother.  And your grandmother was the one who was blind?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.
Story_ID: 543225
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about where they lived?  The land, did they own the land?  Did they sharecrop?
Speaker 2: I really don't know.  I don't think they owned the land.  I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because there--there were about thirteen or fourteen of them.  My Uncle Marion [Marion Talley] was the--he was a twin.  And he was the last one to die.  And if I'm not mistaken he was the youngest one.  He was about--Uncle Marion probably had to be about seventy-five or eighty when he died.  And was nothing wrong with him.  I went down there to see him and talk with him 'cause --'cause he used to live here in Birmingham [Alabama] with the U.S. Steel [United States Steel Corporation] he and he and his brother.  It was Marion and David [David Talley], they were both my great uncles.  And Uncle Marion after we got here to Birmingham he would be the one that would always come by to see about, make sure that we were eating and everything was going right and we were school.  So he lived--his--he died in Montgomery [Alabama].  He lived in Montgomery but you know when the people moved from the farms all those fellas went from the farm, some of them went to Ohio, some they were, they were Talleys, and some of them went to Ohio, some went to New York, some went to California, they spread everywhere.  But Uncle Marion's children, the base children, Marion, Jr. [ph.] and David [ph.], his boys, they lived in Montgomery.  So that was the base for them in Montgomery, Alabama.  And 'cause Uncle David was here in Birmingham.  He died here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they--it's Montgomery and, and Birmingham.
Story_ID: 543226
Speaker 1: Now tell me about your mother [Rachel Payne Dickson].  Did she share any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: This--I was telling you about how she said that didn't nobody really help her but, but Ma [Rachel Talley Payne], her grandmother [sic. mother].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: She, she--mama told me, told us that--that (laughter) she told us that she had been cooking ever since she was ten years old.  She said, "I used to, I used to go with Ma to the white folks kitchen.  I was cooking in the white folks kitchen and, and Ma would let me travel with them and let me go with them."  She said, "I went, I went to went to France."  And I said, "You went France?"   She said, "Yeah, I went to France."  I said, "What you do there?"  She said, "I was cooking."  Said, "I went everywhere they went.  'Cause I was--I was the cook."  I said, "Hm."   I told Robert [Robert Dickson, Jr.], I said, my brother, Robert I said, "Hm."  He looks at me and she said, "Yeah.  I've been cooking since I was thirteen."  And--since she was ten.  Said, "I've been--I've been working in, I've been working in--," she was a--my mother was a--was a domestic.
Story_ID: 543227
Speaker 1: I said, I told her [Dickson's mother, Rachel Payne Dickson], "When'd you go to school?"  She said, "People didn't go to school.  Most of the people--but most of the time," said, "they worked on the fields."  So that means, I think that that would meant that they were sharecropping with somebody because everybody had to work.  But when they moved to Montgomery [Alabama] she said that she went to State Normal School [State Normal School for Colored Students] for a little while and that was Alabama State [Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama].  They lived on the west side of--of Montgomery and that weren't that many--it was near Washington Park [Montgomery, Alabama].  There weren't that many schools on that side of, of west Montgomery.  So she said, they had to go to State and Normal training school and there she learned how to sew.  But she still--they had a shirt factory I think she said she worked at a shirt factory.  But the--mainly my mother worked as a domestic all of her life.  And she--with Robert [Robert Dickson, Jr.] and myself we were talking the other day she--my--my mother worked as a domestic, but she was a smart woman.  I don't know if, if the--what they were teaching was there or if it was just innateness, that--that allowed her to, to--develop.  She had five--had six children.  I had a sister that was older.  I got a brother older and then me and there was a brother under me and a sister and another brother.  But she worked and she--she just--I remember her teaching Robert how to--how to do his ABCs and--and how to count.  She taught him to count to a hundred.
Story_ID: 543228
Speaker 1: We were going to this Catholic kindergarten off Day--may have been off of Day Street, not off Day Street it--we went up Bell Street [Montgomery, Alabama] and there was a Catholic--a lot of nuns there.  And the reason I remember this, I raced through the fence to just pick up some pecans and the, the--they would have a ruler and they beat me with that ruler so much.  I went--got home and I told my daddy I said--we called my daddy Robert [Robert Dickson, Sr.] at the time we, we--he was so glad we could talk I guess he let it go.  So I said, "I'm not going back," (laughter).  "I'm not going back."  So he said, "You got to learn your ABCs. You got to go to school."  Mama [Rachel Payne Dickson] had to work and my dad worked at the sawmill before he died.  So she told Robert [Robert Dickson, Jr.] she said, "I'm gonna show you how to write your name one more time."  And then he was counting good and I'm sitting I was younger--to watching him.  And he didn't write his name right.  She whipped him and she said, "Now write your name."  Robert wrote his name, the same way he wrote that day, he writes it that way this day.  He taught me how to write my name, (laughter) some ABCs.  He taught Clarence Willie James [Clarence Dickson (ph.)], (laughter) how.  He taught Joe [HistoryMaker Joe Dickson], he taught Dora [Dora Dickson], and he taught Luther [Luther Dickson] how to write his name.  If you carefully examine how we write our names, all of us write somewhat the way he write his name.  And that's far as--mama had--mama worked.  And we had to teach, teach each other how to get our lesson and--and be good at school and stuff like that.  I was the baddest one though you know.
Story_ID: 543229
Speaker 1: But other than that.  She--mama [Rachel Payne Dickson], our mama did real good with us I think.  She, she did real--she was blessed.  You know, she was real--she--she was a hard worker.  She--she'd make us--mama would--you had to wash all those clothes on Saturday.  We li- we when I was--let's not go there now.  Let me tell you this.  When she learned how to sew we used to stand--we lived-- remember we--you know when you start remembering about where you are.  We lived on the Mobile Road and that was the main--main thoroughfare going to Mobile [Alabama].  And it was--it was a lot--a lot of houses and stuff in them.  And Bethel Church [Bethel Missionary Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama] was right across the street and every Sunday morning Robert [Robert Dickson, Jr.] and myself we'd stand there holding hands 'til somebody come and take us across the street to the church.  We'd be in that church all, all day.  Sunday school, eleventh day--eleven hour service, BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union of America].  And the thing was the suits that we wore to church, mama made them.  She could sew.  She could--she could really sew.  She made those.  And then you--you stayed there and you got those Sunday school cards and--and Robert would make me read them.  I didn't wanna--wanna read them.  He would make me read them.  And--and make me (laughter).  It was--it was, you know, when you look back on it, it was a lot of fun 'cause you, I mean you really don't know what you're doing, but that was--it was even though we were, even though we were little we didn't even know we was li- where we were living, we really didn't.  Because we were young and everybody--everybody was, was striving to--to they always tell me you gonna have to try to be, be somebody boy you gone have to--and get--get your lesson, get your books.
Story_ID: 543230
Speaker 1: But in, in 1938 and arou- it may be a year before that, people were getting whooping cough.  And people were getting--having what is called the eighth day pneumonia.  I don't know if, if anybody taught you, if you talked--anybody said anything about this though.  The eighth day pneumonia was that, it was a--it was a--you would get a cold of some kind and your lungs would be infused and if you didn't get better by the eighth day, you died.  My daddy had the eighth day pneumonia.  He died.  My brother, Clarence [Clarence Dickson (ph.)], the one that was next to me, he had the eighth day pneumonia, but he didn't die.  My brother, Robert [Robert Dickson, Jr.], had the whooping cough and it bothered him.  So it was--it was--and then some of these people say, "Well I'm not gone take the flu shot."  You need to take it.  Excuse me, "I'm not gone take the pneumonia shot."  You need to take it, 'cause it's real.  'Cause I know my father died in 1938, that Luther [Luther Dickson] was not born then.  He was born that June right after father died that May.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So when he died I was in the room right there with the rest of the children when they took him away.  But people, people would be sick they wasn't, wasn't at the hospital.  They would, they would put towel and stuff on you, so you can get the cold out of you and stuff like that.  They did a lot of doctoring on themselves.  And some of them got well and some of them.  But that eight day pneumonia was something that was going through.  So when Robert [Robert Dickson, Sr.] died, we--my mother [Rachel Payne Dickson] had a sister (background noise) that lived right, right next--right behind us.  And after she died, my--the sister had about four or five children, her husband had died with pneumonia or tuberculosis.  And she died of childbirth after my father died.  So all those children came to my mother.  And she was the smallest one.  She had one brother there, Glover [Glover Payne].  So my mama's oldest sister [Gertrude Payne] from Birmingham [Alabama] they had moved--come to Birmingham my (unclear) came to Birmingham--moved to Birmingham so she said, "Well there's no way in the world that Bett [ph.] can take of all those kids and--and there was no way and she trying to work."  So after they buried my father and for--I guess about, we, we might have stayed there a year.  We didn't stay there a year.  They came to Montgomery [Alabama], my aunt came and--and brought us to Birmingham.  We lived with her out in Fairfield [Alabama].
Story_ID: 543231
Speaker 1: Before we go on to you moving to Birmingham [Alabama].  Let's go back and talk about your father [Robert Dickson, Sr.].  Because at this point we know that he, he dies in 1937.
Speaker 2: Thirty-eight [1938] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But--'38 [1938].  Okay.  Let's talk about where he was born and his mother and father, if you know that information.
Speaker 2: My father was born in--in Hayneville, Alabama.  In Lowndes County [Alabama].  That's the county re- is adjacent to Montgomery County [Alabama].  And his father's name was-- oh, well my--his mother's name was Elizabeth [Elizabeth Dickson].  And my father's--grandfather's name was Sam.  Sam, Sam Dickson, Sr. because he had a son named after him.  He lived on Mr. Bob Dickson's [Robert Stiles Dickson] plantation.  They--they--they came up on Mr. Bob Dickson's plantation [Dicksonia Plantation] in--in Montgomery [Alabama]--in Montgomery or I mean I'm sorry in Haynesville [sic. Lowndesboro, Alabama] down there.  They were born, as far as we can when we look back they, they were born there.  And if I'm not mistaken they came through south--through Virginia or South Carolina down to, to, to that plantation down there.  They were--they were born in the 1800s and I didn't get a--I didn't--my grandfather was there when my father died.  But I don't--I don't remember anything or any talking--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --to him or anything like that.  I think, I can remember he brought Robert, Robert, Jr. [Robert Dickson, Jr.] and myself to Birmingham once on a train.  The first time we rode on a train.  And then I guess we cried so bad they sent us--they sent us back down there.  But I don't remember--I don't remember any of that.  I don't even remember seeing my great-grandmother.  There were about twelve or thirteen of those folk 'cause --'cause the last one of them that died was the youngest one.  Her name was--was--was we called her Aunt Lizzy, but her name was Elizabeth [Elizabeth Dickson].  She died in Montgomery about four years ago.  She was about ninety-four, ninety-four, ninety-five, but she did tell me that--we--I'd talked to her and she tell--well Uncle Sam [Sam Dickson, Jr.] died before she did, but they lived down there on that--on that man's place.  The man was--was he was the man in that county down there.  Everybody tell me about that.  Tell me that he would--you couldn't leave that place.  You had to stay there and work.  If--they say if--and he didn't care who it was, if--if another white man came and tried to get his workers off of that farm, that was--that was--it was wild west down there.  He didn't play that.  Some of my uncles slipped off in the night.  We don't know where, we don't know where--where they went, but they just didn't wanna be down there on that farm.  We don't know where they went.  We managed to keep up with my Uncle Sam. He was in West Virginia.  'Cause I remember--cause I remember Sam because he told Rachel [Rachel Payne Dickson] to let us go with him.  And then we had Eddie [Eddie Dickson]; and Edgar [ph.]; Jim [Jim Dickson]; Johnny [Johnny Dickson]; sister, Mollie [Mollie Dickson]; Lizzy; Annie [ph.]; and this--those are the ones that I can remember.  But some of those others I don't remember because they scattered.
Story_ID: 543232
Speaker 1: But my dad before he died he worked at a sawmill there in--in Montgomery [Alabama].  They--what they call a sawmill, but I think it was a cotton seed plant.  When, when 'cause a lot of cotton was grown down there.  And I guess they took the cotton seed and made cotton seed oil.  He--that's what--that's where he was working when he died.  And he has--we found some carpenter tools.  So we believe he probably was doing carpentry work on--on the side or something like when-when he work.  But that's pretty much as much as I can remember.  I know--I know that he was--when we would go visit my grandmother [Elizabeth Dickson] he would never let us--wouldn't let them give us nothing--he wouldn't--he would say, "No."  He was great.  He was (laughter).  He, he knew when he didn't want you to eat at nobody house.  But that was the general rule then.  You couldn't eat at anybody's house.  And you couldn't charge nobody for no work you do for them you know.  He was you--we couldn't eat.  We, we couldn't stay over there.  We couldn't eat over there.  He wanted his children with him.  And--but when he died, I don't even think social security was in effect then.  So that's why I said mama [Rachel Payne Dickson], worked real hard 'cause we didn't--there was no help.  And people didn't wanna accept welfare.  They didn't call it welfare, they called it relief.  They didn't wanna accept that.  They--you had to work.  And everybody in the house worked.  But it was--Robert [Robert Dickson, Sr.] was--was probably--my dad probably was the youngest one of them.  It was, it was either he or Johnny [Johnny Dickson], but I think--I keep up with Johnny's children, but Sam [Sam Dickson, Jr.] didn't have any and Ma--Annie [ph.] didn't have any.  And Jim [Jim Dickson] didn't have any children.  Ed- Eddie [Eddie Dickson] didn't have any.  So--so my dad had more, more out of that clan--that group he had more, had the five.  So it wasn't that much but there were other cousins and brothers to my grandfather [Sam Dickson, Sr.].  He had--he had a lot of brothers and cousins and things that are--that are down--they're still down there in the Lowndes County [Alabama] south of Montgomery.  But my dad died real, real young.
Story_ID: 543233
Speaker 1: So now you moved to Birmingham [Alabama].  So tell me what happens next?
Speaker 2: When we moved to Birmingham that was--that was a very, very interesting thing.  I had to be in around the third grade when we moved here.  The reason I remember is--is because when we moved from--from Montgomery [Alabama] to Birmingham, Robert [Robert Dickson, Jr.] was in school and I was in school.  Robert was ahead of me, maybe a grade or two, but I know this, they put us back a year.  They didn't--they didn't test you, they just put you back a year.  And we lived with my--my mother's oldest sister [Gertrude Payne] and her husband.  And--and it was--it was based on, you know, how can I say.  He was a--my--my uncle, my--my aunt's husband, was a guy like this.  You or nobody else better not say nothing or do nothing to none of us.  But he was crazy (laughter).  I don't mean--I mean he was--he had--he suffered with asthma, and he would--he would--he couldn't sleep and he couldn't do stuff so we'd be sitting there.  Here you got Juanita [ph.], Lucille [ph.], Willie Fred [ph.], Robert, Jr., and Joe [HistoryMaker Joe Dickson], Clarence [Clarence Dickson (ph.)], Thomas [ph.], Ernest [ph.], ten (unclear) children in a three room house.  Some of us sit there--you had a bed in the front room, a bed in the next room.  And they had a stove in the kitchen.  And there was no sink, you know.  People washed dishes in the dish pan.  The hydrant was in the--in the middle of the block.  And then it--something happened to it and they moved it under the tree down near the end of the block.  So you had to bring the water from the hydrant to the house and you got to wash clothes for all those folk on Saturday.  You got three tubs.  You washed once in this tub.  And you wash again in the other tub.  And you rinse them two times.  Then you put them in the tub with the bluing.  You don't remember bluing?  You put the bluing in them to make them whiter and cleaner and put them last.  And we had to do that, 'cause there was only--there was only one girl.  So it was, it was, it was an exciting--it was, it was very interesting.  And I know this, I tried--I got my brothers and sisters and we were about to run away.
Story_ID: 543234
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were gonna tell me why you were gonna run away.
Speaker 2: We were gonna r- we were gonna run away (laughter).  We--my uncle was just, he was just mean.  And we would cut grass and stuff and we had saved some money and we put it in a can and buried it under the house.  And so I told Robert [Robert Dickson, Jr.], I said, "Robert I'm not gonna put up with this."  I said, "'Cause Sam [Sam Dickson, Jr.] we could--we can come and live with him.  And mama [Rachel Payne Dickson] up there working up there in them four houses and we down here."  And I said, "And they worrying us.  We got to tote and carry all the water and do all this foolishness and stuff."  And I said, "We--I'm--we don't have to do this.  We don't have to stay here."  'Cause you know what we had to do?  When you got up in the morning it weren't no such thing as you didn't have anything to do.  You couldn't--we couldn't get up and sit on the porch.  We got up, we swept the yard.  If we--we when sat up and got through sweeping the yard, we would sweep up under the house and put a (unclear)--sweep up under it with the broom.  The--my Aunt Gertrude [Gertrude Payne] would have us scrub those floors.  And they were--she would make us sweep that floor over and over again, it looked like it had been mopped.  We --we swept the floors, we mopped, we carried that water from, from that other head of that block to the next end of the block.  The toilets were right back there and they had hog pens over there.  It was--it was--I just thought there was something, something better.  And mama was--was living in, and when she would come home to us it was the weekend, you know.  And so, so it's just we know--at least I thought it was better to go with--with my Uncle Sam.  And so that night we were gonna--we were gonna leave.   I said, "Y'all just sit here on the porch."  Somebody must have snitched and told him 'cause just as I was getting ready to get up I said, "Well, Joe [HistoryMaker Joe Dickson] and Robert how we gonna there?"  And we were gonna walk (laughter).  And they were--they were going with me.  So just as we were getting ready to go they said he said, my, my--we had an older cousin she said, "Mama want you."  Mama--my aunt had came out there she said, "Where y'all finna go?"   I said, "We--," and they--they didn't say nothing.  I said, "Well we finna go and stay with my Uncle Sam."  She said, "You finna go with your Uncle Sam then, how you gonna get there?"  "Well we gonna walk."  I just got--I just got mad, mad crying and mad and going on.  And then she tried to explain to us that what they were trying to do trying to teach us what we need to do and this kind of thing.  But you know how you had every room occupied and every space on the floor occupied at night.  People were sleeping on pallets, sleeping on, on the floor, we were sleeping on the floor.  And you could see through--through the floor 'cause the houses didn't have no--no--no it was just wood.  Woodframe wood you could see right straight through the floor.  So Uncle Sam  he didn't have any children and then I felt that if we went to stay with Uncle Sam and Willie Fred [ph.] my other cousins, well my aunt's children, they would--it would be better for them too.  So they caught us here.  Somehow we had got in touch with mama.  She came over there crying and going on.  And I said, "Mama, we just can't stay like this."  I said, "Well, get us a project."  "No Lord.  No.  I ain't gonna stay in no project.  People come in your house and they go through your things and check all your stuff out or get in stuff."  Said, "I ain't gonna stay in no projects."  I said, "Mama, you gonna have to get us somewhere to stay or we, we gonna run away.  We gonna--we gonna leave."  So she was crying and she got us a two room house on the Avenue D up there in Fairfield [Alabama].  Still a bed in the kitchen, a bed everywhere.  So and my sister [Dora Dickson] was in the bed so I was saying, "Mama, we need to get out of here.  We need to--we need to move.  They got houses in the projects."  "Well, I don't wanna live in them."  "Mama, you gonna have to do something."  So finally she broke in and we moved into the projects up there.  But we was gonna run away sister, we was gonna get away from that.  Yeah.  I don't--we were gonna leave.  'Cause Robert [Robert Dickson, Sr.] left me in charge of them.  I wasn't the oldest, but I was there when he died.  So he left me in charge.  So they went--they had to do what I say--what I tell them to do 'cause that's what my daddy told me to do.

Speaker 1: Tell me about school, when you made this transition.
Speaker 2: Well you know when we came to, to Birmingham [Alabama] I think we--I was in Ms. Woodruff's [ph.] room.  Dick Arrington [Richard Arrington, Jr.] was in that class.  Willie Walker [ph.] and all those guys, I said, they were, they were, they were--I didn't know I thought it was--I didn't know they may have been under the same circumstances, but there wasn't as many people at their house as was at our house.  So we were, we were never--Robert [Robert Dickson, Jr.] was smart.  And he made us like that.  So we were never--I never thought that we was supposed to be put back a grade.  But it didn't make it that much different really 'cause we didn't know that anybody anyway. The people we were in school with in Montgomery [Alabama].  So Robert went to Ms. Williams' [ph.] class and I was in Ms. Woodruff's class.  And we--it was a fast pace.  It was 61st Street school [Robinson Elementary School].  It was--it was in Fairfield, Alabama.  It was later named to Robinson Elementary.  But at the time I went, it was 61st Street school.  Ms. Robinson [Esther Robinson] was the principal.  It was a wooden building.  We--when we started out in that, in those wooden buildings.  The building was up here on that end of the, the property.  On the other end of the property down that way were the bathrooms.  And the playground was in between the bathrooms and that.  And in that--in that wooden--in those wooden buildings, there was a big stove in there that that we put wood or coal or whatever we kept it, kept it up.  And we played right there.  And we got the books that the white folks sent from, from after they used them.  The desks, the, the desks we got that's what we got.  But the good thing about that whole in school thing, that we had some teachers that really wanted us to learn.  They stayed on us.  They, they talking about you can't whoop a child now, if you don't have no discipline, you don't have anything.  That's what the problem, one of the problems with school.  They had discipline.  You didn't clown in those schools.  And you didn't act no ruffian in there.  You were in school to get your lesson.  And I think that I was at Robinson Elementary from the third grade until we moved over to the eighth grade.  They kept all the students together and all these students went--weren't no middle school, weren't no in between.  You went from the first to the seventh grade and then from the seventh grade you got promoted to the eighth, and from the eighth to the twelfth.

Speaker 1: I remember--the most memorable thing that I remember about elementary school [Robinson Elementary School, Fairfield, Alabama] was this, two things.  Mama [Rachel Payne Dickson] would be going to work and Robert, Jr. [Robert Dickson, Jr.] was, was in charge.  What Robert, Jr. say that goes.  She said, "If Robert, Jr. wrong, I'm wrong."  She said, "I'll whoop Robert, Jr.'s ass when I come back, but you do what Robert, Jr. tell you to do or you see me."  Well (laughter) we would get up in the morning and we got to get the rest of the children ready to go to school.  We'd be late every morning.  And I was in the fifth grade in Ms. Yarbrough's [ph.] class.  And in that time the smartest boy sat on the front row, on the first seat.  And then the next smartest boy was in the next seat.  They, they developed that competition where you, you, you want to get your lesson, you wanna do good.  So I said I'm--my seat is on the front seat and every day I'm late.  And I'd go in there crying.  I remember the last day I went in there crying, Ms. Yarbrough told me--and I didn't know then and it made a hell of an impression on me now.  She said, "Dickson [HistoryMaker Joe Dickson] you come every day."  Said, "Whenever you come, just come.  Don't worry about it.  Don't cry, just come."  I never will forget that.  And then the other thing that I remember about being in elementary school, I was the best speller in that--in the school when I was over there.  And that was my last year.  And my first one they had--they had two sections.  They had one side on, on--Ms., Ms. Vaughn [ph.] had one side.  Ms. Moore [ph.] had one side.  (Unclear) and them was in Ms. Vaughn's side and I was Ms. Moore's side.  And we had a spelling match one day.  And we, we beat them.  I was in the sixth grade we beat them.  And everybody was--I sat everybody down.  And then she called one more word to me.  And I intentionally misspelled it.  And I remember the way Ms. Moore looked when she looked at me.  She--don't you--she was the only somebody called me Jonathan (laughter).  She said--she looked at me like this, and then it was over.  I had sat everybody down.  We got back over to our class, she brought me--they had a coat room--they had a coat room where you hang your coats on the thing in the back.  She said, "Jonathan, come back here I wanna talk to you.  I wanna--come over here and ask you something."  So she had this spelling book.  She called the word out to me, I spelled it just like that.  And she had this strap (laughter).  She beat me so bad (laughter).  She said, "Boy as long as you live, quit taking things for granted.  Quit assuming.  Step up and do what you supposed to do.  Don't assume.  You knew you could spell that word. Now get back over there and sit down."  I never forgot that.

Speaker 1: Then we went to high school [Fairfield Industrial High School, Fairfield, Alabama].  We got into high school we, we had better teachers.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We had--go ahead.
Speaker 2: Before we go to high school.  I wanna ask you about any activities in elementary school [Robinson Elementary School, Fairfield, Alabama].  Did you belong to any organizations?  Did you play baseball?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't play baseball.  Mama [Rachel Payne Dickson] wouldn't--
Speaker 2: Basketball (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) let us play baseball.  Mama said, "You all play baseball you get hurt I can't--."  She started crying.  And I didn't know then what that was about.  'Cause we were big old, strapping boys.  Little peas and greens and things, you know.  And people weren't sniff--smoking and going on (laughter) and stuff like that.  She said, "Well, you can't play."  Said, "'Cause if you play, you gonna get hurt.  And you get hurt I can't--I can't take you to a doctor."  I knew weren't--weren't nothing going--I can't--she--we couldn't play no baseb- I had a paper route.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I had the biggest paper route in Fairfield [Alabama].  And I got that paper route 'cause I worked with two, two guys.  I started out working with a guy named Alex Brooks [ph.].  Alex Brooks' daddy had gone to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  And, you know, he got a good--he was one of the best paper hangers and painters out there.  But Mr., Mr. Brooks sent all his boys either to Tuskegee or Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  And Alex, I was working with him and, they brother, Frank [ph.] was in my class, but Frank didn't work with Alex.  Alex had a, had a twin named Dan [ph.].  Frank worked--Frank would have seizures, so they, they kind of--he was the youngest boy.  So I worked with Alex and there was another guy named Wilbur Hughes [ph.] and one named Edward Hicks [ph.].  So they had the paper routes and they would, would--and then when the newspaper put together, they would--they would send the Parade magazine or whatever the magazine was, and they send the funnies and they send the social section out.  We put that together midweek.  And then they send the regular section of the newspaper on Saturday.  So I was tied into those guys who were putting the newspaper together, and who were, were, were had the biggest paper routes.  Excuse me.  I graduated from feeding the hogs to being the paper boy.  And I had--I worked with Hicks, and when they was--when they finished high school, they gave me that route.  So I had the route, so I hired my brothers.  I had Robert [Robert Dickson, Jr.]--gave Robert one side.  He and Dora [Dora Dickson] and Luther [Luther Dickson] one side and I took the other side.  So I grew up throwing papers.  When I got out of school, I had to go throw papers.
Story_ID: 543238
Speaker 1: So while I was in school though, I didn't, didn't, didn't participate in any sports. But we were the smartest boys in the school, me and my brothers.  We were the smartest boys there.  And you know we, we were the smartest boys because that's all we had to offer.  I--Robert [Robert Dickson, jr.] said that's all we need.  We didn't have nothing else to offer.  All of us in that house, everybody daddy working and at the plant and the coal mine and everything else, so the only thing that made us okay was we, we were real smart boys.  I was president of my class from the first grade to my junior year in college [Miles College, Fairfield, Alabama].  That's right.  And I--we participated in and I, I never really, I never really solicited or run for office, but people liked me 'cause I would do stuff.  I wouldn't let nobody pick on you.  And I wouldn't let nobody pick on him.  I didn't bother anybody, but I wouldn't let nobody pick on, on him.  My brother was, he was quiet, preacher type and the others, the other brothers he was a nerd.  And the youngest brother was a nerd.  And the boy next to me, he was--he was like somewhat like me but a little more, more, more he didn't--he just--he was out there.  But I was the guy that was, was all right with everybody you know.  So I got, got elected.  And I'd help you get your lesson (laughter) and, you know.  But it was stuff like that.  So I wouldn't--didn't play no sports though.
Speaker 2: Did you read a lot?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.  I read a lot.  Alex Brooks [ph.] that's, that's why I remember Alex.  And I told you he would make me read.  I would read--he would make me read the newspaper.  Our teachers would make you read the newspaper to keep up with what was going on.  He would make me read books.  He would--he would question me about those books and stuff.  And, and that's and that's how I got in it.  You know they still stuck with me now.  I stay at Barnes and Noble [Barnes and Noble Booksellers, Inc.] all day, come on it's time to come home now, you know.  But I--I just got that habit.  And I got it from those guys.  I got it from Robert.  And that competition we had going there.

Speaker 1: Now you go on to high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What's the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: At the time it was Fairfield Industrial High School [Fairfield, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the principal was E.J. Oliver.  Oliver was, was some man.  He was something, he was, he was, he was--he was a real educator.  He was a Booker T. Washingtonian educator.  He believed that you had to learn how to do something with your head as well as your hands.  You had to--the school--the high school that I went to, you had read before you graduate 'Up From Slavery' by Booker T. Washington and outline it.  And that was--we took Negro history by Carter G. Woodson when I was in high school.  When you--when you--when you made the honor roll, Oliver would--Mr. Oliver would parade any--everybody who made the honor roll, he would parade them across the, the rostrum every weekend.  Robert Dickson [Robert Dickson, Jr.], honor roll, second semester.  Continuing last year's work.  That's my oldest brother.  While I was playing and running, trying to run a little gang and do stuff.  He getting lessons and I said, "I can't let him make the honor roll and I don't make the honor roll" (laughter) you know.
Story_ID: 543240
Speaker 1: I was playful.  I went to summer school every year I was in summer school--every year I was in high school, I went to summer school.  And I finished valedictorian of, of my class. McPherson [ph.] was, was--not valedictorian, I was salutatorian.  McPherson was valedictorian.  I went to summer school 'cause Mr. Oliver [E.J. Oliver] said I didn't know how to act (laughter).  Just the truth is, I was elected president of the senior class and I was on suspension from school.  I mean this--you (laughter)--
Speaker 2: What were some of the things that you did to--
Speaker 1: I just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) warrant you being under suspension?
Speaker 1: Getting in other folks' business.  Not even, you know.  Somebody was saying something you don't have any business saying.  You know just, just, I guess I was--you know I told somebody don't nobody ask me about it I believe I was just mad 'cause I remember I used to ask my mama [Rachel Payne Dickson], "Why God gotta kill my daddy [Robert Dickson, Sr.]?  Why, why he didn't kill somebody else daddy?"  Mama said, "Boy you don't say this."  She said--she trying to explain to me and I stayed, I guess, I was just mad.  I, I was just--I always thought I had to go and do something I ain't got no business in and help somebody (laughter) else.  But I stayed in--into something.  And for somebody else's stuff, you know.  I remember one time a boy drew a pistol on the Clarence Edmondson [ph.].  See we had--we had three, three sections of the city went to our school.  People from Englewood and Addisberg [ph.] and what they call on the height up there.  When you--Englewood and Addisberg  was down there by the tar ditch and what they had to do, they had to walk past Fairfield School [Fairfield High School; Fairfield Preparatory School, Fairfield, Alabama] up to our school [Fairfield Industrial High School, Fairfield, Alabama].  They had an elementary school in Englewood, but they walked past the high school to come to our school.  So when you mixed those kids from down in Englewood--and we were living in a different situation cause the lot--a lot of folks in Fairfield [Alabama] had houses.  Most of the people in Englewood were living in--in rented houses.  So they--I find out later I got it wrong.  They said the people from Fairfield looked down on them.  But I ain't never thought about it like that.  And people from, from, from Fairfield would do different stuff to people who came from Englewood.  And I didn't know then, but when I think about it now, that literally probably was my--my base, my voter base (laughter).  The people who really--'cause I would go down there to (unclear) and this and when they got into something, they would come get me.  This boy had a pistol on--on drew a pistol on a boy and I walked up on him and took the pistol from him and slapped him.  And told him don't do that and gave it back to him.  Now you know that was crazy.  And oh, when it got back to Mr. Oliver the only somebody that that the boy was into they didn't do nothing.  He said, "Dickson [HistoryMaker Joe Dickson] you should have come to the office."  He did--they did everything to make me be not so mischievous, like that teacher whooped me for doing that.  I don't--I don't know I just was, was like that. I, I don't understand what it was about.
Story_ID: 543241
Speaker 1: One day after I had gone to law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] and come back, I was sitting right there on the alley.  Mr. Oliver [E.J. Oliver] passed through there 'cause he used to sell funeral plots.  And he stopped.  He said, "Dickson [HistoryMaker Joe Dickson] come here."  I said that's, that's (unclear) Oliver (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So I came back.  We sat right there on it's a little iron rail that we set on.  He said, "Dickson I want you to know I'm proud of you."  He said, "I didn't know what to do with you.  I kept sending you to summer school and--but I'm really proud of you.  You turned out all right."  And I asked him one question.  I said, "How did you teach Negro history at Fairfield [Fairfield Industrial High School, Fairfield, Alabama]?"  He told me that they told him not to.  But he told B.B. Baker the principal--I mean the superintendent that that they brought in, that there was no way for him to do anything with these--his exact words, he said, "I can't do nothing with these big strapping youth coming off the--coming off the farm.  Never been anywhere.   How can I--I got to teach them something about themselves."  He said he called him Elijah.  His name was Elijah James Oliver.  That's my principal name.  Everybody called him E.J. but his name is Elijah. "You can't do it." Said, "They're not gonna want you to do it. They'll take my job."  He said, "Well what can I do?"  He said he made a commitment--got a commitment from the church.  He got a commitment from the, from the, the parents said he was gone educate them and, and the superintendent said, "You can't do it."  He said, "I gotta do it."  So he said, "Okay.  You do it, but if you do and you say I told you say if they come in there and see it, I'll deny it."  He taught us Negro history and that's one of the--one of the big things that made a difference.  If you check students who went to that school out there as small as it was, you check around the world you see that they're achievers.  That school, that was a, that was a wonderful thing.  But I just couldn't--I didn't get it together while I was there (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: We wanted to put wine in, (laughter) in the punch, during the prom they said, "Come here, Dickson, you can't do that" (laughter).
Story_ID: 543242
Speaker 1: Tell me about Fairfield [Alabama] because--where is Fairfield?  Is it a county or a city? 'Cause you said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fairfield is a city.  It--it's about eight miles from here, west.  That's as it--it was--it was a city.  It was formerly--it was formerly known as Corey, C-O, C-O-R-A-Y [sic.].  And it was--it was changed to Fairfield later on.  You had at, one time in Fairfield you had probably the largest number of people working in this county.  'Cause you had Fairfield works out there.  You had the wire mill.  You had the, the steel, the, the plate mill.  You had the tin mill.  You had the sheet mill.  And they did all of that work out there.  They--and they and they had--and if you went over a little further there was Wylam [Birmingham, Alabama] they--they load that coke over to, to right in there.  And you had plenty of pollution there too (laughter).  But them people were employed.  People were--you would see folks walking to work like, you know, like they were going to something, something that they had.  You--we had baseball.  We had on each one of those--all Westfield [Birmingham, Alabama] that was kind of over in Westfield, but Fairfield see all of them had baseball teams.  And kids had something to do.  Willie Mays played out there.  His dad played out there.  One of the best hitters I ever seen Howard Mays [Willie Mays, Sr.] could knock it farther than anybody in the world, was right up there in the Fairfield.  We, we had--we were on that hill, you can--you could not down where my brother lives now they had a barrier there.  It started at 51st Street that barrier there.  You--white section was over here.  And when you went over up the--up front it was a barrier.  And you had the woods up there where the hos- where Lloyd Noland Hospital [Fairfield, Alabama] is.  Over here on the--on the other side over there to the Belrosa [Belrosa Terrace] you had a barrier.  The blacks were contained up there, in that--on that hill.  And there where Home Depot [The Home Depot, Inc.] is now and where that big building where U.S. Steel [United States Steel Corporation] when they moved out of Birmingham [Alabama] and moved to Fairfield that was a--used to be a place where they would all work--people work for TCI [Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company] there.  You know they call it TCI, would come in and they would compete out there.  So Fairfield was really was a--was a unique--it was a good place for--for me to grow up and a good place for most blacks to grow up.  Because of E.J. Oliver, Reverend E.W Williams, Reverend (Unclear), Reverend Walker [William H. Walker, Sr.], and those folks.  Those people were, were together and we had Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama] out there.  I guess if we hadn't been living in that project and not living across the street from the project and looking at Miles College and my mama [Rachel Payne Dickson] telling me that you need to go, I probably wouldn't have gone to college.  So that was a--Fairfield was unique.  And if you--if you talk to people now they said, "Well you from Fairfield."  He said you, now I remember when I used to go up for the records and they'd ask questions about Dick Arrington [Richard Arrington, Jr.].  And I would always talk about it positively.  I would never disparage him.  And then at the end somebody say, "I see I'm trying to get you to say something about Arrington."  They don't know you from Fairfield.  Fairfield folks stick together.  They ain't gonna--they--they stay--it's a funny thing about the people from Fairfield.  They were taught that togetherness.  And you had--you had to go to school.  You had to go to school.  And you had to get your lesson.  So you--we had businesses.  We had--and I guess we had, it was--it was really unique.  We had Dr. Palm [ph.].  We had Dr. Drake [ph.].  We had Dr. Stevens [ph.]. And all those folk out there, there was business folk.  And Dr. Palm--well most of those guys were Republicans.  And I--and it rubbed off on me.  I wanted to be like those guys.  I wanted to be a businessman.  We had a--white folk had soda, soda slip where you can get sodas, we had that in Fairfield.  Dr. Palm and Dr. Drake built that out there.  He was a pharmacist.  Dr.--Dr. Drake, Dr. Farm had--Dr. Palm had the post office--had a post office.  He had a drugstore.  And when we first--when we did get a library, we had the library in his building, he--we--he had a he a filling station.  He had a--he had--he--it was--it was nice.  So we, we were somewhat in a thing of our own, you know.  I, I can't sit here and say I--we didn't know nothing about segregation or nothing like.  But we--it was a little different than--than--because the way we were.  The, the one thing that that we tried to do, we tried to get land from U.S. Steel to build houses and they wouldn't sell us any land.  But when they got ready to do their project, they built it.  And then they started opening up.  They owed some land and then blacks started building houses what we call Borkin [ph.], Borkinville or Borkin Quarters [ph.] a little bit further--a little bit to the back.  But other than that people--people they live.  They had paved streets and some of them--some of them and some places didn't.  We could go skating some places.  Some places didn't have but dirt roads.  But Fairfield was a little different from some of the other places that--that--that I saw.  But you had to get your lesson out there if you stayed out there.

Speaker 1: So it was because you lived across the street from Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama] that you decided to go to the college?
Speaker 2: I didn't decide to go, Rachel [Rachel Payne Dickson] decided I'd go.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I went in the [U.S.] Army, I never went--I don't believe in war.  I think you can talk about it.  I didn't wanna go, but I was drafted.  I was--I had worked as--when I got out of high school [Fairfield Industrial High School, Fairfield, Alabama], I started working as a furniture, a spot welder.  A friend of mine got me a job.  Elijah [E.J. Oliver] got me a job as a spot welder at Vulcan Furniture Manufacturing [Vulcan Furniture Manufacturing Company] up on here on Morris Avenue.  And I was drafted from there.
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: I graduated from high school in 1952.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And spot welder for--
Speaker 2: For Vulcan Furniture Manufacturing.  So then I was drafted from them.  When I got into the Army that was--that was in the early stages of integration.  So when I graduated--my oldest brother got married the night he graduated from high school.  I stayed--I--kids need to know this.  I think I need to just say this.  You know when I worked, I didn't get any--I didn't ta- it weren't my money, it wasn't my money.  It was my family's money.  I--we took the money home.  Like I tell you when we was living I remember, Robert [Robert Dickson, Jr.] reminded me the other day.  They used to gamble and I came out--we worked early on Sunday morning and found about three or four twenty dollar bills. So when I got it, I was scared.  When we got down there to get our papers I showed it to Robert he said, "What you doing with that money boy?"  I said, "I found it.  I picked it up out there."  He said, "What you gonna do with it?"  I said, "I'm gonna give it to mama."  (Laughter) So I gave it to mama and I said this is the truth, she bought everybody some shoes and something and I didn't get nothing.  She didn't buy me nothing.  But when it did it badder when I was--when I shined shoes.  Mama came and got the money.  I might get a tip or tips from somebody. But you know.  So it was--it was like that.  So I have--I was take--I took care of my mama so when I went in the Army, I set a Class Q allotment.  And, and I sent a bond, a eighteen--seventy-five [dollar] bond home every, every month.

Speaker 1: Yeah.  I, I was working at Vulcan Furniture [Vulcan Furniture Manufacturing Company] but then I got drafted.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I had my mother [Rachel Payne Dickson] as a dependent.  I had my mother, my sister [Dora Dickson], and my brother as dependents.  And the house was in my name, that we lived in.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, listen before you go there tell me when you bought a house.  Because the last (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I didn't even buy the house.  We was living in the projects.
Speaker 2: Oh, in the projects.
Speaker 1: And then when I got into high school [Fairfield Industrial High School, Fairfield, Alabama] we was living in the projects.  We didn't buy a house, but it--when the--if you--you working, the rule is the person who's working that's who, who the house (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Mr. Shaw [ph.] said, "Well, he's working now?  Robert [Robert Dickson, Jr.] was--I told you he got married and then I was the next guy, the next oldest.  So then I became the--the--mama--it was mama and then, then she was, she was working, but she--they rather have the one with the most money.  So it was myself.  And I claim those three children as my dependents.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So when I went in the [U.S.] Army they gave--they gave us I think I got a Class Q allotment.  They sent my mother a check to help get those--take care of those children.
Story_ID: 543245
Speaker 1: Well in the [U.S.] Army, it was a, it was a funny kind of thing.  It was kind of tough 'cause when we went in--we went near just about as they was about to call a truce in Korea.  'Cause they call it--we went in--I went in in that, in that June and they called a truce, I think, right after we got out of basic.  'Cause they was getting ready to send us to Korea.  And it was in July they called a truce.  Anyway, but while we were there we went to South Carolina for induction and we came right back to Camp Rucker its Fort Rucker [Alabama] now.  And we trained down there.  And I was in the Army with some guys--most of the guys that I was--that I was in the Army with, the white guys and the black guys had been to college in the outfit that I--in my--in the battle where I was.  We had Smythe [James Smythe (ph.)] who had gone to University of Mississippi [Oxford, Mississippi].  And we had Chew [ph.]  who was in the--you got Smythe I think was the clerk and Chew was the guy hand the stuff out behind the--the guns and all that stuff like that.  And I had Wright [ph.].  And I had (laughter) a Hamilton [ph.].  And Hamilton and myself slept on the same floor.  Hamilton would go up to the--to the canteen, to the beer--the beer hall--all of us would go up there.  Hamilton would go up and get drunk, come back down raising all kinds of hell.  Ain't but two blacks that was down on the floor me and Hamilton.  Hamilton, up there and over me, I think.  And he was there on top of the thing drunk, calling the white folks all kinds of, all--all kind of names.  So they--the first time they forget about it.  So he go up back up there and he come back down he raise all kind of saying.  Wright was upstairs.  So what they were doing, I guess, what they would do, would they do, as we come out the field, they took all these big old cook pots and other stuff you got to clean up. Old Sergeant Mullinex [ph.] said, "So now give me Dickson [HistoryMaker Joe Dickson], Rice [ph.],  Hamilton and nine or more."  When you're in an artillery outfit.  And Wright didn't like it and Hamilton didn't like it.  I didn't like it.  But I--I didn't--I just went on with it.  But Hamilton and--and-and-what's his name, Wright, raised holy hell.  But when we got back from the beer hall he come in there I--I said, "Come on, come on--let me talk you here."  Hamilton was a boxer.  He used to box.  And he, he, he--I guess 'cause I guess he--'cause he was a boxer, he thought he could beat everyone else.  Ain't but two of down here on this floor (laughter).  I said, "Two of us down here and it look like about thirty or forty white boys down here.  We can't whoop all these folks man please be quiet and leave these folks alone."  He said, "Man I broke their ass.  Man I broke, I broke their ass." He was speaking with--speaking with--he was from South Carolina he was speaking (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Speaking Gullah?
Speaker 1: --Gullah--yeah.  And I couldn't hardly understand what he was saying (laughter).  But I finally got him to calm down.  And these other guys that were in there with us they was school teachers.  Wade [ph.], the other black guy, they was, they was--Ed Henderson [ph.] and all those guys, they was school teachers.
Story_ID: 543246
Speaker 1: I'm gonna tell you the memorable thing that happened to us down there, when we were down there.  They brought a white soldier back from--from Korea or somewhere while we were in--in training down there.  And the guys who made the rifle team they--they were black guys and they could shoot.  They could shoot.  So I--they let me drive.  They taught me how to drive these eight--these wheels and back them big old guns up.  And I drove the bus down past Ozark, Alabama to a funeral.  And the sergeant that went down there with us told me to turn me the bus around so we can get ready to go out.  And get my weapon and come on 'cause you know you shoot.  We got down there in that little--those girls and boys--there weren't that many folk down there.  That lady say, "They done killed my son, then they send these niggers down here to shoot over him.  This ain't right."  The sergeant told us, "Y'all get back in the bus."  We got back in the bus and went back and he explained to us that--he said, "Don't y'all worry, don't worry about that.  Don't pay that no attention."  And I said to myself, I said, "Now, they don't understand all us could get killed."  We--he was a, he was a soldier like us.  But they just didn't understand.  And I made my mind up that you have to change that kind of stuff.  I remember we come out of basic, everybody's supposed to get a stripe.  You know when you come out if you have no problem.  They wouldn't give the black boys no stripe.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So I went to see Lieutenant Henderson [ph.].  And I told him this, I tell him, I say, "Lieutenant I did not go to parade (unclear) Lieutenant."  I said, "I need a promotion."  I said, "I'm not asking for no promotion to be in charge of nobody 'cause really I don't wanna be in the [U.S.] Army.  I don't believe in killing."  I told him.  I said, "I got a mama, a sister [Dora Dickson], and two brothers [Luther Dickson and Clarence Dickson (ph.)] at home."  I just said, "When I--before I came in the Army I worked to take care of them."  And I did 'cause I had promised my daddy [Robert Dickson, Sr.] I was gonna do this.  And I said, "I just don't want this to be a case where a white boy grow up, black boy grow up.  White boy become a man.  Black boy stay a boy. I just want a raise in pay so my mama and sister and brothers can, can do all right, do better while I'm gone."  He, he said, "Anything else?"  I said, "No, sir."  I left out.  He gave--I got some kind of--I got the stripe.  I didn't cr- I didn't have no meeting.  The other incident I remember in the Army was Lieutenant Tanser [ph.]. They teach you in the Army if somebody--if an officer come before you to reach for your weapon, you're supposed to turn it loose.  And Tanser must have been--been to West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York].  And I knew how to shine shoes 'cause I came from a shoe shining background.  That was on my resume (laughter).  So--so I had my shoes shined, my boots and I was straight.  Well Rachel [Rachel Payne Dickson] taught me how to iron, how to stay clean.  But when he got in front of me and he moved, I dropped it--it fell right on the foot.  He said, "Dickson [HistoryMaker Joe Dickson] stand over there."  I said, "What Lord have I done?"  (Laughter) You know.  He told me after he said, "I been watching you."  Said, "You good a soldier."  Said, "How would you like to go to West Point?"  I said, "No, sir, I got back home and take care of my mama."  (Laughter) I didn't know where West Point was at the time didn't (laughter) even know what it was.  I said, "No, sir." I said, "I gotta go back and take care of my mama.  I promised my daddy I was gonna take care of (laughter) my mom and dad [sic.]."
Story_ID: 543247
Speaker 1: I was about nineteen, you know.  And then after that they had--they called a truce and they moved us back to, to Fort Benning [Georgia].  And I developed ulcers.  Let me show how my life was something else.  I developed ulcers when I was in [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 2: You developed what?
Speaker 1: Ulcers.
Speaker 2: Ulcers.  Okay.
Speaker 1: And it was near to us getting out of the Army.  So some of the guys was getting out.  They had moved out folks from, from off Sand Hill over there and Fort Benning. They moved us on, on the--who was getting us out of the Army.  And I was in the hospital so and they, they were about to let me go out of the--out of the hospital.  And so they took me over to the place where they guy getting ready to bus you out.  And they ask you questions and stuff.  And so the man, the sergeant asked me a lot of questions and I told him where I was going and where I was from.  And then he asked me he say, "Do you plan to apply for disability when you get out, Corporal?"  I said, "Hell no.  All I want to do is get out the damn Army.  That's all I want.  I don't--I don't want nothing."  He looked at me.  He said, "Okay."  When I got out of the Army, you know what that man did?  He marked yes.  I guess he said this is a fool (laughter) let me help him.  He marked--now this was a white man.  And usually when people talking, you know, just peoples or people.  He said I got this twenty year old fool and he marked yes and they gave me a 10 percent disability and I ain't never messed with the thing.  I knew the check would come and mama [Rachel Payne Dickson] would get it, you know.  I ain't know that was service connected.  That was service connected disability.  I didn't know.  I'm giving the man a fit, talking about just let me out and the man helped me.
Story_ID: 543248
Speaker 1: So the [U.S.] Army, was kind of, it was kind of a rough at times because we had to bring Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] down there.  You know, here's the funny thing about this?  Adam Clayton Powell came down there, and they called a parade and Powell and General Multar [ph.] was riding in the Jeep.  And I'm from Alabama. I ain't never been nowhere.  I'm standing, I'm still looking for Adam Clayton Powell. (Laughter) I'm still looking for Powell.  And Powell riding around in the desert man in the Jeep with General Multar.  I said, "Who is that white man they got in there?  When--when they gone bring in parade?"  (Laughter) And, and Jeff [ph.] just said, "That's Adam Clayton Powell."  Sergeant say, "What are you talking about over there?"  I said, "I ain't seen Adam, you know" (laughter).  I ain't seen him (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you had never seen him before.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I say, "Oh I see, that's him right there." "Shut up, quit, be quiet."  So we got back to the base.  Say, "Man that's Adam Clayton Powell that was him in that, in that thing." And I said to myself I said, "Lord if you don't go nowhere, you don't go nowhere.  If you do nothing, you don't know nothing."
Story_ID: 543249
Speaker 1: But it was--I got out and I came back home.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Came back home.
Speaker 2: Because you left in what year?
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-two [1952]--'53 [1953].  I came back in '55 [1955].
Speaker 2: Fifty-three [1953], '55 [1955].  Okay.  So now you're back home as a civilian.  And what happens?
Speaker 1: When I got back home, this is unbelievable I told mama, I said, "Mama, I'm a grown man."  I said, "I got me a job at Lloyd Noland Hospital [Fairfield, Alabama], but you know Mr. Walter Clayton [ph.] is the head cook."  And I said, "Nate Reed's [ph.] the second cook."  So they want me in the kitchen washing pots and--and I'm gonna get the job, when Walter--Walter was about ready to retire and they were gone move Nate up and Nate was gone use his juice to get me moved up to being a cook.  So, (laughter) while I was that--Nate had been in the [U.S.] Army too.  Nate and we'd--the thing here and put the pots up there and I washed the pot and then they said he said, "K.P., K.P. I need some ice."  I had to go all the way down stairs and bring back a bucket of ice.  When I come back he said, "Hand me a number two pot over there."  I reached to hand him the number two, all of 'em fall back down in the water.  He started laughing.  So I got--I got over that.  So Rachel [Rachel Payne Dickson] say that--'cause I got out in June.  That was July.  She gave me the--she didn't say--mama didn't argue with me she gave me--she didn't open her mouth.  She asked me say--
Speaker 2: She gave you what?
Speaker 1: Those bonds.  The bonds I tell you I sent one every month I was gone.  Had about eighteen of them.  So she gave them to me.  And we go to work in the morning around--I had to be there around five, but we partied all night, all hours, all the boys, boy we partied all night.  It weren't no problem about it.  'Cause it was clubs then were open all, all the time at that time all day and all night we partied all day and all night.  And they gave you a hundred dollars when you get out or whatever it is they gave you--bust out pennies send you some.  But you know I spent every dime.  I spent all of that money.  I spent all the must not money.  All, all them bonds I spent 'em all.  But that was so, Rachel said, "Boy school opened up right there.  Children going to school out there."  I said, "I see them going up through there."  Said, "You, you ought to go out there and, and see what's going on."  'Cause she said, "Ain't you going to school ain't you?"  "I got a job.  I got me a job.  I got a job up at Lloyd Noland I'm up there with Nate." I said, "I might end up with that cooking job, Mama."  She said, "Boy you, you need to go out there and see what it is."  Two or three weeks passed by, I didn't go.  Then she said, "You been out there boy to, to see 'bout that school thing out there?"  I said, "No, I ain't been out there.  I told you I already got a job.  I don't I, I don't need to go out there."  So it got a little closer, she said, "Come here Joe Nathan [HistoryMaker Joe Dickson].  Let me talk to you a minute."  She said, "Did you go out there and find out what it cost to go to school?"  I said, "No."  She said, "Go out there now."  And I'm grown, I knew what she meant when she said that I went over--I went out there and I think it was either sixty-six or thirty-three dollars a quarter.  I went out there I came back and she said, "Well what did they say?"  I said, "It's, it's sixty-six dollars for the quarter and you got to get your books," and I start crying.  She told me, "What's wrong?" And I said, "Mama I done spent all that money."  She said, "You done spent it all?"  I said, "Yeah."  She didn't say nothing.  She just had a stocking and she opened the stocking up.  She gave me two fifty dollar bills.  And I was sitting there crying like spent all that money.  She gave me two fifty dollar bills.  She say, "They tell me that Uncle Sam will pay your way to school if you go."  She said, "When I was coming up ain't--we didn't have nothing like that.  And I, I had to go the field.  I had to work and do something."  She said, "Boy if you don't go to school you ain't got as much sense as I thought you had."  She, she gave me that money she--she said, "If you go spend this, but if you don't go to school you ain't got much sense as that as I thought you had."  That's how Rachel made--Rachel sent me to the Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama].  She pushed me and pushed me.
Speaker 2: But you had the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] isn't that right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But I wasn't going.  What I'm telling her I got a job (laughter).  I could go--listen, I just told you the service select and I didn't have to pay.  And they were gonna buy my books and pay my tuition.
Story_ID: 543250
Speaker 1: So what happened?  Did you do you finally make it out there?
Speaker 2: I went, I went.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I took the two fifty dollar bills and I went on out there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Got elected president of the class.  They had fifteen hundred--that was the largest class they had, fifteen hundred students.  I got elected president of the class (laughter).  That's, that's something.  That's really, really.
Speaker 1: So tell me what happens in college.  Tell me about your college years.
Speaker 2: College years at Miles [Miles College, Fairfield, Alabama] was--they were--they were probably were different from any other college that you would have gone to because there were no dormitories for, for, for the students there.  Yeah, I think, they had a dormitory--small dormitory for women and mostly what you may call a computer college--I mean a commuter, commuter college. When people lived around there and some folk came from places, boarded with people to go to school.  But you--and we had an excellent, dedicated teachers.  Who were thorough, they made sure that you know what you needed to know.
Speaker 1: Do you know--do you remember any of the professors that might have influenced you?
Speaker 2: Frank Pearson.  Frank Pearson we called him Dean Pearson.  Dean Pearson lived, bled, and died Miles College.  We had Mr. Daugherty [ph.].  We had Professor Maxwell [ph.].  We had Professor Rambeau [Ardenia Rambeau].  We had Ms., Ms.--she was--she was over the--I--it'll come back to me in a minute.  But we had a number of real dedicated people who--the blessing was, they had gone to the segregated schools, but the majority of them had gone to other schools to get their master's and their doctorate degrees.  And they had been exposed somewhat to what you need. They knew what you--you were gonna have to have.  Once you left Miles and had--and had to go for an advanced degree, you might--you may not have liked them, but you know when I got to Miles and they were teaching, they taught euthenics.  And when I finally knew what it was--when I found out what it was, and I saw people didn't how to hold a knife or a fork or set a table, I mean, then I understood that everybody had to take it.  So you could--you couldn't live in this, this culture and, and not be a part of it, so you got to do what they're doing.  They taught, they taught us.  We, we had, we had, we had no football stadium and such.  We, we had a good football team.  Mule Knox [T.J. Knox], Professor Knox taught me political science.  And I would tell him I thought I--I took--I wanna play football he said, "I don't give a damn if you as fast as Mercury.  If you ain't getting no lesson and you can't block a tackle you can't play on my team.  You hear what I say?  If you're not getting no--any lesson, if you can't block the tackle, you can't play on my team if you fast as mercury."  You know.  We had Pettus [Austell Pettus].  When they were teaching us kinesiology and all of--and all of this--these different-- all of this--all this is new coming into to us 'cause we didn't get a bunch of this stuff.  We got the--some basics when we were in high school, you know, when we were in high school.  We didn't take any foreign language when we were in the elementary--in high school.  But we had to take it when we got to Miles.  And we had good foreign language teachers, you know.  (Speaking in French) Nous parlons, mademoiselle?  Quelle est votre nom en francais?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You learned that at Miles College, you know.  This has been about fifty years ago, you know.  So what I'm saying is we had good excellent teachers.  And they were preparing us to be teachers, undertakers, insurance men (laughter).  And, you know, Dick Arrington [Richard Arrington, Jr.] was in my grad class--in my--in my third grade class, but the time that lapsed between me going to the [U.S.] Army and coming back to Miles College he was teaching chemistry.  He had gone to school, gotten his degree what--he got his master's and was at the University of Oklahoma [Norman, Oklahoma] and working on his Ph.D.  So we had people who were interested in preparing the students and the man who was leading the school at the time when I was there was, William Augustus Bell [William A. Bell].  Bell never lived in Birmingham [Alabama].  He always lived in Atlanta [Georgia].  But when Bell walked across the campus and he saw ladies he tipped his hat.  He was dressed immaculately.  No, no pants down across your behind, no long shirts on and all that.  You, you wore ties and a shirts.  You, you, you (unclear). It was a great experience for me.  To go to that--go to Miles, you know.  I got involved out there, that's when I got involved with this--with the struggle.
Story_ID: 543251
Speaker 1: Were there fraternities there [Miles College, Fairfield, Alabama] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you pledge?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  This is another story.  This is a unique guy you're talking to here (laughter).  Let me tell you what happened.  They had the Sigmas [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity].  They had the Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity]. They had the Omegas [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity].  They didn't have the Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity].  I--in the fresh- my freshman year I pledged you--before you go to the sophomore year, you can pledge.  I pledged Alpha.  Cecil B. King [ph.], he was a psychology teacher.  He was a Kappa.  Cecil was from Florida.  So they wanted a--they had no sororities.  They were just thinking about bringing the sororities.  We had Club Rho Nu.  The other clubs that they had, they didn't have any, any sororities.  So they were gonna round out the, the fraternities so they came--Cecil--they came to me and he told me that he wanted me to come and let's begin the Kappas.  I said, "I'm already pledged (unclear).  How about my Alpha pledge?"  He said, "We, we," (laughter), "we got that covered."  And I became a member--instead of being a member of the Sphinx Club, I was a member of the Scrollers Club and became president of the Scrollers Club.  And after we made the chapter out there, in 1957 Delta Tau.  This is the fiftieth year of Delta Tau out there.  I became the polemarch of Delta Tau in 1957.  So we had a--as a matter of fact when they brought the Kappas out there that changed--it brought some insight, it, it made some--made a difference in, in how the, the fraternities acted.  Because the guys who--who put that initial chapter out there came from all over the--just about all over the United States.  'Cause some of them heard that [HistoryMaker] Joe Dickson was pledging so they wanted to see the pledge.  They wanted (laughter) they wanted to review what they're pledging, you know.  And it was---and they called it the brothers fraternity 'cause they had Joe Dickson and Luther Dickson, Donald Delbro [ph.] and Harold Delbro [ph.].   It's about four groups of brother thing in there (unclear).  So they said it's a bunch of brothers in and out of fraternity.  But it came--it turned out okay.  We did good with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But they--they still got to get their minds together and have to realize you don't need to be paddling these folks.  No, you don't need to do that you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But we did good with that.
Story_ID: 543252
Speaker 1: So what year did you graduate [from Miles College, Fairfield, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: I--my completed my work in '59 [1959], but I didn't I--I marched with the class of 1960.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that was because?
Speaker 2: Well, I got sick again.  I got sick again with that--with that ulcer.  And they, they operated--well I got sick.  And then that meant I dropped a quarter--stayed out a quarter and then I went back
Speaker 1: Okay, I got you (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The next quarter to finish up.
Speaker 1: I got you.  So you graduated, actually got your degree in 1960.  And what did you get your degree in?
Speaker 2: Now I was trained to be a high school science teacher with a minor in natural science.
Speaker 1: So you got your degree in science?
Speaker 2: No I--
Speaker 1: Or education?
Speaker 2: My--my degree is in sociology.
Speaker 1: Sociology?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I took a lot of, a lot--well see I, I was going on the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944].  I went summer, winter, autumn, and fall (laughter).  I just, I wanted to you know.
Story_ID: 543253
Speaker 1: So when you graduated, what happens?
Speaker 2: Well, you know be- just before I graduated from Miles [Miles College, Fairfield, Alabama], Jesse Walker was the guy who I mentioned was there. Jesse was--became president of the student government.  And we began to--Jesse began to protest segregation in his inner town from out at Miles College.  And we would come right here to this park over here, we would come right over--
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know we got involved with the--with the struggle a little when I was out there at Miles.  Jesse was president of the student council and he was our leader.  And we would just over to this Kelly Ingram Park [Birmingham, Alabama] over there and march 'cause you couldn't go in the park.  And we'd go in the evening.  And one evening we went in there and a policeman came to us and told us, said, "Maybe you- y'all ought to march."  He said, "Maybe you ought to protest."  He said, "Maybe you ought to be doing what you're doing."  He said, "But let me tell y'all something."  He said, "There are some bad guys out here."  He said, "There's some bad guys out here."  He said, "If you gonna do it, do it in the daytime.  Don't do it at night.  Do it in, do it in, do it in the daytime."  He said, "Or go--if y'all--y'all ought to go--y'all ought to go on the inside."  So we started meeting in the A.G. Gaston Motel [Birmingham, Alabama] there.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And word got back to Dr. Bell [William A. Bell] that we were marching and demonstrating out there, for what--and it was Miles College's name.  And well, when they--when they did that, everybody get excited and they said, "Well we might want to lead a march from Miles College campus."  No, no that was (unclear).  He said, but he said, "You can march young men and young women."  That was that was a plum confrontation we had with Dr. Bell.  But it made sense what he was saying.  He said, "If you gonna march, you can't march from this campus."  He said, "My job is to educate black kids."  And he said, "I get the money to educate black kids from white people."  He said, "If you gonna march, you can't march from this campus."  He said, "But I want you to know this young men and young women, if you decide to do what you're doing, you gonna have to be prepared to take all the responsibility that a race need to take.  You better be prepared to educate your children.  You're gonna have to be able to make--handle your schools, your communities, your--you gonna have to be in a position to pay your way.  And do what you need to do, see because you cannot fight and beg."
Story_ID: 543254
Speaker 1: Well, you were--you were asking me about Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama] and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and the days.  Well, the--Walker [Jesse Walker] continued the effort, but he got suspended from school.
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: See, see Jesse was, was adamant.  He was--he was really into changing what was going on around here.  Jesse came from (unclear) city and his grandfather and folk were all involved in, in fighting for, for decency.  And (unclear) for black folks.  So Jesse was kind of bullheaded.  He was on--he was a good football player too.  So he got suspended and in the interim as God would have it, Dr. Bell [William A. Bell] died and Lucius Pitts [Lucius Holsey Pitts, Sr.] came to town to be president of Miles College.  Lucius was, was a guy from Atlanta [Georgia] who had worked with Dr. Borders [William Holmes Borders] and all those folks who were at Wheat Street [Wheat Street Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] and the YMCA [Butler Street YMCA, Atlanta, Georgia] where all this kind of stuff was forming.  And he--so when this confrontation--all this is new--it's not so much necessary, but we can do something.  And what they began was a selective buying campaign.  And this was what was going on from Miles College's campus.  Fred Shuttlesworth [HistoryMaker Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth] was over at 656 doing what he was doing.  As a matter of fact, Fred told us that what we was doing--what we were getting into was much, much more than we thought it was and that we should come and join him.  But we didn't do that 'cause we didn't, we didn't know.  We were students, but everybody else were, were involving themselves.  So we were gonna involve ourselves and I graduated.
Story_ID: 543255
Speaker 1: When I graduated I got a job with Mr. Gaston [A.G. Gaston] at Booker T. Washington Insurance Company [Birmingham, Alabama] as an insurance salesman.  And God it was in this all the way.  Because I went to the North Carolina Mutual [North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company] and I could not--I was--the guy--I didn't have a suit and tie on, that was he 'cause I--my wife--I was married while I was in school and I had to--had to do get a job do something to take care of those kids 'cause I was graduated and I weren't on G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] anymore.  So he talked to me so bad about my dress and how I should be when I go--so I was coming out the elevator and I saw Sam Germany [ph.].  Sam said, "What's wrong with you?"  I said, "I wanna get a job.  I need a job.  And this man is talking to me like I'm crazy and all that."  He said, "Wait, Wait hold on a second."  Sam lived up the street from where we used to live.  He said come--go around there and go by the--Gaston, Mr. Gaston's hiring folks.  He said, "Now, now I don't want you out there with Charlie Green [ph.] 'cause you and him will be fighting.  Go, go around to, to see Piggy [ph.].  Piggy and them hiring folk go.  Go around there."  I went right around there and told him that I needed a job, I had just finished Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama].  So he told me to come back Monday and make an application.  I had my suit and tie on.  Mama [Rachel Payne Dickson] always told us that if go and look for a job always buy you white shirts and suits and ties.  If they give you a job, you work in your suit said I can wash it and iron it and fix it back like it was.  But just so happens, I just was looking for a job.  So Piggy and them hired me.  They hired me.  And that was a blessing.  I was working in Bessemer [Alabama].  They gave me a debit out there.  It was from Jonesboro [Bessemer, Alabama], which is about twenty-five miles from here, to up in Collegeville [Birmingham, Alabama] which is about four or five miles.  So I had a thirty mile route and had about a hundred dollars' worth of debit (laughter).  Hundred--it was $146 to be exact.  And the arrears were about, I don't know the arrears were about--woo, it was, it was about fifteen or sixteen hundred dollars.  I mean, 'cause you--cause you worked them collecting.  We could--we could pay with insurance.  And the lady had gotten pregnant and couldn't work in the other folks weren't working it.  So they gave me the debit and told me to get in shape.  So I asked the guy about it, he said, "Well you a college boy, I want--you can manage--you a college boy I shouldn't have to tell you nothing about this.  Go on out there, the address is on the book."  So I went out there and I was crazy.  I--I just went out there and worked it down.  Got the arrears down to about (laughter) you won't believe this, to about a hundred dollars and was selling insurance and Mr. Gaston knew about it.  So when I did that the guy wanted me to go with the other folks and help them collect.  I was the agent.  It was another guy named, Jones [ph.] had been in the [U.S.] Air Force and they had just put out a policy called--it was a family plan you buy, you insure the mama, the mother and the dad and you get the mama and everybody else as a family plan.  So we said, we said we can sell them, we can sell them ordinary life insurance.  So the guy kept driving me and pushing me and pushing me, I quit.
Story_ID: 543256
Speaker 1: I quit and I called my sister [Dora Dickson] in New York and told her I had quit.  She said, "Well come on to--come on to--come on to New York."  She sent me a ticket to come--come to New York.  So my wife didn't want me to go.  So I said, "Well it might be a little better you know and I'll, I'll holler back you know.  I'll, I'll come--we'll get you."  So I got to New York and was living in Brooklyn [New York] on (Unclear) Avenue.  And, and, and the lady I was living with, lived on (unclear) so I living with her.  This was--that was my buddy. But we was aunt-in-law.  So they say, "Well you go downtown and you can--on William Street--," I think it was William Street where there was--you can--you can apply for civil service jobs and all this other stuff.  I went to apply and didn't go, somebody said, "Well they hiring, they need somebody at (Unclear)." They need a manger trainee in Bu- they were hiring.  They had war bonds and they were--they needed--they were gonna hire--(Unclear) was gonna hire a manager trainee.  And they hired me right then and there.  So they moved me through all--trained me in all sections of that store.  The dairy, the grocery, the produce, and everything.  But when I got to the--to the--to the market, the butcher, they said, "Now these guys gonna try to resist."  He said but they worked it out and they let me go back there and learn and watch the cuts of the meat and everything.  And guess what happened?  The ulcer come back again.
Story_ID: 543257
Speaker 1: Meanwhile on the--on the way they asked, he said--Mack Mickey [ph.] said, "Did you go and put in for that?"  I said, "No."  He said, "Go."  I went back to New York [New York] on William Street and went in.  On the way back, riding the trip--train back to Brooklyn [New York], there was a guy on there and I just started talking 'cause I like to talk.  And I told him where I was from and what was going on.  He said, "You got a phone number where I can reach you?"  I said, "Yeah."  So I gave him (unclear) phone number.  So he called me and told me, "You be--go down to Williams.  Go down on Williams Street."  The secretary over the welfare thing was a guy named Dumpson.  A black guy named Dumpson
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] James Dumpson?
Speaker 1: Dumpson.  And I went in and, and start talking to him.  And talked and talked and I took the test and I was on way to work to (Unclear) and my--I got peritonitis.  My stomach burst.  I was taken--I was taking the federal service entrance examination.  And the Time Building [sic. The New York Times Building, New York, New York], right up there, the, the doggone United Nations [United Nations Headquarters, New York, New York] over here and there's a hospital that was over on this side, I was just lucky enough to be at that hospital right there.  They took me to the hospital about seven or eight days later the guy was patting on my hand he said, "Mr. Dickson [HistoryMaker Joe Dickson] you are a lucky man."  I saw heaven.  I saw--I seen the promise.  I seen you where you--go through.  And the guy said, "You lucky, you lucky."  And then when my mama--when Rachel [Rachel Payne Dickson] found out about it was--it was--it was--dynamite.  She sent my brother up there to say, "You got to go home."  When I came back--while I was there so Howard K. Smith who speaks from Birmingham [Alabama].  I said I need to be with this--in this.  So I came back, went back to--no I went to work for the White Dairy [White Dairy Company].  Chris--

Speaker 2: That's why I quit, yeah.
Speaker 1: You didn't want to be a collection agent (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't wanna--I didn't mind doing it, but it was the manner in which they were attempting to get me to do it.  They--they was sitting in the office talking and going on and you know.  I--I was trying--all my life I been working.  I was trained you have to get it.  I mean I ain't never had--I didn't have no office job. I didn't just sit around (laughter) in the office and drink coffee.  I was thinking that you're supposed to, you know, be working.  I you do your jo- that's the reason--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that's the only thing that I was about.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Then they calling me college boy (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) All right.
Story_ID: 543260
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you returned to Alabama you go to work for who?
Speaker 2: Worked for White Dairy [White Dairy Company].
Speaker 1: White Gary?
Speaker 2: White Dairy. That's--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You see Barber company around here, well that's--that was--he barber, the barber--it was Barber's dairy [Barber Dairies] but they had a thing called White, we call it White Dairy because they delivered milk to, to doors on the doorsteps (unclear).  I had a buddy that worked there he, he said, "Come on, come on I'm gonna get you work over here."  So we was selling milk.  I did--you get up in the morning at, at three [o'clock] and you wait until the white boy load their buckets up lift trucks call them it a bucket, and then you load yours.  And then when you get out there you got to stay all day instead of delivering the milk and making a sale, you know you got to stay out there all day.  And then I, I had to work so it didn't make any difference.  So one day I had gotten off and I was living--we had moved right back to the projects after I left New York [New York].  And, and this guy was shaking me I was in there somebody--Amos Hall [ph.] that I had gotten the job with Booker Washington [Booker T. Washington Insurance Company, Birmingham, Alabama] and, and got him good and trained, he came knocking on the door and I was half asleep and so Bob Reed [ph.] was--now Bob Reed was a--was the guy that trained the agents for Mr. Gaston [A.G. Gaston].  He said. "We been looking for you."  Said, "Where you been at?"  I told I had been in New York and I was working at White Dairy.  He said, "The old man he told us to find you and we, we need you.  We want you to go to work."  Said, "We don't want you to be no agent we want you to be a supervisor."  And said, "This time we gone send you down there with Mr. Art [ph.]." Mr. Art was the best they had.  See and Mr. Art you working with Art, they (unclear).  Said, "The man like you.  Boy, he want you to go to work."  I said, "You want me to come tomorrow?"  He said, "No you can't just leave a job."  (Laughter) I was so glad to get off that milk truck.  Lord I said (laughter) I know they feel out there in the cotton field. They--you get up and then you go to work.  You get up, you go to--get out the bed before you get in there. I said, "Can I go in--come tomorrow, in the morning?"  He said, "No."  He said, "Give, you need to give your people notice."  So gave them a notice.  When I went to give them the notice, Corporal Borden [ph.] was the supervisor.  "Why you quitting?  You quitting--we got you the job," and he just raising hell 'cause I wanted to quit.  He didn't understand (laughter).  I said, "I'm quitting Goat [ph.]."  We used to call him Goat.  I said, "Goat I'm gone.  I'm gonna finish this week out."  He said, "Well, we gonna put somebody on the truck with you."  Monday morning I was up there and the home office up there with, with Bob Reed he took me out there Mr. Art asked for me and I stayed with out there with Mr. Art 'til they--'til they--'til the situation changed.
Story_ID: 543261
Speaker 1: Then the struggle was heating up all this time, during this time.  The struggle was heating up.  And they was--they began the selective buying campaign.  So what the selective buying campaign was, you don't--you don't need to march and demonstrate to, to boycott.  Dr. Pitts [Lucius Holsey Pitts, Sr.] said, "Well we, we won't, we won't tell them, we won't tell them we boycotting.  We won't march, we'll just have a selective buying campaign."  So they picked Parisians [Parisian], big store.  Pizitz, Loveman's and those stores.  And they asked people to stay away from the stores.  And the people were staying away.  And we continued the selective buying campaign.  'Cause we wanted the ladies to change the--to try on the dresses, to try on the shoes and clothes and everything.  So they said--they--that it wasn't no--we wanted to change the jobs.  We wanted--we wanted--we wanted the black folks to move up.  It shouldn't be just undertakers, school teachers, and insurance men.  So we, we did the buying campaign went on.  So they said, "Okay.  We'll talk.  We'll take the signs down."  And they took the signs down.
Speaker 2: What organization with--are you with?
Speaker 1: I was working for Mr. Gaston [A.G. Gaston].
Speaker 2: So Mr. Gaston, so the insurance company [Booker T. Washington Insurance Company, Birmingham, Alabama] is the one that was kind of sponsoring the selective buying campaign?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama] was, was the selective buying campaign was coming from Miles--
Speaker 2: From Miles College?
Speaker 1: --like the students were leading that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they had David Drew [ph.].  They had--they had Marie Jefferson [ph.].  Marie Jefferson was a white woman whose father--I mean her, her husband's father helped found Mountain Brook [Alabama].  Marie Jefferson she, she worked like a dog in this thing.  And I don't never see her getting any credit.  David Drew, Barefield Prentiss [ph.] wife, Dr. Hamilton's wife [Willa Yvonne Echols Hamilton], they were all involved in the selective buying campaign.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And this--this was this was our side of it.  Fred [HistoryMaker Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth] and that and they were doing what they was doing too (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 543262
Speaker 1: The selective buying campaign we--they, they took the signs down and the people went back downtown. And when the people went back down, they put the signs back up.  So it, it intensified.  And then guys started getting kind of, kind of nasty, you know.  Then we started marching.  The first march, that was the first march, organized march that they had here.  And Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]--Fred [HistoryMaker Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth] had invited Dr. King to come back up.  He was down in Auburn [Alabama] but he wasn't getting any traction down there 'cause they wouldn't let him do anything he want do, Dr. King was.  So they invited him back up here to with us to do--to do that, the marching that we were doing.  So when they--when they start marching, Fred led--Fred was in the lead, I was in the middle, John, John Henry [ph.] was next to Fred, John Henry, Jr., he's dead now.  And Frank Dukes was on the end.  And they, they talked to us--they talked to us a long time.  "You can't hit back.  You can't fight back.  You can't do none of that.  You got to--it's a nonviolent protest."  And we were gonna march down--we marched right down that side of that street right there to the federal court house up there.  And Fred--Fred said we gonna--we gonna be arrested on the federal courthouse grounds.  And I--I could do--I could do that because I was working--I was working for a black company, working for Mr. Gaston [A.G. Gaston].  And, and, and the civil rights folk lived over there in A.G. Gaston Motel [Birmingham, Alabama].  I don't know if they paid any, any rent or nothing.  I don't know 'cause they didn't have money to pay it with.  But it did that.  So we get arrested up there, but they tried everything they could to not allow us to be arrested.  But they did--they talked--Bull Connor talked to us a long time.  "You guys y'all don't need to do this.  And (unclear) they just some outside agitators coming in here wanna disturb our way of life.  And want y'all to create trouble.  Y'all don't need to be sitting out here."  Fred and them they already told us that, "They gonna talk to you when you--when you get up there.  They gonna talk to you and some of these folks gonna wanna leave.  Do your best, talk to them to make them stay, 'cause we got to get arrested.  We got to get this thing going."  So it's just like he said one or two people after he was talking to us, left.  But the rest of them--the rest of (unclear) we stayed there.  And Bull said that, "All right.  If you (unclear) y'all can go. All y'all can go. Y'all--you--y'all can go now."  And we stayed right there, you know, wouldn't go.  So he saw we weren't going then he said, "Arrest all these damn niggers.  Put all of them in jail."  And they--we--we peacefully got in the in the wagon and they took us to the south side and put us in jail.  And it was--they didn't beat nobody up or nothing like that.  So we sitting over in the jail, and Smitty [ph.] and Fred--and Fred he stopped me. He said--we sitting in jail so Fred said, "Man," said, "these folks being mighty nice to us."  Said, "This ain't Birmingham [Alabama]."  (Laughter) I said, "What you want them to do man?"  He said, "We got to show how brutal these folk are."  So there was fan, a big 'ol fan.  There weren't no air conditioning.  It was hot in that basement.  It was hot.  And all of us in one cell.  So Smitty gone climb up on the thing, gone take the doggone rock out the wall so the fan can fall.  I said, "No man, no, I ain't--we ain't gonna do that.  They gonna--if you do that, they got us for destroying public property."  Fred said, "That's right.  That's right."  Fred set up and start to thinking and going on and after a while the light come on.  I told him I thought we gonna be there but a minute (laughter).  The light went on, we still in there (laughter).
Story_ID: 543263
Speaker 1: So the next day the guy said, "[HistoryMaker] Joe Dickson all the way."  I didn't know what he was talking about.  So one of the guys in the--one of the criminals said, "All the way.  Man, you going, you going. You getting out."  I said, "All the way?"  He said, "All the way mean you going and you getting out."  I went out, they didn't say nothing, chewing gum didn't say nothing.  Then another--another time we go to jail, I went to jail again they didn't say nothing.  And the next time I went Piggy [ph.] told me he said, "Joe, we kind of want you on these debits and thing, you know, we need you to get some results for me.  You made your--you made your witness.  You can do that."  Then I slip off and come over here and be with Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and we would--then we went down in the poolroom, go to get the knives from people and so they wouldn't be cutting and beating on them.  We went down there the police told us to get out.  They ran us out the poolroom.  They didn't want us in there.  They didn't want us to bring no peace.  So the last time I went to jail--I went to jail with N.A. Smith [Nelson Smith], he's dead now, John Porter.  They had arrested everybody.  All most of them were in jail.  And weren't nobody out but Reverend Gardner [Edward Gardner] and he was the man that was getting folks out of jail.  So I'm sitting next to John Porter, Reverend Porter I said, "Reverend," I said, "Reverend Porter, man it looks like they got us."  I said, "Man, it's all over."  I said, "They got us."  And I said, "Martin in jail.  Fred [HistoryMaker Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth] in jail.  Ralph [Ralph Abernathy] in jail."  All them folks in jail.  I said, "Man," I said, "what we gonna do?"  Porter told me this he said--he said, "Don't worry about it."  He said, "Martin is dealing from on high."  Same thing happened again.  That next morning we still got all us thinking we gonna get on out, and the next morning, "Joe Dickson all the way."  When I got over there to that office, Piggy was there.  He said, "Joe you know the old man believe in what y'all doing."  He said, "But we got a job for you in Tuskegee [Alabama]."  He said, "We've already," (laughter), "talked to the lady down there.  All you got to do is go down there and report.  Don't get in no--don't go in no--just get in the--your car.  Get in the car with an agent that rides and learn them debits.  And so we can do some business down there."  He said, "The old man believe this, that we need to do this.  We need to fight this and everything is fine."  He said, "But when they integrate, and if they integrate, if you go in there and buy a hamburger or a hotdog you gonna have to pay for it.  So you go on to Montgomery [Alabama].  Pass on through Montgomery, you go to Tuskegee."  And they sent me to Tuskegee to work (laughter).
Speaker 2: So it's--what year was this?
Speaker 1: It had to be around '64 [1964], '64 [1964]. Sixty--'64 [1964] or '65 [1965].  Maybe '64 [1964] or '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 543264
Speaker 1: Now, King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had, had the March on Washington. Do you remember about that day?
Speaker 2: Yeah I was here.  I didn't--I didn't go.  I had--you know, I--I got a little disillusioned with the struggle because I just--I just--I just got mad with this nonviolent.  These--they beat that--beat Reverend Reeb [James Reeb].  (Unclear) they just--I just--I ain't gonna--I ain't--I'm not gonna--I ain't gonna take it no more.  I wasn't gonna--I got--I became not nonviolent.  But you know I didn't tell you it was during this time before (unclear) and with--with Dr. King down there to help get the knives and things with Frank Dukes and myself.  So we went back over and we was sitting in motel [A.G. Gaston Motel, Birmingham, Alabama] over in there and they were talking and King, said, "Brother Dickson [HistoryMaker Joe Dickson], see you know I've been watching you.  You, you all right.  You're into this thing.  You need to, you need to join and come on my staff as we go through the South and we, we fight to free our brothers and bring justice and make things better for them."  I said, "Dr. King," I said, "I can't--I work for Dr. Gaston [A.G. Gaston]."  I said, "I--I can't no way for me to do that."  He said, "No."  He said, "You--you'll do good.  You--you--you should join us as we go across this atlas."  I said, "No.  I don't think Dr. Gaston would like it."  He said, "Well, you let--you let--you let me--let me handle that.  I'll talk to Dr. Gaston."  I guess that's how I got that promotion (laughter) to Tuskegee.  Dr. King probably asked and Mr. Gaston told him I had come to work for him (laughter).  That's probably how I got that new thing.
Story_ID: 543265
Speaker 1: But when I got down there it was--it was something else down there too.  It, now it wasn't that much of a struggle.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But what Mr. Gaston [A.G. Gaston] wanted me to do was to try and, and increase our auto and life business down there.  We got the debit and put it in shape. So one day he came down, he was on the board at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], Dr. Gaston was.  He came through there one day and he said, "Boy, you're doing a good job."  He said, "You gonna do--you gonna do well in this company.  Keep up--keep the good work up and get you some young folks and train them."  And he said, "Boy, you know, you need go over there on Beale Street [Memphis, Tennessee] and get some of these black folks to buy some of this insurance we got here.  And it's--it's ordinary.  They paying all this money.  Tell them we got different short policies for living (unclear) this insurance ain't (unclear).  So tell them--should tell them go over there and sell them some insurance."  I said, "Mr. Gaston I go every time I come back to town I go to Beale Street and I try to sell."  Well, we had a--we had an agent there named Jane [ph.], I can't of think of this--her last name.  But she was--lived in Tuskegee [Alabama].  In her district she had Tuskegee proper.  And then we had Benson [ph.] who had the motel. He had Tuskegee and the outlying areas and the other agents were living in--I had six counties I was working in.  So he said, "You, you go talk to her."  I said, "Yes, sir.  He said, "Boy you--you tell them about these policies?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  "He said, "What they say."  I said, "Mr. Gaston they said they got insurance."  So I said, "They got the New York Life [New York Life Insurance Company]."  I said, "They said they got the Metropolitan Life [Metropolitan Life Insurance Company].  They got--they got Prudential [Prudential Insurance Company of America; Prudential Financial, Inc.].  They got, they got--."  He said, "They ain't they got much of nothing. Boy, he said, what we got for them is something good."  He said, "You go out there and talk to them?" I said, "Yes."  "And that's--and that's what they tell you?"  He said, "Do you tell them about the progress our people making?  Tell them about the building and the motel [A.G. Gaston Motel, Birmingham, Alabama] and the, you know, (unclear) tell them what we're trying to do.  We can do more."  I said, "Mr. Gaston I tell them that."  He said, "What they say?"  I said, "Mr. Gaston they say don't no--don't no black man own that."  He said, "That's what they say?"  I said, "Yes."  So he filled that pipe.  He said, he said, "Joe [HistoryMaker Joe Dickson] keep up the good work.  Just stay with the little man.  So that's what they thinking."  And said, "You know what, as long as they think the white folks own these buildings, they ain't gonna tear them up."  (Laughter) Mr. Gaston was something.  He was something.

Speaker 1: But I left Tuskegee [Alabama]. Pitts [Lucius Holsey Pitts, Sr.] and Dukes [Frank Dukes] came down there and got me.  They--the black folk opened a thing called Excel Superstores [ph.].  They were going to, to open a supermarket in order that black folk could be entrepreneurs.  They had a store right down the street called Liberty Supermarket [Liberty Supermarkets].  And as you can--if you don't--if you don't know most of the people who lived in Birmingham [Alabama], white or black, they were in the commissary mentality.  They--U.S. Steel [United States Steel Corporation] had the--this cutlass community by the throat.  You bought your clothes, your shoes, you got your medical care, everything, through U.S. Steel.  They had the grocery stores, they had everything.  They had it all locked up.  And I think it was The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company that brought the lawsuit to break the monopoly that they had.  They built the houses, the housing, the reason some of this--some of these diseases so prevalent among blacks and people around here is the--all the houses that they built were built right at the gate just about at the plant gate so the workers could do was get up and go to work.  They weren't--you know.  So as a consequence they were--when the supermarkets came in and Reverend Marks [ph.] and everybody saw it, they said, "Well, black people probably can get into this."  They sold stock.  Black people bought stock.  They ran into a little trouble with the--with the--with A.G. [A.G. Gaston] about it, but they managed to--to keep it going.  So I had got into training with (Unclear) and said, excuse me, they were looking for some people, somebody who had had some semblance of an idea of what a supermarket was--was run like.  So Dukes knew I was down in Montgomery [Alabama], so Dukes came to--had gotten Pitts and they and got on me to come back.  I told them no, I didn't wanna do that.  They need to see Mr. Gaston.  So they saw Mr. Gaston and I wrote the letter and I came back to manage Excel Superstores.  And that was something that--that really was, was something, you know.
Story_ID: 543267
Speaker 1: Okay.  Before we go on to you managing Excel Superstores [ph.], right before you left Tuske- I mean to go to Tuskegee [Alabama], there was an incident with the kids in the park that you were telling about off camera.
Speaker 2: Well, what I thought I was telling you was that after the, the initial arrest being arrest and the sit ins were happening all over--all over the south and we were trying to integrate these lunch counters and the other restaurants and things.  In the--in these department stores like Loveman's, Pizitz, they had a nice eating places in there.  And so the kids were up there in the, the--they were--well we would let a senior student probably would take 'em up there to, to sit in and in these restaurants they had, you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And you--as a consequence, it got out of hand.  And so they called out and said that they were acting--the kids were acting kind of bad and for somebody to come up there and get them.  So Fred [HistoryMaker Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth] went up there to get them.  And I just was happening to be coming in at that time--'cause not coming in, I was coming, going about to go up there too.  And so Fred had brought them from downtown, they were on 17th Street and he was on the left hand side coming, going north like you coming back to 16th Street Baptist Church [Birmingham, Alabama].  And right there at the--'cause Nelson Brothers Cafe [Birmingham, Alabama] was right there.  And right time Fred got right there he had a white handkerchief in his hand.  And he had right it--it was going--was going across--we was finna go--they were gonna go across the street and come down by the Masonic Temple [Masonic Temple Building, Birmingham, Alabama] on past the hotel and (unclear) and all that bunch down through there.  And by the time he got right at the end, they put the water hose on him.  They put the water hose on Fred, knocked him up against that wall while they was--and when he was coming off the wall another hose hit him and knocked him back up.  Fred got up.  Malcolm X was standing over on the other corner over there and when--when Fred got up, I don't see how.  He got up and looked at him and several us said, "Don't put no more water on him."  So he went on past and marched the kids on down past the hostess, the new (Unclear) hotel.  And the new (Unclear) restaurant was the hotel up there.  Walked on down there--there used to be a barbershop and was Ms. Lurleen [ph.] had her health and beauty aids stand right there.  And some guys, tried to get in the--in the--they were keeping the kids in a single file march, keep, trying to keep it orderly.  The streets were full.  But they kept the kids in order to get them back in the church.  Some black guys tried to get in the line and this white policeman told them, "You can't get in this line.  You ain't worthy.  You ain't good enough.  You ain't good as these people."  Said, "Get out move back."  He was out--they were get in there after the kids have gone up on there and got in the line and marched back.  They were gonna get in the line.  The police said, "You ain't--you not good as these folk.  Move back, move back."  So when the kids got--when Fred got them across the street there--got all the children inside going in the church, Fred was going down in this little basement like thing on the right side that you can go down.  Them folks put that water hose on Fred, about six or seven water hoses on him.  And look like they tried to flood the basement.  All I know is, I thought he was dead.  They was trying to kill him with--Birmingham [Alabama] fire--firemen were trying to kill him.  Fred survived that.  I saw him over here yesterday.  And that was--and I--and right after that I didn't--I didn't--I didn't wanna be nonviolent no more.  That was--'cause that was--totally they didn't have to do that, you know.
Story_ID: 543268
Speaker 1: And when I got to Tuskegee [Alabama] and they, and they needed somebody to do, come back and do Excel [Excel Superstores (ph.)] they thought I could do the job because I had gotten some training in New York [New York] but (laughter) as I--after we talked to Mr. Gaston [A.G. Gaston] he said, "Well that preacher ain't gonna do right Joe [HistoryMaker Joe Dickson]."  Said, "But I'm--you leave, you go on over there, you go on over there."  He said, "You, you stay honest.  You keep it going as long as you can."  Said, "'Cause if the Negro can't feed themselves, he can't do nothing.  So you go on over there."  He said, "And you keep--." He said, "Now that preacher gonna fire you." Said, "But you go on over there."  I swear to God he told me (laughter).  And as the Lord is heaven, he fired me (laughter).  He fired me.  When he fired me it hurt me so bad.  Here he, he fired me.  He said I stole something and I ain't never stole nothing.  And so I was in--went back over to the shoe shine parlor one day.  Well, in the barbershop when Benny [ph.]--Benny been shining shoes all his life so I was in there I was--I was--I keep up mess all the time.  So, I went over there, head down and I had my suit and tie and everything on.  And I didn't know what I was gone do.  So I went in to get a shoeshine.  So Benny said, "What's wrong with you?  What's wrong you school boy?"  I said, "I'm all right."  He said, he said, "No, something wrong with you."  I said, "You know," and Bob McDowell [ph.] came in.  And I said, he said, "What's wrong?  What's wrong with you?"  I said, "I been on (unclear) standing there all day and all night and Reverend Marks [ph.] and them fired me talking about I stole something.  I ain't never stole nothing in my life."  Benny said, "Man," said, "you ain't, you ain't even no man no way 'til somebody fire you."  He said, "That's what they say all the time.  The Negro then stole something.  You ain't got to be done stole nothing."  (Laughter) Say, "Look up. Man keep wearing your suit and tie."  Say, "Won't nobody do it and you go find you a job.  You ain't--ain't nobody gonna believe nothing that man said."  And I walked out, I walked into one of my better friends, Emory O. Jackson.  Emory O. Jackson was the managing editor of the Birmingham World newspaper.  I was coming out and Benny was telling him some of what's happening.  He said, "Go over to my office."  It was right across--right, right on 17th Street on the alley where Nelson Brothers Cafe is now.  He said, "Wait 'til I get there."  I went in there and I was still kind of feeling bad 'cause they fired me and I had worked day and night in that thing.  Got just so when I got in there Emory said, "So the preacher fired you huh?"  He started laughing.  It wasn't funny to me (laughter).  He started laughing he said, "Well, that always happens.  That always--when they can't use--when they can't get you to do what they wanna do, they use whatever way they can get rid of you.  But that's nothing."  He said, "You got a picture of yourself?"  I said, "Yes I got--I have a picture of myself."  And he said, "Get me a picture."  He said, he called Ms. Ruth Poro Jackson [sic. Ruth J. Jackson], she used to have the Poro school of beauty [Poro College].  She used to train people to do hair.  So she had a thing called the Southern Beauty Congress.  They brought in beauticians from all over the southeast and they would do hair shows and do stuff like that.  But they put together a souvenir magazine.  So I became the executive director of the Southern Beauty Congress.  And my job was to sell advertising and fill up the book.  I sold the advertising, filled the book up, I ain't get no money.  But it redeemed my name (laughter).  It redeemed my name.
Story_ID: 543269
Speaker 1: And Pitts [Lucius Holsey Pitts, Sr.] and Dukes [Frank Dukes] remembered that they had got me to go down, down in Tuskegee [Alabama].  And Pitts called me and told me to come to work he had something for me to do.  I told him I had to go back to Mr. Gaston [A.G. Gaston].  He said, "Well, I'll work that out."  They had a project there it was called--it was--it was really out of Lyndon Johnson's [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] idea to do this Manpower Development Training Act [Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962].  They had--we told--when they told--the argument was that if you integrate Negroes, if you try to put them on jobs, what could they do?  They can't do anything.  So what they did, they did, had an experimental demonstration program.  And Dr. Arenia Mallory who was president of--of Mary Holmes Junior College [sic. Saints Industrial and Literary School] over in Mississippi [Lexington, Mississippi] was running that project.  And then Dr. Bryce [ph.] who was at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] who was in education problem, they told him that they could put together these training programs and train black folks.  So Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama] had one of those grants.  We got a boy named David Wilson [ph.], white boy out of--out of New Jersey, that was supposed to come down and run the program.  Dr. Pitts said, "Well, we gone let him run it.  And you are go- you're gonna be his deputy director."  But David stayed in New Jersey and I ran the program.  So what we did, we trained people to be RNs [registered nurse].  We got them ready to be RNs.  We got them ready to be mechanics.  We got 'em ready to be clerk typists, stenos [stenographers] and stuff like that at Miles College.  You had to come to school.  You had to--they didn't have the GED [General Educational Development] then.  You had to--we had to get you ready so you can pass a test so you can fill out an application.  We did all that stuff at Miles.  The experimental and demonstration program was at Miles College on Miles College campus.  And what we did, gave--the students were supposed to get a fare to ride the bus to the school and get some stipend every, every week to assist them 'cause they were--they weren't children they were older people who, who just was outside of the job market.  So what we did then they didn't--they wanted us to pay them the stipend.  Just give them--give them money.  So we didn't do that.  We had some hardcore folks that were in that program with us who really need.  We got people who finished that program went on to get their B.A., their master's and other degrees and now they sending their kids to college with that training.  But you'd have to be--you have to be real--you can't play with them.  You got to with that.  You got--and you know the need and so we got that program going.  And at the time the program had been on the campus so long, that the people and the neighbors were probably the people wanting to know what was going on.  That's where I met Dr. Ed LaMonte [Edward LaMonte].  This was the first time in my life I ever heard a white man tell somebody these our people.  They came to take the grant because Pitts had been--hadn't put it into use, and probably was using the interest that that paid to run the school.  They came, Pitts was out of town.  Dr. Pitts was out of town so LaMonte said, "I'm sorry, but you can't--you I'm, I'm representing the president.  He, he left no orders with me to, to--for this."  He said, "The president well, he's coming back in town."  He said, "You can talk with the president."  He said, "But we gonna run the program.  Our people need this training."  Ed, Ed LaMonte I think was on loan from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  To Dr., Dr. Pitts down here.  And he was a true champion.  I think Ed is at Birmingham Southern [Birmingham-Southern College, Birmingham, Alabama] now.  But he was a true champion.  He worked with us and got that program.  The program--we perfected the program and the program is now the workforce development thing all over--all over the country.  But we--Pitts was--we were telling John Doar that--that they need to come down and intervene and help us train these folks.  Doar and Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] said it was it a lick--it was--it was a state matter.  It was a matter for the civil (unclear).  The federal government had nothing to do with it, it was state matter, you know.  But then when Lyndon Johnson got in there, they put folks in to train and monitor the staff and we got stuff rolling a little bit.
Story_ID: 543270
Speaker 1: Now, when did I get back to Mr. Gaston (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You know every time I would go--I, I have changed a lot of jobs.  But every time I'd go my base was A.G. Gaston.  I would let him know what I was doing.  He said, "Oh, well go and do it.  Stay honest.  We'll find something for you to do when you come back.  We'll find something for you to do."  So when I left--we didn't get the program refunded again.  So the people in Atlanta [Georgia] the Urban League [Urban League of Greater Atlanta]--no, no--yes, the Urban League had a project called Project Assist.  That project was in six, seven states.  Six--let me see it was in Augusta [Georgia], it was in Birmingham [Alabama], it was Hattiesburg, Mississippi, Atlanta, it simply--it was--it was called Project Assist.  This project was a project to show the people who wanna do well and get folks moving if they think and come up with a good program you can do it and it'll work.  This project was put together to move black people who were stagnated in--in different jobs.  And the purpose was to get them moved up.  So because when they would go to the big--to the big--to these folks, the banks and whatever, water works and all these folks and tell them that we want you to move black folks up, they said, "We would move them up, if they can pass the test.  They can't pass the test."  So a professor at Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] named Dr. Lee Henney [R. Lee Henney] invented or developed what is called--what he called a power test.  Said the reason you don't pass a test, you don't have enough information.   If you can count and do what you need to do and read and write and can move the numbers and stuff you can--you should be able to pass the test.  So we developed a series of tests that we were training people to test.  So and when we got it developed, we'd test them.  But we had to get the people.  So that meant we had to go Sipco [ph.].  We had to go to U.S. Pipe.  We had to go to the banks.  The water works and all these folks to get the list of the names, and most black people were buried in the post office though.  That was the job--the college educated folk were buried in the post office and they were waiters, you know.  So around here--so what we did we went in--and the most disheartening--everybody I got--I mean, I think it was--I think it was--I think it was going well 'til I got to First National Bank of Birmingham [Birmingham, Alabama].  And man I never will forget it.  A little short man, I think his name was Buchanan [ph.] I think he must have been the--the human resources.  They don't call it then, they must be the employment man there whatever.  I went in there and I--Heman Sweatt [Heman Marion Sweatt] was my supervisor from Atlanta, the Atlanta Urban League.  We didn't have no Urban League here.  And so when I first went out, I was trying to use the name the Urban League just so folks knew what we were trying to do.  So we had an office in Mr.--in one of Mr. Gaston's building.  So why I didn't get no traction?  So I went back and I told Mr. Sweatt I said, "Look I'm not getting any traction?"  He said, "You trying to do it by yourself?"  I said, "I thought you told me--."  He said, "No, no. You got to get Gaston.  You got to get somebody like that," (laughter).  "These folks don't know nothing about you."  So I told Mr. Gaston what we were doing.  So he said, "Well, go back."  But when I got to--to Amsouth Bank [AmsouthBancorporation]--it was First National Bank, that guy told me he said, "Mr. Dickson [HistoryMaker Joe Dickson]," he said, "what you asking me for, we don't give that information to nobody but the United States government."  And said, "We make our reports twice a year. We've made our report.  And we ain't gonna give you no report like that."  (Laughter) He said, he told me, he said, "You know ain't nobody interested in this but a--but a few of y'all."  He said, "We just ain't gonna go up in cat mountain and up alley three and hire nobody and have them come back here on Monday morning smelling like whiskey over our customers," (laughter).  "We just ain't gonna have that."  He said, "And you know what?  We like to think that our customers like it like that."  And he said, "You know we got--we got 85 percent of the Negro business.  And we think they like the way we do business."  When I left out that man office I was crying (laughter).  I cried down the elevator, went down--I don't know--I don't remember.  All I remember I was sitting in Mr. Gaston's office crying and Maddie [ph.] said, "What's the matter with you?"  I told him [sic. her] I said, "I just left the bank up there," and was explaining.  She said, "Dr. Gaston, Joe out here in the office.  I don't know what's the matter with him. He out crying he want--he wanna see you."  Say Mr. Gaston you couldn't never just go in there.  You had to have an appointment.  So he said, he said--said, "Well, Dr. Gaston can you see him?"  So I went in there and I told him what happened.  And he said, "Oh you," he smoked that pipe.  Said, "Well, just go on back--go on back down there and call me on the other folk."  I went back down there.  About, I guess about, about, about a week or two later Buchanan called me.  Ms. Wynn [ph.] I think was my secretary.  She said, said, "Mr. Dickson," said, "somebody from the bank want you."  I said, "What bank? First National Bank."  So I picked the phone up he said, "Mr. Dickson?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  He said, "This Mr. Buchanan.  I got something for you.  You can come by and pick it up."  And I'm not--I'll tell you this story because a lot of people didn't understand Mr. Gaston.  Booker T. Washington and A.G. Gaston to me, the two most powerful Alabama Negroes.  They been through--they could get things done.
Story_ID: 543271
Speaker 1: I got that information, so we started moving folks.  We started sending folks to Blue Cross and Blue Shield [Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama].  We started sending folk that hadn't had these jobs before.  And I sent--they needed a salesman at Blue Cross Blue Shield.  They hadn't--they hadn't hired a salesman so--
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) worked with the Urban League [Urban League of Greater Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Okay.  You worked for the Urban League.
Speaker 1: Urban League.
Speaker 2: But you all had an office in Gas- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear). In the building.
Speaker 2: In the building.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Okay.
Speaker 1: So, so we sending people.  And so I sent some girls over there and he said, "Now look (unclear) some of the girls you sent they were--they are--."  Said you know, "They coming on pretty good."  Say, "Now, send us some more like them."  So I sent him some more.  So they needed a salesman over there.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I sent about five guys over there.  And they didn't send--they wouldn't take one of them.  So one day the president of Blue Cross, the sales manager, and vice president was--we was up on 5th Avenue and 17th Street [Birmingham, Alabama].  And Mr. Williams [ph.] said, "They--the people from Blue Cross come here wanna see you."  I said, "Oh, let's hope these folk ain't gone in there and messed up nothing.  (Unclear) is this."  They came over and they took--telling--so they started talking about they needed a salesperson.  And I told them that I had sent them some folk over there.  They said, "We know, we know."  Said, "But we want you."  (Laughter) I said, "I can't do that."  I said, "I can't do that."  So we--they were moving the Urban League in at that time.  So I talked to Mr. Gaston [A.G. Gaston] again.  He said, "Well, we got to, we got to, got get our people in these places."  Said, "Go on over there."  And said, "If you--we'll find something for you to do."  So I went over there, got that started.  And Orzell Billingsley had a project that they had gotten from NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And it was-it was the Afro-American Contractors Association.  Leroy Gaillard who was--who was a huge black contractor and architect around there built a lot--a lot of buildings around there.  Chase right down there and all this stuff.  And he was kind of up with it and Ozzie Elliott [ph.] who had this guy out of New York who had gotten some money from the labor unions and gotten some money from the labor department to, to try to move black folk into some of the electrical trade, these skills and trades as electricians, the plumbers and pipefitters and stuff like that, so. And set them in, set them up in business.  So I took that job to get that, to move that up.
Story_ID: 543272
Speaker 1: And by that time, I had been--I had been divorced from my--that wife for about five years.  So I was dating the wife I'm married to now [Charlie Dickson].  That was in '69 [1969] I think.  And so I said I'm just tired because I always wanted to go to law school.  I had five children.  I said, "I always wanted to go to law school."  So she said, "Well, why don't you go?"  I said, "I can't go I got these--we got these children."  She said, "Yes you can."  We got married and I went to Howard University law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] in 1970.  Just borrowed forty-five hundred dollars of student loan from forty-five hundred dollars.  Just as I got ready to go Rachel [Rachel Payne Dickson] calls me, she down in Dr.--Dr. Carraway's [Ben Carraway] office down there in Fairfield [Alabama]. Look like she--I don't know what's wrong.  So I go--I get her and take her back to Dr. Drake [ph.] he said, "I then told Dickson what's wrong with her.  She got a hiatal hernia."  I said, "What is that?"  He said, "She got a hiatal hernia.  She--it need to be removed.  Dickson, I told you about that."  I said, "She didn't tell me nothing about it."  She went to another doctor, thinking somebody gonna say something else.  I said, "Dr. Drake, would you write down on a prescription everything."  He wrote a prescription I took her to University Hospital [University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, Birmingham, Alabama].  And they admitted her.  He got--they admitted her.  But they wanted fifteen hundred dollars.  I had forty-five.  So I gave them the fifteen hundred.  I called the people at Howard and told them what was--what happened and I told them that I wouldn't--just give the slot to somebody else I wouldn't gonna be able to come 'cause I'd be late 'cause I just put her in the hospital.  I don't know how long she be.  They told me, "You stay there with her, when you get--when they--whenever they release, come on."  And I went to Howard University School of Law.  Rachel got well and I graduated in 1973 (laughter).  And I never passed the bar.
Speaker 2: How many times did you take it?
Speaker 1: I took the bar, at the time you could take it three times.  I made as high as 69.9.  And you don't need to make but 70 [percent] (laughter).  I never passed the bar.
Story_ID: 543273
Speaker 1: Let me just go back a little bit so we can get some dates in here.  You worked for the Urban League [Urban League of Greater Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia] until, until when?
Speaker 2: About 1966--'67 [1967].  'Cause I worked for Blue Cross [Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama] about--about a year.  And then I went to--I left there and I went to the Afro-American Contractors [Afro-American Contractors Association].  And in '69 [1969] probably, 'cause in '70 [1970] I was in law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.].  And in September of 1970 I was in law school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you came out of law school you came back home.  And tell me the name of your--your second wife?
Speaker 2: Charlie Mae [Charlie Dickson].  Dr. Charlie Mae Dickson (laughter).
Speaker 1: And where did you met her?
Speaker 2: In Fairfield [Alabama], where I lived where I grew up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.

Speaker 2: I met her--I used to be an insurance man.  She told me, that she always admired me.  And that was, that was--I was an insurance man back in the '60s [1960s].  So she--she--my wife--see I'm seventy-four.  So my wife birthday is April 1, 1939.  So she--I'm about six maybe six, seven--a little older than she is.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So she probably, probably thought--she probably was--thought I was something, you know, and, and (laughter) and decided--I married up.  The end of it is I married up.  I married a smart woman.  Real smart woman.

Speaker 1: Okay.  So after you finished law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] and you come back to--
Speaker 2: Birmingham [Alabama] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to Birmingham.
Speaker 2: I go home--get a house--we get a house out in, in Grasselli Heights [Birmingham, Alabama].  So Charlie [Charlie Dickson] gone to work at the University of Alabama [University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama].  I had been studying for the bar with the materials they gave me from the bar association.  So I get a call from, from a good friend of mine.  And, "Hey, you a lawyer now.  You, you (unclear) you ought to come take me to lunch now.  You a big man now.  How come you didn't come take, take me to lunch?  You wanna take me to lunch?"  Dr. Gaston [A.G. Gaston].  I ain't have a dime.  (Laughter) I couldn't take him--couldn't take him nowhere.  I said, "Yes, I can come up there and take you to lunch."  So I dress up and I go to the office and sit down and, he come down and we drive the car as slow as we could.  Then I get out and slam the door and lock--went and locked the car and we gone walk over here.  He said, "Well, boy, was that a meter?"  I said, "Yes."  "So why you didn't put something in it?"  I said, "I would man."   He said, "You mean to tell me you would rather take a chance on paying a ticket than rather put a dime or quarter in there?  Put, put some money in that machine."  (Laughter) So I put the money in there.  We get up and go to Joy Young [Birmingham, Alabama].  We in Joy Young's, so we upstairs they had a--had a little upstairs thing where they had the little booths like you can close in a Chinese restaurant.  Mr. Gaston said, "You, you used to--what you doing boy?" I said, I said, "I'm studying for the bar."  He said, "Well how is your library?"  I said, "I'm just studying from, from my books and the stuff I got from the bar review."  And, "You, you that what you doing?"  I said--he said, "You need to--you get up there in Arthur--with Arthur and get with him."  Arthur Shores was--let me see.  Mr. Gaston right here, Lou Ritter [ph.] was here, Butler [ph.] was here, and the library here and Shores was over there.  He said, "You get with Arthur and get in there and in the, in the books in there and study."  And said, "You know--I know you got plenty of money."  He said, "But I'm, I'm gonna pay you two hundred dollars a week while you study for the bar so you can pass."  That was seventy--'73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So we keep eating and he say, got through eating and he said, "You want anything else?"  I said, "No, sir." He said, "Hey, waiter, give him--give him--bring him some of that pecan pie."  He bought me the pecan pie, and I ate the pecan pie.  He said, "Boy how many suits you got?"  I said, "I got about fifteen."  No, I said, "I got about ten.  And I got about oh, about fifteen pair of shoes."  He said, "Well, you, you looking like a lawyer.  You looking good."  He said, "The lawyers they, they do pretty good."  And he said, "Waiter," say, "bring him something to drink."  I said, "No Mr. Gaston I ain't.  I don't want nothing to drink."  I didn't drink with grown--with other people.  He said, "Go on, bring him something--bring him one of them Ol Granddaddy [Old Grand-Dad] he be drinking that down at the bar.  Bring him one of them."  The man brought me the Ol Granddaddy and I drank it.  He said, "Boy, I said if you come up here and you go to work with us, then you gonna--you gonna learn a lot.  'Cause we got--we got plans with you.  We got plans for you.  We got a lot we need to do."  He said, "The opportunities is yours."  He said, "How much suits you say you had?"  I said. Said, "You full?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  He said, "Boy, that is all you can do.  Yeah it's cool, I guess.  That's all you can do if you had all the money in the world.  You can wear a nice suit and clothes.  Eat what you wanna eat, be full."  He said, "You--now you need to learn how to do something to help somebody."
Story_ID: 543275
Speaker 1: So Mr. Gaston [A.G. Gaston] said you need to learn to do something for someone else.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So we, we go--come back to work for Mr. Gaston and I managed the Vulcan real estate investment corporation [Vulcan Realty and Investment Corporation].  And that handled--we collected the rents.  We sold property.  We bought property we had to have.  We, we had L.R. Hall Auditorium [Birmingham, Alabama] we would rent that out on occasion to people you know to--for weddings and stuff like that.  And handle the mortgages.  We had mortgages we handled that.  This kind of, this kind of stuff.  But we--I stayed with--I stayed with him until 1976.  In 1976, I said well, maybe I'll try to do something on my own.  So what I did, I bought a Century 21 [Century 21 Real Estate LLC] franchise.  So I became a Century 21 franchise broker.  And my office moved down on, on Bessemer Road.  And we--we screwed around.  We had twenty-five agents one time.  We then we just--then when Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] came in around '80s [1980s] somewhere the interest rates got extremely high.  And Paul Volcker didn't help it one bit.  So what we had to do, to survive we--we--we went to the City of Birmingham [Alabama] and, and we got them to agree to allow us to build some houses and they had a program that was a buy down program.  They would buy the lot and they would make an effort to get the interest rate down so we could get first time home buyers in the house.  So we--I created a company--for a company called C.D. and W. Construction Company [C.D.W. Construction Company].  And we bought some--bought properties and stuff.  And we got a--I had a bad--it was a bitter, it was bitter strange thing because what I was doing, I was building houses using my--the money we had doing passbook savings and stuff.  So I got convinced that--to, to put the money that I had into a CD [certificate of deposit] with a bank, with--with Compass, not Compass it was--not Compass, Compass bank [BBVA Compass] now.  So we did that and that was a mistake because when the deal was we were to build three houses and then three more and three more.  But at the end of that we, we--you know would go back.  So what happened, that's what we did.  We, we abided by that.  But the money, the excess money we, we had that we were making from the real estate sales from Century 21 and the money that we made profit in dealing with the--that was building those houses allowed us to have money we could do something else.  So one day the guy came out there and told me he said, "We--the bank want you to come in and, and pay off your loan."  Well we stretched out.  We got the CD.  We stretched out.  We're closing out, we never missed a close.  Never missed.  Never did anything.  I said, "What this about?"  He said, "The bank feels threatened."  I said, "Threatened about what?"  They did whatever they could to shut us down.  It was--it was--it was--I found out they could do it.  I wrote them a nice letter and everything.  But we met--we--we--that nearly--I went to the guy at Homecrafter [ph.] who was running Homecrafters.  I explained to him and he said, "What?"  He said--well really--we--they extended us credit to get us through that little, little thing.  And we, we managed--I managed not to have to go bankrupt.  But the bank set out to shut, shut us down.  We were moving too fast.  And we, we didn't go out and buy cars.  We didn't do no stuff like that.  We were about business.  Because the, the--I had help.  The mortgages that--the Masons would buy mortgages so they told us the people that they had money invested with, they--we brought somebody in there that was kind of funny, let them know before they turn it down.  I have had--for what I was doing to try to move keeping the community.  And, and our people owned--I got help from Mr. Gaston, A.G. Gaston, S.J. Bennett, Emory Jackson [Emory O. Jackson], Lucius Pitts [Lucius Holsey Pitts, Sr.], and Taggart [E.W. Taggart], the young--the older section of the black community.  These were the people that I was tied with. That I--that I was tied with these people.  Because they under--I didn't know that--I didn't understand.  Taggart talked to me a whole hour.  He was telling me about everybody in the city.  Dr. Taggart worked at U.S. Steel [United States Steel Corporation] in the summer, went to Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] in the winter.  I got strength from that.  I said, "If they can do that, I can do this."  (Unclear) did the same thing.  So I said, "I'm gonna be a businessman."  But when we went out there, the reality wasn't there.  We went to--U.S. Steel wouldn't sell us no property.  Told us that--the guy told me that they needed to keep it 'cause if a war come they need to go get that resources (laughter) you know.  But we, we stayed there and stayed there with C.D.W. and tried to weather that thing out with the--the high interest rates and stuff.  And the--and these guys only--weren't as creative as they are now about subprime and all that kind of mess.  We just toughed it out.
Story_ID: 543276
Speaker 1: All of the sudden Mr. Gaston [A.G. Gaston] came and got me again.  He said, he, he had gotten a loan.  He said, "You don't need to be down there.  You need come up in here and--and take over this Vulcan [Vulcan Realty and Investment Corporation]."  And--and he had, he had--I really believe Mr. Gaston, he had sold his funeral home to Tom Gardner [Thomas J. Gardner, Sr.].  And he had sold all those other funeral homes to guys who had funeral--Howard Johnson and the brothers down in Tuscaloosa [Alabama] and Marion County [Alabama], Montgomery [Alabama], Mobile [Alabama].  He had sold those funerals to those folk.  They didn't pay a dime down.  They just start paying.  And when he brought me back they weren't paying, so I collected the money.  I collected it.  I just say well you got to have seventeen thousand dollars, we got to have it or we gonna foreclose.  I collected all the money up and nobody liked that.  So we--I stayed there and we start doing stuff.  He sent me to Atlanta [Georgia] to learn how to do subdivisions.  I stayed out there at The Ritz-Carlton [Atlanta, Georgia] for one whole week. We paid thirty-five hundred dollars for me to stay there.  And we paid for the course.  At the time I stayed there, a guy told me from California, he said, "There's gonna be a wave of Mexican people just gonna come in here to do this work."  He said, "They gonna be here."  He said, "Just look for them."  He said, "You learn this.  You know how to do, what you need to do."  White guy told me this.  And, and I said, "Okay."  But when I got back, there--it was a guy didn't want--they didn't--they didn't think they needed--they didn't think they needed to be in that--in the, in the construction industry.  So I--I didn't say anything.  I just stayed on and doing what I needed to do.  Mr. Gaston student granddaughter came back, Cleola [ph.], from Texas.  And he put her under me.  He told me to train her.  Get her ready.  This didn't have nothing to do with you.  And I did what he asked me to do.  I trained her and got her ready.  So when she, she's a tough real estate person now.  And she works--she works for some, some other folk. They shut--
Story_ID: 543277
Speaker 1: You know, I was always active in the Republican Party.  So Governor Hunt [H. Guy Hunt] got elected in eight- 1988.  From '85 [1985] to up to about eighty--I'm--I'm working at the real estate company and stuff.   And I'm shutting my companies down 'cause he said I need to be up there.  See he [A.G. Gaston] was getting up in the eighties.  He wanna fix it like he needed to fix it.  So I come on back.  Well in '88 [1988] when the governor get elected, I in '76 [1976] we set up the, the--it was NBRC, the National Black Republican Council.  But I became president of the Alabama Republican council.  And, and we was there and was working with that for a long while.  But when the Governor gets e- when the Democrats can't get it together and Baxley [Bill Baxley] and the other guy [Charles Graddick] get into it, Hunt gets in the race and wins the election.  We then--here you got a Republican onslaught in, in Alabama now for real.  So they looking for somebody to work in the governor's office then in--in his cabinet.   They, they didn't have no blacks.  And I was chairman of the Alabama Republican conference [sic.], but I'm working for Mr. Gaston.  And so they want me.  I said, "Well I can't go.  I'm always--I can't go."  So I meet with John Whittier [ph.] and I just tell him I say, "I can't go.  You have to talk to Mr. Gaston about this."  Can't (unclear) with the person who really is in my corner.  So Mr. Gaston talked with him and they said okay.  Mr. Gaston go down there and he said, "If he got something for you to do, you do it."  He told this, told Governor Hunt said, "If you got anything for him to do--look, we looking for good men too, this is one of my best men.  If you got anything for him to do, he know.  But if you ain't got nothing for him to do, he can send him on back in there with me."  And I went to work for the governor.  I worked--I--I worked for the governor as--as his assistant for minority affairs.  For that was in--I think that was in '88 [1988], 'cause--yeah--'cause I bought the newspaper [Birmingham World] in '89 [1989].  It was in '88 [1988].  That's when the--when the all hell broke loose.  And the Democrats wanted Mr., Mr. Hunt to take down all the Confederates--all symbols of the republic- I mean, the--the Confederate flags and all this.  Tom Reed [Thomas Reed] gets in trouble over in (unclear).  So I'm down there in the middle of all of this stuff.  And so I know all these guys, you know, 'cause I'm been around them in the church, been in the struggle. So, Hunt tell me, Governor Hunt said, "Joe [HistoryMaker Joe Dickson] you know we can do--we don't need that.  Alabama doesn't need any more confusion and nonsense.  We can take this flag down, but we don't need these marching and acting like this.  We don't need this."  Say 'cause--then who can we talk to?  I said, "Well you can you--why don't you talk to--to--to Chester [ph.] and--," but that's--no.  No he told me he wanted me--he wanted to--to talk to Tom Reed.  So I went and got Tom Reed and he bring in the whole entourage bringing all The New York Times, everybody in.  So they--he talked to him, that didn't do any good.  Then they had sent for Fred Horn.  They climbing all up on the fence.  I said, "Fred, man you all don't need to do this."  So Hunt, Hunt called me back he said, "Joe, we got to do something."  I said, "What can we do?"  I said, "Why don't you get Joe--get Fred and Chester."  And they went and they--they got up and called me in there and that's when they go back and forward but they don't do anything.  So he said, "We got to do something."  He said, "These folks riding around with guns in the back of these--these pickup trucks and guns in the back.  We don't need no more catastrophe."  That was--that was what Governor Hunt told me.  So I said, "What can I do?"  I called Nevett, Reverend Nevett [Charles H. Nevett].  He was the president of--of SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], Alabama president of SCLC.  So I get him on the phone up in the--in the press--in the press office.  The guy who was handling the press for the governor.  And so I said, first I asked if he would do it. He said--he laughed at me.  He wouldn't do nothing.  He said, "No, I ain't gonna get into that. No you let him deal with that."  So I called Nevett.  And when I called--(laughter) when I called Reverend Nettles [John Nettles], Reverend Nettles, Nettles said, "I don't know Joe."  He said, "Joe," he said, "I--I--know--I don't wanna have to."  I said, "Hold on, hold on a minute."  So I ran around there and I told him I said, I told them, "I got, I got, I got Reverend Nettles on the phone." I said, "We got to get--where is the governor?"  He said, "He in there."  I said, "Get him to pick up the phone."  So he goes in there, I said, "We need you and we need your help."  He said, "I'm gonna have to ask the Lowery [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Joseph Lowery] about this."  I said, "What you mean you got to ask the Lowery about this?"  He said, "I got, you know, well Reverend Lowery is the chairman and I'm the president of the SCLC."  I said, "You," I said, "when did a Baptist--when did we get a Baptist minister?" I said, "You, you a Baptist minister got to ask the pope?"  I said, "Is, is Reverend--is Reverend Lowery, the pope?"  He said, "No you crazy, you crazy."  I said, "Man," and Hunt--I said--governor say, "I liked to invite you up to Hunters [sic.]," (laughter), "to the--to the governor's mansion and let's talk about this thing."  And Reverend Lowery and Reverend Nettles went down and talked with the governor and they made the, the transition from the top--the capitol [Alabama State Capitol, Montgomery, Alabama] to the--to the house--of White House of the Confederacy [First White House of the Confederacy, Montgomery, Alabama] they moved it over there.  So when Nettles saw me he said, "Man, now don't do me like this," (laughter), "no more."  But it was quite violent.  They riding around with the shotguns and all that foolishness about the Confederacy.  We needed to get that straightened out.  So they got it straightened out and Nettles and myself, we became very good friends up until his death.  But I don't know how I got him.  When I told him, that, "You gonna--you mean to tell me a Baptist minister got to ask somebody about what a Baptist minister gonna do," (laughter).  He liked to die.
Story_ID: 543278
Speaker 1: So we, we stayed down there for a while.  Then we--when we bought the newspaper [Birmingham World], my wife [Charlie Dickson] and my--my wife was working at the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] and Hobson [ph.] was in, in--and my son, they was just--they had just gotten to graduating from college.  He went, they went and they didn't--he didn't--but Hobson was there with him and we had to do something.  So a situation happened I went to the--I went to Yellow Bluff, Alabama.  It was a black--it was town, a all-black town down there.  MacMillan Bloedel [MacMillan Bloedel Ltd.] has one of it's--MacMillan Bloedel is one of the largest forestry people in the world, out of Canada.  So they have big--nice plant down there.  The town was all--was elected all, black judge, black coroner the whole nine yards, sheriff, whole nine.  So I went down there to see what was going on, see what we could do to help them.  Weren't a--weren't a street, weren't a park or nothing down there.  And money that comes to the states comes, comes to the State of Alabama come to a decker and it's supposed to be used to help low and moderate income people.  You can use it do parks and you do all kinds of stuff with that.  Now, so the governor wanted to do something about it.  So when I went down there I told them to look, you guys then went with the Democrats all the time, they ain't done a damn thing.  Now I'm down here and it ain't but one me over there with all them white folks and if I go down there and we convince them to do, y'all got to vote with them.  That's how you do, you know, one hand wash another.  So I said, "But I tell you what, you can handle it yourself.  I'll get you a meeting up there with the governor."  So he sent somebody else down there another (unclear) one of the white boys went down there and looked at it.  He said, "Guys, Joe [HistoryMaker Joe Dickson] telling the truth.  Ain't nothing down there."  So I went down there again and when I got back they had moved my office off of the top--off the floor up there down in the basement  They ain't told me nothing about it.  So I had got my wife picture and just got on up out there and came on home.  I then wrote him letter let him know, told him I quit.  I don't--you move my stuff down there in the basement.  And all the people were coming down there.  It was so many folks down there who (laughter) to see me and to get stuff, try to get stuff done.  They were--I'm not bragging at all, 'cause I don't want it, I don't brag.  But when they moved that office down there to the bottom now and didn't tell me nothing about it--I wouldn't have mind if they had told me something about it, I just left and came on home to run the newspaper.  But sa- at the same time I could have gone back to Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington Insurance Company, Birmingham, Alabama] but Mr. Gaston [A.G. Gaston] had gotten sick.  And he had sold the company to the employees and they had--they owned SE- or ES- or what is it SOP, ESOP employee stock option thing [employee stock ownership plan].  And so they had a--they had sold the company.  And they had abolished Vulcan Realty [Vulcan Realty and Investment Corporation].  They weren't no more Vulcan Realty (laughter).  So Mr. Gaston, "Boy you been a good one."  Said when he was at the bank, said, "You, you know you been a good one.  These fellows don't understand."  Say, "As long as I'm living, if, young man, if you wanna come in this bank and work, you can come in here and work."  But I just went on to the paper and--and--and worked and dealt--and dealt with that.  But I got away from down there in Montgomery [Alabama], they then moved my office down to the basement? No. And don't tell me about it?  I don't mind being, but you should tell me.  We already gotten it straight once.  They were telling me--I went off somewhere and came back and they wanna know what my schedule was and when I'm away, where you be and what you do.  And I said, "Ask the governor where I went."  I said, "What is this about?"  So I just walked out of my office went down there and said, "Rhonda [ph.], is the governor in?"  She said, "Yeah."  I said, "I need to see him one minute."  I said, "All these folks wanna know what I'm doing or all, everybody down there. Can you straighten this out?"  He put (laughter) his hand on shoulder and laughed walking down there.  He just said, "Y'all this Joe Dickson.  You may not know him, but he know more about this than all y'all know about him.  He know where he going.  He--leave him alone."  But I quit.  He said, "Well you don't have to be in Montgomery.  You can have your office up there if you want to."  I--I wouldn't--I didn't nothing partisan.  What I did, I did for what was best for the people in the State of Alabama, black and white.  And that's--that's an honesty.  Most, most of the folk who really know me, that's what I did.  And, and Hunt [H. Guy Hunt] was the same way.  You see they talking--they talked about him but he--he appointed a black to the Supreme Court [Supreme Court of Alabama].  We don't have a single--right as we speak--black constitutionally elected officer in the State of Alabama.
Story_ID: 543279
Speaker 1: So I worked and I--I was--I wasn't gonna do anything.  I let the paper [Birmingham World] slow down.  And, and this back--this was going up to '95 [1995].  I go back and I started doing the real estate.  Up to '95 [1995] I--I'm running a newspaper day in day out ripping and running.  And guess what?  About three weeks after I quit Hunt [H. Guy Hunt] I get a phone call I'm in Dick Arrington's [Richard Arrington, Jr.] office and the girl told me the governor--three times.  So she told them I was in Dick Arrington's office.  He called Arrington's office, "What you doing in there Joe [HistoryMaker Joe Dickson] (unclear)."  I said, "I was talking with the governor."  He said, "I need to talk you.  I got something I want you to do for me."  I said, "What is it?"  He said, "Come on down here."  So I went down there and I knew I weren't going to work down there or whatever, I was not down there.  He said, "I want you to serve on the state personnel board."  I said, "State personnel board."  So I said, "I'm okay."  I didn't have no problem with that.  He said you only--you have to work one meeting or two meetings a month whatever.  So I went--I served that was in eight- 1990.  So I think I took---no I didn't.  I may have took part--no it was a complete term six years.  I served on that--I serve on that board now.  And (laughter) you got--well, that's why I'm telling you this story.  So General Taylor Hardin [James Taylor Hardin] was on that--on that--that board.  And it's some things that was going on, I guess, the governor wanted to change and he wanted his man over there.  So it rocked and rocked and so finally it revolved around I became the chairman.  And I got--I think, Governor Hunt reappointed me.  That wasn't--yeah, he reappointed me.  So I made that was two terms.  So Governor Hunt got impeached.  And they put in Governor--Governor Folsom [Jim Folsom].  And then Governor Folsom didn't get elected I don't think, or didn't run.  Then they put in Fob James.  And after Fob James got in, I think Fob James appointed me back to the board.  Then after Fob left, then came Siegelman [Don Siegelman].  Then Siegelman left and after Siegelman left, then came Bob Riley.  Then Bob Riley appointed me.  So this year, as last year they--there's a bill circulating in the Alabama Legislature for term limits on the personnel board (laughter).  You--it's, it's something, you know.  You just can't tell me what to do, I'm gonna do what's right but you, you not gonna, you know, do me--tell me what to do.
Story_ID: 543280
Speaker 1: In 1990 you still had the Century 21 [Century 21 Real Estate LLC] franchise?
Speaker 2: I still got--no I didn't have a franchise.  We, we got out of that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We got rid--okay.
Speaker 2: They it was--a lot of stuff came up behind that Century 21 thing.  So we just got out of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They--
Speaker 1: So you had another real estate company?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what is--what is the name of it?
Speaker 2: It's--it's now or what was in it--it was Inestate Realty [ph.] back then, but now it's BJ&W [ph.].  That's what it is now.  And I don't--I'm the only person in there now.  I just do what I been doing--I been doing some stuff for say--do some like U.S. Pipe or Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington Insurance Company, Birmingham, Alabama] or somebody.  I don't--I don't hustle housing no more.  What I do, I'll do--I'll sell a house, but I have to know you.  I don't--I don't--like I used to--I used to sell, close four or five a month for myself.  I used to do that, but I don't do that anymore.  Because it, it takes--you have to network, you have to be there and plus the fact that people who buy houses not my--in my age.  None of them are my age practically anymore.  So I, I got with the paper [Birmingham World] and I, I'm just putting a lot of time with the paper.  In the interim I get mad.  I get mad at my kids.  I said, "We got this thing and I'm moving and, and this, this can go."  And the Internet thing is jumping.  They can deal with it, but they, they don't see what I see I don't guess.

Speaker 1: One day I get phone call from, from--here this woman on the line and it was Rachel [Rachel Payne Dickson].  She said, "What you doing boy?"  I said, "I'm finna go to the office."  She said, "You come down here a minute before you go.  I want you to fix me something to eat."  She ain't never asked me to come fix her nothing to eat.  I said, "I wonder what this is."  So I go over there.  She was living in Clyde William Terrace [W. Clyde Williams Terrace, Fairfield, Alabama] 'cause my brother that had the stroke is there.  He, he's never been five miles away from that woman all his life.  He had the stroke.  So I get there and--and the dishes washed and it look like somebody's cooked the food al- food already.  So I look around I said--well--she just get to talking and talking about everybody, every child she got, and everybody and I'm going on.  See she older now, you know, she ninety something now you know. But she don't want nobody to do nothing for her.  So I'm wondering why she told--so she said, "You doing all right?"  "Yeah."  I said, "I got to the--I'm gonna have to go on and go to the office now."  She said, "Oh boy, sit here.  You ain't got nothing to do, sit here."  I sat there about another hour and I said, "Mama, I gotta--I gotta go to the office now."  She said, "For what?"  (Laughter) She said, "You ain't putting that paper [Birmingham World] out.  What you going up there for?"  I said, "I got--I don't know--I have to go in the office--I can sell two houses in one hour or whatever I want.  And I don't have to do that.  I don't wanna have to--."  "Oh," she said, "what you--what you say?"  I said, "I--I don't have to do that." Then she say, "You mean to tell me you, you mad with your children."  Said, "Weren't you working for this bone?"  I said, "Yes, ma'am."  "Oh, you--did he tell you what--you let them tell you what--what you--what you do in your life is grown children is based?  You base that on your children?"  I said, I said, "Well, no," I said.  But I then worked.  I then worked hard, we then sent them to school and they don't want this paper and ain't no need me worrying about it.  She said, "Boy, you ain't doing nothing that's awful, but let me tell you this, see you put that newspaper back out there.  'Cause if your children don't want it, somebody's child'll get it and do something with it."  Say, "You can't do everything looking out for your children--your children.  You put that newspaper back out there." Then she got sick.  And then I had to, me and my oldest brother--ain't no nursing home.  No, we had to stay there.  We had to stay there.  That boy got sick so I been down (unclear).  And so she died two years ago.  And that boy--she--the boy died first, first six weeks later Rachel died.  Weren't nothing wrong with her.  She told me was just tired, you know.  But for the most part she was always worried.  She told me she said, "You know Robert, Jr. [Robert Dickson, Jr.] retired, Dora [Dora Dickson] retired, Spoosa boy [ph.] retired Baby Pie [ph.] retired and you started work before all them."  And she said, "Oh, Lord."  "Oh" I said, "what's the matter?  You, (unclear)." She said, "No," said, "but you--you--ain't never had no job."  (Laughter)  Said, "You ain't gonna get nothing.  They ain't go even send you for social security."  (Laughter) I said, "Mama don't worry about that.  I'll be okay.  Don't worry about that."  She said, "But boy you--," (laughter), "you hadn't no job, you ain't have no work."  I said, "Mama I'll be all right."  She looked at me so funny (laughter).  But she--she hollered, "Oh, oh lord.  You ain't even had no job." (Laughter) I guess mama didn't think what I was doing--she you know, she weren't she sit down there and them folks you can't say nothing you know.  They was talking about she said she senile, so she said, "Robert, Joe [HistoryMaker Joe Dickson], Clarence [Clarence Dickson (ph.)], Dora, Luther [Luther Dickson]."  So I said she was--it was okay.

Speaker 1: The paper [Birmingham World], I'm gonna do that.
Speaker 2: Okay, so right now what--what's happening with the paper?
Speaker 1: We are, we're working on it now.  We--we're took--we--it was a broadsheet.  And what we're doing, we are changing the--we changing the logo somewhat.  And we're doing--changing the logo somewhat so and so when it shows on the Internet, it comes at you and it won't--it won't be so, so bland.  It'll be in, in keeping with what they're doing now in 2007.  And we're making a tabloid out of it as I said.  And we--we're changing the format a little bit, but we gonna keep it in the same spirit that Emory Jackson [Emory O. Jackson] had it.  And--because it's needed.  You need your own machine like that.
Speaker 2: And will it be a weekly or--
Speaker 1: Weekly.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And the information is about the African American community or something else or more?
Speaker 1: It would be a little more.  What we--what we plan to do is, you--if you go--people are saying newspapers are dying.  I say that stockholders are greedy.  They, they want to make more money out of the newspaper than it's worth.  And the fact that FCC [Federal Communications Commission] has allowed what they've allowed to happen, it really it's kind of misused the American people in that--get--they talk about so many ways to get news.  About the blogs, the videos, YouTube, and all that.  I--I don't consider such as, as--a lot of that is news.  Most of it comes from newspapers.  People dog The New York Times and The Washington Post but they go out and get the--get the (unclear).  When the people who own the Chicago Tribune, the real folk who own it, they dealt with, with the news.  The people--the channels out there and with the L.A., with the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times] the people were getting something different from what they get now, you know.  It's no longer news as I knew it coming up.  So when we--what you have to do if you're gonna be involved in this game, and we plan to, we gonna get us a niche and we're gonna deal with.  We gonna keep it as local, local, local, as we can.
Story_ID: 543283
Speaker 1: All right so you were gonna tell me about the newspaper [Birmingham World] and someone who was running for office (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, what happened we, we ran into a--we had--we ran into a lot of covert opposition from certain politicians, black and white, you know.  One of the, one of the things that really stands out is, remember our newspaper got a lot of, lot of publicity all over the world, I guess, when the--there was a runoff election between, I think it was, Winton Blount [Winton M. Blount III]--not--his son--not the postmaster but his--he had a son that ran for governor and he managed to get into a runoff.  He had run before and when he ran before, he knew I was a Republican and I knew his dad [Winton M. Blount, Jr.], the postmaster, and he came to us and we--we did front interviews and front page stuff with him and, and gave him pretty good notoriety and stuff.  We did what we could for him, you know.  He didn't win but when he came back this past time, the last one when he ran before, he, he managed to get into a runoff.  And, and when he got in the runoff, he, he went and solicited Dick Arrington [Richard Arrington, Jr.] and Don Watkins [Donald V. Watkins] as his front people to, to get him out there and, and get him pass in the runoff so he could, so he could, so he could, you know, go on with the nomination.  So somebody--some of the friends--my friends in Montgomery [Alabama] called me and said, "Look, Joe [HistoryMaker Joe Dickson] we need to talk you, man.  We want you come down here.  We--we had--we just gonna--we want you--want you to help us out a little bit."  I said, "What is it?  What you need me to do?"  And he showed me the pamphlet.  He showed me a pamphlet with, with Blount in the middle, Arrington on one side, and Don Watkins on the other side.  And they were talking about, they didn't need to, to him to go and get Arrington and that crowd just--it was--it was a piece that they said was used really to defeat Blount.  So they didn't know where it came from.  So a friend of mine who, who worked for me really, saw our post office box on the mailer.  And called me and asked me was that my post office box.  And I told him yes it was.  As a consequence, they wrote a story in The Birmingham News.  Now at that time Howell Raines was, was the, was the, the man at The New York Times and he was from Alabama.  So he--Harold--Howell jumped right on the story.  He didn't call me to find out why or nothing.  But they ran with that story.  My friends from New York [New York] mailed me copies of the story from New York about the, the--this--the black publisher of a black weekly newspaper taking sides with the, with the Republicans to defeat this bloodless candidate and all this other stuff.  And I'm thinking--I said to myself, I said, "You know, God is a good god." And, and that here I'm trying to help somebody working for me, they see my post office box and tell somebody that I am the one--I put out--but Don Watkins said, "Now, you know, Joe probably let them use his post office box, but Joe ain't had no money to (laughter)--have this thing." They put it, it was--it went all over the state.  So my whole thing is, he, he should have--if he had come to us, to ask him to help him, we would have helped him.  But The New York Times and these other newspapers should have called me and asked me what happened.  But that's what happened when the--when the black politicians and, and the white politicians who said, "Well, brand you--," who said, "He's a--he's a black Republican. He's not--he's not for black folk."  But you've heard my--what I--how I operate, so it was no cause for that.  And so what, what happened, I don't know if that scared my kids (laughter) off or not, but as I said we gonna put it back out there and we gonna do the same thing.  We gone do stories, and we gonna help people.

Speaker 1: When you look back over your life, can you think of something that you have not done that you want to do?
Speaker 2: The, the most important thing that I wasn't paying any attention to as grew up, I didn't buy my mama [Rachel Payne Dickson] a house.  I didn't think about it.  I--she was so independent and I--that's the one thing that I--that I--that I--when I think back, that's the one thing that I did not do.  I didn't buy my mama a house.  I should--I didn't even ask her.  'Cause she was--and I guess I didn't do it because she never wanted to interfere with what we--'cause she had a bunch of boys.  Weren't like girls, she didn't never want to interfere.  She always was pushing the--you to probably listen to your wife.  And, and she--but, you know, that's the one thing I didn't do.  I didn't--and I had it. I had at some point in time, I've had five and six houses at one time.  And you know, the house I live in now, I didn't buy the house to live in it.  I bought it to sell, to buy it and sell.  But my wife [Charlie Dickson] and children saw it--my wife saw it and they--they wanted to live there.  I have never wanted--I have never wanted to.  Mr. Gaston [A.G. Gaston] poisoned me.  Talking about go--and you got one--you got one, you can't wear but one suit at a time.  Go and try to do something.  And I just didn't never buy my--I never--anything I would be--I would buy her clothes.  I would buy her furniture.  I would buy her all this, but I never did do that.  And I don't know if--I don't know where, how that set with her, but she never said nothing to me about it.  But she usually would tell Joe [HistoryMaker Joe Dickson].  She would tell me.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: She probably wouldn't say nothing to Robert, Jr. [Robert Dickson, Jr.] and the rest, but she would tell me.
Story_ID: 543285
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?  What legacy you wanna leave?
Speaker 2: I think Martin King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] got into me too.  He say I just tried to help somebody.  I never wanted--I had never wanted--but you know a lot of people walk up to me and say, "I know you got money.  I know you got money."  But I have never really been--never thought about trying to make a whole lot.  I never that about that.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It was the way I came up, it was always--I had to give.  So I got used to giving.  I used--got used to it.  Just like you, got used to.  You know when we used to go to school, me and my oldest brother, we--when--when Robert [Robert Dickson, Jr.] was in charge I told you, he fixed the plates.  My aunt instituted this.  When she cooked, everybody had their own plate and cup.  Robert, Jr. would fix the plates and he didn't get the chance to get the first plate, he was the one that got the last plate.  The one who fixed the plates is the one who gets the last plates.  So that made you have to do what?  Be fair.  Made you had to even--equally even those plates out.  And that went along with me.  And if mama [Rachel Payne Dickson] would get the money and the other children and (unclear) then wouldn't give none, it never--it has never dawned on me really about a whole lot of money.  So I--I would like to--and I raised my children to not be so interested in--in stuff where, I don't go to church as much as I used to, but I do know that I always think about, "Store ye not up treasures on this earth," [Matthew 6:19].  Be a lender not a borrower.  And--and I just don't want nobody to be thinking that--that I was trying--I just want--I just tried to help.  That's how I do my part. That's all I want.  That's all that matters, you know.
Story_ID: 543286
Speaker 1: Because this information is going to be available for the future generations, what message do you want to send to the future generation?
Speaker 2: I want young black people especially, to realize that this earth was made by God.  It's not made by man.  You can't tell me this the white's man world.  This is God's world.  That each and every one of them, white, black whatever, made out of the same thing.  The mechanism is the same thing.  We talk--might not understand what somebody in Japan is saying, but they probably saying the same thing in a different way.  That they have to come together and realize that only they, working collectively together can save this world.  And it's not so important that we do 5 percent better than we did last year, 'cause we ain't doing bad with what we were getting.  As a--as a whole I'm talking about.  You don't have to burn the earth up, you know.  You know I just wanna them to realize this.  And if you don't go and prepare yourself for the future, you can't blame nobody for nothing that you do to yourself.  Be prepared, to take responsibility for the things that you do, 'cause nothing is free.
Story_ID: 543287
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we haven't spoken about that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that one of the things that I think that we didn't talk--that I'd like to also say is that I don't want black people to continue this thing about how much they are supposed to do and what they are--how we aren't doing this and we aren't doing that.  In the winter of 1953, James Smythe [ph.] referred me to a book that was written by Alan Paton.  And in that book, in that same book, Rock Hudson [sic.] and Sidney Poitier made a movie.  I think it was 'Cry, the Beloved Country' [Alan Paton] as a book or whatever it was.  Paton and his son lived in Af- South Africa.  And the--and the young--his son had a black friend that went with him everywhere he was the Bantu (unclear).  They were out hunting one day, I remember this vividly out of the book, and, and they were shooting, so the little boy, the little--gave his friend, the little black boy, the gun to shoot.  So his daddy saw him with the--with the--with gun shooting, the black guy.  So he went and snatched the gun from him, and he slapped his son and told him, said, "Never put a gun in a Bantu's hand.  Never."  And Paton went on to talk about--the book went on to talk about and show, it was a little bit about apartheid and what was going on in South Africa and how they, they went in and changed the ways of the folk.  And how they were living and this thing and I thought about America.  When they outlawed slavery in the 17th century [sic.] in the international--and the international community agreed that slavery was over.  But yet in America we did not adhere to the voice of the international community.  We decided that we would disregard it and continue slavery.  You couldn't bring them through the transatlantic slave--slave route.  So what you do?  You breed the daddy with the daughter or the sister with the brother.  And you, you take the language and the culture and you take the religion and all of this, but you don't replace it with anything of value.  And this--Alan Paton said the same thing in the book.  Said, "When you take all that's near and dear from a people, you must replace it with something of value."  And when you look at the Negro in this community where we are today, they're reaching, the gangbangers and this foolishness, they're reaching for something they don't have to reach for.  All they have to do is sit for a minute, open a book, read it, and get back in the groove.  They have to--may have to replace what was missing with something of value themselves.  That's it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I wanna thank you for taking the time to share your story with us.
Speaker 2: Happy to do so.  Happy to do so.
