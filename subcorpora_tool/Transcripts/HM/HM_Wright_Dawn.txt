Speaker 2: My full name is Dawn Jeannine Wright.  So the first name is D-A-W-N and then the middle name is Jeannine, J-E-A-N-N-I-N-E and the last name is Wright, W-R-I-G-H-T.
Speaker 1: And what is your place of birth and birth date?
Speaker 2: I was born on April 15th, 1961 in Baltimore, Maryland.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is your title and occupation?
Speaker 2: I have two titles right now.  The main one is Chief Scientist of the Environmental Systems Research Institute which is a geographic information system company.  And then I'm also Professor of Geography and Oceanography at Oregon State University and right now I'm on leave from Oregon State to work with ESRI and we also say ESRI [pronounced ez-ree].
Story_ID: 23773
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth there are five lightweight questions we always ask that only require a short answer.  Well the first question is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Ooh, where to start.  I have so many favorite foods.  I guess I would say if you go with things that aren't good for you it's ice cream.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I love ice cream especially vanilla ice cream and coffee ice cream.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If you go with things that are good for you, I like dried fruits, especially dried apricots and dried cherries.  And I guess you can put those two together and make an ice cream sundae.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color is orange.
Speaker 1: All right.  A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year, summer.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's another hard one.  Vacation destination would be any secluded beach or any national park.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Ooh, that's also difficult.  I like the Nike phrase "Just do it."  I often think that.  And I guess in terms of a favorite--I like the Bible verse Romans 12:12, "Let your--be patient in your troubles.  Let your hope keep you joyful.  Be patient in your troubles and don't stop praying."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23774
Speaker 1: All right now I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's but we'll start with your mother's.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Jeanne Phyllis Grove is her maiden name.  and her first name is spelled J-E-A-N-N-E, Phyllis, P-H-Y-L-L-I-S and Grove, G-R-O-V-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Baltimore [Maryland] also on January the 4th, 1935.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side and what were they doing occupationally and--?
Speaker 2: Ooh, well in terms of my entire family history I know the most about my mother's side but I don't know as much as I would like to.  I really have only met people in my family back to my great grandmother.  I really don't know that much about that side of the family earlier than my great grandmother.  She was a domestic servant from what I can remember.  I believe she also took care of children so she might have been a nanny.  And she had only one son, my grandfather, who went into the ministry and he was a minister, a Baptist minister for all of his professional life up to his death.  And--but in terms of, it wasn't Southern Baptist.  He--I don't know what part of the Baptist church he ascribed to but it wasn't the normal Southern Baptist black church kind of Baptist church.  I don't know much about his theology and I didn't go to his church very often because we left Baltimore when I was very small and I grew up in the Hawaiian Islands, but that was his profession.  And then he had seven children, he and his--he and my grandmother had seven children and my mother is the second of those seven children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my grandmother was a stay at home mom as we say so she had her hands full supporting him as a pastor's wife and also with the seven children.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was your great grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Rena.  Rena Grove.
Speaker 1: Is that R-E-N-A?
Speaker 2: I think it's R-E-N-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now was she born in the nineteenth century you think?
Speaker 2: Ooh, now this is where I should have some notes with me.  I think she was born in the early twentieth century.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Oh this is your -- I'm asking about your great grandmother.
Speaker 2: Oh my great grandmother?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't know when she was born, nine-, of course nineteenth century but I know that my grandparents were born around the early twentieth century, 1912, 1914, but I don't know my great grandmother's birth date.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think she's from Hagerstown, Maryland.  Getting that far into the family history, our family is from that part of Northern Maryland, maybe Southern Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's in the Appalachians or (unclear) high mountains.
Speaker 2: Getting close to that, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: That's where you come out--Hagerstown is one of the stops on the Pennsylvania Turnpike I think--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --when you first get on, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now so are there any stories passed down about your great grandmother or any stories from your grandparents about--?
Speaker 2: Well my great grandmother, I do remember her because I had some time to spend with her.  My mother has all of the great stories about my great grandmother including what a beautiful spirit she had and a beautiful smile and she used to give things to my mother.  She recognized that my mother loved to read and I recall that she used to bring things that were not wanted by the family that she was working for she was able to bring those things home for the grandchildren including books for my mother.  My grandfather was a very captivating minister and he had a very faithful following.  He also hung wallpaper as an additional job to make ends meet for the family and he was just very gregarious, very engaging.  He was very tall and slender so my memories of him were of these great ways that he used to greet us when we'd come to visit.  But there are also some very hurtful things about my grandfather too that he, towards the end of his life he was a great disappointment to me and to my mother.  He did some very terrible things when there--some of the things I've actually blocked out from my memory because they were so bad.  But there are other things, hurtful family things that occur in all families, disagreements, but I try to have good memories about my grandfather.  And my grandmother I remember she had the most wonderful, hearty laugh and we had a very, very close relationship because my mother adored my grandmother.  She looked up to her and admired her, wanted to be like her.  I think she admired her courage and her spirit and I just remember a lot of good times with my grandmother, especially just laughing.  I don't even remember what we were laughing about.  Maybe it was a joke that she told or a story that she was reading to me but I have all of my memories of my grandmother are very, very good.  My grandparents divorced and this is part of the hurtfulness of my grandfather.  There was--he got into a scandal and back in the day if a pastor fell from grace that was a pretty major thing, especially in the black community.  So there was a divorce that occurred after that, so that destroyed a lot of people in our family.  But my grandmother and I and my mother continued to be as close as we could given that there was also this large distance because again we left Baltimore when I was four years old.
Speaker 1: So did this incident with your grandfather take place before you left Baltimore or--?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, that was history long before I was born with him, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it still, a lot of people--
Speaker 2: But there are still things that he did when I became older that were a great disappointment.
Story_ID: 23775
Speaker 1: Okay.  You say he [Wright's maternal grandfather in Baltimore, Maryland] was a pastor of a Baptist church but you said it was unlike other black Baptist churches.  In what sense was it different?
Speaker 2: Well it wasn't Pentecostal so to speak with a lot of the big amen corners and a lot of people weeping and wailing and emoting in church.  He didn't have that style of preaching where he would get wildly emotional or I guess he was more subdued in his delivery.  The--and again I didn't attend his church regularly so I'm just going on what I had heard from my mother and from others in my family.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: He seemed to go his own way in terms of how he conducted the services in his own style of preaching.  And in fact I don't, it may not have been like the preaching style, it may have been more like delivering, it may have been more of an academic style of delivery the way that he delivered his messages.  So I think that's what made it different.
Speaker 1: Now was he college trained?
Speaker 2: No.  No, and I don't know how much education he had, maybe it was high school but I don't think he went to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's interesting that kind of approach, he sounds like more of a Methodist than a Baptist.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: But you know that's--I wonder you know (unclear) taught in a theology school or something you know?
Speaker 2: No, I don't--I think he was self read so, and he--I think and again this is really sketchy information so I hope you won't hold me to any of this because it's really something that my mother could give you more information on but there were programs on the radio and so he would listen to, for instance from the Chicago [Illinois] area, Moody Bible Institute programs.  He was very aware of the Reverend Billy Graham.  And so these of course were Caucasian ministers and leaders.  I don't really know of a black minister or black theologian that he actually followed or admired or patterned his style after.  So maybe again that's why his church was not like a typical black church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23776
Speaker 1: Okay. Now what did your mother [Jeanne Phyllis Grove] say about growing up in Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: I think she would say that it was a good experience overall.  She was from a big family.  The schools, she talked a lot about how good the schools were, how good the teachers were.  And it was segregated and, but she went to--she especially enjoyed Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Baltimore.  She was very proud to have come out of that high school and always talked about the good teachers there. She had good friendships.  I think she felt safe and I think she had a good experience growing up in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Did she meet any of the celebrity musicians from Dunbar High School like Cab Calloway [Cabell "Cab" Calloway, American jazz musician, band leader and dancer] or--
Speaker 2: No.  No, she never--
Speaker 1: --growing up or--
Speaker 2: She never mentioned that.  I didn't know Cab--
Speaker 1: --Steven--Les McCann the piano player was in there.
Speaker 2: Ooh, I didn't know that they went to Dunbar High School, no.  She never mentioned that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he even has a, Les McCann has a sweep he plays called Dunbar High School Marching Band you know based on Dunbar (unclear).
Speaker 2: On my goodness, I didn't know anything about that.  No the, one of her best friends in high school Lois, I'm blanking on her last name, but Lois' father was a doctor and Lois wanted to be a doctor and she became a doctor.  So back in that time for a young African American girl growing up in the 40s [1940s] and 50s [1950s] in segregated Baltimore to ascribe to become a physician was a great thing.  So that was like a celebrity.  She was--Lois and her father, I think they were like celebrities to my mom.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now did your mother now did, she went to, she finished Dunbar.  Did she get a chance to go on to college too?
Speaker 2: Yes.  In fact she went all the way through graduate school.  And this is one of the good things that, good influence of my grandfather there because my grandfather was aware as I mentioned before of Billy Graham.  He had heard about Wheaton College [Illinois] and I think he was partly responsible for her interest in Wheaton College which is a small, private liberal arts Christian college outside of Chicago [Illinois].  And so she found out about Wheaton and really set her heart on going to Wheaton because of the Christian education there, the environment of the school, the quality of the education.  Wheaton was also one of the few colleges at the time that would allow Negro or African American students.  I think at that time it was just a small quota but they were letting students enroll.  She had to be put on a waiting list so she went to Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia] for a year and then she transferred to Wheaton and she took a degree from Wheaton in speech, it wasn't speech communication it was just speech at that time and she had a wonderful, wonderful rich, fulfilling experience at Wheaton and talked about it all through my childhood to the point where I wanted to go to Wheaton as well and I ended up going to Wheaton College also.  But after she finished at Wheaton she had the opportunity to go to South Dakota State as a graduate student and she took a master's degree from South Dakota State [University, Bookings, South Dakota].  And her master-, I'm going to get this wrong.  She just told me what the degree was.  It was not speech but it's related, it was in language ooh, language arts or language science.  Ooh, she's going to kill me.  She just told me what the, we were talking about this a few weeks ago and at any rate she took her master's degree in the humanities.  And she was pointed towards, she was pointing herself towards teaching and so she went into a teaching career after that at the college level and it was actually how she meet my father because she was, she got a, she got several teaching positions in Virginia.  I'm going to forget but I don't remember all of the different places but she ended up in South Carolina teaching there and so that's how she met my father.
Speaker 1: Now whereabouts in South Carolina did she--?
Speaker 2: So this is Charleston.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And now my father went to South Carolina State [University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] but I don't think she was teaching at South Carolina State.  Well maybe she was, because he was playing basketball for South Carolina State so she must have been there teaching as well and they were introduced and one thing lead to another and then they got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23777
Speaker 1: Well let's do your father's side of the family then we'll--we'll start with him and we'll get them back together.  All right, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name is Robert Theodore Wright, R-O-B-E-R-T T-H-E-O-D-O-R-E and then W-R-I-G-H-T.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth I believe is February the 2nd, 1937 and I believe it's in Charleston, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about your father's side of the family, what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Ooh, I can tell you very, very little about my father's side of the family because my parents divorced when I was eleven years old and my father was not, he was not very involved with me as a father throughout most of my life.  So--I really wish I knew more but I don't.  I--he has two brothers and I think all three of them are deceased now because my father passed away a couple of years ago.  But there are three brothers and I had met my grandmother on that side of the family.  I don't recall meeting my grandfather on that side of the family and I was--in terms of the people on that side of the family that I was closest to were cousins.  One cousin in particular who used to babysit for me, she was very close to my mother [Jeanne Phyllis Grove] and she was working as a nurse.  She was in the [U.S.] Air Force for a long time but she was living up in Baltimore [Maryland] and was very, very close with my mother and with me.  I've, I--so till this day she's the one person on my father's side of the family that I'm able to keep in touch with.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you know what your father's, mother and father did for a living?
Speaker 2: No.  No, I have no idea.  From what I can remember with my grandmother, I believe she was a stay at home mother but I really don't know.  It's a shame.
Speaker 1: Now was--did his father, was he a teacher or anything like that or did he--?
Speaker 2: He was a coach.  His aspiration was to play in the NBA [National Basketball Association] and he was a basketball star.  I believe he was--
Speaker 1: Now this is, that's not your grandfather.
Speaker 2: Oh my grandfather, oh I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Your father's father.
Speaker 2: My father--I have, I don't know anything about my father's father.  I have no idea.  In fact I don't even know what his name is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, but your--well then back to, your father you know had aspirations to become a coach and he was a famous basketball player at South Carolina State [University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].
Speaker 2: Yes.  So his aspiration was to be a professional basketball player.  He was not able to achieve that because he did, he was a star for South Carolina State and he had a tryout with the Detroit Pistons and he wasn't able to--he didn't make the team.  But he had great skills as a teacher, as a coach and so he went into coaching.  And so his career was mainly coaching basketball at the high school level.
Speaker 1: Now did he return to South Carolina and coach?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah, so he, after he left my mother and me I'm not sure of the chain of events but he eventually ended up back in South Carolina in the Charleston area and he was coaching for I believe it was North Charleston High School.  And even when he was with us in our family, with my mother and myself, cause I don't have any brothers and sisters, he was able to coach many things.  He coached--basketball was the main thing but he could coach tennis, he coached volley ball, girls' volleyball, he could coach track.  So I think he was coaching multiple sports at North Charleston High School when he passed away.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you said he was about 6'2" [height of six feet, two inches] I think, you know he was a--
Speaker 2: About 6'2", probably about 190 [pounds, weight].  His playing days he was about 1--, 190, 195 [pounds].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: Good point, point guard, shooting guard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is your father still alive or is he--?
Speaker 2: No, he passed away a couple of years ago. He succumbed to cancer, colon cancer.
Speaker 1: That's in 2010, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23778
Speaker 1: All right.  So well, okay so your parents [Jeanne Phyllis Grove and Robert Theodore Wright] meet in South Carolina.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And they hit it off and get married and then you're the only child.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I came along about a year later and I was not even supposed to be here because there was--my mother had a physical ailment and the doctors in South Carolina were telling her that I was not going to be able to arrive, that I wasn't going to make it.  She got a second opinion, my grandfather stepped in and brought her back up to the Baltimore [Maryland] area to see the doctors up there and they assured her that I was going to be able to make it, and I did.  So she returned to Baltimore and that's--and I was born in Baltimore.  I'm not sure if my father, he, I'm not sure if he was even there for my birth because they had not moved lock, stock and barrel.  They were still based in South Carolina and my mother came up to Baltimore just to get that additional medical attention to make sure that I was going to make it.
Speaker 1: I don't think I, I didn't--I forgot to ask you your grandfather's name, your mother's father's name.  What was his name?
Speaker 2: I don't--I can't think of his name.
Speaker 1: But he was a reverend?
Speaker 2: The grandfather on my--oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Reverend Grove?
Speaker 2: Grandfather on my father--on my mother's side?
Speaker 1: Yeah on your mother's side yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh yes well his name is Eugene Thomas Grove.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: E-U-G-E-N-E T-H-O-M-A-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, so your mother went back to her parents in Baltimore and subsequently you were born.  So it was possible and (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I barely made it cause I was six pounds, one ounce, but I took care of that right away and just kept on growing.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 23779
Speaker 1: Now when you think about your parents' personalities and their dispositions and their likes and dislikes and the way they look, the way they walk and talk, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well physically I take after my father [Robert Theodore Wright] although I don't think I look like either my mother [Jeanne Phyllis Grove] or my father.  I don't think I look like either one of them.  But in terms of my physical, musculature, my frame, the way that I stand, my athleticism, that all comes from my father.  In terms of my temperament--everything on the outside, everything on the inside is my mother.  So in terms of my likes and dislikes, my temperament, thank goodness I say, that all comes from my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my mother and I are very, very close, best friends.  We're like best girlfriends because we like the same things.  We enjoy the same movies and we can talk about politics and religion and we share the, we laugh at the same things.  So that has been a wonderful blessing.
Story_ID: 23780
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: An early childhood memory is I was sent to a pre-school in Baltimore [Maryland] that I really enjoyed.  And I remember there was a great big gigantic, it was--the room where we had our sessions was a great big play room and there was a large slide in the middle of that room and I loved that slide.  And so that's my earliest memory.  That's--I was around three years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23781
Speaker 1: All right, now you left Baltimore [Maryland], you were four, about--
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --four years old.  Do you remember the trip?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember the trip at all and the reason we were leaving Baltimore is because my mother [Jeanne Phyllis Grove] had found a--she had gotten a job in Canada; Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.  And so when I was--so for my fifth year we were in Canada.  I don't remember all of the, I wasn't privy to all of the details in terms of what decisions my parents were dealing with in terms of making ends meet or how their marriage was going but largely the way that things worked in my family was that my mother secured these professional positions and then my father [Robert Theodore Wright] just followed along.  He was able to get a job as a coach so it was easier.  He had more flexibility but she was securing the teaching positions and making the decision to go forward.  I think my parents' marriage was, it was not going well because my father was not--I don't' think he was ready to be married.  He decided he didn't want to be married.  It's a very painful subject but it just didn't go well.  I think it was a mistake for them to be married but--
Speaker 1: Now he was a couple of years younger than your mother, right?
Speaker 2: Two years younger.
Speaker 1: Two years younger, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  So she was trying to keep things going, keep the family together and so she decided to make these professional decisions to move forward and so that's what she did.  And so we went out to Canada for a year and then she had a desire to go to Hawaii so even when we were in Baltimore, she wanted to find some way to get to Hawaii and she had the sense that she should go to Hawaii and it turned out to be one of the best things I think that she ever did because she was able to get a position in Hawaii the year after--we were in Canada for a year and then we went to Hawaii.
Story_ID: 23782
Speaker 1: Yeah, now we were just commenting, I was commenting off camera that while it seems like your mother [Jeanne Phyllis Grove] was trying to get as far away from you know her birth place [Baltimore, Maryland] as possible almost in some ways cause you got you know, she goes to Saskatchewan [Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada] which is in the northern plains of Canada right, in the north?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I don't think it was intentional.  She--her life had been in Baltimore and that's what she knew.  But I think it was more in terms of what opportunities, what position she could get, in order to keep us going as a family in order to make ends meet and in order to pursue a career that she had trained for and that she could make a contribution to society.  She wanted to teach.  She wanted to be involved in mentoring and helping students and that was the position that came up that opened up for her.
Speaker 1: So this 1965, '66 [1966] when she--?
Speaker 2: So, 1965, '66 [1966], um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now Hawaii you know became a state what, in '59 [1959] or--?
Speaker 2: 1959, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, '59 [1959].  So did she, do you know what her fascination was with Hawaii was about or how she became fascinated with Hawaii?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  She used to say that this still small voice like the voice of God, the voice of the Lord, go to Hawaii, like that's your next, the next phase, your next step.  There, I don't know how much she knew about Hawaii but she did have a spirit of adventure.   She was a voracious reader and she knew about other places in the world and she was not afraid to step out and visit other places even though she did not have the opportunity to travel.  And Canada was her first international experience, was all, for all of us it was our first "international" experience even though going to Canada it's like going to another state because the Canadians that we, we have so many similarities with the Canadians and of course the language is no problem. But I really don't know what specifically about Hawaii attracted her but I know what attracted me.  It was wonderful for me as a child because it was warm and it was the ocean and all the different kinds of people and it wasn't crowded.  We moved to Hawaii at a time, especially on the Island of Maui where we ended up was very rural.  And I believe we were the first African American family to settle on Maui in the '60s [1960s] so it was a new frontier--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wondered if your--
Speaker 2: --so to speak.
Speaker 1: I was wondering if your mother knew anyone else who ever--
Speaker 2: She didn't.
Speaker 1: --was, ever lived in Hawaii.
Speaker 2: She didn't know any--she didn't have any friends or--
Speaker 1: Cause I know--
Speaker 2: --no family connections.
Speaker 1: --in the, I think it was around '64 [1964] that there was a major motion picture called 'Hawaii'--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --made--and it was about missionaries going to Hawaii in the nineteenth century dealing with lepers.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, yeah.
Speaker 1: It has a long, one of these four hour epic movies--
Speaker 2: I think it was based on Michener's [James A. Michener] novel.
Speaker 1: --set around--yes right.  That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Did--was your mother familiar with that at all?
Speaker 2: I don't know if she was familiar with--of course we, we've seen the film several times since but I don't know whether she had seen it before making this decision.  My father [Robert Theodore Wright] was actually one of the extras in the sequel to--it was 'Hawaii' and then 'The Hawaiians'.  And as the story goes he got in as one of the extras although I don't know that's really true.  But it's really something in terms of all of the children in her fam--she was the second of seven children but she was the only one who went far away to college.  She went all the way out to Illinois to go to school [at Wheaton College] and then she's the only one of all the children to go to graduate school in South Dakota [South Dakota State University, Brookings, South Dakota].  So, again for a young black woman, a young African American woman to venture out like that, she's very unusual.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does kind of paint a story of independence and you know going to kind of isolated places in a lot of ways.  You know South Dakota--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is--
Speaker 2: She wasn't seeking those places.  She wasn't like "Well I just want to get away from everyone.  I want to be in the most isolated place possible."  It was just the opportunities that came her way.  When she was a student at Wheaton College her professor had links, which is often the case, where a professor will know another professor at another university who's looking for graduate students or starting up a new program or needing graduate assistants.  And so that, there was that connection at Wheaton and her professor at Wheaton recommended her and one of her classmates for these graduate research teaching--I think they were teaching assistantships.  And so, and that's still the way that it is especially in the sciences where you often times have to go where you can get funding as a student.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But your father, here he is, he leaves Charleston [South Carolina] and he's in Saskatchewan [Canada].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so he got a job coaching there in Saskatchewan?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I don't know much about what his job was because there was also a period where he was cleaning buses too to try to make ends meet in Baltimore.  But I don't know what coaching job--the only thing I remember about him in Canada is that he was playing, it wasn't, I don't even know if it was semi-professional but maybe it was like minor league baseball.  But there were these organized basketball teams and he was playing for those teams.  That's a good point cause I don't know whether he was getting any money for that like semi-professional ball.  I don't even know if there was that kind of a league.  But there was a league, basketball league in that part of Canada and he played for one of those teams.  That's the only thing that I remember about what he was doing in Canada.  I don't remember anything, I don't know anything about his real employment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then he, of course your family moved the next year to Hawaii.
Speaker 2: Then we moved the next year to Hawaii--
Speaker 1: Where there's no other family members and--?
Speaker 2: No, so nobody from his family, I don't know anything about his side of the family except I do know that I don't think anybody had ventured out as far west as he was, sticking with my mom and following my mom.  So certainly there was nobody who would venture to Canada, let alone Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.  I mean we're not talking about Montreal or British Columbia [Canada], we're in this hard core central plains and then certainly not to Hawaii.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay, so I don't know, I guess I just can imagine he probably was homesick I guess being so far away, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know.  My father I could, I never, I was never really able to have a close relationship with my father.  I didn't know what made him tick.  I didn't know, he never talked much about his family.  He spent a lot of time away playing.  He was, because he was always in a league.  He was always on a team playing and he was always the star player and he spent a lot of time with those teammates and partying and whatever they were doing.  He didn't spend--and I grew up loving athletics and showing promise as a basketball player myself and I ran track and played tennis and volleyball and all of the things that he did.  But he never spent time with me.  I learned how to play basketball mainly from watching it on TV, learning the rules and everything watching it on TV, reading about it in 'Sports Illustrated'.  So I really, I wish I knew more about my father but I really don't know my father very well.  He really didn't spend much time with me or my mom.
Story_ID: 23783
Speaker 1: So when you were about five [years old] then the family moved to Hawaii and from Saskatoon [Saskatchewan, Canada]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So I was, for my fifth year as a five year old I spent, I think in terms of school, so my kindergarten year was in Canada and then first grade we were in Hawaii and we were actually in Honolulu because my mother [Jeanne Phyllis Grove] was able to get a job with the University of Hawaii with the speech department.  So she was at the main campus, the flagship University of Hawaii campus which is in Minoa--excuse me, in Honolulu on Oahu so we were there for one year and then she was given the opportunity to start the speech communication program at Maui Community College so after that one year in, on Oahu then we moved to Maui.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now did you live in the same place in Maui most of the time or--?
Speaker 2: Yes, most of the time.  So we were on Maui for about ten years and the first couple of years--and my father [Robert Theodore Wright] didn't follow us to Maui. So it was my mother and I moving to Maui first.  My father wanted to stay on Oahu so he stayed behind on Oahu for a while.  So we had a couple of years in Wailuku, Maui and that's one of the main towns on Maui and then we had a chance to rent a house in Kahului.  Kahului is probably one of the main cities on Maui now and it's where the international airport is.
Speaker 1: Now can you spell that for us or--?
Speaker 2: So Kahului is K-A-H-U-L-U-I and Wailuku is W-A-I-L-U-K-U, Maui, M-A-U-I.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did your father, how long did it take your father to follow your mother to--?
Speaker 2: I think it was, I think after about a year or two then he moved to Maui.  It was always a decision as to whether or not he wanted to be part of the family so this is getting into some deep personal distress actually with our family and my mother actually--she, she's the only one who really knows the story there.  But he would always decide that he wanted to yes, keep being part of the family and then he would show up again.  And when he was on Maui he was able to get coaching jobs at middle schools, well one middle school in particular and then he got a really good long standing job with St. Anthony High School and he was the, "the" coach, the head basketball coach for St. Anthony High School.  And I think that was for him it was the longest stint in his, up that point that was his longest professional position.  It worked really well for him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23784
Speaker 1: Now tell me, we always ask this question in terms of growing up, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Ooh, well in Hawaii, growing up for me the ocean, the sights and the smell of the salt water.  I spent a lot of time in the water swimming, a lot of time on the beach playing and I loved growing up in Hawaii because it was, it is such a cross roads of the Pacific.  So I actually grew up with children, Japanese American children, Chinese American, Filipino, Hawaiian, Portuguese, and everybody was mixed race.  So all of these foods from these different cultures were a big part of our lives, even in our school lunches we would have Japanese food or poi, the Hawaiian poi and so all of those smells and tastes, I just loved it.  Absorbed all of that and loved it.  I loved all of the local foods so that was another big thing and all of the different kinds of plants, the trees and flowers.  I loved to climb trees and there was a big banyan tree that was down the street from our house in a little park and I loved that tree.  Banyan trees have these huge root systems and huge trunks and they've got long vines so for children it's just fantastic.  You can swing on the vines and climb up them and you can sleep on the branches because they're such big voluptuous trees so that was a big memory.  So there are so many things, just the landscape and the culture of Hawaii and then the ocean as well so all of those things made a big impact on me right away.
Story_ID: 23785
Speaker 1: In terms of the population who, did the native Hawaiians predominate I mean in terms of the population or--?
Speaker 2: No, the history of Hawaii is very interesting and that movie that you mentioned, 'Hawaii' I think alludes to a lot of that quite well.  But at the time that we were there, I think the Japanese, the Japanese Americans, Japanese Hawaiians were dominant.  So there--and in fact, we would have regular school and then most of my class, they had Japanese school after regular school and they would learn the Japanese language.  And I don't know whether religion was involved but anyway they had this other cultural training that they had to do after regular school.  So--and my teachers all through elementary school and into middle school, they were all Japanese Americans.  And I went to--we went to an Episcopal church in Wailuku [Maui] and that church had a lot of Filipino Americans, a lot of Filipinos attended that church and they even had a separate service for those who were comfortable just speaking Filipino.  So they had services that were all in Filipino so that was another ethnic group that was large.  And I'd say in the minority were Caucasians or white, there weren't that many white kids.  I was the only black child all through my schooling.  I don't remember meeting really--there might have been, I think there were a couple of little girls who showed up there.  I don't know what their situation was but they were only around for a year, maybe their parents were just there on some kind of an exchange, I don't know.  But I was the only black child through all of elementary school, middle school, into high school.  But that was not an issue for me because in terms of my appearance, I looked like a Polynesian anyway and they, there are a lot of mixtures in Hawaii and a lot of kids had mixtures of--they had Hawaiian ancestry in there somewhere and it was like a very proud badge to have Hawaiian ancestry.  And there's a very famous--of course we know about Hawaii now because of President [Barack] Obama and he went to Punahou High School which was a--which is, was and is a highly regarded private high school but there's another school called Kamehameha School and you have to be, you have to prove Hawaiian heritage in order to be able to go to that school.  And all of us wanted to go to Kamehameha but you, until you were at least 1/16th Hawaiian, you--they weren't going to let you in.  And it's a very, it's a special school.  It's a wonderful school because it's got good academics and good sports but they also teach the Hawaiian culture, the Hawaiian language and they really keep that going.  At any rate, with my hair, although my hair was still an issue because nobody had hair like mine so everybody was fascinated with my kinky hair.  The kids were always touching my hair but in terms of my skin color, my features, I passed as a Samoan or a Tongan so for the most part I was comfortable for most of my growing up.  It was actually the Caucasian kids who had trouble every once in a while cause they were called haoles and haole is the Hawaiian word for foreigner like you don't belong, especially with the history in the islands with the missionaries.
Speaker 1: That's pretty, yeah it's a pretty tense history from what I--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --I think PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] is getting ready to do a special on the dispatching of Queen Liliuokalani and--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --and Dole [Sanford Ballard Dole] coming in and all of that again.  And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --they did it once before but there's something coming out I think that's even more penetrating than that about the history of Hawaii.  So--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, yeah very painful history there, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, and you are I believe the exact same age as the president [President Barack Obama].
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah, so I was having my little experiences on Maui and he was having his experiences on Oahu and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, two different islands so you never crossed--did you ever cross paths at all or ever hear about him?
Speaker 2: Oh no.  No, I never knew anything.  Of course I guess none of us knew what was coming down the road with him.  But it's one very interesting thing about Hawaii because the islands had their subcultures and there was competition between the islands, well at least in terms of athletics.  When the football teams would come over from Oahu, any of the high schools from Oahu would come over to Maui to play us in any sports that was a big deal and there was a lot of rivalry there.  But there, I think there were subcultures on the different islands and so the different islands were their own little communities and cultures and of course you knew everybody on the island.  Oahu was different from the rest of the islands though because they had the big city Honolulu and that was a completely different situation because at the time that we were in Hawaii, I think Hawaii as a state was mainly a rural state except for Honolulu.  At least that was the way things appeared to me as a child and as a young teenager and Honolulu was on its way to becoming like a Los Angeles but that was completely foreign to those of us who lived on the other islands.  And so Barack Obama was in a completely different situation I would think because he was in Honolulu in that urban environment and he was, of course he was in Indonesia as well and Punahou High School completely different.  So I didn't know anything about him or--I didn't even know basketball was a big sport in--University of Hawaii's basketball team that was like an NBA team to us.  So we all knew all those players and admired them but he was still too young.  He was a high school player at that time so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think he was known as Barry Obama then.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah it's been really, I've been fascinated of course with his story and the parallels and to see him move all the way to the presidency of the U.S., it's just wonderful.  You've--in fact he's part of the HistoryMakers isn't he?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yes, he was a--
Speaker 2: Wasn't he interviewed as a senator?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I think he was a state rep when we interviewed him actually.
Speaker 2: Oh okay, I'll have to watch that.
Speaker 1: Cause he was earlier.  I think he was interviewed 2001 I believe.
Speaker 2: Ooh!
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I don't think they did an update or anything.  I guess we'll wait until after he's finished being president to get the rest of the story.
Speaker 2: Yes.  He's, yeah he's kind of busy right now, yes.
Speaker 1: Yes, right.  Right, okay well I thought I'd ask you about that you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Story_ID: 23786
Speaker 1: Well tell us about school now?  What was the name of your first school?  Now you started first grade there right, in Hawaii?
Speaker 2: Yes I, so I had, was in the first grade on Oahu and I don't remember the name of the school.  It was a, I believe it was a private school but I went through the first grade there and then we left for Maui.  And so I started the second grade, second through fifth grade at Wailuku Elementary School and I dearly loved that school.  I had a good experience on Oahu in the first grade too but I had some disciplinary problems when I was in the first grade.  I used to get in trouble.  There was a, it was a little boy in the class that I liked and I would follow him whatever he wanted to do and he would get into trouble so I would get into trouble.  So I had an up and down--I don't remember much else.  I enjoyed school.  I enjoyed the first grade but I just remember getting into trouble and having my mother [Jeanne Phyllis Grove] called in to see the teacher which is like a fate worst than death.  It's like ooh, if your mother has to be called in, if your teacher is calling your mother in to talk about your behavior, that's bad.  But it all worked out.
Speaker 1: Well you were a little kid that had been moved around and quite a bit I think at that point right?  You'd gone from Baltimore [Maryland]--
Speaker 2: Yeah we'd had a lot of--
Speaker 1: --to Saskatoon [Saskatchewan, Canada]--
Speaker 2: A lot of changes, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --Hawaii, you know this is in the first six years of life.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but once we moved to Maui I did have some trouble adjusting because I remember not wanting to go to school at first and I think it was just the, well moving to a new place.  Those children in that class had been together since the first grade so they, a lot of them knew each other.  They were linked because in that public school system you, you're in different levels so there were the sort of like the gifted and talented kids and then the kids who were sort of C students.  I mean we were--you would all be in the second grade but you would stay with your cohort of students all the way through and you'd have the same classmates all the way through fifth grade and then into middle school.  So I came in as a new child, a new student into that second grade cohort and a lot of those kids knew each other already.  So I had some, it was just fear on my part because they were very friendly and very welcoming and I was able to make friends right away but I just, I had imaginary stomach aches so that I could see the school nurse and get out of class and eventually that went away.  And I had--there was one racial incident but that was not until the fifth grade where there was actually a bully in school giving me a hard time because I was black.  But that wasn't until the fifth grade and by then I had settled in and loved school and was with my cohort.  My mother had to do some convincing to the teachers to put me in with the A students with the sort of the gifted and talented but she got me in there and so I was with that group of students all the way through and I just loved it.
Story_ID: 23787
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when we were in Oakland [California, at a ScienceMaker's public program] I think you were discussing growing up and the attraction of the sea and now is it time to talk about that?
Speaker 2: Oh sure, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So the culture in Hawaii I mean on an island you are surrounded by the ocean and living--we were in Wailuku [Maui] for a couple of years and then Kahului and both of those are coastal towns so it was very easy to get to the beach.  I was, so I was always either going to the beach with my mother or with my friends swimming, loved to body surf.  I didn't have enough money for a surf board so I didn't learn how to surf like standing up on a surf board but I had just a cheap board that I could body surf and so just loved being in the ocean.  And affected by TV also because we had a TV as I was growing up and I grew up on a steady diet of Walt Disney programs and the Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom and the 'Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau' [Jacques-Yves Cousteau, French naval officer, explorer, filmmaker, conservationist, scientist, photographer, researcher and author].  And then a lot of the cartoons, there was a special kids show for afterschool, 'Gilligan's Island', I loved that show because it was set on an island.  So I was influenced by TV quite a bit and the Jacques Cousteau, those specials on Sunday night as well as many of anything that was related to the oceans or like an ocean adventure, any kind of a movie.  When '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea', that Disney Movie came out several years earlier but in reruns, I was just attracted to anything having to do with the oceans and I think it's because we were living on an island and when you see your own world portrayed in different ways that can be very attractive.  So people who grew up in the mountains, maybe they like novels or movies about mountaineers or people who lived that kind of lifestyle so that pretty much--that was very important to me.  And then when I started thinking about what I wanted to do when I grew up or professionally was underwater photography and it's mainly because of the influence of Jacques Cousteau and his programs on TV.
Speaker 1: Now we can't overemphasize Jacques Cousteau I guess in the sense that his shows, I mean his undersea explorations were on television, I think National Geographic [magazine/television programming] had at least two or three of them a year for--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the 1970s.
Speaker 2: I remember seeing quite a few, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And they were always in color if you had a color set anyway and you could see him you know exploring places right on earth that no one had ever been to before.
Speaker 2: Yes and it was neat because I already lived in Hawaii and a lot of people wanted to come to Hawaii to explore around there.  But he was showing places all over, other places in the Pacific and in the Mediterranean.  So it was still opening up a completely different world to all of us who were watching those programs and seeing the Calypso [ship] go all over the world and have those adventures.  Now there's a dark side to that because it was revealed later that there were some things that Jacques Cousteau was doing in his personal life and then also even some of the things that they did on the Calypso were not, what we would consider a good thing now.  But the important thing was that he through, mainly through photography and videography and exploration he was doing wonderful.  It was wonderful education.  It was wonderful inspiration for those of us who are interested in the oceans.  And I, I found out later that I was not an artist because I think to be a photographer or videographer I mean that's--you're an artist and you have to have that kind of ability, that eye, that kind of skill.  I figured out soon after that I wanted to be, to do science.  I wanted to learn about how the oceans work as a scientist and so as I got closer to middle school I started to think more about that and then into high school they were telling us about college and careers and so forth.
Story_ID: 23788
Speaker 1: Okay, now I read here and also I was mentioning during the break that you were interested in space exploration too growing up.  So--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well I think the space, the interest in space exploration came mainly from books but also the Apollo, was it the Apollo 11 mission, when they landed on the moon [in 1969] I was completely enthralled by that.  And that's one of those situations where I know exactly where I was and what I was doing when that took place.  So that live feed when Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon I was sitting in the living room.  My mother [Jeanne Phyllis Grove] and father [Robert Theodore Wright] had some friends over and I think they were in the backyard talking.  But I was, I remember anyway being alone in the living room watching that on TV just being completely fascinated by that and thinking that that was just the most wonderful thing.  And so I was very interested in space exploration and briefly considered being an astronaut but that did not seem reachable to me.  That, I--that was sort of like something where I wanted to go to the Olympics also and--or you might want to you know play in the NBA [National Basketball Association] one day and there's some things that oh I would love to be able to do that or I would love to be a movie star or something but you know that that's likely never going to happen or that the way is not going to be--that your path is not going to, really going to take you in that direction.  So I dabbled with that and I loved science fiction, still love science fiction so I'm an avid Star Wars fan and I'm a great fan of the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Space Program and came to really admire a lot of astronauts.  But that was never really going to be my path.
Speaker 1: So you were eight years old I guess when they landed on the moon, what is it 1969?
Speaker 2: Yes, so if that was 1969 so that, so I was eight years old, yeah.
Story_ID: 23789
Speaker 1: Yeah, eight, I think eight year olds are, well kids are wonderful but there's something about eight year olds.  And for my eighth year that was a big year for me because of that and because I started to really gel in my thinking in terms of where I wanted to go and what I wanted to do with my life.  I became a person of faith at eight years old and started becoming aware of God and the Christian faith and the Bible and a lot of things were coming into place for me when I was eight.
Speaker 2: So I take it religion is a big part of growing up?
Speaker 1: Yes, I think of it more in terms of faith rather than religion because I think of religion as something where we try to do cultural and social things to, together in churches which is great but sometimes you can lose sight of God in all of that and you can be in a religion or in a church and not really be a person of faith.  And to me the personal faith, a personal relationship with God was much more important to me.  So I've been in various--I've gone to church and been in various churches in various communities but to me it's--that, I think of it as something separate where you can still lose your way in a church.  But if you've got the personal faith, personal relationship with God, that can take you through all the ups and downs in life.  So I had talks with my mother [Jeanne Phyllis Grove] about that.  She kind of guided me in that way.  That's where we're very similar in our--the way that we look at religion versus faith and we make that distinction.  So I ended up going to--we were in a church at the time and I ended up going to a Christian college [Wheaton College, Illinois] and so forth but it was still more like a one on one relationship with God.  That's very, very important to me.
Speaker 2: So was there some sort of, was it an incident or an event that took place when you were an eight that made a--made you different from when you were seven or--?
Speaker 1: Oh, I just made a conscious decision to become a Christian and to really have a personal relationship with God when I was eight.  And I prayed to God about that and started that relationship sort of, it was sort when people become a Christian or become a Muslim or whenever you make that conscious decision so that happened to me that summer.  And I started to read the Bible more and I don't know whether my activities in the church--cause we were already attending the Episcopal church and I was involved as a--oh, I don't think I had started becoming an acolyte so I wanted to be trained as a, like an altar girl to be--participate in the ceremony more so I became aware, more aware of those things after that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 23790
Speaker 1: So now in the fourth grade I have here that your fourth grade teacher, Sue Okata--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was very instrumental in your development.  What--tell us about her.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well Sue Okata, Ms. Okata she was--hopefully all of us have one or two teachers that really, that we really loved and respected.  She was this, just the most wonderful teacher and it didn't hurt that she was also my next door neighbor so we had a special relationship anyway because I lived next door to my teacher and she would leave cookies or dried fruits.  Maybe that's where my love of dried fruits came from.  She would leave those things on our back doorstep and she and my mother [Jeanne Phyllis Grove] were good friends.  But I just loved her in the classroom.  She was very--she would tell these wonderful stories.  She--we--she had good humor, she was energetic and she would push us to read.  She really encouraged us to read books, read whatever we, things that we would enjoy, just read as much as you can and try to learn as much as you can from books and so that's something that really stayed with me throughout the rest of my elementary school into college, into high school and college just picking up that good discipline and that good practice of reading and reading well, comprehending what you read.  And she, she's one of those teachers that, sort of the teacher of the year.  Everybody looked forward to, everybody who was not in Ms. Okata's class wished that they were in her class.  Those of us who had a chance to be in her class and again it was a situation where the A students, she had the A students, the most gifted students.  And so we had heard about her in the third grade and we couldn't wait to start in the fourth grade to be in her class.  We were not disappointed.  When we were in the fifth grade we were, we'd look back on that year and think oh how wonderful it was being in Ms. Okata's class and how it's helped us now in the fifth grade and so forth.  So she was a really special teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 23791
Speaker 1: All right. So now what are the--it just occurred for some reason it passed my mind.  What did the sky look like in Maui [Hawaii]?
Speaker 2: The sky, I just remember it being blue very similar to here in Redlands or Southern California, just a beautiful blue or just a clear sky anywhere I guess.  It was very clear and blue and beautiful, beautiful sunsets.
Speaker 1: What about at night, the stars and such?  Did you see a lot of--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there--clear nights.  Again Maui was quite rural at the time so I don't remember there being problems with smog or any kind of pollution in the air so everything was very clear, very beautiful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were you ever in any danger from storms growing up out there in Hawaii?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, any--?
Speaker 1: Storms?
Speaker 2: Storms?  I don't remember any big storms.  Hawaii can be hit by tropical cyclones but growing up I don't remember.  The main physical thing, I was in an earthquake and this was in middle school.  We had a pretty good earthquake.  I think it was magnitude 6 and we felt the shaking and I remember our teacher having us run outside into the courtyard and it didn't last for very long.  That's really the only thing that I remember growing up in Hawaii.  I don't remember--of course there were major storms that came through but that's the only thing that really stayed with me was that one earthquake.
Speaker 1: And did you spend much time on the water in Hawaii?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I, not--now we didn't have--I was not--now in Hawaii there are lots of canoe teams and so forth.  If that had been available I would have been involved in that.  But most of my time on the water was just swimming inshore.
Speaker 1: So there wasn't a lot of boat traffic between the islands that you and your mother (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, not--for a while there was a hydrofoil service but to get from one island to the other, you'd fly.  So I didn't spend a lot of time in boats or canoes or ships or anything like that.  Now I think kayaking is pretty popular.  Well I was living in the Pacific Northwest until recently so kayaking, ocean kayaking is huge.  I would imagine that it's pretty popular in Hawaii but there was nothing like that.  Those sports were not popular.  In fact wind surfing, Maui is known to be this, a great wind surfing island and that was not even a sport when I was growing up.  It was mainly just surfing.  Surfing or snorkeling, swimming, body surfing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23792
Speaker 1: Now did you, was there a certain age where you determined that you were going to be a scientist meanwhile?  Was it--?
Speaker 2: Yeah I think it was during that, the age of eight again that was a major year when I started thinking more about science.  And in--I was in the third grade then and we were learning about science and I don't remember the curriculum but I just remember that I just loved school and we learned about social studies and science and other cultures, Hawaiian history and so forth.  So I started to think now that well being an underwater photographer would be, that would have been nice but I don't really see myself as being artistic enough to be a photographer.  I went to think about science.
Speaker 1: Now was middle school the same school where you went to grade school or was it--?
Speaker 2: It was a different school.  So there was Wailuku Elementary and then those of us who were in Wailuku Elementary, the next school for us was Iao School.
Speaker 1: How do you spell it?
Speaker 2: I-A-O.
Speaker 1: I-A-O.
Speaker 2: And that was the middle school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that was, middle school I think they called it intermediate school was sixth, seventh and eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were there any special teachers in sixth, seventh or eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Seventh, my seventh grade teacher, Mr. Sato, and I believe he was our either math or science teacher.  So he was another one where he was famous at the school and you'd hear about him in the grade before and you'd lick your lips being eager to get into his class when your time came and then not being disappointed.  So he was another great teacher.  Now I had to leave Iao School for eighth grade.  Eighth grade was spent in California because my mother--and by that time my parents [Jeanne Phyllis Grove and Robert Theodore Wright] had divorced because they divorced when I was eleven so that was sixth grade.  But in the eighth grade or during that year she had the opportunity to do a teaching exchange with a professor.  So she was building the--a speech program at Maui Community College and she had a chance to exchange with a professor at Cabrillo College in Aptos, Santa Cruz area in California.  So his family came to Maui for a year and we went up to Central California for a year and it was a complete exchange where we lived in their house and they lived in our house although they decided to move from our house to Kihei.  They wanted to be even closer I think to the water.  Anyway, we lived in their house for the entire year so I had a very good eighth grade year in, at Aptos Junior High.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's called what, so what's the name of it, Aptos?
Speaker 2: Aptos, A-P-T-O-S.
Speaker 1: A-A-P-T-S.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Aptos is, if you think about the Loma Prieta, the big earthquake that hit San Francisco [California], the epicenter of that quake was right near Aptos unfortunately back in the late 1980s.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're in the eighth grade.  This is what, 1974 or--?
Speaker 2: Ooh, it's getting harder now to do the math.  Yes, that's '74 [1974], um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23793
Speaker 1: All right. So now at some point now--now when your parents [Jeanne Phyllis Grove and Robert Theodore Wright] split up was your father still in Hawaii or had he left?
Speaker 2: He had left Maui [Hawaii].  I think he was on--he had moved to Kaneohe on Oahu so he had left the island.  He hadn't left Hawaii yet.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But he had made the break.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you, now you and your mother moved--you went to high school in the [United] States, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So we had that exchange year in California and it was really good.  I made new friends and really had a good year.  It was very, very hard to leave all of my friends from Hawaii but then I was reunited with them the following year in high school because all of them had moved on to Baldwin High School on Maui.  And so for my freshman year in high school I was at Baldwin High School on Maui so I was back with my friends and I was doing a lot more with basketball and track and field so I was on those teams.  So once--so getting into high school on the athletic teams that was a big deal for me.  And it was around that time that I was also thinking about the Olympics seriously because the Baldwin High School track program had I think a very gifted coach.  His name was Lou--well I can't remember his first name because to me he was Mr. Souza, S-O-U-Z-A	 and he was a very gifted coach and he had taken an interest in me and was training me in the long jump.  And so we were thinking together that there might be a possibility of getting to the 1980 Olympics in the long jump.  He had trained a young athlete in the hurdles, Lacey O'Neal several years earlier and so he and I had very good working relationship and I really admired him as a coach.  There was also a coach from St. Anthony High School where my father had been the basketball coach and he also--his name was Louie Silva and he took an interest in me, was always giving me good tips and advice and was trying to be a good mentor even though he was from another high school.  But he knew my father and I think he had been friends with my father because my father was the basketball coach and he was the girls' track coach.  So both of those men, Mr. Silva and Mr. Souza I think were very good mentors for me during that year, that freshman year in high school so that was great.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 23794
Speaker 1: So now, so then did you go--your sophomore year was that spent in Hawaii or did you come back?
Speaker 2: No.  So the--boy it was quite an exciting time because the sophomore year we had to leave Hawaii and that was due to a personal matter because my mother [Jeanne Phyllis Grove] had found out that my grandmother in Baltimore [Maryland] was very, very ill and she knew somehow that it was not good for her to be so far away from the main core of her family because her brothers and sisters and both parents, everybody was pretty much in the Baltimore area still.  So she made a very important, very difficult decision to leave Hawaii and go back to the East coast because somehow she sensed that it was going to be very important to be there with my mother--with my grandmother's health failing and maybe to be a very important pillar for the family since she was the second oldest.  The oldest, my aunt was living in Washington state at the time and so in terms of the, who could be the strength for the family she was going to be the one to do that.  So she gave up the tenure that she had at Maui Community College and we pulled up stakes and we moved across the country back to the Baltimore area.  We actually settled in Columbia, Maryland right outside of Baltimore--well Columbia is between Baltimore and Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia].  So I actually finished high school in Columbia, Maryland and that was a hard move.  That was very difficult because I did not want to leave Hawaii and we had a very good life there.  She didn't want to leave either but this was a very important decision that she knew that she had to make and it was a good one because my grandmother ended up dying within a year and there were all of the ramifications for that because my grandmother was really the pillar of the extended family with my grandfather having had his difficulties and his scandal and the things that he was going through so it was really good that we had moved back so something that needed to happen.
Story_ID: 23795
Speaker 1: But it was a culture shock from me moving from Hawaii to the, not just to the West coast but to the East coast [to Columbia, Maryland].  I didn't really like my high school at first although it turned out to be the most wonderful high school for me because it was an open space high school.  And I don't know whether open space high schools exist anymore.
Speaker 2: Now what do you mean by that, an open space high school?
Speaker 1: Well open space meant that they had, maybe it's like charter schools today.  I don't know enough about the K through 12 curriculum but we hear so much about the difficulties with our schools and the school districts and so forth.  But open space, it was, it meant structurally the way that the high school was built, it was a round building with a library in the center where the library was that nexus of knowledge.  They deliberately put the library in the center of the building so that everybody could get to the library from just about any classroom, any place that you were in.  And the idea was that you could--there was more of a flexibility in the curriculum where you could actually take some courses self-paced, self-study and there was a, I guess they called it open space because there was an openness about how you could construct your training so you weren't just in a regimented class.  Your class went through ninth, tenth, eleventh and so forth and you didn't just have physics and chemistry and social studies and so forth.   You could kind of, you had more of a participation, more of a say in some of the directions that you wanted to go based on your talents and your abilities and your teachers would focus on that and point you towards that.  So there were some courses that I took that were completely self-paced.  Like I took a literature course that way and an American history course that way and it was really a wonderful experience.  And then they also had a good curriculum.  This was a public school but they had a very good curriculum and a lot of AP [advanced placement] courses were available.  So you could get out of high school with quite a few advanced placement credits towards college.
Speaker 2: Did they teach calculus there?
Speaker 1: Yes.  So they, and there was AP calculus.  I enjoyed and I mean it, I enjoyed AP chemistry, AP American history and AP English as a student at that school.  So once I got adjusted and made friends and got involved with sports I really--and got over missing Hawaii and being away from Hawaii and wanting to be at Baldwin High School instead of Wild Lake High School, it became a great experience.
Speaker 2: Did, how did the other students react to you being raised in Hawaii?  I mean that's a--
Speaker 1: Well they thought it was neat.  It was nice to have that kind of notoriety where, oh this is the girl from Hawaii.  But it was also very interesting because I was finally in an integrated high school where there were a lot of African American students.  I wouldn't say that it was like being in inner city Baltimore or in Baltimore County where there were a lot of schools where there would be quite a few African Amer-, mostly African American students but there were quite a few at Wild Lake [High School].  But I wasn't, I did not relate to them.  I actually related more to the white students and most of my friends, I think all of my friends at Wild Lake were white or I think there were a couple of Asian American friends.  But I was not, I did not slot into the black community there.
Speaker 2: Did you see a cultural difference basically (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Oh yes.  Yeah there were cultural differences in the way that I spoke and I hadn't been brought up with maybe like the funk music at the time.  This is 1970s.  I was more into the more mainstream rock and roll and I got into alternative rock later on in high school.  There were a lot of differences, the way that I dressed I guess and the way that I wore my hair.  And I just wore my hair so that I could control it so it was basically in two pony tails or two pig tails or two just separated so I could do something with it, especially with all the sports that I was doing.  But there was no--
Speaker 2: So you weren't perming your hair or pressing it and that sort of thing?
Speaker 1: No.  I would have it relaxed a little bit just so I could get a comb through it but it wasn't straightened.  So that's the way my, like it is now it's relaxed so that it's--it's still natural.  But I didn't want to wear an afro.  I didn't want to--my hair was not, is not naturally an afro.  I don't have that kind of hair but I would go to hairdressers in the area and they'd want to give me an afro and I just, I didn't want that.  My hair is too fine for that anyway.  I think, of course we as African Americans, we have all different kinds of hair textures and skin colors and we have all kinds of differences so we're not all alike just as any ethnicity is, we're not all alike.  But I just didn't want to, I wasn't like the African American, the black kids, I wasn't like them.  There wasn't any animosity there it's just that I moved in different circles.
Story_ID: 23796
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was there any particular teacher in high school [Wild Lake High School] at Columbia [Maryland] that was a mentor?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had--and this is where the science really kicked in.  In fact I had a wonderful science teacher and a wonderful American history teacher.  But it was the science teacher, Ms. Winemiller, W-I-N-E-M-I-L-L-E-R.  She really encouraged me in science and helped me.  She was my mentor for the Maryland Science Fair in helping with my science project.  And then I also had a great--my American history teacher was Mr. Wright, W-R-I-G-H-T so we hit it off.  Both of them were white or Caucasian which didn't really make any, didn't make any difference to me.  In fact I wasn't, throughout my going to school I wasn't really looking for a teacher who was male or female or any ethnicity I just was drawn to teachers who were good at teaching the material and who were enthusiastic and who were fun.  And all of these people were fun people.  Mr. Wright was great with American history and he guided our class through I think most of us in his class took the AP American history test so that was a great experience.  Sort of like 'Stand By Me' where that teacher took his students through that AP calculus test.  That's what he did with us.  So those two--and then I also had an AP chemistry teacher and I can see him clearly but I was not as close to him and I don't remember his name.  I can't think of his name but I did enjoy his class too.
Speaker 1: I think the movie is--are you talking about 'Stand and Deliver'.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry, 'Stand and Deliver', yes.  'Stand By Me', that's a different--that's completely different.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's a different movie.  That's a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Stand and Deliver'.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're talking about the one with Edward James Olmos.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Edward James Olmos, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, as a yeah, teacher in LA that, East LA [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So I think those were--I also had a good homeroom teacher, Ms. Almand, A-L-M-A-N-D.  She was our English and literature teacher and she was a big high strung and it took a while to feel comfortable in her class or in her homeroom.  But once I did, she I think she was a gem also.  I just appreciated how much she cared about us in our homeroom, so I remember her.  Now, Wild Lake High School is completely different now.  They have torn down the original building with its architecture, that unique architecture.  There is no more open space curriculum so I feel as though I don't have a high school anymore.  I don't have any connection to Wild Lake High School as it exists today.  It's a completely--they've rebuilt the school.  It looks, to me it looks like--well it's just a different architecture.  I think it's in brick and it's larger.  I think they were able to accommodate more students.  But once they tore--and I can't remember when they tore down Wild, the original Wild Lake High School but to me it was like it just wiped that all away and I just never, it was like being a person without a country.  You know I just didn't have a high school anymore and I think it's a shame that they had to make those changes.  But that was a really wonderful time.  Also, Columbia as a planned community, I think we, my mother made a great choice to move to Columbia because Columbia, Maryland and Reston, Virginia, those were two of those planned communities where the way that the neighborhoods were structured, you didn't have a--for example you didn't have a mailbox outside of your house.  All of the mailboxes were together in one portion of the neighborhood and it was put, done that way deliberately so that you would talk to your neighbors or see your neighbors as you go to get your mail.  And each of the--and there were neighborhoods that were built with little shopping areas and churches and everything that you needed within your neighborhood.  And it was all very clean and new and structured very nicely and they had the schools and all the neighborhoods.  In terms of urban and I don't know much about urban planning or landscape architecture but it was a concerted effort back in the '70s [1970s] to have these communities.
Story_ID: 23797
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is Wild Lake High School in Columbia.
Speaker 2: In Columbia, Maryland, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And so did you run track and play basketball there too?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So at Wild Lake, I played basketball and I ran track and cross country so those were my three sports.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had a pretty serious knee injury playing basketball that sophomore year at Wild Lake so I was not able to--well at the time with sports medicine being the way that it was then, I don't there was enough known about what I had done to my knees at the time so I was never able to sprint or to jump the way that I had before.
Speaker 1: Now was that an ACL injury [anterior cruciate ligament injury]?
Speaker 2: It was torn cartilage.  I might have done something to my ligaments but they didn't have things like an MRI or you know the kinds of procedures that we get now with any kind of injury.  They just did--it just wasn't diagnosed that way.  But I just knew that I wasn't able to sprint or to jump anymore.
Speaker 1: Does it still bother you?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, it's something that's been with me till this day and then I've had other knee injuries.  I injured the other knee playing basketball and I injured the first knee playing powder puff football in college and I've had the surgeries, the arthroscopies on both knees.  So, but it was in high school that I started to try to make the transition to running middle distance and long distance which worked.  I was never going to excel in those, at those distances because of my body type cause I'm a sprinter but I still wanted to participate in track.  And so I was able to participate in that way.  But I think the, with my body type, it took its toll on my knees after a while.  I ended up even running marathons in college and in graduate school.  So--but anyway the Olympic dream ended that sophomore year in high school because I knew that I was, I wasn't with my coach Mr. Souza anymore because I was at Wild Lake.  There wasn't any, there wasn't anybody that I could work with.  My mother [Jeanne Phyllis Grove] didn't--I don't even know if the idea of personal coaches, I mean kids nowadays they can get personal coaches, personal trainers and they're on their way but we didn't have a way to do that.  So I had to let that go.
Speaker 1: Now how were your grades?
Speaker 2: Oh my grades in high school were very good.  I was an A student in high school.  Even though I was having, going through culture shock in making the transition I did like Wild Lake High--I liked those teachers.  I made friends easily and I really loved the open space, that curriculum what they were doing there and I, so I thrived.  I just really loved it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know you were taking AP courses and all that so did you make the National Honor Society and that sort of thing or--?
Speaker 2: I don't remember--I didn't make the National Honor Society.  There were other honors that I had as a--at Wild Lake there were about twenty of us who were valedictorians so because of that open space system and the way that they did grade point averages and so forth, there were about twenty of us who ended up with 4.0s and so we were all valedictorians.  So we had that kind of a system.  The science fair, I was second at the Maryland State Science Fair and actually did a project for the Maryland Social Science Fair and won the social science fair.  I did a project on the Nez Perce Indian War of 1877 and really--
Speaker 1: With Chief Joseph up in Washington State.
Speaker 2: Chief Joseph, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And that was thanks to Mr. Wright's American history class and I really enjoyed that ex--I don't know if there--cause we hear about science fairs all the time now of course.  And there's a, you know the big Intel science fair and Google has their science fair and so forth but you don't hear about social science fairs and I don't know whether Maryland kept going with that.  But I just remember my experience was a great one and so there were those kinds of inspirations and affirmations.
Story_ID: 23798
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what kind of counseling did you get about college or did you listen to anybody other than your mother [Jeanne Phyllis Grove] about going to Wheaton [College, Illinois] or what?
Speaker 2: Well I really had my heart set on going to Wheaton College and I pretty much decided that in I think it was, even middle school I was thinking about Wheaton but certainly all through high school.  The main thing for me was what I was going to major in.  So I, so we had good guidance counseling.  I don't really, I don't remember the counselors that I talked to because I was pretty much set.  I wanted to go to Wheaton and I wanted the small private, liberal arts experience.  Of course as is the case now if you're a good student you get all kinds of letters and brochures from all kinds of colleges and universities so I was getting a lot of those.  And I remember the ones from Smith College.  I paid attention to the small, private liberal arts colleges that I was getting materials from and I thought ooh, Smith College [Northampton, Massachusetts], that looks nice.  And I think even Radford, Radcliffe College [Cambridge, Massachusetts], a part of Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and some of the others.  But it was still Wheaton and so I applied for early admission to Wheaton and I got into Wheaton so I didn't have to worry about that.  And Wheaton is, I don't know where it ranked at the time but it was--well it was called the Harvard of Christian colleges.  It was small in terms of, I think they had about 1,800, maybe 1,500 or 1,800 students at the time and they're--they have I think about 2,000 students so they've kept it small.  So the main thing for me was what I was going to major in.  And at that time I know that I wanted oceanography and it's still the case that you, that there are not many undergraduate institutions where you can major in oceanography.  Oceanography is an integrative science and so unless you're going to a place like the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] or Humboldt State [University, Arcata, California] or--those are places where you can get a bachelor degree in oceanography but certainly Wheaton didn't have that.  And so you had to make a decision as to which basic science you're going to major in and then you go into oceanography at the graduate level.  And I was learning all of this mainly through reading books in the library, reading brochures in the library because I don't remember my guidance counselors having much information there but it didn't matter because I was finding everything that I needed in the library and this is before the internet.  It seems strange to think of anything before the internet but there was no internet.  So I decided on geology and Wheaton was one of the few Christian colleges that had a geology program so that made Wheaton even more attractive.  And so I knew that I was going to be majoring in geology and I went in as a freshman with a declared major and went that route because I really loved rocks, especially volcanic rocks having grown up in Hawaii.  I loved--I was fascinated by the structure, earth structure, by fissures and faults in earthquakes and so I knew that I was going to be much more interested and much, do a much better job in that science rather than chemistry or biology or physics which I liked all of those but geology was what I loved the most.
Story_ID: 23799
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is 1979 when you graduated from Wild Lake [High School, Columbia, Maryland] and you go off to Wheaton College [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now was Wheaton like you imagined it to be or was it--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, Wheaton was everything I imagined it to be.  It was--the professors, the courses were wonderful.  The students were wonderful.  I thrived in the nurturing Christian environment.  It was not very diverse and I was one of only a few African American students who were in that freshman class.  So like my mother [Jeanne Phyllis Grove] before me who had come into Wheaton in 1953 and I think there were only three or four students, African American students who were admitted in her class--of course society had changed and everything and so it wasn't any problem at all, it's just a matter of choice but there weren't that many African American students in my class.  I knew all of them and we were all in different majors.  And my roommate, my freshman roommate is Indian.  Her family is from India so she's an Indian American and we hit it off.  We had a wonderful time.  But Wheaton was everything that I imagined it to be and again I wasn't thinking about how many black students were there or what the ethnic make up was of the students.  I just wanted to be in the college experience.  I wanted to take the classes.  I was on the basketball team there and the track team and made wonderful friends, was able to grow in my faith because Bible and theology were required courses along with the other parts of the liberal arts curriculum.  I loved the professors, people in the administration.  I like the town of Wheaton cause Wheaton is a nice, small college town.  It's very easy to feel at home there and to--and if you wanted to venture to Chicago [Illinois], Chicago was only, is only twenty-five miles away.  At--I didn't mind the weather because I wanted to be at Wheaton so much so the harsh winters, I didn't have a problem with that so it all worked out.
Speaker 1: Now is Wheaton on Lake Michigan?  Is it--?
Speaker 2: No, it's twenty-five miles due west of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right (unclear).
Speaker 2: So I forget the name of--Roosevelt Road, if you go out Roosevelt Road for instance or highway and just keep going straight, straight on out, so it's inland.
Speaker 1: Like you're going towards DeKalb or--is it?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Naperville is close by so we have that way, Elmhurst [suburbs of Chicago].
Speaker 1: And then colleges are in most of these places too right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of small private, small colleges.
Speaker 1: I think College of DuPage and Naperville College and yeah.
Speaker 2: Olivet Nazarene [University] and so forth, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, Elmhurst College right?
Speaker 2: Yes and so those are all the colleges we played sports because it's NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] Division 3, small college.  So we played all of them.  Augustana [College, Rock Island, Illinois] I think was the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Augustana.
Speaker 2: --was the big rival and the big evil, I don't know what it was about Augustana but we--they were a big rival.
Speaker 1: Didn't they set a football record?  They won the most football games of any NCAA team in a row--
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: --over three years?  They didn't lose a game or something?
Speaker 2: They were good.  We just had a hard time, whenever we played Augustana we just had a hard time winning.  I guess that's why we didn't like them.
Story_ID: 23800
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now in terms of, so you're majoring in geography right?
Speaker 2: Geology.
Speaker 1: Or geology.  Geology, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, and there was no geography.  That's an interesting point because geography is not in the, was not in the curriculum at all there and I didn't discover geography as a discipline until my Ph.D. studies at UC [University of California] Santa Barbara so that's another interesting story.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So geology and did you have, was there a particular teacher who was a mentor in terms of geology there at Wheaton College [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well at Wheaton the geology program was very small and there are only two professors, Dr. Haddock and Dr. DeVries so--and there were only seven of us who were majoring in geology.  So as compared to other majors like biology, there were tons of people it seemed in, majoring in biology because so many of them were pre-med.  There are certain majors at Wheaton that there were lots of students in those majors, very popular.  So biology was one, Christian education was another one, literature, a lot of literature matures.  There are a lot of Poly Sci, political science majors cause there are a lot of students looking to go into law, law school and so forth.  But the geology program only had two professors and seven majors and we loved those two professors and I think they gave us everything that they could.  There were some courses now and I--now that I'm a professor and I've worked with geology students and I know that geology undergraduate curriculum, there were a couple of courses that they just couldn't offer to us.  They didn't have the laboratory facilities, they didn't have the capacity to offer those courses but they got us through as best we could.  And we all went on to do good things.  Some of us, some people went into the mission field but others went on to become professional geologists and a couple of us went on to graduate school.  And in my case I got what I needed to enter a geological oceanography graduate program because from there I went on to Texas A & M [University, College Station, Texas].
Story_ID: 23801
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now at Wheaton [College, Illinois], I have to ask this question.  There's so much in the news today about Christian education in terms of creationism and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Was there any controversy in those days around, about teaching evolution and--?
Speaker 2: No.  No, and that's a very good point because--and nowadays the word evangelical I think does not mean the same thing that it meant back in the 1980s.  To be an evangelical Christian in the 1980s or late '70s [1970s], at an evangelical Christian college meant that there was--that intellectual rigor was a very, very important part of your faith.  So it was not, it was very different from fundamentalism and so I think there--that's been lost now.  Fundamentalist Christian, evangelical Christian, they mean the same to people and they're very, very different.  During that time Jerry Falwell [Jerry Lamon Falwell, Jr., Southern Baptist pastor and televangelist] and his followers and his church and so forth that, with the moral majority, that seemed to me to be very, very right wing and not--that was very different from evangelical Christianity.  And those folks were young earth or still are I guess young earth creationists.  They're not looking at the validity of science and that's not what we were taught at Wheaton because we were--we were taught that there's a science and theology can be very complementary and in that you're not going to find the answers to detailed scientific processes in the Bible because the Bible is there to help you with your relationship with God and to lay out that story God's relationship to human kind and bringing in Jesus Christ into the picture and so forth.  So you're not going to be able to open the Book of Genesis for instance and learn everything about the geologic record from Genesis.  The Bible has a different purpose.  And in terms of science, science has been given to us.  We have the ability to do science so that we can actually find out some of these mysteries if you will, that aren't laid out in the Bible or they're not laid out in other places.  That's what science is for and so science can complement faith or theology in that way.  So Genesis, the main point of Genesis is to bring forth the idea that God did create the earth but how he created, it's not going to tell you how that happened.  And so as a scientist you can't just read Genesis and think of six 24--six or seven 24 hour days of creation and that's how the earth was formed.  That's looking at it in the wrong way.  So our geology program was a good, rigorous geology program.  And we ascribe to the age of the earth being billions of years old and the slow geological processes that took place, the rock record.  All of that is what we were taught in our geology program.  And thinking of it from a theological standpoint, I think it's even more impressive that if God created the earth to carefully take billions of years to do that just shows even more his divine patience and love to do that rather than, oh, 20--here we go, seven 24 hour days, we're done, on to the next thing.  So at any rate, there was no--and there is the Institute for Creation Research that was very big, trying to be a big powerful force at the time in the 1980s.  And for us at Wheaton as geology students and the geology faculty were of this mind also that you know there's a mission field out there but we actually have a mission field to the church, to Christians who are misguided in their thinking about the earth and that we should, we have to witness to them so to speak and teach it, very similar now to the whole thing about climate science and how there is sadly and frustratingly there is an issue of whether or not the earth is warming and whether this warming is human induced.  And we have people in Congress, presidential, one presidential candidate who challenges this and thinks that it's a vast left wing conspiracy or that we're making this up, so very similar.  Anyway there was no--we didn't--we were not in that debate or didn't have any trouble with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So today when you think about all the term--I mean is Wheaton still maintaining this position today as (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, Wheaton is still very strong and very rigorous in all of the sciences and moving, working within and with the mainstream scientific community and teaching students along those lines.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So students are involved in that kind of research, same thing with the climate science.  As much as they're able to do at a small, private liberal arts institution, rather than a big, major university with the research funding and so forth, there are a lot of students that are involved in undergraduate research projects and I think they're doing very well there.  In fact they just built a new science building and it's been a revival for--it's been wonderful for the geology and environmental science program there now.  And they have, instead of two faculty I think they have four now but they've got forty majors instead of seven and they're doing very well.

Speaker 1: Now what was your social life like at Wheaton [College, Illinois]?  You know I was kidding you before about the reputation that Wheaton, they didn't allow you to dance.  But this is actually true wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, because at Wheaton there is what they call the community covenant so as a member of the campus community, the college community, everybody signs this covenant or back when I was a student it was called the pledge.  And of course there the main things that people think about, no drinking, no smoking, no dancing and so forth.  But it was, it's really more of a spiritual, the idea that you're going to try to be the best person that you can be and that you're going to be a productive member of the community that you're going to have this discipline in your life.  So there are many, many points, many things that are signed, that are part of what you sign onto in the pledge and faculty, staff and students alike sign that.  But for me it didn't mean that it was boring or that it was poor social life.  There were lots of parties that I went to as a Wheaton College student.  But we had cake and ice cream instead of alcohol and the ice cream socials were a big deal at Wheaton.  There was no dancing but I was never a good dancer and I was never wanting to go to dances anyway so that didn't bother me.  They do have dancing now, social dancing at Wheaton so--and that, I think that's going very well.  In fact, we had square dancing.  But I was an athlete at Wheaton so that put me in a different subculture because even the way that it is now for athletes, college athletes you spend a lot of time with your teammates and you study with your teammates and you spend time, social time with them and so that was my experience where I was always involved in a sport at Wheaton.  So my best friends were on the basketball or track teams or cross country teams but I was not lacking--I went to movies and when my mother [Jeanne Phyllis Grove] was a student at Wheaton, I don't think they were allowed to go to movies.  So they've evolved the community covenant over time within reason so that you're not completely counter-cultural in a bad sense where you're completely out of it.  But I--my Wheaton College experience was wonderful.  And people dated, got married so all of that was, it was--to me it just felt like it was a good, healthy environment so I don't feel as though I missed anything.
Story_ID: 23803
Speaker 1: Now were you involved in any sororities or clubs at Wheaton [College, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well Wheaton didn't have sororities or fraternities.  They had various clubs but for me the main thing was athletics because that took up so much time so those were the main, the club so to speak for me because I played the NCAA Division 3 basketball, track and cross country.  There was a very important organization though that I was involved in.  My freshman year it was called SOUL, Students Organized for Urban Leadership.  And the main idea of SOUL was to be an organization for African American students to commune together and also to get involved in projects or with churches, especially in the Chicago [Illinois] area.  And our group that first year decided to expand the organization into what we call BRIDGE which was, it stood for, Building Relationships in Discipleship, Grace and Experience.  And with BRIDGE, we worked very closely with the Minority Student Office, the Office of Minority Student Affairs at Wheaton which was coming into the fore at that time with the realization that Wheaton was not very diverse as a college and certainly as a community.  And Wheaton I think was beginning to grapple with the need to recruit, not just to have students who wanted to come to Wheaton but to broaden the awareness of what Wheaton was about as a college to communities that had not normally been involved with the campus and with the college.  And so that basically was code for we need to reach out to the African American, Asian American, Hispanic and Native American communities.  And with BRIDGE, what we did was to expand the involvement of the organization not just for African American students but students across the board from those minority groups, but also involving white students as well.  And we basically went to ethnic churches around the area which is very easy to do because they say in Wheaton, you could go to a different church fifty-two Sundays of the year.  But we went to black churches, to Asian churches such as Korean churches and so forth.  We went to a different church every Sunday for that experience and then we had different events on campus to help, to expose the campus to our cultures or to the other groups sort of, so back in the '80s [1980s] I guess that was quite unusual in terms of diversity outreach.  So I was very involved with BRIDGE, in addition to being involved with sports.  BRIDGE, I don't think exists anymore at Wheaton.  There is a BRIDGE organization but it's, I think it's a different, it has a different purpose and the acronym is different.  I think it has something to do with student orientation.  But there is a gospel choir at Wheaton now which is really neat given Wheaton's makeup cause Wheaton still struggles with diversity.  There are not that many, we're talking about one to two percent of the student population.  They may have one or two African American professors at the entire college.  And so this is quite a big thing for Wheaton to have a gospel choir in the first place and it's an integrated gospel choir so it's not just all African American but there are a lot of white students in the choir, students of other ethnicities and I think they're having a really good time with it and making, doing a lot of good things.
Story_ID: 23804
Speaker 1: Now was there a major, I mean a senior capstone project in geology that you had to do?  Anything (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, that's a good question.  There--the main thing for us was field camp in our junior year so if you--field camp was a sort of a capstone because that's so important to the training of a geologist to actually get out into the wilderness.  And Wheaton [College, Illinois] has a very wonderful science station in the Black Hills of South Dakota.  So we go out for the entire summer to the Black Hills and we take structural geology and other courses and so that was pretty much our capstone and then there were courses that we took in our senior year, but that's the main thing for geology majors.  There are other courses that are offered at the science station in biology especially, but that was the main thing for us.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now South Dakota is where they, I know some of the geological features exposed, dinosaur bones and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, it's a very, very wonderful place to have a geological field camp especially if you're interested in paleontology or if you're interested in mineral, structural geology, understanding faults and folds and fissures and so forth.  So Wheaton also has Honey Rock Camp in Wisconsin so even though it's a small college it's nice that they have these other facilities.
Story_ID: 23805
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now where were you thinking of--were you thinking about going to graduate school when you finished?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes because I, during my own research I had learned that in order to become an oceanographer I had to go to graduate school because there were not many places in the U.S. where I could major in oceanography as an undergrad [undergraduate student].  And certainly at Wheaton [College, Illinois] they didn't have that major.  They had one course in oceanography which I devoured.  But I knew that I was going to have to go to graduate school so that had always been at the back of my mind was to get my degree and then be good enough in my major so that I could get into a good graduate school.  I didn't know which graduate school at the time but I had been looking at all of the major graduate schools for oceanography around the country and so I put out a lot of applications I think in my junior year of college thinking ahead to graduate school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you ended up going to Texas A & M [University, College Station, Texas], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And now how did you choose Texas A & M?  I wouldn't think of oceanography if I thought of Texas A & M.
Speaker 2: Yeah it's such a--Texas A & M has always had an excellent oceanography program because they focus on the Gulf of Mexico.  They are like I said, the campus and College Station is in, inland but it's just a hop, skip and a jump to the gulf.  It's sort of the way Oregon State [University, Corvallis, Oregon] is where I'm a professor now because Corvallis is fifty miles inland but Oregon State has a very prominent oceanography program with facilities on the coast and Texas A & M was like that as well.  I went to Texas A & M because I was able to get a graduate, a fellowship so I had to follow the money in that sense.  Texas A & M was not a place that I thought I would end up in a million years but it turned out to be the right choice for me.  It was a very, very good program and the ocean drilling program was going to come into the fore later which was going to greatly affect my life and that was, that would only have been available to me had I been at Texas A & M, not any other place.  So it's really amazing how life is.
Story_ID: 23806
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is 1993.  Let me ask you did you know--now you graduated from Wheaton College magna cum laude [Latin for "with great honor"], I thought we'd say that.  And, but did you know Dr. Dale Morgan at Texas A & M?
Speaker 2: I did.  Dr. Morgan--and he has a much better memory of this than I do.  I was, I think I was in his class.  It must have been a class that I had taken with him at the time when he was at Texas A & M.  So--
Speaker 1: Yeah, cause he was a geologist (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes, and very prominent geophysicist as well.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: So it was really great to connect with him again in Oakland [California] all these many years later.
Speaker 1: But you don't remember taking a class--?
Speaker 2: No, I--and it's one of those things where I'm remiss.  I don't remember clearly the, all of the interactions that we had.  Maybe it was during a term where I was overloaded or something was going on.  But he was not my--my major professor was a geophysicist, Will Sager [Dr. William Sager] so I did have several classes with Will Sager who was just beginning his academic career at the time as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Will Sager is still at Texas A & M.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now while you were at Texas A & M, you went on your first seafaring expedition, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was a--all of the students in the oceanography program at Texas A & M do a student research cruise and we participate on the, at the time main research vessel for Texas A & M was the Gyre, G-Y-R-E and I think we had five days at sea in the Gulf of Mexico.  And for me I was sick, seasick for three of those days and I reconsidered whether I was in the right major.
Speaker 1: So did you--
Speaker 2: But I started feeling better after the third day and I was able to participate in the activities of the cruise and really enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you all, you went on a cruise out into the Gulf and were you looking for anything specific?
Speaker 2: No, it was just a, it was a student cruise so that we could understand how a research vessel works and to work with some of the equipment taking some samples, water samples and so forth, understanding how the research ship is navigated also.  I think there was also some bathymetry data that we may have collected because I was sick for three out of the five days, I was flat on my back in my bunk so I missed out on the critical first parts of the instruction for that cruise.  But it was mainly just to get the students, to give them the experience of being on a research vessel.  And then all of us were going to have very important projects that we would do for our theses or dissertations so all of us would eventually end up going to sea for our own projects with our professors or working with data that had been collected for real projects.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23807
Speaker 1: So now your thesis was entitled 'The Nature of the Northern Terminus of the Tonga Trench in Southwest Pacific', right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And that was a, it was a geophysical thesis so I was working with seafloor gravity data.  I was looking at the earth's gravitational field and trying to understand the structure and morphology of the ocean floor and the interaction between two tectonic plates as expressed mainly from gravity data but also from bathymetry data as well, measurements of the water depth.  And so for that project I was actually--I didn't go to the Tonga trench.  That data had already been collected and that was a project that existed where I was able to just work with some data that no one else was really working with and worked actually much, very closely with some Ph.D. students in the geophysics department and spent a lot of time over in that other department working on that project with them.  Of course universities have different ways that they're structured but the oceanography department at Texas A & M [University, College Station, Texas], they have geologists and geophysicists and chemists and biologists and so forth within that department but then there are also geophysicists and chemists and biologists in other departments of the university who may also be working on oceanographic data as well but they're not in the oceanography department.  So in my case I ended up actually working quite closely with other students who were in a separate geophysics department.
Story_ID: 23808
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you worked with an instrument called the SeaBeam which is used in bathymetry right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And can you explain that for us?
Speaker 2: So a SeaBeam is, it's actually a trademark.  It's a, it's the--that particular company at the time named its instrument SeaBeam but that's a trade name for--there are other instruments that measure the depth of the ocean.  So basically when you're measuring bathymetry, bathymetry is the opposite of elevation.  So bathy means deep and so you're measuring the depths.  An instrument like, such as SeaBeam but there are other companies that create these instruments, they are mounted to the hull or the bottom of a research vessel and they, in the oceans we have to use sound in order to make these measurements because sound travels much better through the water than electromagnetic energy.  So for instance a lot of people wonder why we can't measure the depth of the oceans with satellites the way that we can measure so many other things about the earth but the electromagnetic energy of satellites doesn't work very well in the water.  That energy is dissipated and the satellites literally cannot see through the water so we use sound instead.  And with an instrument like SeaBeam, the principle is just to send out pulses of sound.  You have those sound, the sound pulses reach the bottom of the ocean and they're reflected back to the instrument.  And so the travel time of the sound pulse from the instrument down to the ocean floor back to the instrument, that travel time is converted to a depth. The travel time is affected by the speed of sound in water cause you must know what the speed of sound is and that's often affected by the salinity or the saltiness of the water as well as the temperature.  So we do have to take other measurements of the salinity and the temperature of the water so that we can understand what the speed of sound, what the local speed of sound is for that region.
Speaker 1: So you say local speed of sound.  So it can vary depending on where--
Speaker 2: Yes, it can.
Speaker 1: --what body of water you're in?
Speaker 2: Yes, because the speed of sound is not constant.  It's not the same everywhere in the oceans.  It's affected by the salinity of the oceans or the temperature.  And the salinity you have different areas in the oceans where it's saltier or warmer, colder, fresher and so forth.  So we always need to know what the local conditions are where we're doing our sonar measurements because when you're taking, when you're working with bathymetry that's sound navigation and ranging, the sonar.
Speaker 1: That makes sense, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So with an instrument like SeaBeam it takes several, it sends out several pulses of sound that go across the beam of the vessel.  So they are, when the pulses are sent out and the ship is moving along it's track, you're actually getting a whole swath of information, a swath of data really that's being collected on the seafloor as the ship is moving along.  And so when you look at the pattern of the ship as it's collecting that data, it's like mowing the lawn because usually the track of the ship is such that the ship will go up and back mowing the lawn over the area that you're trying to and sonophy [phonetic] where you're trying to collect all of these individual measurements of the travel time of these acoustic pulses.  And then you make your corrections in terms of the local conditions and you turn those travel times into depths and so that's basically your--the distance.  That depth is a distance between the sea surface where the ship rests and the ocean floor.
Story_ID: 23809
Speaker 1: Now you received your master's degree in '85 [1985] or '86 [1986]?
Speaker 2: 1986.
Speaker 1: '86 [1986] okay and that's '86 [1986].
Speaker 2: So it took three years to do the course work and to do the thesis.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your advisor was Dr. Sager and any recollections of Dr. Sager?
Speaker 2: He was, I believe I was his first graduate students at Texas A & M [University, College Station, Texas].  He was fresh out of the, out of graduate school himself having just received his Ph.D. at the University of Hawaii.  And his interest was in paleomagnetism, measurements of the earth's magnetic field especially as reflected within seamounts or underwater volcanoes.  And I believe he's still in that area of expertise.  He's also looking at plate tectonic motions, reconstructing the movements of old portions of plates, portions of the seafloor.  He was, at the time he was very ambitious, very busy working.  He was in the publish or perish syndrome as an assistant professor so he had a lot on his plate.  And so I really enjoyed--what I remember about Dr. Sager was his courses.  I really loved his geologic oceanography course and his main course for first year graduate students.  And I wanted to work with him on the basis of that course.  I was pretty much on my own in terms of my thesis project so in a way that was a good experience because I didn't have hand holding with my advisor.  I had to sink or swim on my own and I found resources where I could, again mainly with the graduate students in the department of geophysics.  And at the end of my, I was able to pass my master thesis.  My advisor said that I might not be suited to go forward in oceanography because I had done all right but it wasn't a brilliant master thesis and it was clearly reflective of how I had tried to do it sort of on my own.  I didn't have a lot of mentoring on the project.  And so his advice was for me to consider maybe law school or an MBA [Master's in Business Administration] going forward from there which was a blow to me at the time.  I was very relieved to have passed my master thesis and I was going to get the degree but at the same time my goal was to become a professional oceanographer and for that you really need to go forward to the Ph.D.  So his reaction at the end of my time with him was actually a good motivator for me to prove him wrong in a sense and to continue to move forward.  And so I was very--it was very satisfying to be able to move forward.
Story_ID: 23810
Speaker 1: I didn't leave Texas A & M [University, College Station, Texas] and at the time there was the ocean drilling program.  Texas A & M had just been awarded a huge contract to be the science, to be in charge of all the science operations for the continuation of one of the most amazing earth science programs ever.  Back in the 1960s there was the deep sea drilling project which was a collaboration of many nations around the world to reconstruct the history of the earth as reflected in the rocks and sediments of the world's oceans and they used the, a deep sea drilling vessel for that.  And that program came to an end and there was a desire in funding to continue that program with a bigger and better ship and with more nations involved and that became the ocean drilling program with a brand new drilling vessel.  And that program came to Texas A & M around the time that many of us were either in the middle of our graduate programs or were finishing our graduate programs.  For those of us who were finish our graduate programs, especially those of us who were in geological oceanography and looking at the ocean floor and sediments, the big draw for many of us was working for oil companies.  And so a lot of my colleagues got their master degree and they went on to work for oil companies especially there in the Gulf [of Mexico] and that was very lucrative and things were going well at that time.  But I didn't want to work for an oil company, I wanted to go further and really be an academic oceanographer and get my Ph.D. at some point.  But with the ocean drilling program, being there at Texas A & M and with those opportunities, they needed marine technicians to work aboard the new drilling vessel and this is very special because this is just one ship that was going to go point to point around all of the world's oceans and it would always have a crew of 20 to 25 to 30 scientists from all over the world, and an additional fifty to seventy crew members including a scientific technical staff.  The ship was outfitted with all of the different lab, laboratories that you'd need to do all kinds of studies at sea to understand the rocks and sediments that were being brought on board.  This was basically an oil and gas drilling vessel that had been converted to a scientific platform.  The predecessor to this was the Glomar Challenger, Global Marine, a oil and gas vessel.  This new vessel was called, it was the Sedco BP 471, BP standing for British Petroleum at the time which has a different meaning for a lot of us given the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, but this is back in the '80s [1980s].  The scientific name for the vessel became the JOIDES Resolution, JOIDES standing for Joint Oceanographic Institutions for Deep Earth Sampling and the resolution being named after one of the ships of Captain James Cook and his explorations of the Pacific.  So all of this was incredibly exciting and for me it was perfect timing because I had just got my master's degree.  I was qualified to serve as a technician, a laboratory technician on a geological oceanographic series of expeditions such as this.  I applied for the position as one of the marine technicians and I got the job and I got to stay at Texas A & M.
Story_ID: 23811
Speaker 1: My first--it took a while for me to actually--well actually I need to think back because I was interested in the ocean drilling program as a graduate student and I wanted to go--they were letting Texas A & M [University, College Station, Texas] graduate students go out on expeditions and I was sent to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge from, the port calls were from Senegal [Africa] to Barbados [Caribbean].  So--
Speaker 2: So this is in April of '86 [1986]?
Speaker 1: Yes, um-hmm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And this is the first of ten expeditions in three years?
Speaker 1: Yes.  So if you worked as a, and still do now because the program is now the integrated ocean drilling program.  Technicians at the time we would go out each expedition is two months so you're at, always at sea for at least two months because these expeditions, you have to get to these various sites.  The ship has to be actually anchored into the ocean floor because you're drilling.  So you need time on site to drill to get the sediment samples or the rock samples and then you pull the pipe up and you move to another site.  So these are, it's usually two months at sea.  Most other oceanographic research expeditions are about a month at sea depending on how far away from the shore you're going.  But as a technician our schedule was, there were two technical crews that alternated so one crew of technicians would be out on the ship, the other crew would be back on shore.  So you're basically two months on the ship and two months off.  So my first official cruise or expedition as a full fledged marine technician was going to the Weddell Sea in Antarctica.  And so those port calls were from Punta Arenas, Chile to the Falkland Islands.  And then from there I was on the crew that had several consecutive expeditions throughout the Indian Ocean and then we went on into the Pacific Ocean.  So just a fantastic opportunity, a lot of time at sea now, a lot of experiences with the different kinds of scientific projects that were being undertaken, the different kinds of questions that they were trying to answer out there working with the actual data and working to actually bring up the sediment and rock samples and to process them in the labs, getting exposure to all of these top level scientists from all over the world who were on board at sea, also getting exposure to the men who were working, the crew, the drilling crew, the ship's captain and the mates, the engineers and so forth. The ship's crew, it was just a fantastic experience.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now this is, now you went to--I didn't, want, mean to cut you off before but you went to Dakar first to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge right, that was your first expedition?
Speaker 1: Yes, so that was, that, I was sent out on that expedition as a student technician.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: So I wasn't a full fledged marine technician yet.  But they were sending Texas A & M graduate students who were working for--in fact my, how I ended my graduate career at Texas A & M was actually working for the ocean drilling program as a student assistant and that's how I was able to get some, get the funding that I, the rest of the funding that I needed.  My fellowship had run out so I needed some more funding to finish my graduate studies.  So I was actually working for the ocean drilling program as a student.  And so that was really quite an experience because of course the ship goes point to point but they fly the crew and scientists out to that, to where the ship is going to be docked.  So we had to go to Dakar, Senegal and then we were at sea for two months coming all the way across the Atlantic and our port of call after we finished was Bridgetown, Barbados.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you get to go to some pretty nice places you know.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And then Antarctica.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes, it was an amazing job because they wouldn't pay technicians overtime so we had time off instead of being paid overtime.  So if you were at sea for about two months the equivalent instead of paying us overtime, you'd get about two and a half weeks or so of travel time or time off instead.
Speaker 2: In those locales or--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and so most technicians if you, for instance if you're docking in Barbados, you'd spend a little time traveling in the Caribbean or if you docked in Australia--I had a couple of port calls where I was, we were in--we came into Fremantle, Australia for instance.  And so my friends and I would spend our two and a half weeks traveling through Australia.  There was one port call that was in Mauritius so we had a chance to--several of us decided to travel through Kenya and do a very cheap safari such as what we could afford.  So for a young person just coming out of graduate school still wanting to work in her field, this was just fantastic, getting to travel the world along with it.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah so these places, so you went to--yeah, you went to Singapore, Philippines, Tokyo--
Speaker 1: Yes!
Speaker 2: --all these places.
Speaker 1: All these places, um-hmm.
Story_ID: 23812
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite place of all the places you traveled in these three years?
Speaker 2: Ooh, boy it was tough but I think I enjoyed the Australian Port Calls the most.  Fremantle, Australia was my favorite port call and we were there soon after the, I think the, it was the U.S. who had won the what, is name Dennis Connor who won the America's Cup, the America's--Fremantle was hosting the America's Cup at the time so it was it exciting to be there.
Speaker 1: It was a yacht race, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hmm.  And a friend and I also, we were in Australia for a while and then took some additional time off to travel through New Zealand and I never ever forgot that.  I'm still trying to get back to New Zealand.  I'm hoping I'll be able to go actually next year.
Speaker 1: Okay, they're supposed to have every kind of climate in New Zealand.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, it was, it's, it truly is middle earth.  We spent most of our time in the south island.  We were, did a cycling trip and did a lot of camping and just everything, beautiful beaches, pasture land, mountains, glaciers just a little bit of everything, fantastic place and wonderful people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in 1990 you began work as a graduate student researcher in the Marine Science Institute and the National Center for Geographic Information and analysis at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So around 1989, I had been going to sea continuously two months on, two months off for quite a long time.  And at the time they didn't, the ocean drilling program didn't have the wherewithal to hire more technicians so that we could actually stand down and have a break and not have to just continually go to sea six months out of the year.  And so as wonderful as the job was it was actually taking a toll on me physically and I was also not really home that much.  So I decided that it would be good for me to start looking for, towards the next phase of my life and for me I was still intending to go to graduate school again for a Ph.D.  But I had been trying to keep up with things that were happening in higher education and it was actually my mother [Jeanne Phyllis Grove] who sent me a little newspaper clipping from the chronicle of higher education and at that time 1988, 1989, the National Science Foundation [NSF] had funded three universities to establish this National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis and this is geographic not geologic.  And it was a very exciting new field that was opening up.  It's now known as Geographic Information Science and the technology is Geographic Information Systems which is why I'm here at ESRI [Environmental Systems Research Institute] because ESRI is the leading producer of geographic information, that software as well as the methods that are used with the software.  But that's where I became exposed to geography and wanted to look at geography more as a, maybe that's a discipline that I could go into and still, I could still study the oceans as a geographer but this whole new world that was opening up with mapping technologies and spatial analysis, that really, that attracted me.  So I didn't want to, especially with my experience at Texas A & M [University, College Station, Texas], it was a good experience but since I was, came out of that and was told to think about law school or getting an MBA [Master's in Business Administration], I wasn't too enamored of just going back into a traditional oceanographic program.  So I--and geography as a discipline seemed to be more open minded, broader.  It--geography encompasses so much because it's the physical sciences including ocean sciences, but it's also human, there's a human side to geography as well.  Anyway, I ended up applying to UC [University of California] Santa Barbara where this NCGIA, this National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis was at the University of Maine [Orono, Maine] which I considered as well.  I think I applied to the University of Maine.  It was also at State University of New York of Buffalo [New York].  I--that was out for me cause there's no way I was going to go to Buffalo, New York to go to school.  I had paid my dues at, out in the prairie of Illinois.  And then there's UC Santa Barbara and so I applied to UC Santa Barbara also and got in but again the money.  I was offered a fellowship, president's fellowship to pay for my entire graduate Ph.D. studies.  So that pretty much made the decision for me.  I think I had gotten into a couple of other places but it was really UC Santa Barbara that came back with that offer of funding, that fellowship.
Story_ID: 23813
Speaker 1: Now Santa Barbara [California] is a beautiful place.
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness.
Speaker 1: That doesn't hurt though, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it--talk about having one's ship come in, that was really wonderful.  And so I was in the geography program at Santa Barbara.  Santa Barbara also has, they had, they have the Marine Science Institute.  So it's wonderful because they have a lot of marine science going on.  And they now have actually a graduate degree in marine science.  At that time Santa Barbara, UCSB [University of California, Santa Barbara] didn't have that and so I started off as a geography student.  But Santa Barbara also has an individual interdisciplinary Ph.D. program where you can create your own doctoral program if, especially if you want to study something that is not being sufficiently covered or studied in one department or one discipline.  And so that's how I kind of moved from geography into geography and geology so I was able to embrace the geological oceanography again working with professors who were part of the marine science institute so that's where that, what you read off in terms of where I was working.  But then I also had support from the geography side through the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis [NCGIA].  So that's a long story to explain what it was that you read in terms of what my job was as a student.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was your--who was your Ph.D. advisor?
Speaker 2: My Ph.D. advisor was Raymond C. Smith, Ray Smith.  And he was the most wonderful advisor so again I was blessed.  I was blessed before with all of these great teachers in elementary school and middle school and high school and then I ended up with this fantastic advisor.  I didn't follow the normal path where you are a clone of your graduate advisor or you're working in the same area that he's working in, maybe working with him on a research project.  He is a bio-optical oceanographer and he works with satellite data and he looks at biological processes in the upper ocean as well as the physical processes in the upper layers of the ocean.  And I wanted to still focus on the bottom of the ocean on the sea floor and looking--making maps of the ocean floor.  And my dissertation research at the time was moving towards making maps of the ocean floor with this new technology, this geographic information systems.  So I started off taking his satellite remote sensing class but I knew that I was not going to actually be interested or able to work on the kinds of projects that he was working on but he was still willing to keep me on as his student and to mentor me even though I was working in areas that were completely out of his field.  So he still maintained his status as my major professor but I actually went on to work more closely and to publish parts of my dissertation with faculty members, other, another faculty member in geography, Michael Goodchild and two very, very close and precious faculty members in the geological sciences department, Ken MacDonald and Rachel Haymon.  And then there was an ocean scientist, ocean geologist, Dale Krause who had been working for many years with UNESCO [United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization] and he took an interest in my research as well.  So that was my committee, the people who were on my committee.
Story_ID: 23814
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I have a note in here to ask you about Sylvia Earle.  Now she was an inspiration to you.
Speaker 2: Yes, and I'm trying to think of when I first--Sylvia Earle came to UC [University of California] Santa Barbara to give a public lecture and I think that's when I first became aware of her and her work.  And so as an impressionable graduate student at UC Santa Barbara, working still, working in the ocean sciences, working on my Ph.D., her lecture was just fabulous.  Now she is a fantastic speaker, she's great at inspiring the audience.  She can talk to many different kinds of audiences.  She has this deep, resonant beautiful voice as well so she just sucks you, takes you in.  So I was very impressed with her lecture.  I forget what her lecture--of course it was about the oceans but I forget the specifics of it at the time.  But it had, most definitely had to do with exploring the oceans and with preserving and protecting the oceans.  Now she would later come back into my life on several different occasions but that was when I first encountered her.
Story_ID: 23815
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in '91, you're still working on your Ph.D. but you had an opportunity to take a dive above the Alvin [U.S. Navy-owned Deep Submergence Vehicle], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, so this is--so by that time in 1991, I--similar to what had happened to me at Texas A & M [University, College Station, Texas] where I was sort of on my own and I found resources and people to work with over in another department.  The same thing happened to me at [University of California] Santa Barbara.  It was a, I think much happier circumstances at Santa Barbara because I had and I forget how it all started but I started spending a lot of time in the lab of Ken MacDonald and Rachel Haymon.  They are husband and wife, geological oceanography professors in the geological sciences department at UCSB so I left--so I was spending, even though I was a geography student I was spending a lot of time in their lab with their students and getting involved in their projects.  And I think the connection was made because they were starting to use GIS [geographic information systems] at the time.  They were, I think probably the first in the, in that department to use this fairly new technology.  And the interesting thing is that Rachel Haymon had been involved with Robert Ballard who had become famous even more.  He was already famous in the scientific community but he would become world famous because of his discovery of the Titanic.  He had made that discovery with a deep towed camera sled called the Argo II and Rachel Haymon was using that same vehicle to look at hydrothermal vents or underwater hot springs on the ocean floor south of Acapulco, Mexico.  Now to make a long story short the crew, the technical crew of the Argo II was experimenting with different technologies, one of which was geographic information systems and they were using the ArcInfo geographic information system to collect and manage the data from that deep towed sled, camera sled.  Rachel had been involved with this expedition and she received her data in this GIS format which she didn't know anything about.  So they needed a GIS, Geographic Information Systems, geography students worked with that.  So she was looking for a geography student who was interested in working on the oceans but who needed, who had the expertise in GIS and so I fit that description and ended up working very closely with her.  So I got involved, I--and that was actually my way of learning GIS because I hadn't had a chance to take the geography GIS course at UCSB yet.  So I started working with her data first and she actually paid a geography, another geography graduate student to teach me ArcInfo so by the time--so that we could work with her data.  And by the time I had finished that and took the GIS course it was easy.  At any rate, she involved me in her other research expeditions on this very important segment of the East Pacific rise where two tectonic plates are pulling apart and there's a lot of volcanic activity, a lot of hot springs and that actually became my dissertation study area.  In order to study those areas close up, she had gotten funding for the Alvin, to use the Alvin submersible and so I was involved in one of her expeditions and she would send students down in Alvin and so that's where that comes from at that time.  It was amazing because at that, on that particular expedition that was the first expedition, it was the closest that anyone, any scientist had come to actually seeing a volcanic eruption on the ocean floor.  Of course we know about volcanic eruptions on land but no one had ever seen one and really not until a couple of years ago had anyone actually witnessed it happening because it's so hard to be in the oceans, to explore the oceans, to move through the water.  It's not the same of course as being on land.  And it was just serendipity that brought us to within two weeks of actually seeing a volcanic eruption.  We--she was there to see the aftermath of an eruption that had occurred two weeks earlier and we know that from the dating of the volcanic ash.  So it was a very historic expedition and it was historic from the sense of her scientific discovery but also the fact that the first dive of that cruise she went down with another woman scientist and also a female Alvin pilot.  That was the first time that there had ever been a female pilot of Alvin and with two women scientists, first time there was an all women crew in Alvin.  And then when I was sent down I think it's a shame that this has to be significant but I guess it is, I was the first African American woman to go down in Alvin on a submersible dive to the ocean floor, two miles depth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was quite a cruise.
Speaker 1: All right.  So this is in 1991?
Speaker 2: 1991.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 23816
Speaker 1: In '93 [1993] you placed third in the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] Collegiate Road Nationals at UC [University of California] Santa Barbara's bike team, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, well that's extra--
Speaker 1: You were on the bicycle team.
Speaker 2: Extracurricular, yeah.  In '92 [1992] there was more of the same with more diving in the Alvin submersible [U.S. Navy-owned Deep Submergence Vehicle] and more research and more fun work but I'd also gotten involved in cycling with the cycling team at UC Santa Barbara and learned about that as a new sport.  By then my knees had gone to, my knees were, I couldn't play basketball or run anymore so I was looking or a new sport and so I took up cycling.  UCSB [University of California, Santa Barbara] had, still has a great cycling, road cycling team.  It's not an NCAA sport, it's a club sport but there's still collegiate championships and so forth.  So we had a very good team that year and we qualified as a team for nationals and took third.  Now here's a bit of trivia.  That year--Tyler Hamilton is very famous now because he rode with Lance Armstrong for all those years and he's had his own troubles with doping and so forth and we know now about his story and his connection with Lance Armstrong.  Well that year in collegiate cycling, he was at the University of Colorado at Boulder and he actually won the entire competition.  He was the best cyclist there and his team CU Boulder won the national championship.  UC [University of California] Davis was second and we, our team UCSB was third so we were all on a podium together.  So all of us can say that we were way back when on a podium with Tyler Hamilton before he became Tyler Hamilton.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's a very nice guy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But he's been accused along with Lance Armstrong and others of doping and--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He, yes and he has confessed to doping and he's written an expose on how he did it and he's pointed the finger at Lance Armstrong and others and we know what's going on with Lance Armstrong now.  So it's, again it's amazing how life turns out the twists and turns and what's coming down the road.
Story_ID: 23817
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you received your Ph.D. in 1994 and your dissertation is entitled 'From Pattern to Process on the Deep Ocean Floor, a Geographic Information System Approach'.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So that was a combination of the degree was a joint degree in geography and geology and the main message of my dissertation was using geographical approaches and spatial analysis through geographic information systems to understand patterns and processes on the ocean floor.  The ocean floor, the bit of ocean floor I was looking at was this segment of the East Pacific Rise where I had been working with Rachel Haymon and also Ken MacDonald.  And we--with the data that we were able to get from the Alvin submersible [U.S. Navy-owned Deep Submergence Vehicle] and also from this Argo deep towed camera sled, we were able to look at geological processes but also biology where different creatures were living at these vents, the chemistry of the vents and also how the vents were distributed on the sea floor.  There are spacings that are proximity to other features such as faults and fissures.  And the geographic information systems technology helped us to integrate all those different kinds of data and to understand what was happening.  It turned out to be--my dissertation described a cycling of different kinds of processes that were happening consecutively but also interleaved.  But it was a combined story of geology, biology and chemistry to understand those hot springs on the ocean floor.
Story_ID: 23818
Speaker 1: Now you did post-doctoral work at--with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA]?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.  So I, when I finished my dissertation [at the University of California, Santa Barbara] I was actually not, towards the end of finishing my dissertation I wasn't really looking for academic jobs yet cause I was trying to get finished with my dissertation.  And I was also a little bit worried because I had been in a mountain biking accident.  I had actually flown down a mountain down, a hundred feet down a ravine and had to get helicoptered out of the ravine.  I'd come very close to being killed actually and I was trying to get healed up from that and to finish writing my dissertation and to, just to move on from there.
Speaker 1: So did you break bones and such?
Speaker 2: No.  No, didn't break any bones but I did injure my knees again, tore some cartilage.  I had to have some knee surgery and I tore some muscles in my neck but it was--that's quite a story behind that accident but I was able to get through that.  So I was pretty concerned with just getting healed up from that.  But around that time Oregon State University [Corvallis, Oregon] was looking for an assistant professor and they had not had a new assistant professor in their department for twelve years and they were already hiring a department chair and somehow they were able to get a faculty line for an assistant professor as well and they were looking for candidates.  And the, I think it was the department chair at the time contacted my major advisor [Raymond C. Smith] to see if I was going to be available to interview because they saw this, the dissertation title that you just read [Wright's dissertation, titled 'From Pattern to Process on the Deep Ocean Floor, a Geographic Information System Approach'], they saw that in a newsletter in a geography newsletter and they were interested in that.  They were interested in someone who was--had skills and expertise in both geography and geology because this department at Oregon State [University] is the department, at the time it was the Department of Geosciences so it had both geography and geology and I was coming out as a student with a joint degree in geography and geology.  So to make a long story short they invited me to come up to interview.  I was supposed to interview around the time that I had my bike accident and I had to delay the interview because of the bike accident, but eventually did come up to interview and actually got the position.  I wanted though to actually do a post-doc before moving into a tenure track faculty position and they very nicely negotiated for me to have an eight month post-doc with NOAA at their Hatfield Marine Science Center on the coast. So I was there with NOAA--
Speaker 1: Is Hatfield named for Senator Mark Hatfield--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, Senator Mark Hatfield had done so much in Oregon and supported ocean science as well so that center is named after him.  And the group that I was working with is the vents group which actually looks at hydrothermal vents off the coast of Oregon and Washington so it was the perfect post-doc for me and I had two more dives in the Alvin submersible [U.S. Navy-owned Deep Submergence Vehicle] through that.  I was with them for eight months and then that's in Newport [Oregon], about fifty miles from the main Oregon State University Campus but after eight months with them than I moved to Corvallis, the main campus to start the teaching and research and the typical faculty position.
Story_ID: 23819
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so this is 1995 when you, you know start at OSU [Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon], then right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what kind of schedule did you have in terms of--I mean did you have a lot of your time spent in research or I mean how was research and teaching balanced I guess?
Speaker 2: Well in '95 [1995], in January I started my post-doc [post-doctoral position at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)] which was all research and that was in Newport [Oregon].  And, but then in September I started at Oregon State [University] so there I had the typical balance where it was 40 percent research, 40 percent teaching and 20 percent service.  My service component was a little larger because I was being given the--all of the GIS [geographic information systems] coordination for the entire department [Department of Geosciences] and campus.  So GIS was becoming very, very popular technology and it's a very popular area of study for students, it's very marketable and we can see that now with how mapping is literally everywhere in all aspects of our lives.  So there was a lot that I was expected to do in terms of coordinating GIS across the campus.  But I had a typical load of courses, I think about four courses and then research to bring in my summer salary and to support graduate students.  So I started off in that typical mode and went from there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what's the faculty like at Oregon State?  I mean (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I think as a campus, Oregon State, there's a lot of collegiality among the faculty and it's, I think it's a great place to be because there are low walls in terms of collaborating with people in, from different parts of the campus.  So if you want to--like in my case working as--in the geosciences department I was very free to work with faculty in the college of oceanic and atmospheric sciences.  Now that's all been--our geosciences department is now part of that College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences and it's now the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences. So there's a lot of freedom to work with colleagues from other departments, students from other departments and so forth.  So I think it--and my first, I'd say my first ten years at Oregon State, I was especially happy because I had such good department chairs who were fantastic mentors.  So once again I was blessed.  And Sherm Bloomer [Sherman H. Bloomer] was an early department chair and he and I actually did a research expedition together and published together and then I also--Gordon [E.] Matzke was also a huge mentor.  So Sherm Bloomer is a geologist, Gordon Matzke is a geographer but those two men, I think they were fantastic chair, department chairs, great leaders and they both took an interest in me and were very, very good mentors for me.  So that really launched me professionally as a faculty member.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in '96 [1996], it says here in '96 [1996] you helped map the Tonga Trench between Fiji and Samoa, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was a project with Sherm Bloomer, my department chair at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You had worked on the Tonga Trench during your masters.
Speaker 2: So yes, yes it was a happy return to the Tonga Trench and we were able to map the second deepest spot on the entire planet which is the Horizon Deep.  The deepest part we know--most people really know about it now because of James Cameron's single descent to Challenger Deep in the Marianas Trench but the second deepest spot is Horizon Deep in the Tonga Trench.
Story_ID: 156824
Speaker 1: Okay, now we were just talking during the break about the, what we don't know about the oceans.  You said it's a good segue into this discussion so let's talk about it.  What do we know and don't we know?
Speaker 2: Well I've been involved in mapping the ocean floor and if we look at the amount of the ocean and all of the ocean floors that we have mapped in the same level of detail as areas on land, or if we even look at--we have a complete mapping of the moon and Venus and Mars.  We've sent satellites to those planets and to that moon and we have very detailed elevations of the planet.  But earth is a water planet and satellites can't see through the water as I mentioned before so we only have about five to ten percent of the ocean floor mapped and the same level of detail as Venus and Mars, the dark side of the moon and on land.  So when we're talking about various issues such as for instance you're thinking about hazards and tsunamis where you actually need to know the topography, the bathymetry, what the seafloor is like to understand the true behavior of a tsunami because that's a fast moving wave that's going to feel the bottom as it comes on shore and then act accordingly.  We don't have the maps, the detailed maps to have that knowledge for most of our coasts off the United States.  Even for the--and then for the water column or the water that's between the ocean floor and the sea surface, we have very, very little of all of that inner space mapped again completely the way that we have maps of the land and even maps of the atmosphere and that's because it's very hard to function in a water world.  And with the technologies that we have such as the sonar that we--you mentioned the SeaBeam with those acoustic pulses, you know as we're--we only have so many vehicles and instruments that we can put in the water at any one time.  We haven't had the funding for that at levels similar to what NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] gets to explore outer space.  Of course they need more money because it's--they're dealing with outer space but at the same time we just haven't had the level of funding to do the same thing for our own planet.  So if we're going to understand many of these forces of nature, these storms like Hurricane Sandy and climate change and how tsunamis, the earthquakes that cause these tsunamis and how they're going to be killers once they reach the shore we have to be able to understand our oceans and that means exploring and mapping the oceans has to continue.  So many of us are thinking, calling this a second age of discovery that's still needed.  We don't know everything about our own planet.
Story_ID: 156825
Speaker 1: Okay.  In 2000, you served as a co-editor of your first book entitled, 'Marine and Coastal Geographical Information Systems', right?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hmm.  So along the lines of understanding the oceans, GIS [geographic information systems] technology has been very, very important in--it's played an important role in this because the mapping, a lot of the mapping that is done is done with GIS.  And my dissertation earlier was one of the first dissertations to use GIS to look at the oceans.  Now what I did in my dissertation is nothing compared to what people are doing now especially students.  But back then in the early 90s [1990s], that was, it was very unusual.  So a few years later this book that came out in 2000 was the first major compendium of studies that people, the progress to date with how people were using GIS to map and understand the oceans.  So that was a very important milestone for me professionally and working with a colleague from Ireland, Darius Bartlett from the University College Cork who had been doing a lot of work on coastal GIS and I'd been looking more at deep ocean GIS.
Story_ID: 156826
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now in 2001, you spend your sabbatical year in Samoa, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Now I wasn't living in Samoa the whole year.  I was actually living in Santa Barbara so I was able to return to Santa Barbara and that was a--Samoa was important at the time because, so this is where Sylvia Earle comes back into the picture because Sylvia Earle at that time had launched this initiative called the Sustainable Seas Expeditions.  And she had gotten some major funding to map all of the or most of the national marine sanctuaries and she was educating the world, but certainly educating the United States about the importance of our National Marine Sanctuary System and how these are really our national parks that are off shore and I think most people at the time just didn't realize that.  Similar to Yosemite National Park and the Grand Canyon National Park we have these sanctuaries such as the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.  Most of the sanctuary is underwater and these are essentially part of the United States, very important parts of the United States that have been--that are being protected and preserved and parts that you could, you can actually visit.  Well the smallest and most remote of the National Marine Sanctuaries is the Fagatele Bay National Marine Sanctuary in American Samoa.  So I wrote a proposal, a research proposal to do mapping in that sanctuary along the spirit, same lines as Sylvia Earle's sustainable seas expeditions initiative to map that sanctuary.  And so that's where the Samoa connection came in. Fagatele Bay is actually, it's going to be--happily this sanctuary has just recently been expanded so they're changing the name of it and it's going to cover larger areas.  American Samoa a lot of people don't realize is also a part of the United States because it's one of our territories.
Story_ID: 156827
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you also in 2001 worked with the initial working group for ArcGIS, right or Arc--how do you spell that, ArcGIS?
Speaker 2: ArcG-I-S?
Speaker 1: Yeah, ArcGIS.  Okay.  And the group met here in Redlands [California].  So well tell us about that.
Speaker 2: That was a group of us that came together to put together a data model for using GIS [Geographical Information Systems] but more specifically ArcGIS which is a software that's produced here at ESRI [Environmental Systems Research Institute].  So for instance there are all kinds of word processors if you want to write a novel or an email or anything written but many people, most people perhaps use Microsoft Word, that brand from Microsoft.  So I dare say that most people who use geographic information systems are using the product ArcGIS.  So we wanted to put together a framework for structuring data to be put into ArcGIS more easily if you were working with oceanographic data.  And if you were getting data from systems like SeaBeam for bathymetry or from buoys or from instruments that are put into the water to measure all aspects of the oceans.  So our group got together and we were hosted here at ESRI headquarters in 2001 to develop that model and the model was finished in 2007 and published as a book and people are still using it. And part of my job here at ESRI now as chief scientist is to further, is to lead the further development of that model because it's been so useful, apparently so useful to people to research scientists and to resource managers, including those working in national marine sanctuaries.  So we're going to continue to update and improve that model. So something that started with a group of us, a small group of us in 2001 working on that, putting it together and then having it published as a book, here we are in 2012 and it still lives on.
Speaker 1: So it's good work.
Speaker 2: And so now I work for ESRI so we can really do a lot of good work on it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, okay you were promoted to full professor in 2002, right, in the department of geosciences here, I mean at Oregon State [University, Corvallis, Oregon].
Speaker 2: [Nods in agreement].
Speaker 1: Did you have anything to do with the launching the Argo Program?
Speaker 2: The Argo Program?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: Because there are several, I guess there are several different programs that are called Argo.  But my own relationship to--oh I'm drawing a blank here.  You might have to edit this part of the interview.  I'm also running out of steam.  I know you must be running out of steam too.  Maybe you could read me more about what that--?
Speaker 1: Well it's a collaboration between fifty research and operational agencies in twenty-six countries with the United States contributing over half the total funding as of December 2004.  The program was intended to sync with satellite observations with a service topography of the ocean.
Speaker 2: Oh okay, so that's a, that--no I'm not involved with that particular program but our data model can work with data from the floats of--Argo has a whole series of buoys and floats that move up and down in the water and take measurements of the salinity and the temperature and the clarity of the water and so forth.  It's a great, it's a huge deployment of instruments to help us understand particularly the Pacific Ocean, but I wasn't involved in getting that set up.  That's really more in the area of physical and chemical oceanography and I'm still mainly with, involved with geological oceanography.
Story_ID: 156828
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now 2004, it says here that you became a certified GIS [geographic information systems] professional.  Now what does that mean and who can certify you?
Speaker 2: Well geographic information, people who work with geographic information systems, that's become so prevalent in all aspects of society, not just in the, in academia but people working local government, local and state government, federal government, across the board in many different kinds of industries--it's just, it may be as prevalent as people who are certified as chiropractors or certified as engineers.  So GIS as a profession has evolved now to the point that we have a National GIS Certification Institute and so this actually certifies people with the relevant experience and training and activities to be certified GIS professionals.  So I have that certification now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You also received a grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to sponsor graduate fellowships in I guess for applying GIS or remote sensing to coastal resource management projects?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That was a small, I think that was a pretty small grant just to have students, to train students working, interested in working on applying GIS to coastal zone management and particularly looking at coastal planning, working with coastal protected areas like sanctuaries and reserves, looking at hazard, hazards along the coast as well.  So all of that is in the realm of coastal zone management and we can see how important that is especially given the recent disasters that we've had such as the Gulf oil spill, recovering from those kinds of disasters, finding places that need to be restored and protected such as the wetlands, helping people to find new places to live, preserving the ecosystems in those areas.  So again the mapping and the spatial analysis that GIS brings to that is very valuable.  So at the time NOAA was able to give grants to professors to work with, to train students in that area and get them involved in projects like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now 2005 you served as a chief scientist with the Pisces Science Observer, the submersible used--and this is in Hawaii right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was--so that's a different chief scientist from what I'm doing here at ESRI [Environmental Systems Research Institute].  When you're leading a scientific expedition at sea you're called the chief scientist for that expedition so that was just one of the expeditions that I was able to lead at sea and we were using the Pisces submersible which is very similar to Alvin.  It looks very similar to Alvin and we were using it to identify new species of corals and invertebrates around American Samoa so this was a continuation of the work that had started back during my first sabbatical.  And Pisces is actually not doing too well right now because with the budget cuts that we've had, NOAA has received some terrible budget cuts which has basically wiped out the National Undersea Research Program that funds the deployment of Pisces.  But anyway, Pisces is based in the University of Hawaii.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So it's not operational right now.

Speaker 1: Now in 2006 you won the Oregon Assembly for Black Affairs Education Award.
Speaker 2: Yes, was very humbled by that award.  It's usually given to an African American faculty member at an Oregon University who's doing outreach work or different kinds of projects, sort of making a difference on their university campuses or in their community.  So I, I'm not sure--I just consider myself just keeping my head down and staying out of trouble and teaching my classes and working with students and so it's nice to be recognized.
Speaker 1: And then in 2007 you're recognized as a United States Professor of the Year for the State of Oregon by the Carnegie Foundation, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That was a real shocker for me because I've never really thought of myself as a strong teacher.  Teaching is very hard for me and I've had to work incredibly hard and I used to be scared to death in the classroom but over the years it's been I guess a labor of love to come into my own as an instructor.  And so to receive that award was--I still--it doesn't seem like that was me.  Maybe that was my evil twin or something.
Speaker 1: Okay.  2007 it says, is this the book we were talking about before, the Arc Marine GIS--
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's the book that--
Speaker 1: --for a Blue Planet?  Same book, okay.
Speaker 2: --essentially published the data model.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In 2008, you're named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in the Geosciences Division, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now this is, what--to be a fellow here is that, is this an honor as well (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, usually with scholarly organizations such as the American Geophysical Union or in this case the American Association for the Advancement of Science [AAAS], that, that's I think our largest scholarly organization for science so across the, all of the sciences.  So if you're chosen as a fellow that's a great honor because it's usually--they reserve that for anywhere from five to one percent of the membership of the organization to be chosen a fellow.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 156830
Speaker 1: And now what are you working on now and what are your future plans?
Speaker 2: Well now for--with ESRI [Environmental Systems Research Institute], I'm taking a leave of absence with ESRI because I was asked by the CEO, Jack Dangerman to work with him as his science strategist, the science advisor. Given the importance and we've talked about many of these issues already with what's happening across the planet with natural disasters and with climate change, with the importance of conservation with problems with that we have with water and with food across the world, many of the issues that we are dealing with today they're underpinned by science.  And so ESRI as an organization that produces software but also does a lot of research and development to back up that software and help people use that software more effectively, the sciences are very important especially climate science, ecology, forestry, conservation biology and ocean sciences.  So Jack Dangerman as the CEO [Chief Executive officer] of ESRI is very concerned with this.  He's also wanted to really have ESRI be much more involved with ocean science and helping to improve our software and our products and our services to improve what we're doing in the ocean science and ocean resource management areas.  And this is specially again in the light of the needs that we have in that area given what's happened with the Gulf of Mexico with the oil spill, recently with Hurricane Sandy, the tsunami in Japan where debris are still going to be hitting the U.S. west coast for the next several years.  There's--
Speaker 1: The hurricane that hit Haiti and--
Speaker 2: Yes, all of these, it's been one right after another.  And we also now have a National Ocean Policy under President [Barack] Obama, the first time in U.S. history that we have a National Ocean Policy and coastal and marine spatial planning, the mapping that is required for that kind of wise resource.  It's like land use planning except it's applied to our ocean areas, including our sanctuaries.  So Jack Dangerman asked me to come and be his chief scientist, to lead a new ocean GIS initiative so we're working on all of these issues across the organization.  So with the flexibility that he has here and also with Oregon State where a professor can take a leave of absence and do something different.  So for instance, I think the best example of this is Jane Lubchenco who is the administrator.  President Obama asked her to be the administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that you've asked me about several times.  She's still a professor at Oregon State but she--Oregon State gave her a four year leave of absence to serve President [Barack] Obama as his NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] and administrator.  So I'm not anywhere near the level of Jane Lubchenco but in a similar way, Oregon State University [Corvallis, Oregon] has given me a leave of two years to work with ESRI as their chief scientist.  Now I'll have to make a decision in the future as to where I go from here.  Do I continue working with ESRI as chief scientist and extending my leave from OSU [Oregon State University] because if I'm not at OSU then I'm not teaching and I'm not working with students.  I'm also not bringing in research dollars to OSU because I'm a hundred percent employed.  I have a leave without pay so I'm a hundred percent employed by ESRI so I have a very important decision to make soon as to what I'll do.  But for now I've been involved with ESRI on many different, interesting projects and we have some new products and services for mapping the oceans and for doing spatial analysis in the oceans.  We recently had an ocean summit where we had 50 top notch scientists and resource managers come here to brainstorm with us about how we can improve our software and improve our knowledge of what's happening along the cutting edge of all of the ocean sciences from the geological oceanography to physical, chemical, biological oceanography.  The coastal marine spatial planning and so forth and how we can improve what we do in terms of visualizing in three dimensions and four dimensions with our software and working with different data formats such as with--coming from the Argo floats, from the Argo program that you mentioned or with the different kinds of sonar sensors that give us even more detailed bathymetry and so forth.  So there's a lot going on and I also--part of my job here is to represent ESRI on various committees of the National Academy of Sciences [NAS] and the National Science Foundation [NSF] , some of the advisory boards of different organizations such as Conservation International.  So we now have a--I provide the science representation of ESRI to those boards and I also bring back the latest issues and knowledge from what's being discussed at those high levels in the federal government and across these other organizations.  I bring that back to Jack Dangerman and to the other directors and programs here at ESRI.  So I'm sort of like a science ambassador, science liaison.  So this is a wonderful job right now and I'm really enjoying living in Southern California again, especially at this time of the year where I was escaping the Oregon rain and gloom and doom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's where I am right now.
Story_ID: 156831
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point is there any major move that you would undo or go back and change?
Speaker 2: Ooh, that's a good question.  I don't think I would undo anything.  There were some things that were very hard, some things that were out of my control for instance having to move from Hawaii to Maryland.  There's no way in the world if left to my own devices I would have left Hawaii but I didn't have any--I was a high school student.  I was in--I was with my mother and she had to make that life decision.  But looking back on it now, it was the perfect path for me to have followed.  No, I don't think there's anything that I would change because everything--my story is one of just trusting and following the opportunities, the cookie crumbs if you will because the places that I, aside from Wheaton where I, by hook or crook I was going to go to Wheaton College.  But going to the other schools that I went to, it was mainly that the door opened and the opportunity presented itself.  And even though it wasn't my first choice or I had no idea that I would be going to that place or in that direction, I just went through that open door and it, all--everything fell into place and led to really other great opportunities.  And then I think my story is also a story of people who have been inserted into my life along the way these great teachers and mentors that I've had and they've come from all different backgrounds.  There really haven't been African Americans that I've had to look up to so if I had limited myself to only wanting to see role models or mentors who looked like me I wouldn't have had much to look toward.  So I think another message is to find your inspiration, be willing to find your inspiration in all different ways through different kinds of people.  Now I love being a role model and a mentor to young people, including African American people who want to consider going into the earth sciences or studying the oceans.  I love that.  I love that there are more of us now.  There are so many good examples like [HM] Evan Forde who works for NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] is another fantastic example, African American scientist who's a generation ahead of me and works very closely with young people.  There are people in allied fields like many of us admire Mae Jemison the first female, African American female in space so there are all kinds of wonderful examples out there.  We just have to be willing to open our eyes and look out there and see them.
Story_ID: 156832
Speaker 1: Okay.  As someone who does a lot of outreach in the community and like I first met you at ScienceMakers I think, you know talking to young people, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well in terms of the African American community, I hope that we can not discourage our--people who aren't fitting into the mode, people who are interested in different things and I'm probably not stating this clearly as I could, but there are not very many of us who look at the earth sciences for instance and who think about majoring in geology or maybe physics or chemistry.  And I just hope that we--if there's a young people in our community who has those interests that we don't discourage them from trying to follow that path.  Even if you're in athletics, if you want to play basketball but if you also have an interest in science I hope that that can be nurtured in our communities and there are more and more programs, opportunities to go to science camps or to work with faculty at universities or to be involved in science clubs, these kinds of opportunities are--people are working very, very hard to make these available to young people, African American--in our African American community so we shouldn't discourage people and make fun of people or ostracize those people in our community who have those other interests.
Story_ID: 23829
Speaker 1: Okay, now we always ask this question too.  When you consider what you've done till this juncture in life what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I think my legacy is that I've--well I'll go back to my mother [Jeanne Phyllis Grove].  She was the first in her family and the only one in her family to step out, step away from the East coast and venture West and go to school in Illinois and work in Canada and then Hawaii so I think my legacy is one of someone who has stepped into an unusual area, an unusual profession for African Americans.  And my story has been a, mostly a positive one so if others would like to follow in those same footsteps and try, you know majoring in some of these areas where we don't see African Americans.  Like I was saying I've always been the only one in my undergraduate program, my graduate program in terms of being an African American.  There have been very few women in these areas but that is really changing where we see now the numbers of women in the sciences.  Many of these science programs it's half and half with men.  So at any rate I think my legacy is one of stepping into these new frontiers, these new territories and I hope that others follow suit because it's really fun and exciting and we can do it.  We can do it.
Story_ID: 23830
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any other--I know there must be some other black oceanographers or in related fields.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well Dale Morgan you can consider an oceanographer because he's looked any many aspects of geophysics including in the oceans so he is a wonderful role model.  Evan Ford who I mentioned before, he is, I think he's, he was trained as a physical oceanographer.  He works for Noah Research Lab in Miami.  There--in fact I should probably just provide you with a link to--there are a couple of sites that feature African Americans and other minorities in ocean sciences and there are quite a few of us now.  And there are quite a few of us who are moving into I guess the, into senior levels cause in my case now I've been in academia for quite some time and I've moved into being a full professor and this is where we have another challenge where we are not seeing African Americans and we're not seeing women in the upper, the more senior levels of academics and sciences.  So we still have a long way to go there too.  When I was at--for most of my time at, I think well it's still the case at Oregon State University [Corvallis, Oregon] I was the only African American female faculty member in the entire college of science and so we've got to remedy that.  But it's, we--it can't happen overnight and we've got to have people who are interested and who are--who, their life circumstances are such that they feel they can stay with it and pursue this kind of life.
Story_ID: 23831
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us something about your family today?  Your father passed away in 2010, right (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And you had a dog die last year too, I guess what now?
Speaker 2: Well my family unit is very small because I'm not married.  I don't have any children.  My path has been such that I've been so--I've had so many adventures being at sea and traveling and doing the different kinds of projects that I've been doing that I haven't met someone to settle down with.  But the good thing for me is that I'm very, very happy being single and I have, I enjoy my freedom.  I mentioned that my mother [Jeanne Phyllis Grove] is very, very close.  We've been a close family unit because I don't have brothers and sisters especially.  So she has retired and lives with me so I can keep an eye on her.  So we have a family of females where it's my mother, it's myself and my dog Sally.  So that's my family unit right now.  And still with all the traveling that I do it's too much traveling so that I'm away from them quite a bit.  But we're a very, very happy little family unit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you live in Oregon for the most part right?
Speaker 2: Well so, because I'm full time here with ESRI [Environmental Systems Research Institute] I live here in Redlands [California] so I have a house up in Oregon that has been rented.  I've been renting a house.  It's up for sale right now and I still have ties to Oregon because I--the agreement that I have right now is to return to Oregon State [University, Corvallis, Oregon] at point.  But I'm living here in Redlands right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I think you've covered the gamut pretty, pretty closely.  Basically as you're saying it's chronological so you've basically gone through my whole life so I don't think you missed anything.
Story_ID: 23832
Speaker 1: Okay. Well the last question is similar to legacy but it's a little bit different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as someone who--oh, well I think it's similar to the legacy.  I would like people to remember the legacy, someone who was adventurous and who stepped out into a new area, a new frontier in terms of ocean sciences and geography and ocean exploration and made contributions in terms of the research that I was able to do and the teaching, the students and the young people mentored over the years.  And someone who had fun doing it and showing that this is, this kind of life is fulfilling and exciting and makes a contribution.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Well thank you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23833
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead and tell us about this picture.
Speaker 2: Well that's a picture of my mother when she was about six years old.  I think she was about six.  I don't know the occasion but I like the picture because she looks so intelligent and so serious even at that age.
Speaker 1: Now what's your mother's name?
Speaker 2: Jean.  Jean Wright.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's an important thing to remember.  Somebody who's not here that's typing this up so they won't know anything about it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So that's a picture of my mother when she, I think she was in college so it's some time in the 1950s.  And I don't know in that--that's also a picture of my mother, Jean Wright.  I don't know when that was taken.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, let's see here.
Speaker 1: So this is a collage, I don't know how you want to handle that.  So that's a picture of me, 1995 just starting as a professor at Oregon State and that's a picture of me also around the same time--
Speaker 2: Was it in this picture?
Speaker 1: And that's me, age five.
Speaker 2: You want to take that out?  Let's not cover that part.
Speaker 1: Or you can just, it's already behind the glass. So that's me at age five.  And it's a mother/daughter picture.  I was twenty-five and that's just a picture of me at a conference oh I guess some time around 2000.
Speaker 2: Let's see, I'm trying to think the best one of these graduation pictures (unclear) I mean with--is there one with you and your mother?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Is this (unclear) one?
Speaker 1: Yes, that's a good one.
Speaker 2: Okay, and this is your--is this your advisor?
Speaker 1: That's my advisor, un-huh.
Speaker 2: Okay, we'll do those two (unclear).
Speaker 1: So that's a picture of my mother putting a lei on me at UCSB after getting my Ph.D. going through that graduation and this is the same graduation from UCSB [University of California, Santa Barbara] with my advisor Raymond Smith.
Speaker 2: Okay.  A couple of ocean going pictures here (unclear).  That's the only one.
Speaker 1: Yes, so that's the Alvin submersible so that was, I think that was around 19, the 1990s.  Oh no, maybe that's 1991.  I'm blanking on the actual date but that was one of our Alvin submersible expeditions.
Speaker 2: It says 1995 on the book so I don't know what that means to have a '95 [1995] print (unclear).
Speaker 1: Some of those pictures were from earlier.  That might have been 1992, early '90s [1990s].
Speaker 2: Here's the whole boat I think with the Alvin (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that's a--that's a picture.  It's a, actually a postcard of the Atlantis II which for many years was the tender for the Alvin submersible.  There's now a new ship that handles the Alvin--
Speaker 2: You got a picture of the instrumentation from those days.
Speaker 1: Yes, so that's a picture of one of the labs that we had set up on the Atlantis II for mapping the seafloor with geographic information systems.  Oh that's a picture of me racing my bike at UC [University of California] Santa Barbara.  That's around 1993.  And that's a picture around 1995 or 1996 with the chair of the Department of Geography at the University of Oregon [Eugene, Oregon].  Oh, so there it is, 1996.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I had been asked to give a lecture.  So this is a nice collage that Evan Ford of Noah who is another great African American scientist, ocean scientist.  He put that collage together for black history month last year.  And this is a picture from American Samoa, our Pisces submersible dive expedition and that was around 2005.  And that's an article that was published in our--the OSU, Oregon State University [Corvallis, Oregon] Research Magazine.  And let's see, this is another article that was published in the Oregon State College of Science Magazine about some of the research that I had been doing up to that time.  So I guess that's around 1996.
Speaker 2: Yeah, spring of '96 [1996].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh okay so this is from one of the Sally Ride Science Books for young people just talking about my career as an ocean scientist and a geographer.  And that's also, that's another Sally Ride science book that was produced that has--it's pretty much the same story and same pictures except it's in color.  So that's showing me with my dog Lydia and a picture of the Alvin submersible.
Speaker 2: Where did you get the name Lydia for your dog?
Speaker 1: She had already had the name Lydia.
Speaker 2: She had the name already?
Speaker 1: Somebody had already named her and she already knew her name.  This is one of the banners that was placed around campus of prominent faculty so that's the banner that Oregon State University did of me with the nickname Deep Sea Dawn that I don't know--somebody gave me that nickname and it just stuck.
Speaker 2: Ocean people get names like that?
Speaker 1: Yeah there are a lot of--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) everybody that work cause the other one is the sturgeon general.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, Sylvia Earle has that, her deepness.
