Speaker 1: All right, my name is Larry Crowe, I'm interviewing for the HistoryMakers.  Our Videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Arlie Petters, Arlie is A-R-L-I-E, Petters is P-E-T-T-E-R-S.
Speaker 1: All right now do you have a middle name?
Speaker 2: Yes, Oswald, O-S-W-A-L-D.
Speaker 1: All right and is there a story behind your name, Arlie Petters?
Speaker 2: My understanding is my uncle had a book of English names and in that book he apparently found the word Arlie, and Oswald I think he must have already known that.  I think it's like how you have Raleigh, and other such things.  Arlie must be a derivative of a name like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And Petters as far as you know is a, is an English--
Speaker 2: Or European in some form, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born February 8, 1964 in Dangriga, Belize.
Speaker 1: Now can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: D, Dangriga is D-A-N-G-R-I-G-A.
Speaker 1: And Belize.
Speaker 2: B-E-L-I-Z-E.
Speaker 1: All right.  And so what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a Professor, I'm a Professor at Duke University and I'm currently, I have a multiple appointment between Mathematics, Physics and Business Administration over in the Business School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I didn't know about the Business Administration too.  Okay.  All right now what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is February, what is it, the 21st?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes, 19--February 21st, 2012, the year of the Mayas.
Speaker 1: And where are we at?
Speaker 2: We are in--
Speaker 1: That's right, you're the [unclear].
Speaker 2: That's right.  The year that Maya is predicting--well the end of a cycle in the Mayan Loncomb [ph.] calendar, 2012 is quite special, particularly December 21st.  And as you know part of the history of Belize involves the Mayas.  Yes I'm currently at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.
Story_ID: 20954
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that only require a short answer that we ask as a warm-up.
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I love Belizean food, particularly a good old rice and beans stewed chicken, a Belizean potato salad, some very ripe plantain on the side.
Speaker 1: Okay do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I don't think any one color stands out, but I do have a few that I think captivate.  So if you're looking at aqua marine type colors, I love that.  You're looking at certain hues of green, that also I find very captivating.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It must be my, you know growing up on the coast with the sea and the green with the inland.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Around Easter.  This is--I would say that March/April period when for example out here it's not hot or cold.  In the mid seventies, I think that's perfect weather.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I would say the hometown I grew up in Belize, Dangriga.  It's authentic, simple.  It's a place where you can really be in the present, and I love that about it.  I feel quite alive when I'm there.
Speaker 1: Okay and the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I think the one that sticks with me is do unto others as you would like them do unto you.  I mean that Biblical statement to me is a profound law of behavior that I find has been enriching for me throughout my whole life.
Story_ID: 20955
Speaker 1: Okay now I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll tart with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Velina Petters, V-E-L-I-N-A, Petters, P-E-T-T-E-R-S.
Speaker 1: And what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: James.
Speaker 1: James, okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: That, I wouldn't recall offhand.  I can look it up, but--
Speaker 1: Okay well can you give us a ballpark, was she born in say the '30s [1930's], or the--
Speaker 2: I would say the '40s [1940's].
Speaker 1: Forties, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: April 29th but in the '40s [1940s], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where, where was she born?
Speaker 2: In Be--in Dangriga, Belize.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about the history of your mother's side of the family?  How, how far back can you trace them and what do you know of them?
Speaker 2: My understanding is my mother's father immigrated to Belize from Grenada.  And he married my mother's mother who is from Belize, and I--my understanding is that he stayed in Belize the rest of his life and worked as a farmer, for example, as a lot of immigrants in those days did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then on the Belizean--so, so I don't know much beyond that, with the Grenadian and part of our family roots.  On the Belizean side I understand there was a mixture happening, you know and those days with Colonialism, you have a lot of Brits that interacted and had children with local Belizeans.  And I believe part of the family, it has a heritage like that.  So you're going to see names like Pascasio or Usher and so on that fit in with interactions of that type.  I think it would be more Scottish--I believe that there were people that did agricultural work in the citrus industry in those days.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now the, the, the history of--the, the people of Dangriga and I, and I--would you characterize them--your family as Garifunas?
Speaker 2: Our family, it's not Garifuna, it's Creole.  And as you know Belize has a lot of small ethnic groups somewhat culturally distinct.  And I would be considered what's a, what's considered a Creole.  And the way that is used in Belize is it's African American mixed.  You know if I should use language like here, it would be African American mix with a non-African American.  So in Belize it's black mixed with non-black.  And then--
Speaker 1: So that could be European or Indian?
Speaker 2: Yes it could be Indian.  Like my father was Mestizo which is part Maya and part Spanish.  And then the Garifuna people are quite distinct in that they originally interacted, mixed with the Carib Indians in the Caribbean.  And they have their own language, their culture that is well defined with a lot of African threads throughout.  I'd say my understanding it's a lot of Yoruba elements.  So my family I think, as my understanding, is that it was a mixture of Belizean, black, Belizean, Creole that came about with Colonial mixing and things like that.
Speaker 1: But the name Creole, the way it's spelled in the Belizean context is--starts with a K right?
Speaker 2: Well some, yeah there isn't like a universal spelling.  You have, yes with a K and then in American C-E-R-E-O, and so on.
Speaker 1: It's the same name.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it simply we take it broadly to mean a mixture.  And they--I believe the blacks were originally logwood cutters in Belize that were brought in as slaves.  But it has also some distinct elements in that a lot of English pirates settled in Belize and interacted with former slaves and things of this sort.  So it had sort of a more liberal interaction between black and white I would say, rather than the standard thing of one race feeling genetically superior to the other. You may have that in some pockets, but I think the injection from the pirates, the Buccaneers as they were called, I think added a kind of, you know, difference in that part of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So now back to the--your specific family.  What, what about your grandmother?
Speaker 2: My grandmother--
Speaker 1: On your mother's side.
Speaker 2: On my mother's side, she came in part along the Pascasio line.  And I, my understanding is that the Pascasio were people--the original people were out of Scotland and one of them interacted with a Belizean black woman, then that gave rise to my mother's mother and several other children.  And they took the name Pascasio.
Speaker 1: Now how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: P-A-S-C-A, and I think it's C-I-O, no S-I-O, Pascasio, S-I-O.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay so that's--so now are there any stories that your grandparents passed down on your mother's side about life in Belize?
Speaker 2: One thing that struck me is my--so my--the--in those days they used to have a train that ran--there are no trains in Belize today.  But apparently there was a railroad that ran through the--well just a little outside the town of Dangriga and went inland.  And I understand that my great-grandfather drove that.  So it was something I never knew.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was called Driven Train in those days, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I can just imagine you know a black man being responsible for you know, driving a train like that, that's a big investment.  So they must have really had a lot of trust in him.  And I don't know how he got his training and so on, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So this would have been back in the--
Speaker 2: Fifties [1950s] I would imagine, if not earlier, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right now what kind of--well while your grandfather was a engineer for a train I guess.  Then now what kind of work did your people do on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Most of them were farmers.  The women of course stayed at home and I--my understanding is an uncle of mine had a small grocery store.  And of course these things evolved with time.  When I was a baby, I heard that my grandmother, she's very entrepreneurial, and if there's anything I got from her it was that.  She had a small restaurant and a small shop that she--she's an excellent cook and I guess the shop would be one of these things that would carry a little bit of everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now what, what is your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Ber--so Bernice Waight, W-A-I-G-H-T.
Speaker 1: A-I-G-H-T.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20956
Speaker 1: All right.  And did our mother have a chance to go to school in Belize or finish high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mom did up to high school in Belize.  My grandmother only to elementary school, by the way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So was your mother the first one in the family to finish high school?
Speaker 2: I believe that is correct, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is it--was it common in Belize I guess when she was growing up for people not to finish high school?
Speaker 2: Right, it was quite common.  Some--most probably didn't even finish elementary school.  And I think completing elementary school was sort of the basic foundation I think for getting jobs in those days, yeah.  At least what I would call store jobs, where you'd be the accountant or something for a little store.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right so did, did people look forward to going to school or was it something that, that was seen as a privilege to do?
Speaker 2: I think it was viewed as a privilege.  And my understanding is with particularly with the males, the sooner you could get them working on a farm or something of that sort, or in a store, the better.  And, and some of those pressures still exist in Belize today.  But I--my take is that going to high school and all of that, was you know, the rich man's privilege, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you wouldn't be as likely to have high school dropouts in Belize.
Speaker 2: In those days, correct, because it was, you know it was such an honor.  It would have to be financial I would gather, for you to drop out of high school.  That was a great honor in those days.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, all right.  Now, now did your mother speak about what her aspirations were when she was growing up or what she wanted to do or--
Speaker 2: Well my mother had me out of wedlock and I think she must have been eighteen or nineteen.  And that, you know in those days you're in very strict community and I think that must have surely created a lot of stress for her.  And she had an opportunity to come to the U.S. and start a new life because she and my father were not together and she took that opportunity and I was raised--that's how come I was raised by my grandmother.  So it's the typical immigrant story where for survival and proximity to the U.S., that is the place to try and go and, you know make it so to speak.  And I think that, if I understand the, those days appropriately, I think that was a major driving force for her.
Story_ID: 20957
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, all right so we're going to leave your mother's side right now and go to your father's side of the story.  And I know you've got two fathers to discuss.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your biological father.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And a stepfather.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay so they--let's start with the biological father.  Can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, Oswald Vasquez, Vasquez is V-A-S-Q-U-E-Z.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't know his birth and but I imagine he was close in age to my mother, so he probably was born in the early '40's [1940's], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And was he born in Dangriga?
Speaker 2: He was born in Orange Walk, two words, Orange and Walk.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now you say he was a Mestizo.
Speaker 2: Yes so he was part Mayan and part Spanish.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Mayan and Spanish, so he would, he would look different.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: He would have straighter hair, that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now did that create like a cultural difference between the families?
Speaker 2: Well my understanding is even in those days when you look at the history of Belize, the--most people were mixed and it would be mixed either with P--you know the Colonial or with the Mestizo Mayans that were already in the country.  So it was not unusual to have that kind of mixing is my understanding.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay so it wouldn't be--
Speaker 2: It wouldn't be viewed as odd, yeah that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, so what, what can you tell us about his side of the family?  How far back can you go with him?
Speaker 2: I don't know a lot about my father's side of the family.  But my understanding is that it stems from the Vasquez clan which some--if I should make some inferences, it surely is different from my mother's [Velina Petters] where you have the Pascasio with some Scottish person having a role in that part of the family tree.  And so the, the Vasquez family is pretty big in Belize and that sounds to me more probably influences connected with greater Central America.  You know with a name like that.  And I don't know the original Vasquez, probably out of Spain you know with that time in that part of the world, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had several siblings and they are also in the western part of Belize where you, you know these--Orange Walk is in the north and then Kyle, which is in the west.  When you go to those parts of Belize, you see a lot more Mestizo culture.  The diet begins to change and people are bilingual.  You hear a lot more Spanish being spoken and then last names will be like Mendes or Vasquez, things of that sort.  I met my father only once in my life, I was twenty five years old and it's only in recent years that I began to have I'd say a closer connection with the children he had while in Orange Walk.  But most of my life when I grew up I, I knew of him but never had any interaction with him.
Speaker 1: Okay so you met him only once?
Speaker 2: Yeah I met him once and he died I think, must have been a couple of years after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What, what were your impressions of him?
Speaker 2: Well it was weird.  It was--I remember I was in graduate school I guess or just starting graduate school.  Fourth of July, long weekend.  I went to Jacksonville, Florida.  He immigrated to the U.S., by the way, and married an American, a Caucasian American.  So I went to visit, she lived in Jacksonville, Florida and I visited him.  And it was just weird to see someone that physically have a resemblance.  That, that was quite striking.  And the part that may be even a little more profound is I noticed some of his personality traits are like mine and I never grew up with this man.  I, I found him to be very intense and I, I think I'm a little more on the intense side naturally.  And you know like he has this fire in him when he talks about things he's doing or want to motivate people.  So that was very striking to see these similarities.  He was very friendly, charismatic type person.  Tells jokes and he was in real good physical shape.  He loves I guess working out and things like--I don't have a six pack, this man had a six pack, you know.  And I understand it goes back to his early days in Belize.  He always loved exercising, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  What kind of work did he do in, in Florida?
Speaker 2: He--what you call the people then that--the civil engineering work where you're building roads and things of that sort.  So he did that type of job.  I guess he was part of the crew when--that work on highways, yeah.
Story_ID: 20958
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell us about your stepfather.
Speaker 2: My stepfather, my interaction with him--
Speaker 1: What, what is his full name?  Can you give us his name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name is Cecil Petters, C-E-C-I-L Petters.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I am--I think he must have been born in the late '20s [1920s], early '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: Yeah he's, he's older than your mother.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah much older than my mother.  Maybe early '30s [1930s], around that ballpark.  And I can get the specific dates for you.
Speaker 1: He's 80 now?  He's in his 80s now.
Speaker 2: Early 80s, yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Somewhere around that.
Speaker 1: Okay now where is he from?
Speaker 2: He is from Honduras.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well I, I believe--it could be he was born in Jamaica and then moved to Honduras as a child.  Because part of his family I know is out of Jamaica or you know he was born in Honduras then had more Jamaican interactions there.  So he immigrated to the U.S., you know, he was there much earlier than my mother.  And he--he's black or we'd call him African American.  He worked as a doorman in the U.S. most of the time he has been there.  He's retired now.  Prior to that, my understanding is from Honduras he used to be a cook on the ship that made stops I guess throughout the Caribbean, must--I am not sure what type of vessel that was.  I would guess probably cargo.
Speaker 1: Merchant.
Speaker 2: Merchant, that's right, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's a, a detail that is interesting.  When I grew up in Belize, I had my--it's standard you take your father's last name.  So I was Arlie Vasquez.  And then when I moved to the U.S. permanently as part of getting my green card and my citizenship, he adopted me and then my name was changed from Vasquez to Petters.  So Petters is not a common Belizean name, right.  So that, that's the origin of the name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He--I don't know a lot about his side of the family, but I know for sure out of Honduras and they, they also links to Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Now it seems to be like history, from the history I've read a lot of Jamaicans, you know, would go to Honduras and Central America to work for United Fruit, yeah bananas and such, you know.
Speaker 2: I will ask my mother about this.  So he could have probably been part of that wave.
Speaker 1: Right, Marcus Garvey actually was a timekeeper for United Fruit Company before he came to America.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: And Jamaican you know, goes to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know Honduras, I believe he went to Honduras.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Or Costa Rica or someplace like that.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: So that's a path, I don't know, that might be--
Speaker 2: I will check with my mother on that, yes.
Speaker 1: But from, from what you've, what, what we--from, from what you were saying I guess he, he may have arrived in New York via a Merchant Marine?
Speaker 2: I would assume that, yes that's right, yeah.  And he became a citizen.  When my mom arrived I think he was already a citizen.  So he had to have been dealing with the U.S. for quite a while I would imagine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Prior to that.
Speaker 1: Now in your early growing up, you really saw him maybe once a summer.
Speaker 2: Yes I saw him the first time when I was five because he and my mom made a visit.  And then after that when I was ten, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you, you moved to the U.S. when you were thirteen, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah that's right, permanently.
Speaker 1: So all right now, now I guess we, we need to probably have more detailed information about your grandmother too, the one that raised you.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: She's really significant in your early development, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: So what is her name again?
Speaker 2: Bernice--
Speaker 1: Is it B?
Speaker 2: B-E-R-N-I-C-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Waight, W-A-I-G-H-T.
Speaker 1: Okay and do you have any idea what her date of birth is?
Speaker 2: I believe it's 1928 and April I think like 27 or so, yes.
Speaker 1: Was she born in Dangriga?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, that's right.
Story_ID: 20959
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so your grandmother, I think you were saying earlier, had, she had attended grade school.
Speaker 2: That's right, exactly.
Speaker 1: And that was the basic, you know that was basically terminal education for most people.
Speaker 2: For most people, yeah at that time, right.  What I think struck me about her was I say her entrepreneurial spirit in that she understood money, the importance of it as a tool, and had the inner strength to take the risks necessary to help to make it grow.  And you, you see that in her.  There, there's a kind of to me emotional resiliency perhaps driven by the need to survive, that made her to me understand how to manage money.  I would say that though her formal education didn't go very far, she had I think, and again this fits in with the entrepreneurial side, she had tremendous emotional intelligence.  This was someone that understood people.  She knew how to interact with people in effective ways.  When someone would perturb her she was able to step back and really know how much to react or whether or not to.  These kinds of skills I think were extremely important I would say, at least in things that influenced me.  And just watching her as a role model, you know someone that doesn't have a high school or college education looking at how far that takes you, right.  And then I think I feel fortunate to have witnessed someone like that.  Equally important was her spirituality.  I would say of everything that was the most important in her life.  And to this day it still is.  And when you hear me talk about the, the quote or verse or whatever that has been a, a central compass in my life, you know doing unto others as you like them do unto you is something I literally got from her.  And I got it I would say in a way in that she lived it, right.  So there were times when things would get rough and you don't see where a resolution to a problem will come, she would pray and just have faith that would to an outsider just look like blind, crazy faith.  But something inside her told her that it will be okay and we will get past this one.  So I think those aspects of her had a very strong impression on me, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay now is she, what I guess denomination.
Speaker 2: She was Methodist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Still is Methodist, yeah.  And I went to a Methodist elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is the--are the schools in Belize mostly church established schools?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.  In fact most of the schools, I would probably venture to say close to seventy five to eighty percent of the schools are affiliated with some church or so.  And they are very active in the education of the Belizeans and this goes way back.  I would say the Catholic church probably has the most schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's only more--it was probably more longer after that the Baptist church and some evangelical churches from the U.S. started establishing schools in Belize.  But the longer traditions would be Catholic, Methodist, Anglican, yeah.
Speaker 1: Presbyterian popular there?
Speaker 2: I don't think there's an explicit Presbyterian that I--could be one recently.  The Mormons are coming in more recently too.  But I don't believe they have any schools, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, Okay.
Story_ID: 20960
Speaker 1: All right so, so when you look back on growing up, when you think about your parents' personalities, their talents, their dispositions.  I'm talking about all three.
Speaker 2: Yes, right, just the different--yeah.
Speaker 1: Their dispositions, their looks and mannerisms, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I would say my grandmother [Bernice Waight].  I, I have a little bit of--with my mother [Velina Petters] one thing that she influenced me with is she always--she never made me feel like she's forcing a point of view on me.  I always felt free to choose.  She put me in a situation that says well there's this, there's that and that.  You know you should choose the one that you feel is right for you.  And I remember the first time I saw that in her kind of freaked me out because I don't know.  You're to tell me.  But then I began to realize that she wants me to have the freedom and enough bravery to make a decision on my own.  And then look at the consequences thereafter and have that inform me for the next decision.  And so getting this from her very early on, from my first trip to the U.S. I began seeing that.  While growing up in Belize, you know the, the elders would probably be more influential in telling you.  But she gave me a kind of freedom of choice I had not known before.  And so to this day anything I do, I will solicit advice, but at the end I want to feel that I have chosen it from within.  And so that is one aspect I know from my mom that stands out.  My stepfather [Cecil Petters] I think, though I had a rocky road with him early in my life which has been mended since, the one thing that stood out is that man as a, as a doorman, when I look at what he did with his money and how he built up assets based simply on patience and simple interest and then compound interest.  And so this is someone that took his money, put it in the bank, didn't spend too much but he wasn't a miser either, right.  He, he found time to enjoy life.  But was disciplined in putting a little away every month, a little.  And over many, many years you see how compound interest impacts that.  And when I teach finance I always think about him.  Where you can end up having properties and these kinds of things just from the patience and the, the rigorous discipline of managing that side of your money.  I had never witnessed that in the same way in Belize with my grandmother's entrepreneurial spirit.  She did the same thing but at the same time, she was managing the risks of business and you know, things are more volatile.  But here, his job, he was in a union, this was stable.  It's like a tenured professor, right.  But he simply stuck with it.  I've never seen anyone so disciplined before.  And that had an impact on me that in anything you do if you are serious about it, you commit to it and don't abandon it in the middle when things get, you know a bit rocky along that road.  So I, I'd say that was very important to me coming from him.
Story_ID: 20961
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a story about how your, your biological parents met?
Speaker 2: My understanding is my father [Oswald Vasquez] was working on road, he did--he loved roads I guess, the building of roads.  And in Belize he was part of the public works I assume.  And they were building a road in the Dangriga area.  And that's how he and my mother met.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes so he was stationed in that area when they were working on the roads.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did they--why did they break up, or was it that serious a relationship or what?
Speaker 2: My understanding is, and I'm giving this from the point of view of my mother [Velina Petters], is that she discovered he was married and that you know the whole family went in an uproar.  And she felt betrayed.  So I think that she didn't want to have anything to do with him after that.  I heard my grandfather was looking for him with a shotgun.  So he, he skipped town quickly.
Speaker 1: So, so did he go back to Orange Walk?
Speaker 2: Yes that's right.  And then my other half siblings, he had them after.  Yeah but he went back, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 20962
Speaker 1: So now, now so you grew up--how soon did your mother leave Belize?
Speaker 2: When I was a year and a half old my mom [Velina Petters]--the opportunity came up to move to New York [New York, New York]and that, I think the person that sent for him was--everyone calls him Uncle Wilfred, but I'm not too sure.  I believe he's a relative of my stepfather [Cecil Petters].  But I'm not sure if it was actually his uncle.  You know how like my grandmother, everyone calls her Aunt Bernice, right.  So he was the one that had a connection with my grandfather in Belize and sent for my mother.  Said no send her here, I'll get a job for her, etc., yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 20963
Speaker 1: So do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I can only recall my mother [Velina Petters] visiting me when I was around five.  And when she came with my stepfather [Cecil Petters] and Uncle Wilfred.  And this memory partly sticks in my mind because Uncle Wilfred had one of these little cameras, like these little movie cameras in those days.  I'd never in my life seen something like that.  So he was filming all over Dangriga [Belize] and so that time stuck in my mind.  Guess it must be one of the earlier models of a video camera, right, but it was on the film.
Speaker 1: Yeah the Super 8.
Speaker 2: Yeah I guess so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 20964
Speaker 1: Okay so now what, well describe the, the community you grew up in.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well first of all did the community have a name in, in Dangriga?
Speaker 2: I don't think it, it had a distinct name.  But typically what happened as I understand it in those days, the Creole families knew each other, huddled together.  The Garifuna families, they were kept in their communities and you know, did what their culture dictates.  And I don't know if there was a lot of interaction in those days.  But growing up as a child, I did feel a distinctness between those two communities, though I played with some Garifuna kids.  I remember part of it was there's this ritual in the Garifuna culture called the Dugu and it, it has many elements like in the Haitian culture where there's a worship of the ancestors.  And you know if an ancestor comes to someone in a dream, a dead person, a relative or so, they may call for a Dugu.  And so all night the drums would be beating and there's a temple where there's a special dance and rituals that would happen.  As a child I remember they didn't want us to go there.  And I felt afraid of it, right.  So that kind of thing in culture and religious rituals I think was a little bit of a partitioning.  But today I mean those boundaries are very loose now.
Speaker 1: Now are the Garifunas Christians as well?
Speaker 2: Yes, and but they mix it in with their own--a little like what I said with the Haitian.  A lot of Garifunas are Catholic so you'd have elements of that in there and so on.
Speaker 1: Okay so that ritual was--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Catholic saints marking a place for the [unclear].
Speaker 2: That's right, so a little like in Brazil or you know we have our own distinct thing happening in Belize, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did the, the church leaders in the Creole community tell you that this had something to do with the devil or anything?
Speaker 2: In the beginning yes.  Today, no.  Because you now have, you know I'm glad to see the openness in fact emerging more and more.  In the Catholic church the priest who is Caucasian, he speaks fluent Garifuna.  And he may give sermons in Garifuna.  When the hymns are being played, you have Garifuna drumming to the hymns, it's like brilliant.  I didn't even know you can adapt the sound, you know, to hymns in such a brilliant way.  And so that, you know growing up as a kid you wouldn't even dream that such a thing would happen, yeah.
Speaker 1: I think, I guess people as they're, as they know more, they--
Speaker 2: That's right.  You know ignorance creates all these unfounded fears and so on, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, so that's--what did the community look like?  Now you know, now we're sitting here in North Carolina, which is beautiful but, but what did it look like in Dangriga?
Speaker 2: When I was growing up, so when the Garifunas came to Belize, Dangriga was the epicenter where they were given safe haven.  They were being chased, you know, persecuted, etc. throughout Central America.
Speaker 1: This is like 1763 I believe from what I was reading.
Speaker 2: Yeah I mean into the 1800s and so on.  And Dangriga has a section called the Carib Reserve.  And it, it's not the word reserve in the sense of a nature reserve.  This was 40,000 acres of land I understand, that was given to them so that they can start to build a life for themselves.  So it was divided up into blocks and each family got some land.  The government of Belize had done a similar thing by the way, for the Mennonites in the west, right.  So Dangriga became an epicenter where the majority of Garifunas moved to and so growing up as a child, they were the majority of the population in the town because of this flood in, you know with the immigration.  And so you'd see Garifuna people, you'd see Creole.  Interestingly today it's far more diversified than that.  You'll see Garifuna, Creole, you'll see Chinese, you'll see India Indians, you're going to see Mestizo.  And say looks--you walk down the street, it's like this little melting pot.  You know this is a tiny town, there's like 12,000 people, but look at the diversity already, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah that does sound like an interesting place
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, right.
Speaker 1: For a tourist it may be tough to figure out who's who.
Speaker 2: Who's who, that's right.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so there was not a specific name to your neighborhood, but--
Speaker 2: No, no name.  I think it was just too small a physical space.
Speaker 1: Is it on a certain side of Dangriga?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's on the north side.  There's a bridge that, you know bridges often--and a river that define north and south.  So we lived on the north side of Dangriga.
Speaker 1: What's the name of the river?
Speaker 2: The Stann, S-T-A-N-N Creek River.  Stann Creek is the district that Dangriga sits in, so that's like the state.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now I read somewhere where the Dangriga used to be called Stann Creek.
Speaker 2: That's right, it used to be called Stann Creek Tongue, and then the district was Stann Creek District.
Story_ID: 20965
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what were some of the--we always ask this one.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well so at least through my eyes, what was breathtaking for me, it was just--so let me start with the people and then touch on nature.  With the Garifuna culture in the town, when the women wear the outfits you think you're in West Africa.  And that to me was--and you know you have the bright yellow, you'd have black.  So it was very colorful and distinct.  The heads are wrapped and things of that sort.  So I remember with the people, seeing that.  And for me I was in awe.  And the sounds, the drumming that would occur.  And this is not just, you know, different points in the year, but it was especially strong around the 19th of November, which celebrates the Garifuna Settlement Day.  And boy you--that town just comes alive.  Another time was Christmas, from Christmas to like the sixth of January you have the Jonkunu performances.  These are masquerades in fact that happen throughout the town and they go from home to home performing and the Jonkunu is also a mockery of the British.  So if you ever look at it, you, you'll see them dressed in white and black ribbons and he has a white face, a mask as if he's European.  And the way the dance is done, it mocks the British and their politeness and their super proper etiquette, you know.  But I think it was just brilliant.  I cannot say anything less than that.  And then you have on the Shakanare, which is a totally different rhythm and involves a cow with horns and they chase the kids around and so that, you know, has a big crowd.  I can remember the sounds of that.  Also the most somber Dugus [ph.] I told you.  That goes all night.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Dugus?
Speaker 2: I think there may be more than one spelling, but I would do D-U-G-U.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, like there might be an official Garifuna way to spell it.
Speaker 1: What about the Jonkunu?
Speaker 2: The Jonkunu, so there are couple of ways I have seen it spelled and Jon, the word John, and then C-U and U.  So I'm sure if you Google it you may see some variations.
Speaker 1: Now, now what is--does it have a specific meaning?  I mean does it really, you know you say they mock the British, but is--what's the word Jonkunu, does it have a specific meaning?
Speaker 2: I'm not too sure if that one has a, you know there--I think there's like the word wakanare [ph.] or so, that's the origin of the Jonkunu.  But I think this, you know came out as a form of rebellion against Colonialism.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know that they do, Jonkunu in the Bahamas I think.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, yes.  And Belize has its one to the shells, you have shells on the knees and you know the little kids do it all the way up to the adults.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But surely the sight, those sights are strong in my mind.  The sounds from the drumming, and the drumming they have different sounds depending on the, the particular role of that performance.
Story_ID: 20966
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did, do the Creoles ever participate in these festivities?
Speaker 2: No, they--at least when I was growing up it would typically be the Garifuna, but they would come and watch, yeah.
Speaker 1: So is the, is the origin of that the link between the Creoles and the British?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: That they would come and watch politely.
Speaker 2: Watch politely, yes, in amazement, that's right.  And they also in those days saw the Garifunas as immigrants.  You know those things with the borders and the U.S. and you let in the Mexicans, right, this, this kind of you know, they're visitors or--but over time, suddenly you know with the next generation then oh yeah, they're Americans.  And now they're Belizeans, that's how enough time has passed that it's being viewed that way.  I think with respect to participating in the rituals, there might be more strictness with who can be involved dancing in a Dugu.  My sense is you'd have to be Garifuna, yeah, cause there's a certain respect and so on, you know.
Speaker 1: Is there any, is there ever any cultural migration where a Creole marries into a Garifuna?
Speaker 2: Yes, you have more of that happening.  Even members of my family have married Garifunas, yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So it's interesting to watch how these things evolve with time.  In the beginning you know there's this, you know border here and they just join.  But then the flow starts to happen over time.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so there are distinctions but they're not so rigid as they used to be.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20967
Speaker 1: All right so, so these are some of the sights and sounds and smells.
Speaker 2: I should add one more thing with the visual impact that I think was strong for me.  I always love art as a kid and drew, drew, drew, drew.  In fact I wanted to be an artist, not a scientist.  I recall visiting a lot of Garifuna artists and was just struck by their art.  And even some of the other portraits and prints they had hanging in their little art studio, it was, I must have been like eight or so.  That was the first time I saw Salvador Dali's painting of the crucifixion of Christ.  And that painting gripped me boy.  So the, the art, and the music, and here I'm not just talking about the ritual drumming, but you had a lot of bands in the town.  In fact Dangriga is considered the culture capital of Belize.  So that aspect of it really had visually quite an impact on me.  I started getting, grow, trying to grow an afro by watching you know the cool musicians and other people do that, the artists, you know.  Jim Brown and all that stuff was all on their walls, right.
Speaker 1: Our Jim Brown the football player turned actor.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: His movies were popular?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Belize.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Did, did you go to movies a lot in Belize?
Speaker 2: Yeah we were allowed to go to the matinees, yeah as a kid.
Speaker 1: So you saw the black American movies?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, those were the--and you know Shaft placards and all that were everywhere, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm getting the impression that the, the Creoles become the shop people basically, and the Garifunas have a, are more artists and the--
Speaker 2: That's right, yes that's right in those days.  And now the Chinese are really--must be ninety eight percent of the stores, the shops are now owned by Chinese, yeah.
Speaker 1: I know East Indians do that in Trinidad.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And Chinese as well.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I would say the East Indians are much smaller percentage in Dangriga.  The Creoles now do a lot of the service industry, the banking and things like that, tourism, banking.  They're--at least in Dangriga they're heavy in that.
Story_ID: 20968
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, now, now was, was television a, a part of growing up?  Did you have a television or --
Speaker 2: No, radio was a major source of information.  There were a few people in the town that had television and that was like huge.  And of course it's a black and white and then it's all grainy and the image jumps up and down.
Speaker 1: It was, so I take it probably was not a television station in Dangriga [Belize]?
Speaker 2: No, no.  And I don't even believe in those days there was a radio station.  So you would try and tune in to BBC through the radio.  And there was a Belize, a national Belize radio station, Radio Belize.
Speaker 1: Where would they broadcast from?
Speaker 2: Out of the city and then they tried to put powers, you know in different parts of the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the Capital of Belize is --
Speaker 2: Belmopan.
Speaker 1: And that's inland.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the center, and it was moved there because of hurricanes, yeah.
Speaker 1: How, how do you spell Belmopan?
Speaker 2: B-E-L-M-O-P-A-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now what is the group, you know presides there basically?
Speaker 2: I would say Belmopan is largely Creole and then Mestizo.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20969
Speaker 1: All right now well tell us about school.  Now where did you, you started at a Methodist school, right?
Speaker 2: Methodist elementary school.  I think it--the full name is Epwort, E-P-W-O-R-T Methodist Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Okay, was it, was it close by to your house?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, you could walk there, seven, eight minute walk.
Speaker 1: Okay now from what I read you loved school.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: There's a picture of you with a briefcase, carrying early in life.
Speaker 2: I must have been the only kid in all of Dangriga [Belize] with a briefcase.  That of course was sent by my mother.  And I was always a pensive kid, and used to think about things that probably scared me too as well.  I used to look up at the--speaking of imagery and sounds, I used to spend a lot of time looking at the sky and how the clouds come together and I noticed that certain times of the year the clouds have a different shape than others.  And the scale of clouds, I remember fascinating me.  Another part was looking at the sun dipping you know, in, in--behind the moun--the hills.  That was breathtaking to just watch how the colors changed.  I used to at night look at the sky a lot and just amazed.  Sometimes I had to go to sleep my grandmother said and I want the blinds open enough so from my little bed I can look through it and watch the stars twinkling.  So the mystery of existence was something that captured me from a child.  And I know this happened a lot during elementary school where I wanted to know what the world is all about and why you exist and what is this thing, you know I love and move.  What's that all about?
Speaker 1: So this is a curiosity that goes beyond the answers of religion.
Speaker 2: Way beyond that, yes, yes.  I, I felt myself in this world with fascinating things.  I used to look at ants.  I had a--a lot of kids, you know, with the metamorphosis for a butterfly.  I had one of those and every morning I'd get up and look at it you know.  I remember my first tomato plant, watching that grow every day.  And so just being fascinated by the workings of the world, that I naturally asked a lot of questions, particularly during elementary school, that's when it began.  And it just stuck with my entire life, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now the sky must--I guess in a place where you didn't have a lot of electric lights.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Belize, yeah.
Speaker 2: Studied under kerosene lamp.  And so it was just breathtaking at night.
Speaker 1: So many people live in cities now that never seen the sky in the country.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: The lights.
Speaker 2: That's right, and it naturally begs all kinds of philosophical questions as a child with, you know, where did all that come from, what are those sparkly things called stars?  And how do we fit in that story?  So early on I used to draw a lot and it's part of why I was much more pensive.  I didn't play a lot as a kid.  I was always at home, you know drawing, trying to capture some these things I was seeing around me.  I loved to study and was always thinking a lot.  I think my grandmother got worried quite a bit.  She used to try and chase me out the house to go and play with the other kids.
Speaker 1: So what kinds of subject matter were you studying?
Speaker 2: Everything.  I was asking questions about philosophy, you know, is there a God, how do I know there's a God, things like that.  Asking questions about nature.  I used to look at ants, you know it's like well how do they know to go along that line?  And then like they're walking with these little things in their mouth and know where they're going, right.  I was--I just sat there and watched them for hours.  Like this is a whole little world down there.  And then with respect to more physics type questions about the cosmos, right and how many stars and you know, how they sit up there, and all these kinds of things.  So these were queries that went beyond of course your school curriculum, right.  They have a standard thing and I always bugged people with questions like that.
Speaker 1: I, I read that you had a cousin who had graduated from high school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did he have an affinity for the kinds of questions that you--
Speaker 2: That's right.  He was someone that got me fascinated with issues of chemistry and he also, how do I say this?  He highlighted something to me that I didn't realize, you know you're experiencing the world but then it's a lot of different stimuli.  But he was the first person that said you know you must be smart, but you must be physically strong.  And it's like okay.  So he taught me karate and exercise and then some of that led to this issue of mind and body.  And so it was language that was starting to organize the world for me because I'd normally be thinking about this stuff outside, but then there's me too.  And so he gave that to me I think in a way without even realizing it, that as I get older and I develop, there are certain I guess we'd call them models and paradigms of the world that helps you to organize it in useful ways.  So he loved chemistry and also loved to exercise and believed in self defense and of course I think it was the influence of  Bruce Lee in Belize, right.  So he, he did that with me and it, it had quite an impact.  So you could be smart but be physically in good shape.
Story_ID: 20970
Speaker 1: Now there, there, was there a--were you all keenly aware of Chinese culture in Belize?
Speaker 2: Yes, some of my good friends in elementary school, Mario Won Kay [ph.], I remember his name clearly, very good friend of mine.  We played like every weekend I'd go by his house and I recall his dad got magazines from China and I asked him if I could look at them.  It was a big magazine, huge pictures, and it was the first time I saw this thing where you have a stadium of people, you know they're holding a little placard that you go up maybe make a face of Maui [ph.], you hold this one up and I'd never seen something like that before.  And I'd never seen so many people before.  And so I would look in his magazines and I was like oh my goodness, there's a whole 'nother world out there.
Speaker 1: You're, you're talking about where a crowd sits in a stadium.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Everybody has a piece of a--
Speaker 2: A, a face or something.
Speaker 1: A part of a face that makes this huge picture.
Speaker 2: That's right, I'd never seen things like that.  You know so I was just, I--each time I went I asked him you have new magazine yet?  And, and so he liked that I liked the magazines.  So I think you know as a kid you're fascinated by Chinese culture.  In part I remember the movies with Bruce Lee and you know they do this Kung Fu thing and you know the wise master and so all those things, you know, made it natural for my curiosity to grow.
Speaker 1: And then you met real Chinese people.
Speaker 2: And then you're in someone's home and so on, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Story_ID: 20971
Speaker 1: Okay so now were there any particular teachers or mentors other than your, your cousin, you know that, that tried to nurture your curiosity?
Speaker 2: Well I remember two people that struck me.  One was at the high school level and the other was in the latter part of elementary school.  The elementary school one, he was a minister that was in Dangriga, also an artist who he, you know in the church he was drawing some of the murals on the wall.  But they said oh he's smart, he has a PhD in philosophy.  I don't know what that is, but I--it's apparently something very important.  And I remember asking him about philosophy and this person engaged me.  I was asking him all kinds of questions you know about how do I know there is a God and he introduced me to a lot of different philosophical thought.  He wasn't afraid of this little kid.  You know I started hearing about Aquinas and all these other philosophers.  So it was, it was something where this was another person who is encouraging me to ask these questions because it was going to open up doors for me to learn about some of the great thinkers in history, right.  And I didn't realize this, but I was drawn to people who wouldn't--you know knock me down and say you're asking these crazy questions, but who I think made me feel oh, here is someone who thought about some of these things.  I probably had it in a more naive, childlike form, but I felt like you know there are actually other people who ponder these things in a deep way.  Then outside of the church and the more philosophical things, I had a high school teacher who he was a biology teacher, okay.  But this man loved talking about chemistry, math, astronomy and in my opinion he would have loved astronomy, to teach that more than biology.  And it was him who really gave me the introduction to the stars.  So he was like a real renaissance type person.
Speaker 1: Now was this in Belize?
Speaker 2: In Belize in high school.  It had to have been probably like the second year of high school, Mr. Leall [ph.].  I mean this man was--he freely moved between the different subjects.
Speaker 1: Now when does high school start in Belize?  I mean well what is the system like in terms of--
Speaker 2: So you do elementary school, what would be the analog of eighth grade is what we call standard six.  And in Belize your--you reach the end of eighth grade earlier.  And it's because they start school earlier as well.  I think I was a year ahead.  So I, I had to have been somewhere like eleven or twelve when I started high school.
Speaker 1: Okay so had you started grade school at age five or what?
Speaker 2: Maybe four.  I think I was four, that's right.  Because I, I was a, a year ahead if I remember correctly, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you were eleven when you started high school?
Speaker 2: Eleven, twelve, around there.  And I remember this well because in my third year of high school, I had to have been about fifteen, sixteen, and when I came to the U.S. they told me oh, you're so young.  You should stay two more years in high school in the U.S.  In fact I think I was fifteen cause I graduated from high school here when I was seventeen.  And I remember being upset by this, they're holding me back.  But they say you know you're, you're young, you should learn the American system.  We have honors classes if you want to do more.  And you know that was one of the best piece of advice they gave my parents, in that spending that two more years in high school, I really got to be integrated with American culture at that, you know that latter teen period.  And so it was very, very good for me to have done that.  It would have been a disaster to go to college that young, you know fifteen, sixteen.  That, that would have been--I, I wasn't mature enough.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your grandmother encourage you in high school in Belize?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was always a hard working student.  I remember we had a speech contest and I came in second and she said don't worry, you know, sometimes there'll be disappointments and all of this.  She was always that person that made you feel there's no limit to what you can do.  And I think that inner freedom where when I think about as I began learning about racism, which was why those--that high school time in the U.S. was so important to me.  As I began learning about from a child you grow up in an environment where you look at the subtleties of racism, it's impacting your parents or relatives.  I think it in a sense deconstructs some of the deep, natural human tendencies that you would have to just embrace the entire world and go for it.  When that gets messed with early on, I think it limits what you think you can get out of the society.  And in little Belize where I was, I didn't have to contend with that.  You know there's competition, sometimes you don't win the race.  But then I'm back and I'm going to beat you the next time.  I never felt that there was some greater force that no matter how hard I try, I wouldn't get anywhere too far, right.  And so that kind of freedom to live and become a full human being, you take it for granted in Belize but when I came here, I began realizing that you begin to feel forces against that drive to be free in this way, right.  And that was very profound for me.  And it made me sad too, to see some of my friends, you know, be affected in that way.
Story_ID: 20972
Speaker 1: Now is this, now I don't know there's been a lot of discussion even in black academia about why it is that black people from the Caribbean or from any other place can come here and they don't seem to have the same problems dealing with American society as people who have been raised here.  And this is--so you seem to be alluding to this kind of mentality that American society fosters where people feel they have a lid on their aspirations.
Speaker 2: Yes and I think it happens in a very deep way in that it makes you begin to have a self doubt at times.  I wonder can I really do this?  Because if from a child the signals you're getting is that you're not as good, your complexion is not as, you know, is not the preferred one.  And all different dimensions of things like that.  It's going to plant a seed inside of you I think in a psychological way that will eat away at your confidence that maybe you could win a Nobel Prize or you could be President of the United Sates.  I think the average person it eats away at you like that.  And then there will be exceptions that will refuse to have it infect them.  When you're growing up in these other countries, those aren't issues that you really encounter.  You may encounter class issues, but that's different from you wondering if I'm genetically not measuring up to the Colonialists.  You feel oh this person, you know I can be smarter than him and I could, you know it's just that he has some power over me right now but not forever, and right.  So it's a different kind of mental warfare I think, you see.  And when folks come from overseas, I think it's also sad that sometimes they do not understand the psychic history, right, the psychological onslaught that you would go through if you're a child from here in a school system and an environment where you're not seeing success and you know, I would say a rocketing up through the society.  I saw people of color that were having the highest positions in government.  My teachers were people of color.  And so to me all that was normal, right, I never doubted for once that I could rise up through the society.  So I think that in a sense it helps you, but it's not enough that you didn't have that from childhood and then you come into the society you may have a different orientation, and you probably also had preparation in some of the basic pillars, educationally, that is quite strong, quite solid and that helps to give you an advantage in career success, right.  While you may find in certain pockets here, you know if you study, you're being white, right.  That kind of sentence structure doesn't make sense where I came from, you see.  Now I, I will tease the Colonialist that's acting like a Jonkonnu dancer, right.  But being smart and good in math, they look up to you in the society and they honor you and everyone does that.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's a profound difference.
Speaker 2: Very, very, and sometimes people have come to the U.S. don't understand that's what African Americans have to contend with.  You know it's a different set of demons you've got to slay.  It's not that you're better or smarter cause coming--no, no, we're all the same.  But they have different historical lines that will--that's the way you adapt in that kind of setting, you know.  And so on the flip side you also have folks from overseas that would come here as immigrants and then encounter racism for the first time, and have no resiliency towards it.  Fall apart, pack up and head back home.  They don't talk about that too, or just give up, right, while you have an African American that has developed a toughness that allows them to endure this and do what they have to do to survive, right.  It's like well why is this happening to me, I haven't done anything to anybody?  That's what the immigrant says and it's all confusing and you need a paradigm shift to be able to process that.
Speaker 1: So would you say it's beneficial to be able to back away from the whole thing and see, see it all rather than to just see a little part of it.
Speaker 2: That's right, right.  And you know this is what I would say those two years of high school in the U.S. allowed me to transition into and understand it better.  Because that was when I was called the N word for the first time.  I, I'll tell you--I mean it's not funny in retrospect I could you know, laugh about it.
Speaker 1: What happened, what happened?
Speaker 2: I'm walking down a sidewalk in Brooklyn in Canarsie and these guys pulled up next to me, you know white guys in a car.  And they said nigger, nigger, nigger.  I'd never heard this word before and I turned to them and said hi, hi, how are you?  I thought they were like saying what's up?  And they were so confused, they just took off.  That was my introduction.  And--
Speaker 1: That's a great story.
Speaker 2: And you know, so--
Story_ID: 20973
Speaker 1: Now you said earlier before we started that your first trip here, you would come in the summers to visit your mother.
Speaker 2: Yes, at ten.
Speaker 1: Prior to finishing high school.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So you, you, you'd come--so your first trip was at ten years old.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: What, what kind of a--
Speaker 2: I went to East New York in Brooklyn [New York], that's where my mom lived, this is a black, you know--
Speaker 1: Had you come by boat or--
Speaker 2: Plane, yeah.
Speaker 1: Plane, okay.
Speaker 2: In those days I think it was Eastern Airlines that flew to Belize, Central America, and I came on that.  It was my first time on a plane and boy that was quite an experience.  And then in New York [New York], I guess we'd label it as a ghetto.  That's where the immigrants, you know, go to.  I remember I got a bike and it must have been like two weeks later these guys held me up.  Thank God they didn't beat me up, and took my bike, you know, it was my, my people held me up and took my bike.  So that was also you know beginning to realize America is dangerous too, right, that that would be unheard of in my little town, right.  So it, it, it opened up my world view I'd say rather quickly.  And allowed me to understand that there are different societies in the world, each having its own timeline, history, issues.  And you need to understand each environment you go into.  So you get the right tools for dealing with it.
Story_ID: 20974
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so, well high school then--we're, you're in Car--what was it?
Speaker 2: Canarsie High School.
Speaker 1: Canarsie High School.
Speaker 2: In Brooklyn.
Speaker 1: In Brooklyn, okay, and we have a note here that a most famous person on campus was the basketball player John Salley.
Speaker 2: That's right, right.
Speaker 1: But who, who else was there and who were some of the teachers that you know, seemed to help you?
Speaker 2: Well I remember the physics teachers and math teachers.  So when I was in high school, I was in this thing, this honors program called Arista.  And I guess they, they said this is where all the nerds hang out, right.  But we were the ones that had an interest in math and physics and did very well.  So we were sort of like in a separate little group, separate cohort.  But with respect to the athletes, I had more of an interaction with them and this was how I learned for example, about John Salley, where my stepbrother was on the football team.  And so because of that, no one messed with me, right.  And then he introduced me to his friends and then I started trying to work out, get my little [unclear] going, you know.  And so that was the--how I got to see that other side.
Speaker 1: So how, how many step-siblings did you have in New York?
Speaker 2: Two.
Speaker 1: Two.
Speaker 2: Yeah, stepbrother, stepsister.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes so that, that was very interesting.
Speaker 1: So did you play any sports at all when you were there?
Speaker 2: I tried to do track and field, I was no good at it but I enjoyed it.  More middle distance, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what else about American culture did you find fascinating?
Speaker 2: I think the, the most profound thing for me was the freedom.  Intellectually within that British system of learning, you know those teachers didn't--apart from people like Mr. Leall, most of the teachers didn't allow you to just take questions in other directions.  There was a strict syllabus and that is how it is and that's how it has always been, right, so get used to it and just roll with it.  I hated that, to be honest with you.  When I came to America you could ask questions.  I mean the teachers stimulates conversation as a discussion and a topic.  I didn't know that was possible, right.  And so I--it allowed my mind to just ask all kinds of things in math and physics.  Then I still had this liking for art, right, going back to Dangriga [Belize].  In New York it used to--in the summers you have the art show, blocks and blocks of artists are out there.  I would go to that, I enjoyed it so much.  So to me America was like this infinite candy store of knowledge and experience and diversity, right.  Of course that's a New York centric world view that I just fell in love with, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did, did you go to the museums like the Met [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York] and the Guggenheim [Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, New York] and the--
Speaker 2: Yes, all over, all--I tried to gobble up everything.  And I especially liked the Village area where the artists were.  And I remember struggling between whether to--I always did in school, but whether to go into science or art, I really struggled with that.
Speaker 1: And so in high school you--that's still a question.
Speaker 2: It was still a, a major question for me.
Speaker 1: Now what kind of artwork were you doing?
Speaker 2: I was drawing--I did a lot of pencil.  I did some acrylic, but a lot of charcoal type based work and in fact several of my pieces were, was used for the yearbook.  In fact the opening page was a paint, an acrylic painting I had done.  So I, I was a good artist.  I don't know if I'd say I was an excellent one, but I loved it enough that I wanted to do a career in it.  Nonetheless with my girlfriend at that time in New York, I wanted to stay in Brooklyn.  But you know I got a opportunity--I realized that [unclear] astronomy in the CUNY [City University of New York] System, I'd have to go to Hunter College.  And so I had a cousin that had been there and she said oh, you got to go, it's great and, and so I decided to go to Hunter College to study astronomy and physics.
Story_ID: 20975
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so, okay now so what pushed you over the edge into science instead of art, or did you still kind of think well I could do both, be both?
Speaker 2: Well I would say the, the roots of that go back to Belize and this high school teacher that really brought the different fields together.  I'd began noticing that it's also an artistic dimension to mathematics.  That the way these equations balance, there's a beauty and the feelings I began having from looking deeper into mathematics as well as some of the ideas, you know I started learning about Newton's theory of gravity, then I heard the name Einstein and all of these things that nature has a sort of mathematical structure that was beautiful.  And so the feelings that gave me were similar to feelings I was getting when I did art and even feelings I got when I listened to music.  I used to love ABBA, right in those days as a kid.  And of course you know you also have the, the--we call it macovi music that would come from Al Green, you know and all of these singers, artists, you know and these guys of that, of that time.  But for me it was the feeling I got if I listened to an Otis Redding song, or the feeling I got from doing art, or the feeling now, the new part that you get from looking at all mathematical equations balance.  There was not an arbitrariness.  So my mother made a remark that I think was defining.  She said you know you could be an artist if you want, it's your choice, but you probably will have a hard time making a living doing that.  And I had witnessed enough of these artists trying to sell their work during the summers in New York.  I said but if you go into science you could make a good living and you could still do art on the side.  Given that I had this--the same feelings I was getting from art I was getting in mathematics and my physics classes, I didn't feel like I was giving up something totally.  So it was a natural flow that the passion can continue, right, in the hard sciences and mathematics.  And I think that was what really nailed it for me.
Speaker 1: And that's something I haven't experienced in life yet.  I, I used to do art but, but failed before math.  I've heard mathematicians describe equations as elegant.
Speaker 2: Yes that's right.  There's an aesthetic balance to it.  And you'll find that the way it flows, it's like you're looking at a masterpiece.  And that I think was what was able to fuel my passion for the subject.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Our friend Matthew Hickey always says that math is the language of physics.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right, exactly.  And the thing that I would say, you know as I got more mature intellectually, the profound mysteries, why is it that nature at its core, at least how human beings describe nature, that you need mathematics.  That is a great mystery, right.  That these underlying equations governing how the physical world works and they're beautiful.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 20976
Speaker 1: Okay so Hunter College.  This is--were you at the campus on--
Speaker 2: Park Avenue.
Speaker 1: You were Park Avenue.
Speaker 2: I was at the Park Avenue campus and there--Hunter College I would say what I loved about it--boy they must have had students from every country in the world.  To me a cultural melting pot.  You had Dr. Clark was there at the time of course, African American studies was booming.  I remember clearly apartheid being an issue.  I was actively involved in clubs and my girlfriend at the time was from Nigeria and she, you know, I was involved with her and, and the apartheid issue.  What I loved is on the physics end I had a, a professor who actually took time from his busy schedule and taught me Einstein's theory of relativity when I was only a sophomore in college.
Speaker 1: Now, now this is 1982, just a--right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You graduated from high school and then started Hunter College in the Fall of '82 [1982].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It's the year after Belizean independence I believe.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.  It was quite a special time, quite a special time.  And you know the, the, thing is you, you begin to integrate American culture cause now you know you're becoming full fledged American and then you have the Belizean heritage, and then this concept of Belizean American begins to emerge, right, where you feel you represent Belize, but at the same time I now see myself as African American, right.  And so to me I like all of that kind of stuff.  I, I love a rich, you know I, I need to have seasoning in my food, right.  And so I just love--to me it was like a melting pot, right.  And at that time as we were being activists in school and all of this rights of people, rights of people in other countries, and it just with Belize becoming independent, that was extremely special, right.
Speaker 1: Now did, did you--after you got here when you were thirteen did you go back periodically to Belize?
Speaker 2: Not as often, not as often.  I think it was probably in college, remember that pic--I have a picture there with my mother and myself where I had to give a speech in Dangriga.  So that was one of those trips, but I was here for more extended blocks of time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now let me get you back to you were telling us about your sophomore year at Hunter College, this profound experience where the instructor explains to you Einstein's theory of relativity.
Speaker 2: That's right.  You know I went to the professor and tell him you know I want to learn about Einstein's theory.  And he, you know there wasn't a course at that time that would give me the introduction.  And I asked him if he would teach me.  And he was like looking at--and he said sure.  And that was the start of it.  And he said in the summer you come and he met with me and he gave me readings and just guided me through the background, mathematical technology you need to even begin to talk about the concepts.  And so I thought that was very generous of him to do, but it also told me this is someone who believed in me, that I can understand Einstein's theory.  Right, so all of these things I, I felt were very special.  And I in fact ended writing--so at Hunter College, and I believe this is still true today, they had an accelerated program for exceptional undergraduates whereby you could do a BA and MA simultaneously, but in five years.  And you end up getting the Master's at undergraduate prices.  And so I was enrolled, they called it a BA/MA program.  And my Master's thesis was the same professor that taught me Einstein's theory.  He was one of the advisors.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was this professor's name?
Speaker 2: Tryon, T-R-Y-O-N, Professor Edward Tryon.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a theoretical physicist.  And the other advisor I had was Professor Daniel Chess.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his last name?
Speaker 2: C-H-E-S-S.  He was a mathematician that taught me the differential geometry I needed for Einstein's theory.  And so with the two of them I wrote a Master's thesis on the mathematical theory of general relativity.
Story_ID: 20977
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right so, so you really started to be--now I'm surprised, you know all--a lot of kids can tell you Einstein's theory is E=MC2.  I can say that but I have no idea what--you know a little idea of what it is.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: A pinch of idea of what it means.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Well you know the thing that that equation really does is to me it creates a unification.  You have energy, this mysterious thing called energy that you can't see, right?  But that's the east side of the equation and we know about energy because light is a form of energy and so on.  And then M for mass, you know that's this chair we're in, that's stuff.  And he really said that there isn't really a difference between those two because one can transform into the other.  And that to me was a very profound thing.  That a solid object and then something that you can't see, right, this, this--almost like a ether type thing, is really not too different from a solid object.  And so the E=MC2 is like the foundational equation that establishes this equivalence.  The other thing that I loved with--so Einstein has two theories is that one that is a local theory that you know, centers around this E=MC2 that the public knows.  And then there's a general theory of relativity which is the big monster, right.  You imagine special relativity gluing together into this bigger theory.  And the general relativity what hit me with that is that Einstein brought together geometry on the one hand and then energy and mass--that's the in the E=MC2 part, and said there's a connection between those two.  It's like what.  And he begins to talk about space and time curving and that curvature is governed by certain geometry.  So it's like linking the physical world to geometry.  The same geometry I've always loved.  So for me philosophically the theory had the elements of things--it tied together things I have always been passionate about throughout my math/physics journey.  If you--I also feel that you know Einstein in my opinion for you to tie different things together like that, you can't be a prejudice person.  These are, you know you've got to be open to a melting pot and wanting to interact with different kinds of things, different people, different modes of thinking.  To me that philosophically sits in, right, with someone who would create a theory like that.
Speaker 1: So you're saying that recognition of this larger equation of existence--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Makes you--I mean the recognition is too big to act small.
Speaker 2: That's right.  You know you have to be a renaissance type person, right.  And to me philosophically it had all the good elements that you need, right.
Story_ID: 20978
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now is this--now if I'm going too fast, slow me down but at a certain point when you're on your journey here, some family issues and some problems.
Speaker 2: Oh yes. That's right.  So that began at the end of my first year of college, I was eighteen and I had some family issues with my stepfather.
Speaker 1: Now this was 1982.
Speaker 2: That's right, with my stepfather, and it got to a point where I couldn't take it anymore.  And so I just left home.  And boy I don't know what got into me, but I didn't have a penny in my pocket, just the clothes on my back.  And my girlfriend at the time, her father took me in and he had a room in his basement and that's where I stayed.  I was, you know, staying with this person, that person, and I asked her you know I'm kind of bumming around and I just need a little time to stabilize.  I was in fact thinking about going back to Belize because my grandmother was saying come back, you know we don't want you out in the streets and this kind of thing.  And she spoke with her dad and he said sure, he could come and stay here until he can get on his feet.  And at that time I had no idea how I'd pay my way through college, how I'd even get a token to take the subway, and I don't like being a burden to anyone.
Speaker 1: Now do you mind telling us what happened, actually what happened?
Speaker 2: Well it, it's something that had a longer history than that where at least through my eyes, I felt a bit like I was doing extremely well in school, his kids were not doing very well.  You know he had come from little Belize and taking advantage of all these opportunities I'm seeing in America and just starting to skyrocket, right, in honors program in high school, this sort of thing.  And I think that began to create some issues, at least through my eyes, I could be wrong, you know.  But that's how it came across to me.  And I felt that he was roughing me up in ways that I think were verbally abusive.  When I was up studying late at night one night I remember he kicked the door open and said turn off that f-ing light.  And that's one example of the kind of thing that I think created a psychological environment where you don't feel you belong.  This isn't really a father to you, this someone doesn't care for you to be in their home.  And so that long list of things began to add up and that particular day we had a quarrel and I screamed at him and I just walked out the house, I couldn't take it anymore.  So that--
Speaker 1: You said you left everything there and just walked out.
Speaker 2: I just walked out, didn't take anything.  And my girlfriend and her father helped me get on my feet.  What was definitive I would say I remember hearing--I don't know what made me recall this, that there were minority scholarships available.  And I was a permanent resident by that time, and so I qualified for it.  But this was like May and those things, applications were due like December, January.  So I went over to this professor at Hunter, African American professor you know, camped out outside his office, Dr. Wyche.
Speaker 1: W-Y-C-H-E?
Speaker 2: --C-H-E, yes. Dr. Jim Wyche.  And when he came I, you know I introduced myself to him.  He, he recalled I was sleeping outside his office door.  And he came and I told him my situation.  I said I have good grades and I wonder if I can apply for the--it was called a MARC Fellowship, Minority Access to Research Careers, sponsored by NIH [National Institute of Health], M-A-R-C.  So I told him you know, that I'm thinking to go back to Belize, but I would really love to stay in the U.S. and I remember distinctly telling him that if he gives me this chance, I'll never let him down.  And I think he was struck by my honesty, forthrightness and he said give me couple weeks because the deadline is already passed.  He doesn't know if anymore scholarships are left and he will talk with his dean and others.  So you know the couple weeks or so went by and he called me over, you know my girlfriend's place, and he said I have great news for you.  He said we have a scholarship slot for you, but equally important, we are going to give you a fellowship.  So it's scholarship plus a stipend for me to survive.  And they arranged for me to get a room in the dorms at Hunter College so I could move out of where I'm at.  I tell you I never cried so much in my life.  And that was something that the--I was living in east New York, in Brooklyn, you know this is a ghetto environment.  I've seen--talk about murders and things, I know all that stuff.  And now the dorms for Hunter College is in this affluent white neighborhood, 25th Street, First Avenue.  For me this is like the moving up in Jeffersons, right.  You're moving on up.  And I couldn't believe that had happened.  That he must have really went out there and put his neck out for me.  And the university came in and really you know, made this happen.  So I was now, I was living in a good environment where I didn't have to worry about my physical safety.  I was actually on campus in a good intellectual environment.  Had a monthly stipend for me to buy my clothes and food.  And my tuition was being paid.  And that is an example of where people who are against Affirmative Action, they, they don't understand this.  I mean in any program there will probably be abuses, give us a break, right.  But Affirmative Action is extremely important.  And no one can ever tell me, you know, to be against that because I benefitted from it in a very fundamental way.  So after that I just took off.  I mean intellectually, that was when I got into the BA/MA program.  I also in addition BA/MA in math.  I also did a BA in physics.  So I was doing, you know like three degrees at once, and I just worked like a dog cause I wasn't going to let that man down.  And with the hard work came you know, acknowledgement of that hard work, awards, prizes of you know a wide variety in physics and math.  So and then of course opportunity to do my PhD at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] where I also won a scholarship, a minority scholarship for that.  So it was a very profound change in my life.
Story_ID: 20979
Speaker 1: Now did, did things heal up between you and your stepfather?
Speaker 2: Many, many years after.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was, must have been about 15 years after that, yeah that it was not immediate because I was hurt for a very long time.  And--but you have to forgive, right.  And so that--the good, the positive is that I have forgiven and, I mean he may feel he may not need to be forgiven of anything.  That's between him and God I say, right, but we have a, a functional relationship.  And I was able to look back on it and see some of the good things I saw in him that has influenced me, like his money management and discipline.  So I would say that that turning point at Hunter College was what made what you see today possible.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how, how is your relationship with your stepbrother and --
Speaker 2: He passed away already--those were excellent with my stepbrother, stepsister, they were always great.
Speaker 1: So they didn't have the kind of resentment about your success in, in school.
Speaker 2: No, they were happy for me, they were proud for me, yeah.  To this day my stepsister, you know, it's my brother.  When the PBS [Public Broadcasting System] program came out she was letting the whole world know.
Speaker 1: Now what about your mother?  Did, did you--did, did that rift with your stepfather create a distance?
Speaker 2: I think it put her in a very awkward situation.  As an adult, I can begin to understand that much better.  And I feel you know in life we have each got his or her own journey, and you need to make the decision that is best for you in that moment, right.  I don't think she would have anticipated I would have had this level of success, just form all the barriers and the turmoil that was happening at that time.  I remember when the New York Times did an article on me, that was something that like just blew her away because someone that, you know she came to New York like from eighteen.  So most of her life in the U.S. and you know about the different newspapers in New York, right and then the New York Times, that's like the top of the mountain, you know.  And so when to just witness that I think was something that had a very big impact on her.  And also healing happened between me and her because I also had a distance from her.  And thank God, you know I would say things are in a positive state and I talk to my mother almost every day, right.  And you know in life you, you've got to forgive and even sometimes the challenges you encounter help to shape you and strengthen you, and I probably wouldn't be the way I am if I hadn't encountered some of those challenges, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay everybody's got a story.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 20980
Speaker 1: So, so now MIT, tell us--Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Speaker 2: Yes that was an interesting story there.
Speaker 1: And so how does it--
Speaker 2: Well I have to tell you first the humble pill I got.  So when I graduated from Hunter, I had must have been like four awards at graduation in math and physics, so I feel like I'm king, top of the world, you know smart man.  And so I, I go--I'm here and now doing my PhD at MIT, you feel proud, right.  My first elite, high powered private research institution.  And I remember getting feedback for the first time on my work.  This was a homework set.  And you know I, I'm a good student.  I'll sit right up front under the professor's nose.  So he took the homework that was graded and dropped them all in front of me, say pick yours and pass the rest along.  So I am flipping this through this thing, right, and it's all of 20 points.  And I see 19, 19 and a half, 19, 20, 20, and they keep going.  I was like wow.  Mine was at the bottom.  I had the lowest score in the class, I had a 18 and I felt inferior.  I looked around and said damn they're smart.  So what it did was to really raise my bar, you know.  I say that Hunter [Hunter College, New York, New York] is an excellent school, but because you're in a much bigger environment that you have a more diversity in the different types of students you interact with.  So you'll have a percentage of very bright students, but in your entire class, it won't be filled with valedictorians, right.  And this was like my first introduction to that kind of competition.  And it was good for me because you know it, it allowed me to raise my bar to another level.  And so the next homework set I'm going to kick your butt, you know.  And I really did well at MIT.  I, I flourished, had perfect GPA and then I had an opportunity after my coursework to go to Princeton to write my thesis.  And having you know, during the thesis stage of my--they have some exchange scholars program.  So after my two years at MIT, I went to Princeton to do my--the actual dissertation writing.
Speaker 1: So this is 19--
Speaker 2: Let's see.
Speaker 1: Eighty-eight what I have here.
Speaker 2: Around there, that's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes and Princeton was completely different from MIT in that MIT you feel you're in a structure, you know as a graduate student you're going to have a GPA, you have classes, problem sets and it's very structured.  I guess with all the engineering.  At Princeton I felt free.  There were essentially like no grades, no one tells you what to do, and that to me was just ideal when I had those previous two years at MIT, that now I'm free to explore whatever I wanted as a graduate student.  And that was when I began developing the mathematical theory of gravitational lensing, which has been you know, one of the defining work of my career.  That really brought me all the way to where I am today.  And if you may recall, as an undergrad I did the mathematical theory of general relativity.  So I'd always been in this mode of trying to develop a mathematical theory of some physical phenomenon.  And so I became the first person to really start to pioneer these kinds of things and to develop this mathematical theory of gravitational lensing.
Speaker 1: Okay now tell us in terms that even someone like I can understand.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: What is--yeah.
Speaker 2: So gravitational lensing is really how gravity acts in light.  And this is similar to if you have a glass lens and you shine light through it, the lens is going to bend the light or create a rainbow and do things like that.  So the word lensing is now being applied to gravity except you replace the lens by something that has a gravitational field strong enough to cause light to be deflected and delayed and all these kinds of things.  So that means the lensing is coming from stars or black holes, or galaxies, collections of galaxies, or even the whole universe.  And this actually began--a lot of aspects of it began with Einstein.  So for me, I wanted to develop a mathematical theory of how light and gravity interact.
Story_ID: 20981
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay so now you were telling us about gravitational lensing.
Speaker 2: That's right, so I have always been fascinated by gravity, that's through Einstein's theory, and definitely light, right.  I mean light is just one of those things, what is it and how does it behave?  Now one of the predictions that Einstein made was actually a gravitational lensing prediction, and it was really this prediction that made him famous.  He calculated explicitly how much the sun would bend light passing by, light originating from background stars.  And he predicted an amount of bending that was twice that you would get using Newton's theory.  And his ended up being the correct one.  And so it was this hinge that really showed that all his theories connecting mass energy to the geometry of space/time was on the right track.  And I, you know when I got into the theory of gravitational lensing, the field had been largely in astronomy and the activity centered around some very basic questions.  And I remember at, being at Princeton, at the university I used to go over to the Institute for Advanced Study to seminars.  And this astronomy, astronomer posed a question that he said he didn't know how to solve.  So here's a history of it.  Einstein in 1936 observed that, let us say you're looking at me, I'm a background source of light, and then I put a star between us, but not exactly on line between, a little off.  Einstein calculated and said you would see two images of me.  So a single star creates double images.  Then it took a long time, in 1986 two German astronomers, Schneider and Vice looked at the same problem and said well what if you have two stars between you and me, how many images you'd see.  And they proved that you'd see three or five.  So at this talk this person said well what happens, stars are distributed in three dimensions.  What if you have end stars along the way?  How many images will you see?  And he said intuitively I think I know the minimum number you'll see, he said two to the power n, but I really don't know how to count the images.  And I got obsessed with that problem. I said I'm going to solve that problem.  And when I began looking at the equations, I realized it's not humanly possible to solve these equations.  And so that couldn't be the right approach.  And what happened was on a train ride back to MIT on Amtrak, I kept thinking about this and it occurred to me that I don't need to find explicitly solutions of these equations.  I only need to count how many there are.  And so what I was--I hit--the thing was that the solution space actually corresponded to like a terrain.  Imagine a mountainous terrain.  You have peaks and you have valleys, and it turns out the peaks and the valleys in this terrain were the solutions that would give you how many images there are.  So this terrain turns out to involve an area of mathematics that's all the way out there in pure mathematics, having nothing to do with astronomy.  And so it's called Morse theory.  I was able to then connect Morse theory with this basic question in gravitational lensing and astronomy.  And so I was bringing in high powered pure mathematics to bear in a astronomy.  And that I think was the breakthrough.  It was the first step I would say towards developing a mathematical theory of general, of, of gravitational lensing.  And this was actually my thesis, and I think that was what landed me my job at Princeton as when I came back as an Assistant Professor.  And then also the way you build a mathematical theory is you look at a series of physics questions that need to be answered.  And you try and solve them using an appropriate mathematical model.  And so when you begin to solve a lot of these questions, you then look for a way to tie all the different solutions together under one umbrella, under one coherent theory.  And that was something I was able to do, yeah.
Story_ID: 20982
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So when you--so your--do you consider yourself more of a, an astrophysicist or a mathematician?
Speaker 2: You know the, the way I think about it is, it is I'm probably neither in a sense.  I'm just a guy that loves--almost like a theoretician that loves to take on problems of a certain nature.  And I will grab tools from many different areas of mathematics to assist me and also say it's a physics related set of questions.  Grab some key physical ideas and try and blend them together.  Some people call an individual that does that a mathematical physicist, but the, the thing is I feel it's not fully accurate because I also have interest in finance, right, which has to do with my appointment in the Business School.  The structure of the flow of money, right, has a mathematical structure.  And I would use ideas from finance to come together with that.  So it's not quite just mathematical physics, it's more a theoretician that uses a wide variety of tools to resolve questions of a quantitative nature, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay so I guess I was asking too is it your, is your primary concern solving questions in astrophysics or using, just using math as a tool to solve any number of questions.
Speaker 2: Yeah I would say using math as well as some other tools to address questions that I think are, you know are particularly fundamental in certain fields.  And so I began by looking at certain core questions in the world of gravitational lensing.  And now I'm shifting to look also at questions in the world of finance because some of the structures you're dealing with in gravitational lensing also show up in Wall Street type analysis when you're looking at the nature of the, the price behavior of stocks for example.
Speaker 1: Okay well how does that, how, how do they correlate?
Speaker 2: Well you--it turns out there is this property of galaxies that comes, connects with gravitational lensing that create a shearing on light.  So they refer to it as a shared distribution of galaxies, okay.  So that's on the one hand.  And now you look at the distribution of prices of stocks.  You know this is a random thing.  It turns out the model that you use to look at the distribution of the prices of stocks, it's called Geometric Brownian motion, that's also the model that's used for the distribution of share in galaxies.  You see so that's, that's the great mystery of the world, right.  That you're seeing these connections right, in worlds that seem to have nothing to do with each other, in areas that seem to have nothing to do with each other.
Story_ID: 20983
Speaker 1: Okay. So, all right so you were able to finish your PhD in 1991.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And on the thesis the Singularities in Gravitational Micro Lensing.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay so I was just amazed at all the places that you ended up going and you know, with this.  Now you go back to teach at MIT.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And then you--okay in 1992 you published a paper called Morse Theory in Gravitational Lensing.  Now that's what you just described.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, yes.
Speaker 1: The landscaping of the stars.
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: And their effect on lensing.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay now at a certain point, oh you want to talk about the new caustic singularities in multiple lens plane gravitational [unclear].
Speaker 2: Well I tell you after the image counting problem, after addressing that with Morse theory, there was something that I found very striking and let's see how to describe it.  If stars are going to create multiple images of other background stars from its gravity, well then guess what?  It must mean that shadow patterns must be cast throughout the universe just from how gravity acts on light.  So when you're driving along the road and it's a bright, sunny day, the light shines on the trees and the leaves of the trees cast shadow patterns along the pavement.  Similarly, it must mean the gravity of stars will do something like that throughout space.  And the areas where you have the brightest, you know you have that bright then it's dark into the shadow, those brightest areas are called the caustics.  And so one of the things I did was to do a full classification of the local nature of caustics that can occur in the universe, and then to be able to address and come up with a mathematical law governing the global properties of these caustics.  Because the caustics in a sense, they are separation, they define the boundaries between areas of different levels of shading or different shadow levels because the shadows come in a gradation.  And then the caustics are the defining boundaries between that.  Except now in the universe the shadows that are cast, they are in three dimensional space, right.  And so when you're moving across in the universe, you are going to be seen brighter or dimmer depending on where you are in that shadow pattern cast in the universe, right.  So I was involved in developing a whole mathematical theory of these shadow patterns in the universe.  And that's what that paper is about.
Story_ID: 20984
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now in 1994 you went back to Princeton as an Assistant Professor in mathematics.
Speaker 2: Ninety five [1996], yes.
Speaker 1: That's '95 [1996], okay not '93 [1993] so let's scratch that out.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So '94 [1994] you go to the Max Planck Institute.
Speaker 2: That's right, yes that's right.
Speaker 1: Now this is--now did you speak German?
Speaker 2: No, thank goodness it was all in English.  And it, it was quite an honor to be at Max Planck.  As you know these are the, the premier research centers in Germany and I was at the one in Garshing just outside Munich.  And it to me was just a pleasure to see European science being done, you know being there and having interactions with a lot of German theoreticians, some were astronomers, physicists.  And I at that time was already working on this monograph.  So I did part of the book while there.  That book ten years by the way.  So I began working on parts of the book while I was--during the visit to some of these institutions, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there anything that, that's--well good story out of the German experience at Max Planck?
Speaker 2: Well I, my sense is that there were like technical benefits.  So for example how do I explain this?  Ellers [phonetic] was the leader of the gravity group at Max Planck at that time, he already passed away.  And this was someone who has studied Einstein's theory his entire life.  And he had his whole, a whole research team of former students also, current faculty.  And I found that they were extremely strong in what would be called higher order analysis of the impact of the gravity of galaxies on light.  They, they had like a whole research machine that probed that in a profound way compared to what say we were doing in the U.S. [United States].  And I, I think that was very, very useful to know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did you go directly from Germany to Oxford?
Speaker 2: I came back to the U.S., then I went to Oxford.  While--interestingly now at Oxford, I was visiting with Roger Penrose, there what I got out of the Oxford experience with the mathematicians, they I think were extremely strong on the geometric end.  I would characterize it that way.  And those aspects, you know it's like looking at the action of gravity on light in what I would call a space/time context.  And I got that aspect of it which showed up in the book, during my Oxford visit.  So it, it's just interesting how each research entity has a strength over others, you know, a signature I think.  And they have a long history of work connected with Einstein's theory.
Speaker 1: Now, now explain who Roger Penrose was.
Speaker 2: He's a mathematical physicist that is involved with quite a number of important results in general relativity.  You may hear about the Hawking Penrose Singularity Theorems when you study--Steven Hawking.  They did a lot of important work on singularities.  On the more front end you may hear about the Penrose Bar, which is an impossible tri-bar, right.  So--and you hear about Penrose Tiling, things of this sort.  So I was very fortunate to have spent some time you know, picking his brain and reading some of his papers there.
Speaker 1: Okay now did, did you meet Steven Hawking?
Speaker 2: Not in person, not in person, yes.  I had more of an interaction with Penrose.
Speaker 1: Okay so did you talk to Hawking on the phone or something?
Speaker 2: No, no I didn't, no I--you know Penrose had done work that was more directly related to what I was interested in with light.  Hawking had done work more at a quantum level which connects with his--at that time the thing I was interested in more of what's now called Hawking Radiation.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Of course he's a, you know he's a, he's almost a pop culture figure.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Now they have him in cartoons and every possible, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know he's become like a iconic--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Much like Einstein too.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You see a guy with bushy hair you assume it's Einstein you know.  So is, okay so you go back and you become Co-Director of Graduate Studies at Princeton.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so what was special about that for me is that I--it meant me and a colleague of mine, Eli Stein, we were involved in the recruiting as well as the admissions of graduate students and the admin--this is a PhD program in mathematics.  And the--just the managing of that program, but two things I thought that were special for me.  We were able to get an African American graduate student in as well as a Hispanic one.  So those were things that you know, I'd never dreamed the day would have come where I could be involved in such decision making for Princeton, right.  And so that was very special.
Story_ID: 20985
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you remember the lessons that you learned at Hunter College.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes that was like to me good preparation, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The--so in '98 [1998], now this was in '96 [1996] you were, you were Director of--you started as Co-Director of Graduate Studies at Princeton.  So how did you wind up, you know moving from Princeton to Duke?  Now what was that--what was the--
Speaker 2: So you know what happens is that when you're in tenure track you have six years, you come up for tenure in your sixth year.  And then if you say don't get tenured, they--the universities typically give you one more year.  So I was pretty fortunate is that by my fifth year on that track, I said let me put out some feelers to see if someone--because tenure is a thing you're after.  And Duke was really interested in me and said they would offer me tenure outright.  And I said are you crazy to turn that down?  Never.  In addition they would give me an endowed chair to go along with the tenure.  And so I jumped shipped.  You know I had an early tenure offer and it also worked out good because my mentor at Princeton, he was leaving Princeton at that time.  And so that worked out very nicely for me that, you know I can now--I could transition to Duke because a lot of the relativity that was happening at Princeton at that time, at least the type I do, wouldn't be happening as much since he would be leaving too.  And so Duke made me an offer I could not refuse.  What was interesting when I came to visit the campus, I saw it was gothic architecture just like Princeton, so it, it was quite physically--it wasn't a big transition.  I would say what I loved about Duke is it's much young--it's probably the youngest of like the top ten universities in the U.S.  And that youth to me makes it very quick to adapt.  I find that it has I would say a very strong entrepreneurial intellectual spirit.  The interdisciplinary nature of the place was very attractive.  It's not like you feel you're at this old university and any change would take forever.  At Duke you know physicists talk to mathematicians, talk to engineers and it was going across the boundaries of disciplines in a way that was extremely appealing, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now were there any other African Americans on the faculty here when you--
Speaker 2: Well I'm--I was the first to get tenured in mathematics.  And then Calvin Howell was here in physics.  I think he has been a Dukie, may have even gone to graduate school here.  Outside, that was it and then I met of course African American professors more in the humanities and social sciences.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right so you know there are folks like Carla Holloway who are very warm and welcoming when I visited.  And interestingly when I was a professor at Princeton, I had met her daughter who was an undergraduate there.  She's now a professor in physics, right.  So it was just, just good to see these links, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now and you were here in 1988, I mean '98 [1998], you received the Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship.
Speaker 2: That's right, I, I was very--that was a very special year for me because as you know these are awards you're nominated for.  It's not something you can apply for.  And receiving that as an African American was really special in that it acknowledges how my work was being valued by the greater scientific community.  And you know my sense is that few African Americans have ever gotten that award.  So it was very, very special for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and what did it really support?
Speaker 2: It supported--you get money for research and of course it's, you know, one of those feathers you put in your cap.  There are two major awards young professors, they usually benchmark you on in terms of how well you're doing; the Alfred P. Sloan which is private and the National Science Foundation's Career Award.  And I was blessed to have gotten both of them.  So usually if you get one of those, you know you have the right feather in your cap for tenure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20986
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right now 2001 your book is published finally.
Speaker 2: Finally, over 600 pages of headache.  Yes that, that was very, very--I was so relieved when that book was done.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were times I'd feel like it would never finish, yes.
Speaker 1: And now this is the Singularity Theory and Gravitational Lensing.
Speaker 2: Yes that's right.
Speaker 1: That's the title, yeah.  And what was the reception of the book?
Speaker 2: Well it really was well received.  I--and I remember they used it at Oxford University as part of you know they had so many research courses they were doing on gravitational lensing.  That to me was, you know, quite a special endorsement.  And colleagues from around the world, you know you see they were buying it around the world where you, you have major research centers throughout Europe, in Asia, Japan in particular.  And so it's like you look back and say my good--you know the publisher sends you to parts of the world where the book, book is sold and people want to get your autograph for it and I say boy, you know, I never thought this day would come, you know.  I always feel that way when I look at my path, yeah.
Speaker 1: How many copies does a text book like this sell typically?
Speaker 2: So these are very advanced research monographs and so they don't print as many.  I am guessing probably between two and 3,000 would be sold worldwide, cause it's very dense, you know, heavyweight stuff.  And you know I don't know the exact, you know, numbers and how many, but that would be my guess as it's a very special market of mathematical physicists who would buy that.
Story_ID: 20987
Speaker 1: Now this raises another question.  I've talked to physicists before and they, they tend to think--they have to fight thinking that they're smarter than everybody else.  Is this--
Speaker 2: You know and they say that's when your grandmother will whop you upside the head.  I, I think that least in my case, I don't suffer from god envy and I think a lot of my colleagues do.  They have this fever all the time, this god envy fever.  I find that the more I learn about the world, the humbler I get in that I don't know diddly, okay I'll put it like that.  And I like to use this metaphor in that as human beings we're fortunate to be able to have penetrated reality to this--in such a fast way, fast way and as far as we have up to this point.  And you know it's illustrated in all the technology that shows we are really understanding quite well, though not perfectly, how the world works.  But I would never make the flawed error in my opinion, of thinking that I can understand everything about reality.  And not me as a person but human beings because I, I always use this analogy as I said, an amoeba, right.  This little microscopic thing down there.  I mean what we are talking about, that's transcendental to an amoeba, right.  Can an amoeba understand what is going on between you and me now?  To even say that like makes no sense.  Yet we exist and we are interacting in a plane of existence way beyond the reality of an amoeba.  Now who am I to think that we human beings are at the top of this plane, right?  And some people these call these other dimensions of reality god and angels or whatever label you attach to it.  I would never be crazy to think that this little thing up here has access to all of the nature of reality.  To me we are like that little amoeba, right.  And so I just--when some of my colleagues act like it's just foolish arrogance in my opinion.
Speaker 1: Now it used to be thought that a, that doctors felt that they were, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: God-like because what they can do.  But this is heady stuff and those of us who have an--who want to know more about how the world operates, we look to physicists.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: With an awe.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes that's right.
Story_ID: 20988
Speaker 1: So is it--how do you feel about the popular culture notions about science in the U.S.?  I mean cause you have people elected to school boards that decide how our children are going to be educated and what's in the books who have no idea about what science is even.
Speaker 2: I would really love to see the politics get out of it and here when I say politics, I don't just mean Republican, Democrats.  I mean internal politics within an organization with who are the decision makers and the lobbying and stresses on those decision makers.  I would love to see it more vertically integrated where the people that are creating new knowledge, example the scientists or the economists or the sociologists, who are at the frontier of knowledge creation, actually have a lot more say in the infrastructure our kids will need to be able to utilize that knowledge down the road.  And I often see a disconnect even in the choices of textbooks, right.  There's a lot of little micro, you know local politics that goes into that and publishers and money making and blah, blah, blah.  But you know you really think I would say need more--a tighter integration of from elementary school right through to the frontier of knowledge, and to continuously monitor to make sure that the skills are still relevant and that new skills that are necessary are going to be injected along the way.  But you're dealing with such a monstrosity in an educational system that at least on the public end, making those changes, oh my goodness.  I mean that's, that's a tough one but it doesn't mean we don't try, right.  So I find that this kind of disconnect, it's almost like it happens a lot when you look at the path from elementary school with what the students are learning, expectations of students, the metrics you use to measure their performance, right.  And then you look at what they really will be needing in college, and then you'll be needing as a practicing adult in a profession, right.  You don't have to become a scientist, but just to distill that down appropriately to the elementary school level and high school level.
Speaker 1: Now I'm, I'm maybe jumping ahead but it--I thought of another question in terms of the political--the impact of politics on how we teach science.  I know you have gone, you know back to Belize and in your hometown established a Arlie Petters Institute for Research.  Is, is it easier to go to a place where there's--the politics aren't as strong.  I mean, I mean you're seen by the--I mean the President speaks of you in glowing terms, you know.  And you hardly ever hear [unclear] the United States where the President you know, knows a physicist you know.  But, but they, you know, they revere you there and what you do.  And is it easier to go and establish a strong science program coming off [unclear]?
Speaker 2: I find it easier and part of it is that when they look at me, they see possibilities for their children.  And therefore they take seriously what I have to say.  And that also means there's great responsibility on my end to convey information that is well researched and to have the very best people involved in whatever curriculum advice we would give, whatever summer programs we run there, whatever enhancements we may do.  So that I find in many ways makes it easier to have an impact in Belize.  I will say out of one of our summer programs we got the first Belizean high school student ever to get into Duke, right.  That was an example where parents listened and respected what you had to say and they believed in it, and we created the opportunities.  The, the student had to work hard, do his part, but then the probability of him getting into a school like Duke, that came very high, and it worked out, right.  And now when you're dealing with a much larger society and all the complexities of the politics and the sociology, whether the sociology involves race, or some other issue, you then start to have a lot more, a lot more set of complex layers to break through before anything can get done, right.  If I go walk into, you know a school district, I want to speak--first they'll probably--knowing if they look at me on paper okay, I could be wrong, but I'm just telling my intuition.  Look at me on paper.  This guy is qualified.  Now I show up in the room, they don't know what I look like and I walk in, I can bet you they will not respect me the same way.  Because that's still in our society.  And so now I have to fight through that hurdle and what I would do instead is to have a different tactical approach that I don't show up myself.  I have some other colleagues that they would relate to better and have them talk, right.  So I have to use a different set of techniques to get something done.  You see all this kind of stuff I don't have to deal with in Belize.
Story_ID: 20989
Speaker 1: So we're back to the timeline, I want to go back to our timeline here and we, we were talking about the books, publication and then okay now 2002 you're a visiting professor at Harvard.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now was that a direct result of the publication of the book you think, or --
Speaker 2: Yes, and I was also beginning to look--so the book dealt with gravitational lensing I would say in what's called the weak deflection limit, so not very strong bending of light.  And the next layer, in fact I'm working on a book with a colleague right now.  The next stage is to look at strong deflection lensing where black holes begin to act on light in a profound way.  And so I began the elements of that with that visit to Harvard.  There was a colleague, Noresh, Ramesh Noryan [ph.] who, you know began looking at black holes and I really started digging deeper into how black holes act on light.
Story_ID: 20990
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right so, so when you returned to Duke, you, you were Director of Undergraduate Studies for the Mathematics Department.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes I and, you know I already had this experience at Princeton and it, you know each school has its own nuances and things of this sort.  I say that we were able to get two African Americans into the PhD program here at Duke.  We know that throughout the USA--it's not specific to Duke, for things to happen you really need someone to believe in it and push it, right.  Particularly when it comes along the lines of African American related issues.  I believe personally that the U.S. has not even began to tap on the tremendous reservoir of talent that can even help the country to go to another level.  That's our underrepresented minority students.  They haven't begun to tap in on that.  Imagine if you systematically begin to do that how much more advanced we would be, how much to me better for the society would be.  So for whatever historical reasons, right, I feel it's part of my duty to do that because I cannot sit around and think someone else will do that.
Speaker 1: Now we're talking about proportionately probably 50% of the people who live in the United States.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Really don't get the kind of access or--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Encouragement in the math and sciences.
Speaker 2: That's right, yes.  And I believe the statistics are somewhere around like 1% of PhDs in mathematics are for, is for African Americans.  One percent, you know, and so to me there's a lot of opportunity there.
Speaker 1: But you're saying the talent is there, the natural ability is there.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, yeah.  And so that is something that I believe that folks like myself, we have to do that, right.  There may be--you know it's a little bit like if this thing of social interest to your community, then you go and do it.  There will be others outside your community that will help, but they're not going to be as motivated as you should be, right.  And so I say you--that's what you got to do.  You find talent, you give it opportunities, you nurture it, mentor them along the way.  And so I'm always coaching, right.  They just graduated last year, the two of them, right.  So but I know that I have to be a proactive player in having possibilities like that realized.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in 2003 you are the Martin Luther King, Jr. Visiting Professor of Physics at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now I--now it just seemed curious to me that there's a, a physics chair named after Martin Luther King.
Speaker 2: Yes I, I, you know MIT has had a very interesting history with respect to minorities in the sciences.  And I believe this was part of an attempt to have visiting professors you know, top African Americans from around the country, come to MIT and be in the classroom to do research.  So for me it was quite special, having you know, had an earlier history at MIT.  I don't know--was probably the first African American those students saw teach Einstein's theory.  And I just think that act in and of itself is so important for society, right.  That they see others who can understand theories that we all view as profound.  I think it's healthy for everybody, right.  And so--and they didn't drop out of my class, that is a great thing.  The class had a lot of students, I must have had about eighty students in that class.
Story_ID: 20991
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell us about the, the Blackwell Tapia prize in mathematical science.
Speaker 2: That, that's a special one, and it came to me as a total surprise.  When you look at--you know be curious to see how this played in the humanities and social sciences.  But from the point of view of race, the last frontier is really the physical sciences and mathematics.  When you're dealing with a field that does not have much African Americans and other represented minority groups, no one is going to rush out there giving you prizes, right.  And if you can look at other ethnic groups, I mean they had to create their own prizes for their community.  And with me winning an Alfred P. Sloan, I was very blessed, but that's not something that would be common.  There were special circumstances I think that where I had the support for that to be a possibility.  We all know that with these prizes, someone has to nominate you.  And then there has to be probably four top notch researches who write in support of your nomination.  How many people will be doing things like that for African Americans?  These writers will say well I didn't get one, I deserved that.  Why should I nominate you?  Right.  So you have a sociology that can be challenging for opportunities for you even though you would be equally qualified for that award.  And when Carlos Castile Chavez they created the Blackwell Tapia Prize, to me that was so important because we now have a prize that will honor you for excellence in your research in mathematics, but also they made sure they coupled to it that you have evidence of supporting underrepresented minorities.  And I think that's equally important, right.  It's not a selfish person, a me, me, me, and give me the prize and don't want to help the next generation.  And when that came about and to see that they selected me as the first recipient of it, I, I was extremely, extremely touched by that.
Story_ID: 20992
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you became a--shortly thereafter you became a full professor at Duke.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And how many--did you--I would just guess there are a small number of full professors of African Americans at Duke.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.  Very small percentage.  And you know in these elite universities, getting tenure, much less the final stage is full professor, right.  It's no joke to get that because it's the same thing.  You play no role in them writing out--they write out probably the twelve, thirteen experts in your field around the country, around the world.  You have no idea who they are.  And your promotion will be based on what they say about your work in those letters, right.  And so when you're in a society where there are still challenges in the area of race, that kind of endorsement is not easily had, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I guess we're chronologically I guess--okay, 2004 you received a, a National Science Foundation Mathematical Innovation Grant.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: And that lasted, that was a four year grant.
Speaker 2: That's right, yes I was happy by that.  That grant related to work that I was doing with astronomers at MIT.  And we were very happy to have gotten that.  It's very tough grant to get, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20993
Speaker 1: And in 2005, that's when you actually found the Petters Research Institute in Belize.
Speaker 2: In Belize, that's right.
Speaker 1: And were you, did you propose the idea to the Belizean's government or did they--did someone in Belize propose the idea to you, or--
Speaker 2: Well I'll tell you how the, the origin of this effort.  I was involved in a worldwide effort in Africa to set up a new university in Africa.  The motivation was what can one really do to help turn around [unclear] in Africa.  We know that all kinds of efforts have been going on, billions of dollars spent.  And so the idea was to instead try and use science and technology as a tool to address poverty alleviation.  So we were involved in this and I'm looking at the, you know, phenomenal ideas of things that would to me empower communities to really raise standard of living and for people to take ownership of their country and help with building the kind of technological infrastructure you need for this new century.  And said I need to take this concept to Belize, right I was involved in all the blueprints, so this intellectual blueprint of setting this thing up.  And I saw that aspects of it Belize can surely benefit from.  And so that was really the seed that was involved with the Institute, and then of course the government was very happy because we are politically neutral and I have had excellent support from them ever since.
Speaker 1: Okay there's a picture here, it's a beautiful building.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yah.
Speaker 1: And what, what, what are the--what kind of programs do you all run and how many children are involved?
Speaker 2: So the way we do it is we think of the Institute as a catalyst that would drive science and technology, STEM [Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics] fields, really, innovation, but we want to tie it to national development in very practical ways because science in the U.S. is not particularly--you can't just assume it's relevant in Belize, right.  You don't want to do nuclear physics in Belize you know.  So we try to touch on issues in science and technology that--I'll give you an example that are really needed in the country.  We partnered with the Ministry of Defense in Belize and had a--offered a summer program that would teach young people how to assemble computers, how to repair them.  Now this is something that if your computer ever breaks down in Belize, good luck with finding help for it.  But we thought that this is simple enough that--we even had some elementary school kids involved.  But surely teach it at the high school level.  And so we partnered with the military.  We were able to have everyone over at the base.  I got a colleague from Duke [Duke University] who went down and taught the course and we got donations and they assembled all the computers.  And at the end of the program, plugged it in and it booted up, Windows came up, and we donated them to needy schools.  So what we try to--that's an example of a skill set.  To me the repair and maintenance of computers is like you needing a plumber and electrician.  That's basic for a modern economy.  And Belize, you know it's an area where they had it to me primarily in a cottage industry form.  And the Institute acts as a catalyst to try and systemize this sort of thing in the country.  So we look at these kind of basic building blocks for an economy, go in there, run a program that would stimulate it and then you have a bigger organization come in and sustain it, right.  So that, that's the way we act.
Story_ID: 20994
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's see, in 2006 it says here a portrait of you is inducted into the National Academy of Arts and Sciences Portrait Gallery of Distinguished African American Scientists and Engineers.
Speaker 2: Yes, so the National Academy of Sciences had contacted me and they said I was selected to be part of their permanent portrait collection in DC.  I was like oh my goodness.  And what really moved me deeply about it is the--when you go in there, in the Keck [ph.] Center is where they have it.  They go back to slavery time.  And the first scientist was Benjamin Banneker who kept almanacs, right, and the motion of the moon and the things like that.  And they were just marching through history to our current time period.  And for me to feel that my portrait is now among that lineage was--I mean that, that really, words cannot describe that.  And things like that are extremely, extremely important.  Because to me what it does is that thing we were talking about in the very beginning, that we want a young kid on a school trip going through there to say my picture will be on that wall.  That's a possibility for me, that's a reality.  The deep inner self doesn't get destroyed and you know you can get there, right.  No one will break you down inside.  That kind of possibility for young people, I never saw that when I was growing up.  And to me it is very noble to see the National Academy of Sciences do it.  And at the ceremony all the top people were there.  So this is something endorsed from the very top, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20995
Speaker 1: Nowow in 2006 you served on the Board of Trustees for the Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics, that's for four years.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: As well now where, where was that institute housed?
Speaker 2: So that--there are two boards that I was on, two mathematics boards.  And the IPAM [Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics], that's the one you're, you're talking about, the Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics, that's out of UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles].  And then the IMA, the Institute of Mathematics and it's Applications, I served on that board, that's out of the University of Minnesota.  What is interesting about these is this is where the decision making happens at the highest level for these prestigious mathematical institutes.  And when you have folks like myself represented with a vote on these Boards of Trustees, to me we bring in a point of view that's extremely important.  Of course we bring in a--the scientific, technical expertise, but we know all of that happens within a social context.  And so when you have your visitor programs, I'd like to know well, where are you advertising?  Are you advertising to my community?  We are smart people there too, right.  Are you advertising to women?  So I feel that being granted that vote, it is a very special thing and it plays a role in, in helping to shape this landscape and maybe will change that one percent, bring it up to two and then you keep growing, yeah.
Story_ID: 20996
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in 2007 Nova Science Now produced a short documentary, a biography of you, and I was able to see it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So how did you feel about that?  Now [unclear] Tyson is--
Speaker 2: Imagine the host, right?  And we were, we were colleagues at Princeton.  That, you know, all of Belize was very proud and my, my family in the U.S.  By, by this time things have healed, you know, were repaired with my, my mom and stepfather.  And I think she was starting to feel ownership of that space, you know that's my son and things like that.  Programs of that sort again I think it does perhaps in a wider sense, what those portraits try to do.  And I want that little kid, that immigrant kid to look at that, but also remember that his responsibilities go beyond his country of origin.  That it's also to his communities in the U.S., right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So yeah the, so the--what you're saying too is something I hadn't realized.  That the show is shown in Belize.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So it's not, is Nova Science now a regular--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's also in Canada, I got calls, emails from all over, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 20997
Speaker 1: Now you were honored by Hunter College, but you also were honored by in 2008, by the Queen of England.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now what was, what was this about?
Speaker 2: So this is--that one membership in the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire sounds so colonial, right?
Speaker 1: It's sounds like it's something that should be in Jonkonau.
Speaker 2: Now imagine the Jonkonau teasing the Englishman, right.  But it's something where I will give Burton credit for doing that.  Where for all, for Britain included as well as all commonwealth countries across the world.  They honor people that have been accomplished in the arts, military, sciences, politics, things of that sort.  And so I got the honor for the work I did in Belize as well as the scientific accomplishments in the U.S.  And it was--I didn't expect that to happen because typically in these commonwealth countries it's very political to get nominated.  But the Prime Minister really believed in what I was doing and he saw the track record we had, and my understanding is that he nominated me for it and that's how it came about, yeah.
Speaker 1: Shouldn't you be referred to as Sir?
Speaker 2: No, no, just good old Arlie, right.  This is, you know the, and the Queen sends you a big certificate with her penmanship you know that's--yeah.
Speaker 1: So did you go to England for that?
Speaker 2: No, this was done in Belize.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 20998
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay I have a note here that you did something recently in terms of non-random gravitational lensing, is that--can you explain what that is?
Speaker 2: So with gravitational lensing, so this was some work that came out I think, I believe they're referring to the paper that must have been in December I believe where the best analogy is like for glasses you have a prescription, a colleague and you know, and I, what we did was to figure out the prescription for a black hole.  I think that's the best way to put it.  And that means you're finding an equation governing the optics from--of light passing by a black hole.  And Duke had done a very nice article on that topic.  So they, they called me the Black Hole Optometrist.
Speaker 1: Okay that's interesting, the optometry of a black hole.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 20999
Speaker 1: In 2008 you achieved a triple appointment at Duke with the Department of Mathematics, Department of Physics and the Fuqua School of Business.  Now we, we really haven't discussed much of the business aspect.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about the business.  Now you, you have a business degree as well?
Speaker 2: Well what I--it's finance, it comes under finance.  And usually what happens is the people that are doing work in finance are actually mathematicians.  If you need a PhD in mathematics.  I have actually been doing finance, wow, close to a dozen years now.  But have been doing it quietly on the side.  And I created a Duke, a course on mathematical finance.  I have been teaching that course probably like for ten years now.  And it has been growing and growing and my work in Belize also ties in with using business models as tools in national development, and I also have a small business, my wife and I, that we run.  So what I realize is at least when you're looking at emerging economies like Belize, you really need the science and you need the financial economics if I should put it that way.  That old grandmother stuff with her little business, right.  You could have all the science in the world but if you're not converting it into some business activity that gives people jobs and raises their standard of living, then you know this is a self indulgent thing, right, the science.  So we, I try to tie that and bring scientific methods into business models.  So over in the business school currently I'm supervising the finance concentration for the Executive MBA students.  So they do research projects on anything ranging from a stock market issue to a merger and acquisition, to maybe a, a startup company they might have.  And I would say the language that is universal and all of this is quantitative tools that you'd get from the mathematics.
Story_ID: 21000
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now they--in 2009 in Dangriga [Belize] they established Arlie Petters Street.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I, you know it's often said that a prophet is not recognized in his own hometown.  It's clearly not always true because if you go into an environment with a good heart and you're humble, you don't come in like you know everything.  You integrate the local knowledge, you listen to people with your formal training and you merge them, you can then really bring a lot of value back to people.  And I believe that was the community's way of saying thank you for all that you have done, yeah.
Story_ID: 21001
Speaker 1: Okay in 2010 you become Chairman of the Council of Science Advisors to the Prime Minister of Belize.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Now this, I would expect this.
Speaker 2: Thank you.  You know this to me is very important.  Now we're talking about policy issues, that I believe at least for me personally, I don't say everyone has to do this.  But if you have done a lot of the scientific work over two decades, you need to give it back in many different ways ranging from mentoring young people to advising with curriculum development, but one important way to give back is to play a role in shaping policy, right.  And to--in the case of Belize we're really trying to have science as an important tool in strengthening the economy.  So we look at what are the natural assets of the country and find ways to integrate that in managing national debt, in storing up growth in certain sectors.  So we, we look at things like that and, and to me it's a wonderful application of many years of experience and so on, yeah.
Story_ID: 21002
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now you were fortunate enough to get married in 19, in 2011.
Speaker 2: Yes last year, a Belizean.
Speaker 1: Now you've mentioned--I think it's interesting because so many people don't do this.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You mentioned several of your girlfriends along the way.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And they, in light of them helping you.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And having a positive action along the way.  And then you--but you had--is this your first marriage?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I was married before.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But this one, and I'm friends, you know with--I feel fortunate that I've always had good relationships, even if they, you know did not continue forever with anyone in my past.  I try to keep positive relations throughout my life.  I feel that my wife Elizabeth, she was someone that, from Belize actually, and it's someone that I have a very deep connection with and in many ways we have synergies that fit well with our value system, the way we see the world, the way we want to help others.  And interestingly Elizabeth is Belizean Caucasian, right, you, you'd never think this would turn out that way when you know I've had a life where I deal with issues of race and so on.  And then my wife turns out to be Caucasian, right.  And sometimes when we walk, people would see her and think she's white American, but she's hardcore Belizean like me, you know.  And she--I think really loves all people, that's the thing that I, I believe is fundamentally important.  That we, we love and value each other on this planet.  And we share that kind of conviction I think in a profound way that goes beyond career issues, you know.  So I think the value system is solid.
Speaker 1: Now is she a scientist as well?
Speaker 2: She's a lawyer by trade.
Speaker 1: A lawyer by trade.
Speaker 2: Yes that's right.  But also has a very entrepreneurial side.  So like our small business thing, she runs that.  And enjoys it, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, now do you have children?
Speaker 2: Not yet, not yet.  Hopefully soon.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  But you don't have any children from the past.
Speaker 2: No, no, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay so now how did your grandmother feel about your success?  I mean did she realize what--
Speaker 2: She says--I know with the Nova documentary, I remember she, she often said she never thought I would have gotten to what it is today.  She thought I would have had after Hunter College some success, and but never expected this you know and she looks at it from you know, point of view of we thank God for all of our blessings, right, and one big positive for me personally that connects with her is that I was able to make enough money to really take good care of her, right, financially I mean.  And so in her later years, you know I'm saying don't you worry about money.  Do whatever you want, you know.  You have put in your time already, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay that's good.  Now when did your grandmother pass?
Speaker 2: She's still--
Speaker 1: She's still alive?
Speaker 2: Yeah, on the other, on my father's side, my grandmother did pass already.
Speaker 1: All right but that's great, your grandmother is still alive.
Speaker 2: Yeah on my mom's side she's still alive, yes.
Speaker 1: And she's enjoying--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: [Unclear] Belize, okay, all right.
Story_ID: 21003
Speaker 1: Also in 2011 it says you received a Robert L. Clark Award from Bronx Community College.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And I'm sure there's probably been a lot of awards along the way.  You--and in 2012 you, you began to hold the Benjamin Powell Endowed Chair at Duke.  Now what does this mean?
Speaker 2: That, I think that chair is from earlier.
Speaker 1: Is it?
Speaker 2: Yeah it's from much earlier.  That must have been 2007 I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It should be on CV [curricula vitae] somewhere.
Speaker 1: I'll make a correction to it cause they have it as 2012.
Speaker 2: Yeah I think it's 2007.  So what that is it's an endowed chair.  It's the highest honor that the university can grant on its faculty when you get an endowed chair.  It's, it's like--it's a situation where you, you have to show innovation and work of a certain magnitude that goes beyond the full professor level and they write out to experts again to write in to whether they should give this guy this chair or not and so on.  These are things to me that go beyond you know, way, way beyond what you can ever hope for.  And I'll be perfectly happy as a full professor.  But then to get an endowed chair on top of it, you know, that's icing on the cake I would characterize it as.  I was involved in chairing this year the committee that selects the next round of endowed chairs.  And when I look at the rigor they put into these things, it, it surely is a very special thing.  And I'm, I feel honored to have it in the sciences, yeah.
Story_ID: 21004
Speaker 1: Okay now who have been some of your students that you've been the proudest of?
Speaker 2: I have quite a number and there's one young man in terms of say trajectory similar as an immigrant story.  He's a U.S. citizen like me now.  I--Peter Blair, undergraduate here at Duke, came from, straight from the Bahamas and you know, as a foreign student.  This young man I think represents a lot of the values that I believe in.  He has a strong affinity and love for his community and disadvantaged peoples, and at the same time he has a love that reaches out to all races, right.  He has friends with everybody.  And on top of that he has a super high GPA.  He was a math major, an economics major.  He is a very giving person.  So right now he's pursuing his PhD in finance at Penn.  So I'm very, very--he's an example of someone that I'm extremely proud of.  And that is the more academic tract.  I've had two other students in my--they were in my research group by the way as undergrads.  One is Luke Steward who took the track of business and got his MBA from Stanford.  And the other one Michelle, Sowanimo [ph.], who took the track of law and with her law degree from Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I, I'm very proud of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Cause you know I saw them from little ones so to speak.
Story_ID: 21005
Speaker 1: What is the, I guess the future of gravitation lensing?  I mean what are we going to find do you think?
Speaker 2: I believe that part of the future will be gravitational lensing by black holes and right now what's happening is this probably was one of the most daring papers I have done in my career, and this was with a colleague at Rutgers.  Where we are using gravitational lensing as a tool that would allow you to check whether there's an extra dimension to the universe.  And so we made a prediction in the paper and with time we'll see if that prediction will stand up.  Yes that, that is the kind--so gravitational lensing has now become part of the basic "curriculum" of astronomy.  Everyone has to learn that.  It's such a fundamental tool.  And I think it will just continue to do so.
Speaker 1: Okay do you hope that--do you have any hopes about what we might discover in outer space, or--
Speaker 2: I hope our prediction is correct, that the universe has an extra, a fifth dimension.  I hope that is correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we will see.
Speaker 1: Do you have any thoughts about whether there's other life in space or not?
Speaker 2: I really believe you'll have other life forms in the universe.  I think it would be totally weird if we are the only ones and you know with our other life forms here on this planet.  There's so many planets, the universe is so vast.  I don't think God would play those games with us.  I think you have other life forms, and intelligent life forms.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 21006
Speaker 1: Now on this, here now on earth, what are some of your concerns about the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well I would surely like to see more systematically rather than little pockets, a direct involvement in STEM, Science Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, and to see the value of that in the economic enterprise of this country.  You know you see Steve Jobs, right.  I want them to know you can have African American Steve Jobs too, right.  We have distinguished ourselves in the entertainment industry, right, in the media industry with Oprah and others.  But we can also create business tycoons using science and technology, right.  We could be people with great things like Google or Facebook.  And the difference is these now are because of the Internet types of technologies that we don't require the same sort of startup capital like in the old days, and don't require you to have to jump so many hurdles that in the old days were considered hurdles of racism, right.  The Internet is open to the entire planet, right.  That is your customer base.  And so there are opportunities for us to get in on that activity and create products and services that the whole world would want to buy.  It's not just the U.S. that would buy it.
Story_ID: 21007
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you look back at everything that you've done to this point and you're, you're like forty--
Speaker 2: Forty eight.
Speaker 1: Forty eight now.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I would say on the scientific end, if I should pick one thing, it would really be the mathematical theory of gravitational lensing.  I don't know how to work with predicting an extra dimension to the universe will play out, but as a cumulative thing I think that's very important.  But I would add to that along that way I have always done my best to mentor and nurture talent, underrepresented talent especially, and to show them that the possibilities are there for you to explore.  I believe that this is a very important last frontier of knowledge that as African Americans we should feel we also belong there.  And not only that, all human beings should have the right to explore that if that's what they're passionate about, and to succeed at it.  So I would like that if anyone is telling any story about me, that they don't forget that part.
Story_ID: 21008
Speaker 1: Now is there anything that you would go back and change if you could?
Speaker 2: I don't think I have any, any one thing that's significant enough that I would call it a profound regret or miscalculation so to speak.  Because I've always the sort of person that I will make the decision I can make in that moment.  And then if it turns out to be not what I expected and I'm going say off track, I always have corrective measures to bring myself back.  But then I warn the next person about what happened to me, right.  So I make every step a learning opportunity and I try to pass on all that knowledge.  I don't want to go to grave with that.  I look at it as many people know about my path, let them save some time and not reinvent the wheel or make my mistakes, right, yeah.
Story_ID: 21009
Speaker 1: Now you play the guitar.  Do you have any other hobbies?  Tell us about that and what else--
Speaker 2: Well right now I'm so busy that the only time I get to zone out perhaps would be to go to some movies, right.  I love movies and I try to catch them when I can cause it takes me in a whole other world, right.  And traveling, I try to take a novel and catch up on some of those.  I would say that's about it, given how hectic my schedule is, yeah.  But I enjoy every little moment of life.  So in my, in my mind there isn't so much a clear divide between hobbies and day-to-day work.  To me I live and I enjoy every little activity I do.  Some of it gets labeled work because my salary is based on it.  But to me I'm enjoying the teaching the way I enjoy reading a novel on the beach in Belize.  So I try to keep my life holistic in this way and let one feel, you know, give it a different label.  I'm just living in each moment as much as I can.
Story_ID: 21010
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there anything else we need to talk about before I ask you my last question?
Speaker 2: I think you know you have been very comprehensive.  I would say you know I don't know if this will make anyone uneasy, but you know what is fact is fact.  I would say throughout my life that my belief in God has played a fundamental role in me staying together.  And there was a period in my life when I was an atheist and all of that.  I don't believe in pushing religion down anybody's throat, but if you want to know the story of me, you have to also remember that I am a Christian, or I try my best to live as Christ-like a life as I can, I'm not perfect.  And I also have a firm belief in God.  And that is also underneath all of this stuff you see, right.  That's equally important for me, yeah.

Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: You know I would really like to be seen as that person that tried to share with everyone all the lessons he has learned about life.  Particularly the young people that are coming from behind who may be encountering challenges, whether it's race related, family related, country related, and perhaps could draw some kind of strength from the way I have tried to lead my life.  And so that's why I would really want you know to leave as much of this behind as possible.  When you're doing archiving of this sort, this is why I think it is so important.
